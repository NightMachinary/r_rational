I think that, after a few years of being distrustful and miserable, they might... distrust the message they got, think through how their experiment might have failed, and figure out what happened (or think "Maybe someone else got a hold of this in 40 years and sent back the code after torturing the other me," or something.)

Following the message for 40 years requires pretty much blind trust in the message, and the person who sent it.
