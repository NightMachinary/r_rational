Nearly 2 million word count. That's incredible. You are not joking around. Thanks for the recommendation though. I'm glad I asked. As I said I am brand new here I found this place through "Mother of Learning" and ever since I caught up with it I've been looking for a good book to catch up with... well technically I already read through Child of Light Since that. I only found Mother of Learning through [[/r/Noveltranslations][r/Noveltranslations]]. Can't tell you how I found that place but I'm glad I did because it got me reading, before last year I wouldn't pick up a book and only watched anime which lead me to manga which lead me to light novels which finally lead me to real novels. It was a roundabout path but I enjoyed it. I used to loath literature in highschool but now I'm reading and it's like a whole new world has opened up to me. Plus it's improving my vocabulary, reading speed, and patience with reading. Which is very helpful towards academic pursuits. Anyway just kind of felt like giving some background and making this a little more personal and friendly than just a normal robotic internet conversation.
