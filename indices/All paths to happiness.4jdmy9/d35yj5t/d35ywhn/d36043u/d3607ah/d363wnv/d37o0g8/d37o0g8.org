Another good one to follow is UNSONG. Another popular one is the finished hpmor at [[/r/hpmor]]. There are other stories that people do too. Check out the top of the sub (every single one on top is there for a reason). Some notable people, Eliezer Yudkowsky, Scott Alexander, ummm... I can't remember anymore, I'm on mobile. There's also Ra, which I haven't read. Another series is the Tinker's daughter, which I haven't read. Alicorn wrote a rational Twilight, which is supposed to be amazing.

Bottom line is this: browse this sub. There are some amazing stories on this sub. You will lose yourself for months, but in the end, the ideas the stories perpetuate will make you better. (That's a good thing BTW.) All the stories are about making sense (rational) but many are about living life strategically (rationality as best as I can describe it). The ideas tend to go along the route of transhumanism.

It's quite enlightening actually. And even if you don't care about it, the stories here are about as high quality as you'll find.
