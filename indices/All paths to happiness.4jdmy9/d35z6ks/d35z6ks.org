The idea that after creating a set of universes across which you watch /literally every possible set of ~2 hour long moving images/, the device that enters the highest number would enter anything remotely close to 0 is absurd.

Oh and one major thing that bothered me about the story was the fact that it wasn't explained or explored what happens if the button is pressed a different number of times before entering a number. Say for instance you decide to press it, then press it again if you see a 1 and not if you see a 0. You'd have a 0, a 11, and a 10 universe. If the 0 universe you enters the highest number, then everyone sees a 0? In the story it seemed taken for granted that every single result was exactly 2^{n} bits. What if in one universe, the computer went haywire and produced a subtree of a few googolplex extra universes? Just seems a bit odd not to at least mention.
