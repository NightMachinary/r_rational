I understood. But think about how many movies that is. A version of himself will have just watched literally every possible combination of images. That means one will watch an incredible movie starring his family, yes. And another will watch Citizen Kane. Another will watch Citizen Kane with all the actors cross-eyed. Another will watch 2 hours of himself staring at the camera. Another is a detailed and accurate video about how to invent a nuclear bomb. And billions more will be each of the above with a single pixel changed in one frame.

These are just random and very limited examples. My point is that there are just far, far too many universes created for his precomittment to entering the number of Oscars he wins to matter. One version of himself will see a film that somehow convinces him to enter as big a number as he can. Another might cause a bug in the computer and glitch it into thinking he entered a big number. Another billion billion billion will be movies of himself writing a computer program that does something amazing. But some of those programs will actually be scripts that accidentally enter huge values for him. Some of those might even be self-improving Al's that convert the planet into a factory to press 9 until the sun dies. In fact I suspect the number of universes created is so large that it hardly even matters what the differences are. I'm hardly even scratching the surface of how unimaginably large the space of possible outcomes is. That out of all of those possible worlds, /none/ of them resulted in him being convinced that what he had just seen was too important not to share, or any other of the quadrillions of other possible reasons for entering a huge number, is absurd. We can't even imagine what sequence of 1s and 0s would actually result in the highest value being entered, and his previous intent will have nothing to do with it.
