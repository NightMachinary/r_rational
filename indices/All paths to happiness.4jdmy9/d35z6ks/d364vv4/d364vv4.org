  The idea that after creating a set of universes across which you watch literally every possible set of ~2 hour long moving images, the device that enters the highest number would enter anything remotely close to 0 is absurd.

I think you misunderstood that part. The main character enters the number of Oscars the movie had won. What is displayed on all the machines is not the number that is entered but the ID number (consisting of 1s and 0s) of the machine that entered the highest number.
