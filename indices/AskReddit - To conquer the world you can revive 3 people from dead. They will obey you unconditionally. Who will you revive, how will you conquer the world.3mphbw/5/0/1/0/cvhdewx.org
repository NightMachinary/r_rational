1% chance of developing something we can't do and are not sure how close we are to + making sure that it's safe/doesn't flame out or hurt anyone + making sure that social factors don't break this?

For me, it's almost impossible to put a number on such a thing, but then, I'm not that knowledgeable about the combination of AI, research and sociology required.

Of course. Because taking over the world is a comic book concept. So you need comic book characters. If real people could take over the world they would have. Even with an unimaginable industrial advantage (compared to three people) it wasn't done.And it won't be now.

Coming up with something...extrahuman to do it might indeed be the smartest path, I'm just playing the pessimist.
