I'm not expecting them to do outlandishly well, and I wouldn't keep their existence secret. My plan is merely to literally create the best AI research team in the world, and if Paul Erd√∂s and, I don't know, Eisenhower or something publicly announce they have come back from the grave to deal with the threat of AI, I don't expect them to have trouble finding publicity, tenure, private funding or research assistants.

My plan is simple, legal, doesn't require secrecy or unproven skills, and creates a reign everlasting upon success. It doesn't give 99% chance of success, or probably even 10%, but 1% doesn't seem unreasonable. I've yet to see people do better, including ones who try to use religious prophets.

Also note that they don't keep their possessions, including their money.
