You did read what I posted, right? The President can't pass anything. He can propose an amendment to Congress; if 2/3 of the ~550 Congressfolk pass the amendment and /then/ 3/4 of the states pass it, /then/ it becomes an amendment. On average it's taken 2.5 years for an amendment to pass, and that's for things that were major national issues. If you need to rewrite the Constitution for your plan to pass, you might want to pass on your plan.
