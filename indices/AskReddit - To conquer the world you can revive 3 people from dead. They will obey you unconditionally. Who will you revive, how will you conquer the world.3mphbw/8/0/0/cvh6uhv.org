I just read this post, did not click through to see any prohibitions. I mentioned the possibility that it might be problematic - though perhaps you had started your reply before I made the edit.

Anyway, I believe that if Jesus was raised with wounds in his hands and feet and sides and I brought him to the Pope, we could probably convince him and others. Potentially if any holy artifacts are actually legit (blood of jesus/ shroud of turin, etc) there would be another avenue towards legitimacy.

As for Muhammed, I don't really know enough about him to make a guess but I would imagine there are ways. He did leave a major mark on that part of the world, after all, and probably knows some things that could be corroborated or explain some ancient texts, shrines, etc.
