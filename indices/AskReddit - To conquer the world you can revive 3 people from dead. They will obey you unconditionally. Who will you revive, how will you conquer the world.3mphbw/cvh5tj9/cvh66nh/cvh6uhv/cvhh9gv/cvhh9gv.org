  Anyway, I believe that if Jesus was raised with wounds in his hands and feet and sides and I brought him to the Pope, we could probably convince him and others.

Dozens of people go to the holy land, turn crazy and become convinced they are Jesus every year. Barring him pulling actual miracles you'd have little more luck than they do.

I feel like if there was Jesus's genetic material floating about we would have heard about it? Like people would be doing reconstructions of his phenotype from the genetics and someone would be making waves about cloning him and so on.
