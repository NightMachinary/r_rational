Jesus Christ, Muhammed, Nikolai Tesla. The first two to get over half the world's population (who conveniently seem to be relatively easy to convince of things) and the last to build some amazing technology to take over the world. Jesus and Muhammed should be able to get me enough manpower and money to invest into whatever genius ideas Nikolai can come up with.

There is of course the major problem of convincing people that it is actually Jesus or Muhammed. And the possibility that Jesus didn't exist is always a concern, but presumably I wouldn't be wasting my power if it didn't work.
