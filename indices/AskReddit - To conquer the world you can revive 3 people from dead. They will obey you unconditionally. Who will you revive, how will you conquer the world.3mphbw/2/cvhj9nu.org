Wait for someone extremely rich and powerful to suffer a life-threatening accident, spam revives at them till it takes. With any luck it'll be explained away as 'oh they just died on the operating table for a few seconds'.

Intelligence is nice in a minion, but hilarious amounts of money and power are more vital for such an undertaking. Political leaders are nice, but democracy ensures you're paying for only a few years of actual use, and you can't really have them do much because in most cases their party can just have a vote of no confidence.

Next step, using my money and power to kill someone who has /all/ the blackmail material, like the director of the NSA. This time have some fancy detectors pointed at me (and if possible him/her) while reviving. I mean, I /probably/ can't recreate this phenomena, but on the off-chance I can then It's worth investing the resources.

At that point though I kinda peter out. There is no one person sufficiently intelligent or rich to conquer the world. Unless there is and they're competent enough that we don't know about it. Spend some resources to find out who the next most powerful or useful person on the planet is. Chinese intelligence head? Really rich dude? If possible use it on myself? Take em over anyway.

Attempt to blackmail all of the congressmen and senators and news agencies and what have you to slowly twist the world in the direction I want it twisted. Try to have people under my command be pulling all of the strings. That's about as far as I get though. I can influence the world and maybe turn it a little bit into what I consider a better place, but conquering it is unlikely.
