Three people raised from the dead to conquer the world.

I will assume that they will be capable of surviving for more than a short time. My power will give them the ability to live for many years.

The first thing is going to be money. We need someone who will have access to money, even if they have died and lost it. One of the Saudi princes would do. Resurrect them shortly after their death, before the transferal of power has occurred.

Firstly, they will have lots of money because of the simple fact that they are alive. Secondly, they just rose from the dead. This would definitely classify as a miracle to religious true believers, especially if they were dead for long enough that there was absolutely no doubt that he was dead. Even better if he was embalmed. (I don't know Islamic burial rites.)

I now practically own at least half of the religious population of the Middle East, and substantial blocks of Muslim true believers elsewhere. I immediately establish a Caliphate in the Saudi Prince's name.

Next up, Mahatma Ganhdi. Another miraculous resurrection. Cult of personality in India, funded by Saudi Arabian money.

And finally, George Washington. There's genetic material of his still around to prove it's him. There's a pretty damn good chance that the US public would be rather vocal about getting him back in the President's seat, and damn the constitution.

The Saudi Prince's money would go through Gandhi to fund George's efforts to get the 22nd amendment repealed.

Between the Caliphate in the Middle East, Gandhi in India, and the enthralled Americans, I now have secondhand control of about a fifth of the world population and a rather substantial percentage of global GDP.

That's a good start.
