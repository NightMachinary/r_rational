Ooh, sneaky. I think it would need to be Truman, though, since it says:

#+begin_quote
  But this article shall not apply to any person holding the office of President *when this article was proposed by the Congress,*
#+end_quote

...not "or before this amendment". It was /passed/ in 1951, but /proposed/ in 1947. Truman was President in both those years.
