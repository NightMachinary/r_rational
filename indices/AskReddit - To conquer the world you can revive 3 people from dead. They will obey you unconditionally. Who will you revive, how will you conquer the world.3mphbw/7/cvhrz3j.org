  1. I'd wait until after the next US president is elected, have them shot, then immediately revive them before anyone notices that they had died. Wham, I now have nuclear weapons.

  2. One of the 9/11 hijackers. Due to their extremely verifiable status of being dead, they'd be able to gather /major/ support with their resurrection.

  3. John Paul II - again, his death was extremely verifiable, so he'll have a massive religious following after his resurrection.
