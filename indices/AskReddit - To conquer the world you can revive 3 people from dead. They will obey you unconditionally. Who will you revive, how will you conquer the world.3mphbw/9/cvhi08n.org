People vary way less in capability than in fame: the real treasure here is the fact that you're resurrecting famous people, which hints you want to get them elected into popular office. Abraham Lincoln/George Washington/Benjamin Franklin (maybe) would have a very good chance to be elected. Get Peter, Nevsky, or Catherine up in Russia. Have them forge radically close diplomatic relations. Try to wrangle China, which will feel threatened, into making a military move on India, where you may or may not have needed to install Bapu, then bring India into the alliance and crush China. If you can't get China to attack on its own, revive Mao and use him to attack. If you don't need him or Bapu, then you resurrect Mohammed.

I don't think you want to do Jesus because you don't have a way to verify his identity.

This is assuming the creation of an international coalition, turning into a world government asap, counts as conquering. If violent seizure of territory is the only option, then use your countries to create a very powerful space program with the aim of being able to drop giant rocks onto Earth, specifically on cities and power plants. There's not much they can do against this. There's no realistic way to avoid your territory then getting nuked, especially given the difficulty of destroying underground missile bunkers, but that's not a big issue because a seed population can rebound very quickly.
