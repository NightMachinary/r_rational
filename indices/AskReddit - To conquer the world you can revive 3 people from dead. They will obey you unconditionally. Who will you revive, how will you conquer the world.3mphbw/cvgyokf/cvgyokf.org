I'm afraid that it might be a teacher's password here, but one of the best shots at /taking over the world/ seems to be to make an fAI. Revive two great mathematicians and a great leader/organiser/planner of small organisations (probably all from the 20th century), and you'll likely be the head of the best AI research team in the world, and therefore have the best shot at making the fAI which conquers the world (for you).
