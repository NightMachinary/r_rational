  Coming up with something...extrahuman to do it might indeed be the smartest path,

This is my claim. You are agreeing with me. It doesn't have to be likely, it just has to be the least implausible.

#+begin_quote
  For me, it's almost impossible to put a number on such a thing,
#+end_quote

I'm just wildly guessing. By Bayes' law, even a statement you know nothing about has some subjective probability of being true. 1% seems like a plausible number based on shallow guesswork. Something like:

AI in our lifetimes: 0.5

Erd√∂s and co spearheading AI research at that time: 0.05

Them managing to make an fAI without error: 0.4

Multiply and you get 1% chance.
