We already have AI teams, and mathematicians (honestly, it's a question of which mathematician is a Great Man, and whose work has been incorporated by talented enough people but it's beyond my competency).

I don't think that three people, even Great Men, can really do things like that, or can be so superior to current organizations*. There's a sort of plasticity in scifi, where geniuses can do outlandish things, which gives some leeway but just assuming three real people? Much harder.

*Unless you swap one of them out with someone with a ridiculous fortune.
