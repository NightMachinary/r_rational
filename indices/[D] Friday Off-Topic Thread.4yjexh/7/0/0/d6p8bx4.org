Fortunately, this project is one that I'm not likely to lose the muse for, partially because I'm being careful not to write myself into a corner, and partially because Undertale is something that will, I suspect, always be close to my heart. :p

I'll probably be comfortable posting a couple chapters once I've got about 20k words done and edited. Need to make sure I've got all my kittens in a row and also need to sort out what tense/perspective I'll be using, still not sure on that.
