I recommend taking a day off but then returning to your writing. Just a day for your brain to rest, not more and not less. Your brain is still not familiar with the exertion of writing a lot in a relatively short span of time. Let it adapt with time. I personally take sundays off but you can choose.

Also, I suggest setting a daily or weekly goal. Like I try to write at least 1000 words a day. Set something achievable like 500 words a day. You may not always meet the goal but most of the time, you will finish your quota. Sometimes you will write much more than expected. Feel free to decrease the quota if it proves itself too much. But try to do your best.

When you see that you are regularly writing much more than the goal specifies, raise it a bit. It will take about a week or two to get comfortable with the new target. If it still gives you trouble then you may have set the target too high. Experiment until you discover your groove. Good luck.
