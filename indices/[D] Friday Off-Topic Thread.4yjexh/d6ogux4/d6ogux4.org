What should we do with information that isn't helpful for people to know. For example it is a fact that intelligence is strongly tied to genetics for any reasonable definition of either of those words. Knowing this doesn't help though. In fact, believing this has been shown to correlate with low achievement especially in children. Should we then avoid mentioning this. Should we pretend it's not true?

I'd say probably for one we should have more study. Is it actually the belief that is causal or is it reverse causation. If it's the latter than there is no harm in spreading the info wide and far, but if it's the former we at least need to be careful about publicizing it.

Also totally unrelated, but I just got told that I'm on to start the first phase of technical interviews with Google. Strangely I feel better about that than I do about more standard interviewing so we'll see.
