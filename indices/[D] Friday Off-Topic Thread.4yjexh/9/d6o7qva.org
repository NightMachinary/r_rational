I haven't updated Sanity Falls (a rational Gravity Falls fic) in several months. At first I was just putting it off, but now I'm leaning towards abandoning it outright. I only ever got two chapters in; does anyone strongly object? I feel my efforts would be better-spent elsewhere, but if there's a strong demand for more, I wouldn't want to disappoint.
