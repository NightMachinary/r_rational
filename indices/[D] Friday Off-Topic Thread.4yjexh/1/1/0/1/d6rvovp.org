I read the whole fic with the belief that the romantic love interest was Bucky [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucky][The Winter Soldier]] who chose the name Roger because he had good associations with the name Rogers for obvious reasons. I think that one of us must have drastically misread it... but I don't think I'm going to go back for a reread just to check this detail.

Anyways, I am totally fine with gender benders even if they don't have a point. I mean, fanfiction changing any other particular details of setting, character, or plot for any reason of aesthetic or authorial choice is totally fine by me, so it would be sort of weird of me to demand specifically that characters genders remain inviolate while allowing other things to change for any or no reason.
