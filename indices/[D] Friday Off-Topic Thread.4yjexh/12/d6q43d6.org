Okay for those of you following The U.S. election have we reached the [[http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/godwins-law][Godwin's law]] threshold?

1. Politics is spiders, but I keep seeing the Trump=Hitler meme-set and it's worrisome despite the lack of civility in the WWF world US politics has become.
2. I have a deep conservative/capitalistic/faith in some parts of the system bias I am re-examining; your personal attacks are unwelcome, as are failure to use primary sources, in context, and will only lower my opinion of you. If you don't have an steel-man argument on the topic please don't bother as you'll only increase my bias.
