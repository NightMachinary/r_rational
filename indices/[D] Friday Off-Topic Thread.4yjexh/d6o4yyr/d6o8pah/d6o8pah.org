I really, really loved the horror-ish parts of Dan Simmon's Hyperion - I'm thinking particularly of The Priest's Tale: The Man Who Cried God, and a few different parts of the end of The Poet's Tale. The Priest's Tale was strange and disturbing and horrific in a number of ways that really worked and resonated with me. Strangely enough, Simmon's completely straight up horror works like Carrion Comfort and Song of Kali never really worked for me at all in the same way.

I really liked the novel House of Leaves by Danielewski. It's got a wonderful creepyness and the structure of the book is just really unique and interesting; everyone should buy and read this book. I just love how the author structures things as stories within stories and how the book is crafted.

I really love parts of Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem (Gamecube) for it's 4th wall breaking horror stuff. It's also got a really nice Lovecraftian aesthetic and structure, and the voice acting is actually astoundingly good quality. The actual gameplay itself isn't all that great, but the other parts of the game have so much going for them I beat it the full three times to get the complete ending.

Song of Saya (Saya no Uta) is a light novel that takes it's inspiration fairly directly from Lovecraft, and was written by the Urobutcher. If you can survive the fairly graphic and disturbing sex scenes, it's got some excellent horror content with a particularly neat aesthetic. It's super disturbing in many ways.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3659997/chapters/8088522][The Northern Caves]] is actually pretty neat horror-ish stuff with a non-neurotypical slant, but the most directly rational horror on AO3 is [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/6178036/chapters/14154868][Cordyceps]], which bills itself as irrationalfic.

I wouldn't have called The Cabin in the Woods horror - for me, the movie (while wonderful) never really evoked any sense of dread or terror because of the framing narrative. For me, I felt the movie to be more of a comedy deconstruction of horror in the same sort of vein of things like [[http://lparchive.org/Illbleed/][Illbleed]]
