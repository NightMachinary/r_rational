  The horror is in mysteries that don't fold like wet tissue paper to inquiry, and/or in victims who don't have the resources to overpower the threat

Of course; I didn't mean to imply that winning in every rational horror story would or should be /easy/ for the main characters. However, it would be far more interesting and horrifying if the threats were dangerous or incomprehensible enough to hold its own against the full extent of humanity's technology and creativity, instead of relying on the protagonist not having access to a handgun and being stupid.

Thank you for the recommendation.
