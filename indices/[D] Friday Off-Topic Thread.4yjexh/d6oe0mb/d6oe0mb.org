Just completed a writing project that I started eight months ago. It's terribly written, full of blunders and mistakes, lot of grammar mistakes too. But damn it, I DONE IT! I completed a thing.

Now, I am going to be working on finishing yet another project, a rational stargate fic.

There's an original fic that I wanted to do, but it's very research-heavy. I need to find an original fic that's not such research heavy or find a better solution to worldbuilding. It's very hard to write when you have no reference materials to fall back on.
