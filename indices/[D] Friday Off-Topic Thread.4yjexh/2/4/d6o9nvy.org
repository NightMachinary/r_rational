Off and on I'm working on a novella about some horror authors attending a small writer's retreat at an expy of the Stanley Hotel, and they cotton on to what's happening pretty quickly. There won't be much scientific investigation, because (1) they're authors, not scientists, and (2) bad things are trying to kill them, but they do their best to avoid being bad horror protagonists.

(a problem is that one of the antagonists is /also/ a horror author >:P )
