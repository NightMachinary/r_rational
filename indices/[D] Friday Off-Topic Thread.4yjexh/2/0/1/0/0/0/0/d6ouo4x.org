Actually, you can, you just need to have somewhere you can be certain you can trust your senses, and be willing to replace your senses with technology. Also be really good at following and formulating plans.

Think of it like the Mars rover: we can't communicate with it in real time, so we have to send it instructions for what to do. In this case, you would be acting as both the rover and control, and instead of a light delay it would be a delay of how long it took to shuttle yourself in and out of the zone of distrust, combined with how much time it takes to review the data.

You can also use things like autodialers and other automatic systems to circumvent self distrust, but this is just an extension of the rover analogy.
