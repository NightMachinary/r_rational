Counterpoint/reconstruction: Warhammer 40K and the Warp. Everyone in the setting is /horrendously/ irrational, because the Warp actively harms people who attempt to study or interact with it, while ignorance and superstition, while no real defense, are at least ways to /not attract its attention/. The only factions /capable/ of behaving rationally without getting skullfucked by daemons are those who literally don't have souls enough to damn.

In a related matter, I'd really love to know what happens when fucking David Chalmers discovers the Warp and how he reacts to the Hard Problem being resolved by irrefutably true nonsense.
