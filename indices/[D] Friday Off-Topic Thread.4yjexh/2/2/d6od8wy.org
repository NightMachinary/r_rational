There's been lots of shitty horror recently because it's really cheap to make. But there have been some excellent horror movies recently, Green Room and It Follows come to mind. Each has characters making dumb but believable choices (they're teenagers after all) and getting smarter through the movie.

Not exactly horror, but the director of Green Room also did Blue Ruin which is a fantastic story.
