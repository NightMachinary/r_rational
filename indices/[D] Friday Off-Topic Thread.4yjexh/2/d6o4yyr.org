Let's talk about the horror genre. 'Supernatural' horror genre, to be specific.

*I.* You see, I quite like it: it's one of my favorite genres. Characters encountering unknown, usually dangerous and hostile but almost always /strange/ forces, trying to understand them and deal with them.

And, as could be expected from a member of this subreddit, I like rational and sane characters, original plot twists, and when priorities are assigned correctly.

Probably not too hard to guess that I rarely get everything I want. Almost never, in fact.

Characters in horror stories are almost always ridiculously stupid and genre-blind, fishes-in-a-barrel. Horror stories are full of cliché character roles and cliché twists and cliché antagonists and cliché everything. Instead of focusing on /encountering supernatural,/ they care about something inconsequential like an old grudge or some blightul love triangle. Nobody ever does anything interesting, and if they do, I almost certainly am reading/listening to/watching a parody.

On the other hand, I saw but a few genuine horror stories in the rationalist community. Usually it's something about the horror of wireheading or uFAI, which is scary, but not exactly what I seek. Why, I wonder? The aforementioned premise is a great way to show characters' rationality, genre-savvines, ability to update their beliefs and explore the unknown. This genre is /full/ of low-hanging fruits.

Really, just imagine that: the main characters notice that something weird is going on in their home. Instead of ignoring it or rationalizing it away until it's too late, they investigate. A monster, they quickly discover, bewildered. They contemplate running for their lives for exactly two seconds. Instead, they carefully study it, making heavy use of modern technology, like quadcopters with video cameras, then capture it and sell it to the scientists, acquiring eternal fame and wealth. Scietists subsequently discover 'supernatural', turn it into a branch of engineering, find a missing piece in their model of the universe, and lead the world into post-scarcity utopia.

Did anyone ever perceived a story that went at least remotely like that? No, I expect. /sigh/ I suppose I will have no choice but to write it myself, will I?

*II.* That part probably belongs in a Monthly Recommendation Thread, but the rant above doesn't, and I wanted to post it all at once.

I do know a few instances of rational-ish works in this genre:

*[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/][SCP Foundation]]*; *[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._P._Lovecraft][Lovecraft]]*'s works; *Wildbow's* *[[https://pactwebserial.wordpress.com/][Pact]]*, partially; *EagleJarl's* works: *[[https://www.amazon.com/Pay-Attention-novella-psychological-horror-ebook/dp/B00V4ZIEMQ/ref=la_B00WCPXLMA_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1471618396&sr=1-2#nav-subnav][Pay Attention]]*, *[[https://www.amazon.com/Baby-Blues-David-K-Storrs-ebook/dp/B00V52XRIE#nav-subnav][Baby Blues]]* and *[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11530632/1/Supernaturally-Rational][Supernaturally Rational]]*. I suppose most people here already know about them; included for the sake of completedness.

*[[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1259521/][The Cabin in the Woods]]*, a movie. To be brief, Worm : Superhero stories :: The Cabin in the Woods : Horror movies.

*[[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2388715/][Oculus]]*, a movie. It promised to be /perfect/. Kaylie's plan, outlined in the first half of the movie, was exactly the sort of thing I expect a rational character to do; I cannot express how pleasantly I was surprised. Unfortunately but inevitably, it didn't last: she [[#s][spoiler]] towards the end (almost literally (it was +an apple+ +a lighbulb+ an apple)), and [[#s][spoiler]] The first half is very good, though.

*[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Another][Another]]*, an anime/light novel. Has a very good atmosphere, genre-savvy and not idiotic main characters, and an interesting and complex yet consistently-behaving opposing force. Has its flaws, which can be summarized as 'the last two episodes of the anime'. I intend to write a rational fanfic of it, someday.

I invite everyone to recommend their favorite works in horror genre, preferably with rational undertones. Everything's fine: books, movies, anime, podcasts, games, etc.
