Plus, at some point you realize you are watching a perpetually sad story about hobo gargoyles who keep getting rejected and hated by basically everyone, plus Xanatos who keeps trying to kill them / capture them / generally make their life miserable for no reason.

Also, Xanatos is a cool character, but as an evil genius, he's kind of overrated.
