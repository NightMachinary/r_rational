I had a good time reading this humorous take in Sir Gawain and the Green Knight [[http://the-toast.net/2015/06/03/sir-gawain-and-the-green-knight/][(link)]]. I also had a good time reading this article on how Gargoyles was great [[http://blacknerdproblems.com/gargoyles-was-the-most-important-cartoon-of-my-pre-intellectual-black-childhood/][(link)]]
