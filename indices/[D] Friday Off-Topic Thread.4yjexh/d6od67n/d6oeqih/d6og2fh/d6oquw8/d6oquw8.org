Oh wow, today I realized that the bold red *12 new comments* on the front page is a [[https://redditenhancementsuite.com/][RES]] feature, not native. (I also use [[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/reddit-au-comment-highlig/jeodebnjeecpbmbgimbpinccfkihhjid?hl=en][Reddit new comment highlight]].) I often come back to even week-old threads if there's new activity, but I can see why others wouldn't.
