There was an MCU fanfic called Move Fast and Break Things posted on this subreddit yesterday that most people seemed to like. Am I the only one who didn't like it? I didn't think it was terrible, just not good enough to keep me reading past the first three chapters.

Instead of reimagining an established story like HPMOR did, it seemed to be retreading old ground with only superficial differences. Toni Stark is nearly identical to her canon counterpart, and the situation she's in is only slightly different and makes just as much sense.

The biggest problem I have, however, is that it's missing what I loved about the movie it's based on. You can't just write dialogue that sounds like RDJ and expect it to have the same impact without his acting. Writing in prose is different than in movies, or even comics.

There's also no Iron Man in it. Toni doesn't even save herself from the terrorists, she escapes almost by accident without overcoming any obstacle. When I sit down to read a story about a superhero character, I want to see them do heroic things. Where was Iron Man?

I don't understand why people like this fanfic. I don't hate it, I just find it boring. It lacks what I liked about its source material and it didn't have anything I wanted that the original story didn't. Maybe it gets better after Toni gives press conferences, but I didn't care enough to keep reading after that.
