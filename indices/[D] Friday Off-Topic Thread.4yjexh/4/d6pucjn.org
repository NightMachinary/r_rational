I just read someone mentioning the Dunning-Kruger offhandedly (in Twig's comments), and decided to checkout out the Wikipedia article on the subject. It's the phenomenon where people with low knowledge of a subject tend to overestimate their knowledge of it, and people with high knowledge tend to underestimate it.

Now, I'd read/heard about it before, mostly interpreted as "you should be careful teaching things to people or you could make them overconfident" or "this guy thinks he knows a lot about X, that means he doesn't know much", and it feels like a meme that would easily spread by allowing people to be smug about people who disagree with them (not only does he not know the first thing about X, he thinks he knows a lot about X! what an idiot) regardless of its veracity. So I searched for articles criticizing the effect.

Well, it turns out the Dunning-Kruger effect isn't real. The experiment failed to replicate several times, and it has basically no credibility in the psychology community. So I guess everyone who quoted this "science fact" is a gullible idiot, and if you feel like telling them that, well, please don't because this whole paragraph is a lie (also don't repeat what I say without looking things up yourself, dammit). Starting over.

As far as my ten minutes research can tell, there is an effect that does replicate (though only for occidentals? I'm not sure), but the "stupid people think they're smart" meme is basically unfounded. low-skill people tend to overestimate their skill and vice-versa, but perceived skill still augments with actual skill. What happens is people who get a 10 think they have a 40, people who have a 50 think they have a 60, and people who have a 90 think they have a 80. [[http://www.talyarkoni.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/dunning_kruger.png][(see this graph for a more visual explanation)]].

The actual explanation is contested. Dunning and Kruger think that, as people get more skilled, they get more tools to notice their flaws and loose some of their overconfidence in the process. On the other hand, most of the effect might be explained by regression to the mean (most people are terrible at judging their skill, most people think they have a constant high level X, and as they get more skilled their level gets closer to perceived level X, without any learning one's flaws involved).

So, what did I learn today? A. Small Wikipedia articles about psychology can be wrong, or, at least, not as informative as googling "is [X] true?". This really bothers me. B. Quoting psychology experiments to prove a point is a horrible idea and you shouldn't do it even if the experiment agrees with you especially if the experiment agrees with you, especially especially if you haven't at least read the entire Wikipedia article about it. That also goes for the Milgram experiment, the Stanford Prison experiment, that one peer pressure experiment with the short lines and the long lines, or the Rosenhan experiment.
