RIP, Angelo.

Lily was maimed, and there's a roster full of disabled or missing humans. Things are grim - but then again, this story is about survival.

The aftermath of Chapter 23 has a lot of dramatic tension. The players will need another 1-2 medical tents. The players surviving the battle with the mini-boss and boss will have a flood of NPs, and will get substantially rewarded. Surviving the second day will likely reward them as well.

Player Species C, a.k.a croc-frogs, are monstrously tough. Not only did the two caught in pit traps survive, the ambush party was driven off without any apparent losses - lots of nasty injuries, though. It even seems reasonable that they'd survive their own boss fight.

Nathan's inspiration to use the outhouse's setup function to dig pit traps got a good chuckle out of me.

I'm guessing the players will be flooded by NPs and new skills in Chapter 24. The relatively close match between humans and frogs makes me think that some detente might be possible, at least for a few days. The hard end of stage 1 means that this cannot last - but the arena itself eclipses the threat these enemies pose to each other.
