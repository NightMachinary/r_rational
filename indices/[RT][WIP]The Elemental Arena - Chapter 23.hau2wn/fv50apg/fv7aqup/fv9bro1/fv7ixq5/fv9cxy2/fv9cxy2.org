Good catch - I saw that on a subsequent read-through.

I suspect the enemies in the pits are goners, unless they have some very effective buffs or defensive skills. Banewolf Poison and the spear injuries will probably make it hard to save their captives.

The arena's rewards for "defeating" enemy players would have me pretty ticked off if I was in that situation. Fleeing players do not count as defeated. It isn't yet clear if captives count, either. I'm hoping they do. A live captive is conceivably more valuable than a dead enemy, and riskier to get. Reward in alignment with risk would make some sense, here. (Maybe even a first-time reward for capturing an enemy?)
