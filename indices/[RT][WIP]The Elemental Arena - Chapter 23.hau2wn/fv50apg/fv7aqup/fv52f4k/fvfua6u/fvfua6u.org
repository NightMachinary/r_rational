I gotta say, it's kind of sobering adding a [[https://elemental-arena.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Deceased][Deceased]] tag to the characters in the wiki.

That said - while there are references to bloodbaths taking place off-screen, twelve of the eighteen human characters in the arena are living, or at least not known to be dead. So far, [[/u/Gilgilad7]] has been averaging around one death on-screen every four chapters, along with a lot of life-threatening injuries.

Ava, Maya, and Gabriel are all unknowns at this point, so there's the potential for a big shift. Lillian has a life-threatening injury as well. Many of them may be able to recover by learning a Physical skill, and Asahi is on his feet and likely able to stabilize anyone not yet dead. Gabriel's superhuman speed hopefully allowed him to dodge the shaman's frost ring attack - but this may simply be wishful thinking on my part. Water is the destroying element of Fire, so the attack instantly pixelating Gabriel is a gruesomely likely outcome. If Gabriel is not yet dead, he'll be situated close enough for Asahi's /Injury Stabilize/ skill to take him out of immediate danger.
