I dunno, at usual wuxia translation pace, that'd be a few years. At the pace this was getting translated it was going to be quite a bit longer, and I was hoping to see more translators join the project (one of the reasons for waiting - I prefer to binge and read everything over the course of a few weeks or at least in large chunks). I'm really disappointed that instead of more translators there's now zero. I can't imagine how people who've been reading it from the start feel.
