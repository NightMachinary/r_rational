I didn't start reading yet - was waiting for the translation to finish. Am now glad that I did.

As for speculation that some rights-holders want it translated "on their terms" - bullshit. If they were going to do a higher quality translation, they wouldn't be concerned about competition from hobbyists. I don't expect there will be any translation from them anytime soon.
