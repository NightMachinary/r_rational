There were updates to this being posted here regularly; then it got moved to Gravity Tales, and the update posts stopped. There were another six chapters added on the new site, and then nothing. Investigation led me to the linked post; it looks like the rights to the novel have been acquired by some company, and they want it translated on their own terms.

Thoughts?
