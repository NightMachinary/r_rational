Hah.

If I recall, Naruto and Naruto Shippuden are also works that these trope applies too.

For all that ninjas are awesome, there are some things that don't even make sense. Particularly, the massive idiot ball that allowed Kaguya and 'The Ultimate Mastermind' Black Zetsu to be sealed again...

I mean. What in the world was Black Zetsu thinking not learning every single technique he could in all those years???!

...and his apparent genius was so overrated. Even moreso than the Fourth Hokage. Why didn't he advise Kaguya to BFR each and every remaining member of the last team or simply use whatever means to kill off Obito (or Kakashi, in case he really had adapted to use Kamui without Sharingan eyes just like Madara was skilled enough to use Susanoo without having special eyes...)

1. Kill Teleporters.
2. BFR Sasuke and Naruto into different dimensions and kill Kakashi and Sakura. (Or use them as bait for step 2.)
3. Let them starve.
4. ...
5. PROFIT???

Right...?

(On another note I wonder what would have happened if Madara had transplanted a Byakugan in himself...)
