Yeah, t's fine for a story to start with an improbable situation/coincidence. It's part of the point of story telling: there has to be a noteworthy thing to tell a story about. TV Tropes has the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropicPrinciple][Antropic Principle]], which basically covers this.
