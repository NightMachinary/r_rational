If it happens once, then it depends. A farm boy becoming a hero is not in itself an instance of "plot requires it", because stories are subject to survivorship bias. Think of it from an in-universe writer's perspective. Obviously, someone has to be successful. Once someone has risen from rags to riches, the writer traces history back to his humble origins, and it looks improbable until we remember that there were millions of /other/ farm boys that died unknown and unsung.

But if your farm boy starts on a journey and /at the end/ of it discovers that he is of noble origin then it's it. (One notable exception is the self-fulfilling prophecy thingie)
