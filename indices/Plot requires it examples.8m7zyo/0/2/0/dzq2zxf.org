Hmm, the issue with that type of story would be that it could easily run afoul of [[https://brandonsanderson.com/sandersons-first-law/][Sanderson's First Law of Magic]], because the reader can't reasonably understand what the character can and can't do. So any plot problems that get solved with the power come across as a Deus Ex Machina.

Though you can still tell stories about this type of character, but you just have to focus on different aspects. Like how the character handles the freedom of consequences his power likely grants him.
