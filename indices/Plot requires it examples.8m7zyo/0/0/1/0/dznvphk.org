Or a really nasty world.

For example, you could write something Cthulutech-ish where the main character(s) routinely stop numerous world ending events, like anti-matter munitions, daemon summoning, deep one land invasions, and chicken shortages at Popeyes. It's not that the world is set up for them to save it, but rather that it needs saving a lot and it makes more sense to hire experienced people who have done it one (or more then once) already.
