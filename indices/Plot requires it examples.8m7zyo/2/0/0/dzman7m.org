Again, though, if the MC "just happens" to walk by the event that makes them become awesome, that's less "the plot demands it" and "that's why this character is the MC." For instance, take /Charlie and the Chocolate Factory./ Charlie didn't win ownership of the factory because he was a paragon of virtue, he won because every other child was a the kind of horrible person who pestered their parents to buy enough chocolate so that they couldn't help but find a ticket. Any average child would probably have done well enough to outmatch the spoiled brats on the tour: Charlie was just the one who found the candy bar first, and thus became the MC. If he hadn't, someone else (probably equally poor, given the neighbourhood) would have, and the story would have been "Caroline and the Chocolate Factory."
