Let's take a wade through everyone's favourite redheaded stepchild, the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I'll stick to Phase I.

/Iron Man/:

- Okay, they set up a good reason why Stark might have a spare Arc Reactor downstairs, but it just happens to be in a place that he has /just barely enough/ energy to reach when the plot demands it.
- Pepper's appointment with Agent Coulson just happens to be scheduled at the exact moment where she's fleeing Stark Industries with the incriminating data.
- Tony's spare reactor has just enough power to escape Stane for /just long enough/ to reach freezing altitude.

/The Incredible Hulk/:

- The window Banner drops down in front of while escaping in Brazil just happens to be the cute girl from work, not one of the thugs harassing her.
- Betty decides to go for pizza (implied to be a rare event) when Banner is in the pizza shop.

/Iron Man 2/:

- Hammer is at the race when Stark is attacked by Venko
- Not only does the new element Stark uses to power the Arc reactor /not/ have the toxic effects of palladium, it instantly cures them.
- They get all the information they need to figure out that Venko is going to attack /just/ in time for Tony to arrive at the very end of Hammer's presentation.
- The timed detonator on the Venkobots give Tony /just/ enough time to rescue Pepper.

/Thor/:

- It kind of makes sense why Jane was in the perfect place to run Thor over the /first/ time: she was investigating the Bifrost, even though she didn't know it. Running over him the /second/ time, on the other hand, is much too contrived.
- Jane's notebook is in a place where it can be easily grabbed by Thor on his way out of the compound
- Heimdall thaws at exactly the right time to bring Thor back to Asgard to stop Loki

/Captain America: The First Avenger/:

- The regiment that Cap goes overseas to perform for is the same one Bucky, his childhood friend, is attached to, and Agent Carter, the Colonel, and Stark are all present there too.
- Bucky is both the one who is /currently/ being experimented on when Cap arrives to free him, and the one for whom the experimentation /worked/.
- The Howling Commandos from the Captain America propaganda films look /exactly like/ the Howling Commandos that he rescues along with Bucky.
- The /one/ time Cap gets kissed by a girl, Agent Carter is there to get jealous.
- Somehow, all the world's known vibranium has been made into a prototype shield, that is lying nearby when Cap needs a new shield.
- The delays of blowing up all those factories work out so perfectly that they arrive /just in time/ to intercept the plane being launched.

/Marvel's The Avengers/:

- The one character personally killed by Loki on the Helicarrier is the one with a personal connection to each of the Avengers.
- Tony has his next prototype armour (the Mark VII) in the final stages of development just as he goes to confront Loki in Stark tower wearing a barely-functional Mark VI.
- Loki's Sceptre, being actively used throughout the Battle of Manhattan, which is the only thing that can stop the Tesseract, is dropped atop Stark Tower, right next to the Tesseract.
- The Mark VII has /just enough power/ to take the nuke through the Wormhole, and then fails immediately afterwards.

...That's just off the top of my head, and that's just /Phase I/.

I wouldn't describe your "rise into infinity" scenario as being a "plot requires it" so much as something similar to the anthropic principle: if your MC wasn't the one to participate in the fortuitous event and become awesome, then someone else would, and the story would be about /them/ instead. If it happens /multiple/ times to the same MC, then yeah (e.g. Harry Potter, who has already defeated Voldemort twice and cemented MC status, is in the right position to attend the Triwizard tournament and the Quidditch World Cup, both happening in Britain for the first time in ages).

"Plot requires it" events are generally more like the MCU examples. It's not that there's a Chekov's Gun for the MC to use, but that the MC gets thrown by a "random" explosion so that they're lying /right next/ to the Gun.
