Tongue removal is not even that debilitating under default canon. It's a problem not because people are unable to do it, but because there is little training in it. Using magic non-verbally and wandlessly is clearly possible (see "accidental magic"), but people don't make a conscious effort to learn how to control magic in that way. It could also be theoretically possible for the pain of being violently disabled to be enough to induce an outburst of accidental magic to the detriment of the captors, and so it is avoided unless absolutely necessary.
