Was it really in character for Darth Vader to simply allow Luke and co. to pass through the shield around Endor, instead of, say, having them surrounded and seized by the many Imperial craft that were certainly in the vicinity?

How about Sauron having /not a single orc/ guarding his private volcano where he forged the One Ring? Or the fact that, despite being literally a giant flaming eyeball, he never noticed intruders carrying that ring into his domain - for weeks - until it was too late?

Why did Lord Voldemort stage dramatic confrontations with Harry Potter, but never anyone else? Eg Quirrell allowing Harry enough freedom to fight back or run, Diary!Riddle sending the Basilisk after Harry /while holding Harry's wand and not using it/, resurrected Voldemort allowing Harry to be untied from the gravestone and get a fair fight? Sure, he started to get over that tendency as Harry made him more frustrated, but we never see or hear of him even offering it to anyone else. And why, when captured at Malfoy Manor, were Harry and Hermione simply disarmed and locked up, instead of, say, being /literally/ disarmed? Broken bones are easy for a magical healer to treat, but very difficult for a prisoner to work around.
