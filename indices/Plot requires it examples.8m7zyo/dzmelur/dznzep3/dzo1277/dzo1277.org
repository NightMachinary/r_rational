[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Threepenny_Opera][Threepenny opera]] by Brecht & Weill. I was referring to the scene when the mounted messenger arrives to pardon Mack the Knife, and he also gets ennobled, oh and also a castle, oh and also a yearly rent, by decree of the king (a pony was not explicitly included). The scene is so over the top that you get the sense that he really gets executed and you are watching a bad fix-fic. And the song of the messenger is quite funny at that.

In the original German version, there even is an announcer in the theatre who explains that Mack now needs to get saved because people pay more for happy endings, since they don't get them in real life. I don't know whether this got cut for the broadway version.

This is how I felt when reading the end of crime & punishment. The first arcs were brilliant, but the ending left me very dissatisfied; not over-the-top enough to fully break suspension of disbelief, instead stranded in the uncanny valley of "the plot/morale required it".

PS. If this fourth-wall breaking sounds cliche, it is because Brecht kinda pioneered its use in that way, see [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_theatre][here]] for why Mack actually must get saved (Brecht was pretty transparent about his style). Maybe I read Dostojewsky too literally, and the "Entfremdungseffekt" was intended; but it somehow did not sit right with me.
