Yeah. Garion in the Belgariad wouldn't be an example, because this has always been his prophesied destiny, even if he spent time as a farm boy, and the people taking him off the farm and turning him into a hero know all about that destiny. None of it is coincidental.

Luke in /Star Wars/, on the other hand... of all the moisture farmers on Tattooine, what are the odds that a message from Princess Leia ends up in the hands of Luke Skywalker, son of a Jedi? Even /taking into account/ that Obi-wan Kenobi, the message's intended recipient, is necessarily going to be near Luke, what are the odds that Owen and Beru Lars needed those two /specific kinds of droids/ (interpreter and astromech) right then?
