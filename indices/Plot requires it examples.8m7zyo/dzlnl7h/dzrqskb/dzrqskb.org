One I've seen recently (and couldn't believe) was in Logan.

Spoilers below.

When they stop at the farm after being hunted and found twice. They just barely escaped that /very/ day. What the fuck did they think would happen?! Logan obviously is aware of this as he insists they leave... and is promptly persuaded by Xavier to stay. Because... There was no pressing reason to stay and all the reasons to flee.

The deaths of that family were the most predictable and preventable event in the entire movie.

It made me mad at the writers of an otherwise perfectly fine film.
