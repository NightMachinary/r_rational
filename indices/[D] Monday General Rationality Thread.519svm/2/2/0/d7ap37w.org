Huh, wait, what? I am now frantically googling for research on people being immune to exercise. Most of what I find are pop science articles. Some of them do link to actual research (e.g. this one: [[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26455890]]), but so far I have not found any sufficiently adequate papers.

Would you kindly elaborate on what you mean by "immune to exercise"? What kind of exercise and what kind of stat is immune to being trained? Any references would be much appreciated, too.
