  I assume that 'lifestyle/diet too low in protein and other nutrients for non-negligible muscle growth', along with 'doesn't have the knowledge and motivation to exercise properly and lose weight', are being conflated to create a perception of 'no matter how much I exercise, I don't get healthier'.

That seems to be a reasonably plausible explanation of my previous experience.
