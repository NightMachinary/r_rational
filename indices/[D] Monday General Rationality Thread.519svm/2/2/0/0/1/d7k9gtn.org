I mean, trivially speaking, 100% of people are immune to exercise for a given value of exercise and "pre-training" physique. I exercise 2-3 times a week (powerlifting/strongman/gymnastics type stuff for 1-1.5 hours) and am decently active-ish on my rest days (I'll walk around 5-10mi a day on average, maybe go on a 1-3 mi run a few times a week, often engage in vigorous... other activities, and bike/paddle/swim/climb/hike/wrestle/etc. on the weekends), but have pretty much plateaued given my current "training" volume and intensity. No matter how long I keep at what I'm currently doing, I won't be running 4:30 mile, or lifting a 6/5/4 plate dead/squat/bench, or sending a >5.12, etc. in the foreseeable future. None of those things are terribly unique or exceptional accomplishments, and I could probably get to some of them if I really optimized for performance in those activities, but despite, by all accounts, "exercising" fairly regularly, I've reached a point where progress is slow and fleeting.

Likewise, individuals who are fresh out of a coma or zero-G outer-space or paralysis or a full body cast or whatever will get fabulous results from exercise consisting of walking a few hundred feet around the block. Individuals who are sedentary but otherwise healthy will see their "noob-gains" from that sort of thing dry up pretty fast unless they progressively overload their neighborhood stroll (or whatever it is they're doing; skimming some of the referenced papers, one's abstract states that "on the other hand, the initial level of a phenotype is a major determinant of training response for some traits, such as submaximal exercise heart rate and blood pressure (BP) but has only a minor effect on others (e.g., VO2max, HDL-C)." No shit!).

20% of people are also immune to learning! I determined this by making individuals across a range of ages practice their ABCs, and a large subset of them did not improve in their writing ability. Even when isolating that subset, no dose-dependent response was observed, and not a one went on to pen the next great American classic. In fact, past a certain point, /100%/ of everyone ever was immune to learning. Hot damn, alert the presses! It's like people don't realize you need to adjust as you go (for both exercise and diet -- if you're losing metabolically active tissue that you hitherto had to carry around, guess what, your metabolism changes!) when things are changing for them to keep changing (at least when it comes to physical activity).

Anyway, sorry for ranting. I guess my point is that, outside of anime characters, /everyone/ has "a gene that prevents people from growing muscles beyond a certain point but doesn't put them in hospital". Everyone hits their limit (given a current level of stimulus) somewhere.
