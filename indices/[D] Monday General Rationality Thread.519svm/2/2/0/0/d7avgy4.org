I assume that 'lifestyle/diet too low in protein and other nutrients for non-negligible muscle growth', along with 'doesn't have the knowledge and motivation to exercise properly and lose weight', are being conflated to create a perception of 'no matter how much I exercise, I don't get healthier'. It seems more likely than a gene that prevents people from growing muscles beyond a certain point but doesn't put them in hospital or do any of the other things we'd expect a lack of muscles to cause.
