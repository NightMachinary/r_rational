For one, in all my reading, I haven't come across the concept of 'immune to exercise' before, and it doesn't match up with my understanding of biology. Do you have handy any references thereon?

For another - starting exercising is just one sub-plan of a larger overall plan I'm working on. Put one way, the larger goal is to become an Actually Competent Person(TM), capable of protecting and promoting my values in various future situations I'm increasing my estimates of. There are certain characteristics that I expect such a ACP(TM) to possess, and which I'm starting to look into new methods of acquiring.

Put another way, I'm aiming to be a person of the same approximate realm as a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competent_man][Heinleinian protagonist]]. (Without the negative implications.)

Put yet another way, I want to be a person who you would be willing to destructively upload from cryopreservation into the state of an em.

None of these examples quite cover the target zone I'm trying to describe, partly because I'm still developing my understanding of what my target goal would require of me. But all of them seem to involve being willing to perform physical exercise with no visible results therefrom.
