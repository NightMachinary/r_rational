I've wondered about exercise immunity for strength. When people are in a coma, [[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25296344][their muscles will atrophy]]. If exercise-immune muscles don't respond to the exertion asked of them, then we'd expect exercise-immune people to waste away like a person in a coma, but that doesn't happen. They can still stand and walk and do the things a normal sedentary person can.

(Of course, there'll be a spectrum in how much strength people gain from exercise, and maybe it won't be very worthwhile for people at the low end. Testosterone level is known to associate with gains from exercise, and that can be altered if people want.)
