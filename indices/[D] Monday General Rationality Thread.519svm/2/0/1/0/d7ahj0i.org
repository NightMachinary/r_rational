I hear you about the tons of contradictory information out there. There is, like with almost everything, no silver bullet. A lot of the contradictions come, however, from the different goals and ideals that people implicitly project on you when advising. If people assume that you want to look pumped up, then they are going to recommend completely different things than if they assume you want to be able to do a handstand or run a marathon or hold your straight leg over your head.

On top of that, everyone's bodies indeed do not work in exactly the same way, so optimal routines will vary greatly from person to person. Still, people's bodies work quite similarly to each other. Even though a specialized program tailored just for you will be much more efficient, a generic approach still will take you miles compared to doing nothing or doing something that is not expected to work.

As you have pointed out, the motivation is perhaps the most important part of it all. Yes, you will not have immediate results. Yes, you will end up falling ill or otherwise being unable to train for some periods of time, and all your hard-won progress will disappear. You will have to get back up and KEEP PUSHING.

It is unfortunate that a personal trainer is not an option for you, as that would really be an excellent way to kickstart your process. Here are some generic points that should help you in the long run (in no particular order, but numbered for easier reference)

1. You have to learn how your body works. You have to understand the process of how the food that you eat allows you to do burpees and how doing the burpees may or may not help you burn fat or build muscle. There are many sources online, e.g. this one: [[https://knowledge.freeletics.com/en/understanding-metabolism-impacts-training-results/]] (the whole knowledge base is quite good).
2. Treat your goals not as goals but as predictions. If your predictions fail to come true, then either your understanding of how your body works is incorrect, or you did not train as hard as you planned to or otherwise did not follow the plan. Like with all failure, do not get disappointed. Treat it as a learning experience.
3. You are going to mispredict lots and lots and lots of times. Do not fall victim to the Dunning--Kruger effect, it is not simple.
4. Aim to do better than you did last time. Not just in the number of repetitions or weight, but also in the elapsed time. If it took you 10 seconds (or 10 minutes) to do 5 burpees today, make sure that tomorrow, you do 5 burpees at least one second faster. Sometimes you will fail at that. Do not let that get you down and keep pushing.
5. Mind the nutrition. If you want to lose weight, consume less than you burn. If you want to gain weight, consume more than you burn. Mind what you eat, not just how much. Learn the basics of human nutrition. Again, there is a lot of helpful stuff here: [[https://knowledge.freeletics.com/en/nutrition/]] (Note: I am not affiliated with freeletics, although I endorse them)
6. Sleep well.
7. YOU CAN DO THIS, DO NOT GIVE UP!
