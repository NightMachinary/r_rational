  with very high probability you were doing it wrong.

There is so much information, and misinformation, about exercise, with so many people saying various mutually-contradictory versions of "everyone's body works /this/ way, so obviously you should exercise like /this/", and so little way for me to verify any of it on my limited budget, that I'm kind of used to being told that "you're doing it wrong", without any way to respond.

  When you were exercising with goals, what were your routines?
#+end_quote

I've bicycled. I've walked-for-exercise. I've calisthenesed. I've worn weights. I've tried a few things I don't recall offhand. I can't afford a gym membership, or a trainer, or personal equipment, which places some limits on what those unrecalled routines might have been.

  If you do not know where you are going, why would you expect to arrive some place that you like?

I'm trying to work not directly on improving my body, but on altering my mindset to lead to behaviour that, one day, may lead to an improved body. One of the key mental thingummmies in question is motivation. Historically, and very similarly to other people, if I have a specific goal in mind when I start exercising, and fail to meet that goal, I've tended to become discouraged, not see the exercise as worth the effort, and give it up. With a bit of Zen-like mental judo, however, if I go into an exercise program without any such expectations, then there will be nothing to be discouraged about, and I'm thus more likely to continue exercising to the point where some gains actually result.
