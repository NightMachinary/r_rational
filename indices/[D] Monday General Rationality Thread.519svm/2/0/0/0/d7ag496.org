  would you clarify what you wanted to achieve by posting here?

As part of my attempt at changing my self-concept, I'm making a somewhat public precommitment to performing the acts that my modified persona should be doing. Ie, I intend to post to that Twitter account each day as I finish that day's exercise; and by having publicly posted the existence of the account, there is now a theoretical possibility that an unknown number of people on the internet will be watching that account, and at least in certain dark parts of my subconscious, there is the possibility of silent social disapproval if I fail to live up to my stated standard. (I often use the 'elephant and mahout' model of the mind, with the elephant as the subconscious. I'm hoping that this particular trick will act as one more whack on the elephant's hide to nudge it into moving the way I-the-mahout want it to move; and if not, the cost was writing some text, which is well within my budget.)
