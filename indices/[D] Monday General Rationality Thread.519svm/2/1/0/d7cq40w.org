Thank you for the suggestion. I've bookmarked the links to read through when I've had more than 3 hours of sleep (fershlugging heat waves are annoying), and to try to figure out how to adapt to my particular circumstances (eg, due to complicated home-life stuff, there aren't any walls available for me to push against).
