Uh, now I recognize that the previous message might come off unfriendly, discouraging and condescending. Please do not treat it as such, I definitely did not mean it that way.

Actually doing it and not giving up is the most important part of it. Even getting up and performing 5 burpess is something that deserves respect, so keep it up!

That being said, would you clarify what you wanted to achieve by posting here? I'd love to help, I am just not sure what the best way to approach it would be.
