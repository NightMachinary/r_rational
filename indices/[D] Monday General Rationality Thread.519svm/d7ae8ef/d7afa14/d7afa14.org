When you were exercising with goals, what were your routines? Judging by your claim that you've "never lost weight; never gained in strength or dexterity; never even gotten a second wind", then with very high probability you were doing it wrong. I don't believe having no goals would help much. If you do not know where you are going, why would you expect to arrive some place that you like?
