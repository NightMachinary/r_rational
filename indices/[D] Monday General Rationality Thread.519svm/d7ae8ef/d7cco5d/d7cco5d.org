If you have not tried it yet, I suggest you check out [[/r/bodyweightfitness]] and try their [[https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine][Recommended Routine]] ([[https://www.fitloop.co/routines/bwf-recommended-beginner-routine][or here as a website with instructional videos]]), 60mins/day, not more than 3 times a week. As far as I can tell, the subreddit has a lot of knowlegable, rational people who have optimized the routine over the last years.
