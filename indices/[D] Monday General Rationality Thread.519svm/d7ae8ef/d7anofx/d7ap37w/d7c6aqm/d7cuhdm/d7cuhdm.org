  So going by the HERITAGE data described in that NS link, exercise resistance is a thing in maybe a fifth of the population but mostly on invisible things.

I can see the above being the case. Although I believe, if I read that comment correctly, the 5-20% was gleaned from looking at each individual study. As opposed to an aggregate (which he mentions would be difficult to do) And there's also a lack of mention of weight loss.

So I think saying 5-20% of the population is immune to exercise is a borderline facetious statement on its own. It doesn't really make sense either, barring conditions that make exercise extremely unsafe/impossible. Your body needs fuel. The more you use, the more you'll need. That's practically inviolable.
