One such goal that seems likely to remain constant is to improve my understanding of math to a significant degree. More specifically, I've recently been sorting my ebooks with the Dewey Decimal System, and have realized that I currently can't even provide proper definitions for any of the subheadings of 512 (ie, 512.2 is groups and group theory, 512.3 is fields, 512.4 is rings, integral domains, and ideals). (Come to think of it, Heinlein had a comment on this one, too: "Anyone who cannot cope with mathematics is not fully human. At best he is a tolerable subhuman who has learned to wear shoes, bathe, and not make messes in the house.") It would be nice to be able to understand the videos of [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw/videos?flow=grid&sort=da&view=0][3Blue1Brown]] intuitively rather than having to struggle on any given concept.

Another goal is to improve on my weak areas instead of reinforcing a strength. I am something of a classic nerd, in that my social skills are lacking, which means that I am not very good at communicating my point of view to random people, let alone persuading them of it. Possible specific items here may include rhetoric, drama, dance, music, and developing an artist's eye. Not all at once, as I'm not even where I can start learning on some of these, but as of today, I can start carrying a harmonica and practicing with it in spare moments to start getting some of the fundamentals of breathing and embrasure down.

Some other particular items may include learning sign language, French (necessary to understand my country's federal politics very well), another spoken language, Morse code, and one or more programming/scripting languages; various driver's licensing; trying to gain certifications in first aid; swimming; and any number of other specific skills that don't come to mind offhand. I suppose I could pull out my GURPS rulebook and splatbooks for ideas :) , but honestly, even just figuring out how to improve myself in the ideas I've mentioned in this comment so far is likely to fill up my time for some time to come.

And now, I'm off to start my "what can I start work on improving /today/" by reading a book or two on harmonicas, picking something from [[https://www.harptabs.com/songlist.php?DisplayBy=view][here]] as an initial tune to work towards not being obviously terrible at playing, and figuring out where I can go to make awful noises on one without bothering anyone. :)
