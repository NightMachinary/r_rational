  What sort of level are you at?
#+end_quote

I can handle programming level math - algebra, formulas, graphs on paper, the existence of complex numbers (though I don't intuitively understand more advanced math involving them, such as exponents), and Martin Gardner puzzle books. I know that calculus involves using all sorts of tricks I could look up to figure out derivatives and line-slopes. I know I don't know how to handle matrixes, and I don't know a thing about sets, groups, rings, or other words that don't have their real-world meanings.
