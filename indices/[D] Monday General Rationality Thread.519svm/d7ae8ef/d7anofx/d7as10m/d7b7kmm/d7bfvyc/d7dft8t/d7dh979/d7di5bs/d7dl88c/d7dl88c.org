  this book

I always appreciate book recommendations. :)

Unfortunately, the cheapest I can get that one for is $50, while my monthly budget for all such self-improvement projects is merely $100, some of which is already spent for this month. So I'll probably have to settle for starting with "The Manga Guide to Linear Algebra", "All the mathematics you missed - but need to know for graduate school", and whatever other tomes I can beg, borrow, or steal without involving cash.

I run Red Hat Linux; if you can give me a package name, I can install it.
