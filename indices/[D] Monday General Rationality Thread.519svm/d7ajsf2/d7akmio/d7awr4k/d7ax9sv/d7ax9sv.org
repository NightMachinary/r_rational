  Basically, what I'm getting from this is to just keep writing and eventually, when I'm comfortable with the quality of my writing through my own ham-handed editing to publish it and integrate feedback. Which is reasonable and obvious enough, I suppose. :p

That's about the size of it, yeah :) Unlike a lot of professions, writers don't often have teachers or mentors, especially not individual ones. We learn from the writers we read, and the readers of what we write.

There's only so far you can go on your own, and coalescing all that information into actionable changes in how we practice our craft is a tougher challenge than in other activities that have more tangible and objective metrics, which means the more open you can make the channels of communication between yourself and readers, whether friends/family who are willing to beta or reviewers online, the better. Publishing authors have the advantage of a dedicated editor to go over their work with a fine-toothed comb and help iterate draft after draft, and to make up for our lack of that, we need to expose our work to strangers and listen to what they have to say.

It's an interesting topic, and we'll probably do a Rationally Writing episode on feedback and integrating it sometime soon :)
