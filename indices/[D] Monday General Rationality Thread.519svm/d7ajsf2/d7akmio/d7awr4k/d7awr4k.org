Thank you very much for this. I get what you're saying with regards to the difficulty in modelling individuals. There's certain somewhat-meta aspects of games and stories (namely, Undertale and Homestuck) that I really enjoy that brings other people out of the narrative.

Basically, what I'm getting from this is to just keep writing and eventually, when I'm comfortable with the quality of my writing through my own ham-handed editing to publish it and integrate feedback. Which is reasonable and obvious enough, I suppose. :p
