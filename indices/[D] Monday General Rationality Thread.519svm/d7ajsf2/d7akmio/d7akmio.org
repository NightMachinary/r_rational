I've thought about ways to become better at critiquing my own writing, and realized that it comes down to appropriately modeling how readers would respond to it.

Which I feel like I'm /absolutely terrible/ at.

A general mass of strangers isn't so bad, but individuals are complicated. Modeling my friends isn't too hard in most circumstances. But when it comes to book recommendations or what aspects of stories they like most... I can give a rough estimate of whether most will like or dislike a story, but the oddest things always catch me by surprise. Things that might bring me close to tears they might find tacky, or vice-versa.

For example, I recommended Worm to my step-brother. I thought he'd love it. He did... until he reached the interlude with the Travelers backstory and stopped reading. He said the interlude was just so frustrating to get through that he'd rather not finish Worm.

I don't grok that. It's just outside my mental model of what a reasonable person's response would be. Like, I understand that he just doesn't enjoy the interlude's characters or plot, that's fine. I enjoyed that interlude myself, but I can see why it would be annoying to someone who just wants to get back to the main story. But to dislike it so much that he'd rather just stop reading than even just skip it, despite my assurances that he can without ruining the rest of the story?

I just don't get that. I updated my model of him accordingly upon finding that out, but the existence of such bizarre (to me) perspectives makes it hard for me to critique my own story from readers-like-his perspective. Am I writing interludes so offputting that some people are just going to stop reading? I hope not, but my step-brother is a live example that this is the way some people work, and I don't understand why enough to stop my own story from hitting those same problems, other than "don't make them too long." My interludes are just a chapter long, so hopefully that's not too bad, but it's still a worry of mine.

I think getting better at critiquing your own work comes from receiving lots of detailed critiques from individuals and keeping each in mind as a lens through which to critique your future work. Blending common feedback together from anonymous readers is useful too for sure, but that's not as dynamic.
