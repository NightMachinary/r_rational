Work has officially begun on my boat.

Whoever last worked on it did a pretty bad job. There are holes in the roof that aren't seeled well enough, and that's letting water in between the fiberglass layers.

I'd like to document the process. I like tumblr, because of its "ask" feature. But there's so much else I dislike about it. Basically every way they do things rubs me the wrong way.

I guess I have 3 options

- Create my own blog platform

- Use my old wordpress blog (traverseda.wordpress.com)

- Use tumblr

Ultimately my goal is to build a record showing that I'm experienced with this kind of thing. In the longer term, I'd like to help people move onto boats, which should be a lot more practical with oneweb.

Boats are a good way to experiment with alternative economies/governance. A lot of the technology developed should help with colonizing less hospitable environments. Like space, and deserts, and earth is some of the pretty-bad predictions about global warming are true.
