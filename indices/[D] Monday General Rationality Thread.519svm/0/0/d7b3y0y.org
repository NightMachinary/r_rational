I feel like the mad scientists don't belong in quotes. Sure it's a bad name for it, but this is seriously something that should be scary. Something I've thought about a lot recently is that there's kind of a built in assumption about the way a lot of us think about the future that the power to prevent destruction (the powers of stability) will at a minimum of scale as fast as the power to do harm. The problem is that I can think of nothing that actually means this has to be true.

For example imagine tomorrow we discover a way to using only transistors, capacitors, etc and household AC to produce anti-mater in meaningful amounts also imagine we have some way to contain it. Obviously none of this has happened or will happen but ignoring physics there's no reason it couldn't happen and something like it certainly could.

What would this discover do to the world? I'd posit humanity would be pretty much gone within 10 years. Luckily anti-mater isn't and can't be that easy to make or contain, but what if it becomes that easy to make a super virus? What if it becomes that easy to build von neumann machine? I'm kind of scared to think that we might live in a world where anyone of moderate wealth can build something with a level of destructive potential inline with a nuke. The world is already getting cheaper and cheaper to destroy. It took the US an insane amount of resources to figure out how to build a nuke. Now regardless of politics it looks like Iran could have made one on a fraction of the budget.

What do we do when the budget needed gets down about 100k?
