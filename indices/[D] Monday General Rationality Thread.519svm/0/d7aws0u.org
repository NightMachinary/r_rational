There is some potential for crazy shenanigans on the horizon.

You can buy a home CRISPR kit now: [[http://www.the-odin.com/diy-yeast-crispr-kit/]]

And there is a 3D printing "open source laboratory equipment" movement building to help supply 3rd world hospitals: [[http://www.appropedia.org/Open-source_Lab]]

At some point in the near future (5 years?) it will be pretty feasible to set up your own private lab with an expensive 3d printer and use easily acquirable reagents like from Sigma-Aldrich or similar to essentially conduct your own biotech experiments or replicate those recorded in the literature/patents.

I have no idea how this will be regulated but hopefully someone smarter than me has already thought of this because there would be some risk for exponential harm to ecology if, for example, someone uses documented methods to reproduce a GM crop without putting in terminator genes to sterilise the seeds. You could have super competitive, insect and pesticide resistant crops let loose to outgrow anything else, potentially hybridising those traits with other species of plants once in the wild and irreversibly changing the world we live in.

Someone is going to try using CRISPR or similar on themselves. Try to change their eye colour or something.

I predict many scary stories of "mad scientists up to no good in their basements" in the media sometime soon.

Edit: now with fewer superlatives.
