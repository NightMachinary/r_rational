This is a VERY ambitious project, and, to be honest, I don't think your writing skills are quite up to it. Ignoring minor spelling and grammar issues, your characters don't sound like their anime counterparts (Gendo should never use exclamation points except when he is barking orders), the descriptions are plain, and the rationalist themes could use development.

That said, I think you have potential. If you keep practicing, I wouldn't be surprised if you reread this story in 5 years or so, cringe, and decide to rewrite the whole thing into a form that does the concept justice. If you ever do that, though, please keep the original up; a lot of fanfic writers like to replace their originals when they do this, and it annoys the archivist in me to no end.
