Not my story, yes this is another Evangelion fanfiction, but this Shinji Ikari is less like the ones in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3946501/1/Thousand-Shinji]] or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3886999/1/Shinji-and-Warhammer40k]] and more like HJPEV from methods of rationality. A word of warning though, if you cannot stand HJPEV's constant disrespect of Authority, this story is even worse. That being said this Shinji Ikari is faster at gathering allies and political power than HJPEV. In general it feels like the whole world is taking the angel's threat seriously, so it's not just one character getting buffed and causing cascade of events. This Gendo Ikari does not put on a white hat, but he is the most understandable version of a ruthless manipulative zealot doing everything he can to save the world.
