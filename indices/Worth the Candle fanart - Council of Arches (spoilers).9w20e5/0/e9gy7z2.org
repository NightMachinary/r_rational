- there's so little fanart of worth the candle!! I had to rectify this
- the backpack is anachronistic, since Bethel is in the background, but I thought it represented Amaryllis the best. You can always just pretend it's another backpack.
- similarly, I don't think bethel ever set up in the bottle with the doe, but there's no reason she couldn't (I think)
- spoilers latest update yeah, so I don't have raven, who only became confirmed companion this last update, but in fairness, she shouldn't be in the same as scene as fenn
- I wasn't sure if solace still has her cloak and staff, but they were fun to draw
- the doe is irritating juniper, as always
