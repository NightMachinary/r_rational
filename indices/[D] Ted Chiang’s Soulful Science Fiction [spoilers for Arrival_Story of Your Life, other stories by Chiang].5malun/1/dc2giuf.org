I've been a fan of Villenevue for a while but haven't been able to watch arrival where I am, so I decided to check out Ted Chiang, and glad I did... though I guess it might make the movie a little less fresh, his other stories are more than enough compensation. Especially division by zero, great job of interweaving emotional content and an exciting mathematical notion. Glad to see him get mainstream exposure.
