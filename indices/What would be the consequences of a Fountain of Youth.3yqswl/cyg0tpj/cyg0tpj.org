Don't forget "figure out how it works and see if you can reproduce it". You'll have alchemists, philosophers, hedge-witches and barber-surgeons and all manner of people trying to find a way to duplicate the effect.

Speaking of reproducing, a better way to nerf it is that it renders you sterile. That cuts down the "immortals population explosion" problem as well as providing a disincentive to using it.
