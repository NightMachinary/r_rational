Eh, I think an immortal ruling elite would actually be pretty effective at governing. The first few hundred years would suck, but eventually they realize their primary goal is stability (to make sure they don't get killed) then maximizing hedons (which more advanced societies are better at.) Anyone they didn't like would be screwed, but statistically speaking we'd be pretty well off, because if the ruling elite is incompetent... well, they're still vulnerable to regular weaponry, disease, and unfortunate toilet-related accidents. Democracy is the greatest achievable form of governing, but an immortal plato-style philosopher king would be pretty swell, if we don't have to worry much about succession.

tl;dr: a fountain of youth would probably lead to magic pony land.
