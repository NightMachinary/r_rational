  My first thought on seeing the title was, oh boy, just what we need: immortal ruling elite. Because that's almost certainly the outcome: those who discover the fountain (assuming they are intelligent and not moral saints) will keep it secret, building up their power. Any sufficiently advanced technology (or magic) inevitably either finds its way into the hands of the ruling elite, or makes those who possess it into the ruling elite.

Interesting. What, do you think, makes some resources into Secret Treasures of the Ruling Elite, and others into market commodities?
