  Were you serious about the last sentence?

Um, I dont know. I was think it might throw a spanner in the works of the obvious immortal warrior elite answer, instead maybe then it would mainly be used by warriors, knights, and Kings to keep their wives, and concubines young and hot, only used by themselves as last resort if you are really sick or old. I wonder what the percentage of men who would rather get old and die would be. I wonder how much authority an early medieval warrior king would retain if became a woman, if all the elders are women I suppose it would eventually create some kind of matriarchy. Then I changed my mind and edited, then you finished typing your reply, consider it an optional scenario to ponder.

I think it would be hard to keep secret, without any unwanted side effects almost everyone in the discovering party would want a sip, and want to take some back for their relatives and friends, a chief saying "Now, now this is only for a select few in moderation", while a fountain is gushing behind him might be a hard sell. How do you become an "immortal ruling elite" without people noticing you are not aging over time anyway?
