I think that having a random person's body change sex may not imply the same dysphoria, on average, as a trans person. There's a selection bias here - the people who decide to transition don't just have brains that make a different gender from what they were assigned be better from them, they feel enough pain to overcome the perceived risk from societal transphobia, discrimination, etc. So only the ones that are mismatched by the largest distance identify as trans, and transition. The recent LessWrong survey for instance showed that using the Bem Sex Role index, trans women are more mentally feminine and less masculine on average than cis women, which supports this hypothesis - only the most feminine ones identify as trans and decide that it's worth the risks (which are inflated, IME, especially if you transition young).
