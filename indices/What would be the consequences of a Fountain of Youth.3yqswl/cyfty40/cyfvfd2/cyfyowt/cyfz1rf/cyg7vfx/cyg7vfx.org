The last part is obvious. Way more rigid gender roles. In a present day setting, people with low attachment to their gender identity would perhaps be fine. It's really difficult to tell if the "cis-by-default" theorem is correct, but even if it is, and the numbers from the less wrong survey are correct and half of the entire modern elderly population would respond to a magic gender change + renewed youth with "Score!... Wait, Drat, none of my clothes fit, eh, well, time to go shopping" that would be in a context where people don't treat women as chattel.
