I think some of them would. Suicide rates among transgender people are significantly higher than in the general population and you'd effectively be turning almost all the men who went through it transgendered. The big questions are how different they'd be from the normal transgendered population that we have now, and whether people would be able to see gender dysphoria as a negative consequence ahead of time (since it's entirely possible that they would think it's a sweet deal and only be affected after the fact).

I personally think it would be way worse to be transgender in medieval times than in the present day.
