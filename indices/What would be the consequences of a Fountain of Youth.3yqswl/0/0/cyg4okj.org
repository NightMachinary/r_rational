  "And yet, for anybody to leave the machine unexploited is implausible. We spin more numbers and simulations and we see the machine being reverse-engineered, and the principles it applies being adapted for purposes other than the immediate, perfect restoration of living and dead humans. Mr Grey, you've seen how easy it is to heal. Can you imagine how easy it'll become to kill? [...] Death surrounds this machine, like a curse."

This is the argument against /any/ technological or scientific advancement. In this case what he's really saying is "We don't want humans as a whole learning what we know". He's saying "We like being the only immortals around". He's saying "We're already in the /'Medical technology is deliberately stalled and never reaches the pinnacle it should.'/" scenario. He's saying "We're not going to let you mere mortals /discover/ this either."
