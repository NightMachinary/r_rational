When I first posted the last sentence was a bit odly worded I then edited it thinking no one had seen it yet but then found out there was already a reply. But even if it is only if you continue to consume after you have been rejuvenated to 10, if each does rejuvenates you a decade and most people would want to stay in their 20's then it only takes a few serious injuries or diseases in a row that treating them turns you into a 10 year old girl. Which could be fairly common in the medieval world. Turning people into 10 year girls could be a way to make freshly captured POWs and slaves easier to control.
