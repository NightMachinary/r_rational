An interesting question, but ultimately, I think it's just a matter of scale. All advanced technology will invariably be put to use by those wealthy enough to afford it. Some technologies offer only a meagre advantage over those who do not have it: an iPhone, for example, provides comparatively little advantage over a much cheaper Nokia. This is simply a commodity, in my opinion.

But a rare technology that confers a massive advantage over others would be more like a Secret Treasure. Nuclear bombs, for example, are very rare (comparatively) and are something that any nation without would suffer for, and be at a distinct disadvantage.

This is just off the top of my head, so the examples probably aren't great and the underlying idea might be wrong.
