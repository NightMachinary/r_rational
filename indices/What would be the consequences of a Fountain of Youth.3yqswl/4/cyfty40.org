Were you serious about the last sentence?

My first thought on seeing the title was, oh boy, just what we need: /immortal/ ruling elite. Because that's almost certainly the outcome: those who discover the fountain (assuming they are intelligent and not moral saints) will keep it secret, building up their power. Any sufficiently advanced technology (or magic) inevitably either finds its way into the hands of the ruling elite, or makes those who possess it /into/ the ruling elite.

If the discoverers did foolishly brag about it (or, more understandably, use it to keep all their friends young, thus tipping their hands) then a massive war would break out over such a resource. Eventually, it would come into the hands of a country, and who would control it? The ruling elite, of course. I'm going to say that as much as I can, apparently. But now they would have to at least make some show of sharing it or doling it out. But if the fountain is finite or replenishes slowly, then again we will see it concentrated among the rich and powerful. If not, whatever country controls the fountain will become a superpower within a generation, as they will have a workforce and military that never ages and is constantly in their prime.

Now assuming you were serious about the last line, that's harder to speak to. Quite likely, if the Fountain were restricted to a bare few, the society that controlled it would become matrilineal, with women dominating positions of power (whether by birth or by Fountain). If unrestricted, the country would likely face serious issues as birth rates would drop drastically: I imagine many men would be willing to become women to stave off death. This might increase societal acceptance of LGBT groups (would be a dream come true for MtF transsexuals).
