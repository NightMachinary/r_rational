A large part of the biology can be redirected and transformed simply through hormone replacement. If intervention occurs before puberty, even just puberty postponement like androgen blockers (speaking for MTFs), almost all of the noticeable characteristics, body hair, voice and throat, skeletal and facial structure, bust, can be made entirely feminine.

After puberty, it gets harder to intervene, but masculization still increases as you get older and older, which is why you have 40/50+yo transitioners that don't look so hot. There are generally two spikes in a trans person's life that they are likely to decide to transition, around young adulthood and around middle-age. Self-suppression, which is particularly exacerbated by culture, leads to denial of the condition around the first spike and delays recognition to the second spike or indefinitely, assuming they don't commit suicide in the interim.

Harassment and violence are culturally-inspired reactions to trans people transitioning. Trans people are at risk for domestic abuse, sexual violence, drug abuse, poverty, sexually transmitted diseases, and suicide. These are cultural problems; transitioning is the /only way/ trans people are able to alleviate gender dysphoria. "True gender" has nothing to do with these issues, this is a problem of suffering and death.
