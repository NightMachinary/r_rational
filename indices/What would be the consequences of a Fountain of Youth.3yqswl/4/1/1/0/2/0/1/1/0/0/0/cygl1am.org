  I've said that to make my point that these surgeries DO NOT change gender.

There's a useful difference between genetic sex, anatomical primary and secondary sex characteristics, and psychological gender. The difference between the first and second (and the second's complexification itself) is due to intersex conditions. The difference between the second and third is due to transgender conditions. In other words, gender is a differentiable concept /because of/ transgenderism (and gender apathy vs strong cisgenderism).

Transition is an attempt to reduce gender dysphoria via various medical and social interventions, most of which focus on primary and secondary sex characteristics. It is not gender that is changed, it is not genetic sex that is changed. Transition is a long process, but 'passing' is possible, and becomes more likely the younger the intervention starts. There are rampant selection biases present when casually evaluating P(passing | trans), as trans people that pass are not /apparently/ trans.

  But I think person after surgery would be more likely to being suicidal than non-transgender person.

Yes, which is what the study said. It is, however, incredibly useless when evaluating the expected QALY effect of SRS. Non-trans people are not going to get SRS. To evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention, you have to contrast to trans people who did not get the operation over the same period of time, yet are still seeking transition.
