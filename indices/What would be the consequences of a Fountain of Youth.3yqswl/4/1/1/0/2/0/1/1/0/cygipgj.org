/...Who gives a flying fuck about genotype?!/ I consider you a troll for that alone!

Are you seriously saying that transition increases suicides? It doesn't. /Being trans/ increases suicides, and believe me, it's not something you can change with any known techniques. Don't point me to that fucking Swedish study, they used the non-transgender population as a control group instead of the non-op trans population. That study in fact says nothing about the intervention effectiveness of SRS.
