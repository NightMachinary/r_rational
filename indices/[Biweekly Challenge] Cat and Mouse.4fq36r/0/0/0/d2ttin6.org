I'm glad that came across. Rats lack a lot of concepts that humans take for granted, and I tried to capture some of the difficulty they would have in interpreting our behaviour.

The chief difficulty in their reasoning is that the humans are acting indirectly. It's not about predation or dominance, and the food they're eating isn't even kept in the human's nest.

Nili potentially could have figured it out (separating "nest" from "food storage") but decided it didn't matter.
