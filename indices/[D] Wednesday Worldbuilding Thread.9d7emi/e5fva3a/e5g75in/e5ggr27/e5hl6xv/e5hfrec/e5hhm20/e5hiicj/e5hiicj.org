Hmmm... considering it further, you don't even need HEX (or other fantasy computers) to show this inversion. Humanity does it already - we are both our corporeal bodies and our conceptual minds. Any physical thing that thinks, or does something like thinking, is a mix of both sides.

(Ghosts, on the other hand, are pure Conceptual).
