I don't think, Pakistan is a Islamic country so most of the pagan beliefs have been forgotten or abandoned and replaced with the Islamic ones, and there's just the Djinn vs humans I guess, it is said that djinns live alongside us on earth but they are invisible, there are some beliefs that say that every person has an djinn counterpart.
