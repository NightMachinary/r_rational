So I found a quote from Tim Minchin's Storm "Throughout history, every mystery ever solved has turned out to be not magic." This got me thinking, what if this wasn't the case. What effect would that have on the development of science. So what if some important part of the world was explicitly magic, and the world was indeed created by magic. However ordinary physics does work normally. Also, I need to add that while it is perfectly reasonable to say try to figure out magic, this is in setting difficult for the reasons that the magic has gone away as history progressed by which I mean the ability to make new enchanted objects, but old one continued working. I personally think this would effect things on the basis the concept of a universal law would be harder to come up with as some objects clearly get an out. Also, why make up naturalism if it plainly doesn't work?
