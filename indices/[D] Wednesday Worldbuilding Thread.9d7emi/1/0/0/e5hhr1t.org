That's an interesting approach! I reckon it's an unexpected but believable explanation should I need one, but I'm struggling to think of anything narratively interesting to do with it. Conflicts like wanting to illuminate or change people's perception to better utilize the magic, perhaps, but feels a little predictable.

Any ideas?
