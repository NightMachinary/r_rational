You could look at neurological sensory antagonism. Like how human color photoreceptors encode and deliver color-data as levels of "red vs. green" and "blue vs. yellow." We perceive those as primitive axes to split the world along, only because our brains have been built to measure the two quantities against one-another. It's similar to, but distinct from, the idea of [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/yFDKvfN6D87Tf5J9f/neural-categories][neural categories]].

(Anyone know of other features the brain perceives using this kind of antagonized measurement?)

I feel like you could totally world-build a setting where the categorical duals in the world are inferred from the antagonized features embedded in the neurology of the magical sentients perceiving the world, rather than the other way around.
