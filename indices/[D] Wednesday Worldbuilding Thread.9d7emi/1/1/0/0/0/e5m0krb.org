Those are great examples, and I'm glad there's still some familiar crossover even with modern Pakistan folklore. I mentioned ancient Persia as a source of inspiration in my original post, but I really meant the three early cradles of civilisation. Primarily Mesopotamia, but also Egypt and Indus Valley, which includes ancient Pakistan. There's a lot of crossover as far as east Asia and Africa anyway, pretty sure the Phoenix is related to the Simurgh, like the Lamassu is related to the Sphinx.

Anyway, are there any other similar duality concepts from Pakistan that you're familiar with?
