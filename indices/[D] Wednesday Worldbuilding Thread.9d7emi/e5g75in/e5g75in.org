Building a fantasy setting for a game with themes of duality, so I'm trying to collect interesting dualities that compose the world. It's an invented world, but imagine Persian mythology for flavor.

For a simple example, entities might be composed of two elements to produce a combined effect. Earth + water = clay = golem. Air, fire, smoke, djinn. Etc. (More than two is allowed, just needs to be a balanced split, 2, 4, 8, because fractals or something).

A more interesting example would be Sun and Moon magic opposing each other by being concerned with tangible things (because daylight = visible) and conceptual things (night = imagination) respectively.

That fusion/fission, aligned/opposed, etc/etc duality is what I'm playing with. Can you think of more interesting examples, fitting the theme? Any examples of other worlds built on duality being fundamental to the universe?

The next step for me would be connecting these ideas into something more unified, like life/death and sun/moon being different expressions of the same meta-duality. But I don't think I have enough information to work with yet.
