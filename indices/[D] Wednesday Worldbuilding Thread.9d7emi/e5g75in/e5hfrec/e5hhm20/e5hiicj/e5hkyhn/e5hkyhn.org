This is definitely something I want to play with as a principle in the setting. Toying with the idea of fission and fusion of the fundamental duality of the self. It occurred to me that we have this duality IRL now, where people draw a line between their minds/spirits and their bodies, in so many different ways. Exploring this is meant to be an undercurrent, as far as storytelling goes, at least until the climax.
