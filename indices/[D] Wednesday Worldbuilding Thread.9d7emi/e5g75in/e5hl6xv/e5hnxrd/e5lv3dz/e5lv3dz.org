The concept of yin and yang runs very deep in Chinese culture, in mythology you have the Dragon and Phoenix both embody yin and yang but they harness the opposite types of energy, the Phoenix, a yin symbol, is made of flames, while the Dragon, embodiment of yang, harnesses yin energy and creates rain. The soul of a person is yin while the body is yang. There's also food, which can be divided as yin and yang, or hot and cold, not the temperature but in terms of your body, for example if it's hot outside you would eat foods that are yin/cold, or if you have fever you eat yin food. Eating too much of one type of food is not considered good as it can create imbalance in your body and you may get sick. This hot/cold food is not just limited to China but Japan, India, Pakistan (where I'm from, and I hear my mom always talking about this)etc.
