And I'd add a 6th category: Point of Divergence, which is similar to Type 2, where you pick a single point (non-backstory; mid-stream) where you think the canon story went off the rational rails, and pick up telling the tale from that point on, but taking a rational path instead. Bonus points if that's the only arbitrary change you make to canon, and unless a further change follows logically from the initial point of divergence, canon holds.
