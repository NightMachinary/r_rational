Well in that case, my general case suggestion would be utterly unhelpful to your specific project, but here it is anyway in case its useful to someone else or helps you in spite of my expectation:

Don't plan ahead TOO far at first, and don't get too attached to any one plotline idea. In the case of fanfiction where you're changing a character or premise in cases 1, 2, or 4, remember that the butterfly effect is a thing.

To continue your HPMOR example, if I were going to write a fanfiction rationalizing the HP world (I actually am, but it's from the point of view of a self insert that got eaten by the Diary Horcrux and so thinks of himself as a 16 year old tom riddle. He finds having some of the memories of 'a time travelling muggle that read Harry Potter's Memoirs' to be confusing... but I digress) But anyway, I would try writing it as a series of "What does X do in situation Y? What situation Z does that produce?" repeat for each character and then start again to handle the newly minted situation Zs. Do that until story reaches the end. Sometimes you'll find that if you can get your characters to feel like people... they really almost write the story for you by themselves.

I would also try to sort the stations of canon out into things that happened for local reasons that your changes will impact and things that happened for reasons outside of the area. As an example: My one altered character, and his butterflies, will not likely derail the Year 4 tournament that most likely involved a lot of international politics over a few years to make happen. OTOH, if my character interacts with Dumbledore a lot, the SPECIFIC tasks might get changed if I cause him to miss a meeting where he was involved in the decisions.

If you're trying to follow the plotline of a video game start to finish I don't know if that helps.
