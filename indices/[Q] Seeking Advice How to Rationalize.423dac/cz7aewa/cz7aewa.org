So you've decided that your favorite piece of multimedia needs its own rational fanfic, and you're just the person to do it. It's chock full of opportunities to poke fun at the source material, and has the potential to be even more awesomely epic if you can just smooth a few of the rough edges.

To do that smoothing, I've noticed a few different techniques being used:

1) The Self-Insert. Create a new character or convert an existing one to be Dangerously Genre Savvy, while leaving all other aspects of the source work intact. The new/converted character will happily point out all of the absurdities of the setting while finding the easy solutions to season-long story arcs.

2) The Single Point of Departure. Take the canon backstory, with one or two small changes (optional), and then let the butterflies do their thing... even if it means that the "current events" are completely different from the source material. The source material ceases to be a useful reference for guessing what happens next, what happened five minutes ago... It's all up in the air.

3) The Repaired Backstory. (I can't think of a better title for this one) In this scenario, the starting conditions of a story are altered in such a way that the "current events" of the source material happen for good reasons rather than because plot dictated they should. As the story progresses, things can veer off course again. Unless the "current event" that the plot was repaired towards turns out to be the ending.

4) For Want of a Shark Tank. You know how your favorite story was going great until the author(s) decided to make something really stupid happen because The Plot Demanded It? In this case, you simply ignore it. Pretend it never happened. Just ignore the source material entirely and do your own thing because the source material just can't be fixed.

I will refer you now to our* holy scripture and guiding light: HPMOR. It contained a mix of all these things. Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres is unquestionably a Type 1 fanfic device. While there are multiple points of departure, Type 2 follows from the altered intelligence of certain characters, and the prophecies followed by others. Yet, at the same time, these alterations were made in such a way that the canon starting point was intact, making it simultaneously Type 3. The story of the boy-who-lived is identical to canon, despite the altered facts, and all characters are in their proper starting positions. The cracks in the timeline don't become noticeable until after the first Defense class. And finally, there are some parts of the story (Goblet of Fire, anyone?) that are just discarded entirely, with maybe a lampshade or two hung up as a Take That.**

So when you're trying to reconcile all the various non-sensical parts of your favorite story, how do you decide between the tools available to you?
