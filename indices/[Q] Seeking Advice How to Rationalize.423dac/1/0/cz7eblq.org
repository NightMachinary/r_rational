I'd add a 5th category, the future problem fixer: In this type you leave all cannon as is and no events that take place in the story change, however you write about what would actually occur in the world after the events of the story( for example in the fic I'm working on that takes place in the Harry Potter universe the slytherins don't just move on with their lives after being locked in a dungeon while their parents are either killed or locked in Azkaban. )
