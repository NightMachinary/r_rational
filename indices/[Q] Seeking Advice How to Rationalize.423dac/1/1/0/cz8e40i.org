Both, actually. Twenty years ago, one of my first writing projects was a novelization of Final Fantasy 6. I stalled on the project about a quarter of the way through because while trying to fill in the internal monologues and third-person limited omniscient details, I noticed how many plot holes there were. But the desire never completely died away, and though I've written other things since then, it's been festering in the back of my mind this whole time.

I was going to ask here about things specific to Final Fantasy 6, but halfway through typing my initial post, I realized that:

1) I want to do the actual work of rationalizing it, as much as possible, and compiling crowd-sourced solutions wouldn't be all that rewarding.

2) I want advice slightly more specific to fanfiction than the short-answers on "How to Write Intelligent Characters". Something a bit more practical, but still not specific enough to violate Desire 1 above. And if I want it, others probably do as well. And if I tried to give my own example, it would run the risk of derailing the thread and accomplish neither goal.

I realize that the kind of advice I'm seeking will most likely fall under the category of "things you can only learn by repetition and repeated failure." I could figure it out for myself with enough work. However, I'm lazy, and if there's a chance I can skip some of the hard work by asking the internet for advice, I'll try it.
