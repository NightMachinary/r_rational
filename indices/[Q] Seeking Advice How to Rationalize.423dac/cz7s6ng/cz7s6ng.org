Two things to keep in mind:

-you know how you sat down for a few hours, thinking of ways to fix a character's situation? You have to assume that every rational person has done that for years on end with only their own interests in mind. Any solutions you devise have already been brought up, discussed, discarded or well underway by the time the story starts. There's no such thing as a blank slate character.

-what makes characters interesting is their flaws, their dishonest intents, their choice of wrong decisions for personal reasons. Too often, rational makeovers crush every trait of suboptimal personality out of the main characted, turning them into blank-faced problem solving machines. Don't fall into that trap.
