You ought to keep the world recognizable. How much you can still change and still have that be the case really depends on what your fictional universe looks like and will vary from fandom to fandom. If I'm writing a Where's Waldo fanfic, and I decide that it's stupid that Waldo always wears red and white, then I also start changing his (canonically very thin) personality, eventually I'm just left with a guy wandering between worlds who might as well not be Waldo. You /can/ do this sort of total character replacement, but then that means you have to ground your fic to the fictional world in some other way.

You ought to keep the things that are cool. Making a fantastical world mundane is easy, but usually not that satisfying. You can take /Star Wars/ and say that lightsabers are impractical or the Death Star is a dumb idea that should never have been made, but if you take those things out you're removing something cool. If you do that, you had better have something to replace it with. Most of the time, it's better to leave the cool stuff around.

With those two things in mind, I usually keep to canon as much as possible, mostly because it keeps the new world grounded in the fictional world. It's almost always better to justify things somehow than to just strip them out entirely. As a bonus, most fandoms will have already done the hard work for you in the form of fanwank. The only place where you really need to worry is when there's something that throws the whole story on its head, something wildly inconsistent, or when you want to explore some aspect that fanwank is trying to patch over.
