  The only place where you really need to worry is when there's something that throws the whole story on its head, something wildly inconsistent, or when you want to explore some aspect that fanwank is trying to patch over.

The first of these I think is the most common major issues. In my story's canon universe, Pokeballs are so arbitrarily powerful that the temptation to include more features and failsafes and capabilities than those included in the games/anime, like wireless data backup and automatic registry, have to be resisted. Since I need to draw the line of how powerful they are somewhere, I'm trying to stick to the games' capabilities as much as possible, and even come up with various miscellaneous restrictions (battery life, mass limits, "lock on" requirement) to explain why people in the games and anime don't, for example, fly over wild pokemon dropping pokeballs on them until they're caught.

Otherwise, taken at face value with how they seem to work in canon, the munchkinry would be so powerful and so obvious that the only explanation for why people in the games and anime don't use them that way and are still smart enough to tie their shoelaces in the morning is that pokeballs can't be used that way, and it's just up to our imagination, or in this case mine, to come up with restrictions why they don't. To try to balance that out, I also added some power to them in the form of once the pokemon is inside, it's caught, period: there's nothing sentient left inside it to "fight" its way out, so it's a more rational take on the issue in any case.
