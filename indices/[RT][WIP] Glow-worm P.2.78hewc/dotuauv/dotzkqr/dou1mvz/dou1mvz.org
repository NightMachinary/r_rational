Unofficially, if the work has its own, active subreddit where most of the discussion on the work takes place, I would rather that it didn't get posted more than once an arc, mostly because it seems pointless to divide up discussion unless there's an expectation that discussion will be different between subreddits. This is sort of a "who is this for" test that I think about for all posts, which is my own personal opinion for when/why people should post things.

(The argument about submission volume sort of falls flat for me, because it could be the case that Worm 2 would take up a fair fraction of the front page of the subreddit. This is already the case for a few other serials, which I consider (non-mod hat) problematic.)

Also, I should mention that we have a worm channel on the Discord if you do want to talk to other people about worm, though I know synchronous communication is not everyone's cup of tea.
