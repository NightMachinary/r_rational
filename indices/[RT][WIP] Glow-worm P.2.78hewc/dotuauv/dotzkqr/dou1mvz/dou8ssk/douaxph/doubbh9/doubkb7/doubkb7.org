It's a chat program/platform. It's actually super slick, it's almost a halfway point between IRC and a forum; the chat history goes back as far as you can scroll, includes decent voice chat and recently video chat, and a bunch of subreddits have set up their own servers, [[https://discord.gg/5sutD3W][including us here at /r/rational]]. In particular the thing that attracts me the most to it is that your IP is not exposed to other parties, unlike Skype and some others, so there's a certain amount of privacy.

Try it out in the browser at that link, and if you like it, sign up and download the mobile app/executable of your choice.
