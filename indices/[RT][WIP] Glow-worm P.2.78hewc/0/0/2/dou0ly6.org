I don't think that's necessarily equivalent---Practical Guide doesn't have its own sub, to the best of my knowledge, so this is the best place to discuss each chapter as it comes out. But if someone on here wants to discuss each chapter of Worm 2 as it comes out, chances are they're already doing so on [[/r/parahumans][r/parahumans]].
