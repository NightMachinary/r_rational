Two possibilities:

1. Original character that hasn't been introduced yet. I seem to recall Velorien stating as much at one point, but I could easily be imagining that.

2. [[http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Raijin][Anime-original character Raijin.]] Velorien does watch the anime rather than read the manga, so this is a possibility, but... not a very likely one.

Either way, you aren't supposed to know who it is when Naruto mentions him.
