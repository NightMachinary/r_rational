He has an update on [[https://www.patreon.com/velorien][his Patreon page]] that's more recent, but not much more than the one on his fanfiction page; just that it's around 160,000 words long. That was the end of March and it hadn't gone out to his beta readers yet, so it's a decent assumption his beta readers would take a couple weeks to read it, then he would want to work on it a bit more, before putting it out. He did post the re-written prologue on his Patreon as well, though.
