He tried to constrain the safety of his command, instead of just asking the system what the command /would actually do/. He did something without knowing what would happen!

To clarify, my spoiler is what he /should/ have asked.

Things that also would have worked: "Are you aware of reasons why I wouldn't want to do this? List them to me, in order of descending importance."

[edit] "Do this for every command that hits this protection."
