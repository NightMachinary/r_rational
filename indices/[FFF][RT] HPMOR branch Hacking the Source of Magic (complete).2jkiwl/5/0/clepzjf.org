When Atlantis was unfallen, presumably the physical token was better secured.

Also, steelmanning Atlanteans, I'd predict that by default most of the functions could only be performed at a subset of the cores unless those cores were offline, and that those cores had increased protections against pastviewing. When only one of sixteen devices survives, you're not going to get optimal functioning.
