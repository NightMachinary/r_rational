Also, I want to give a shout-out to [[/u/DayStarEld]] here, for his great work on Pokemon: Origin of Species. I just did a pre-mortem with some friends yesterday, and other things have definitely worked it's way into my life, not to mention the fantastic story (still trying to figure out what angle Geo is taking in the background...)

It's these two stories I'm obsessively reading and looking forward to updates!

The only reason I haven't posted an encouragement thread for P:OoS is because you post on a monthly cycle and I can't influence you :D only 12 more days to go!!!
