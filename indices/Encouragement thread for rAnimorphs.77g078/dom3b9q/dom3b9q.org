I'm also a [[https://www.patreon.com/Sabien][patreon supporter]], and all the money is being used to set up a rationality boot-campfor middle schoolers (though I wouldn't care if [[/u/tk17studios]] was using it for gambling, he earned it afer all, but it's a pretty good cause!)

So yeah if you want to offer some monetary encouragement I'm sure it wouldn't hurt!

(but also, wow, it's an amazing story! I don't support much on things like patreon - I'm notoriously stingy - but The Reckoning is SO VERY AMAZING. I wish it wasn't animorphs fan fiction so that way it could get published "for real" and end up as a movie starring Matt Damon)
