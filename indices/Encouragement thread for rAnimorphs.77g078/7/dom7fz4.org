Animorphs was one of the first book series I ever got into way back in elementary school. It was one of the first examples young-me encountered of the power that fiction wields in exploring the human condition, and it had a big impact on the way I came to see and understand the world.

And now decades later, Animorphs: The Reckoning maintains that same spirit, only even better. I can't say enough good things about it.
