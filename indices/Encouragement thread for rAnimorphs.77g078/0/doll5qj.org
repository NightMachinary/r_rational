r! animorphs has replaced hpmor for me as my go-to good story to use against the "all fan fics are terrible" points people make. I love how alien you've made all the different species feel. And having read so many different books it's brilliant how unpredictable yet smart all you characters are. Chapter 20 was the first thing I've read in a very long time that's bought me to tears just by being such a beautiful moment. and i just want to thank you for having written it
