I have to second every nice things that's been said, and add that R!Animorphs would be my go-to example for "Rational fic that avoids the common sins of rational-fic"

There's no centralisation of competence into a single rational wunderkind, there's no lengthy durdle-diversions for the author to explain all the cool things they know, and there's certainly no sense that the protagonist is assured victory by virtue of how smart they are...

Instead you've got a crowd of high-competence allies and adversaries who pull no punches, a plot moving at a clip that almost risks going to the other extreme of happening quickly enough to leave me stumbling behind its pace (I should really re-read, or read slower... but at every point I urgently want to know what happens next) and every major encounter feels like it could be a total party wipe for the good guys (as it should be, when fighting an alien menace).
