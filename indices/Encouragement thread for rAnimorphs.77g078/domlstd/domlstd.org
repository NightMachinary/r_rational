Aw, shucks, you guys.

Update time, I guess: I've founded a group house called [[http://lesswrong.com/r/discussion/lw/p23/dragon_army_theory_charter_30min_read/][Dragon Army Barracks]], I've been off at a multi-week AI researcher training workshop for CFAR and have another one coming up around Halloween, I've been posting a new rationality post every day for the past 26 days on [[http://www.lesserwrong.com][LessWrong2.0]], and I got a grant to run my rationality bootcamp, which supplements the generosity from people like [[/u/MagicWeasel][u/MagicWeasel]].

So things have been busy. I've felt a little guilty every time I've thought of you guys waiting, but I've also felt a little guilty every time I picked up the r!Animorphs doc because there's /so much world to save./

That being said, I'm genuinely seriously f'real putting in a solid six-hour writing block this weekend, so maybe things will go well enough for an update this week?

I particularly know that I owe [[/u/CouteauBleu][u/CouteauBleu]] the updated interlude that he's been pulling for; he's been very patient.

But anyways, this was an extremely pleasant surprise for me today. All the warm-fuzzies. Thank you so much.
