Absolutely agree. As [[/u/the_real_twibib]] said, I find myself pointing fanfic doubters to r!animorphs these days more than HPMOR, simply because the beginning of HPMOR can turn a lot of people off while r!animorphs is far less "abrasive" and the writing and story /starts/ amazing rather than ramping up to amazing.
