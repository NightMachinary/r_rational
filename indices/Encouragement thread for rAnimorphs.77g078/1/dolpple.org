I just binge-read r!animorphs last week and I have to say I've barely thought about anything else since. It's obscenely good. I love how all the characters are believable and smart and different. I devoured all the reddit threads about each chapter. My favourite parts in no particular order:

-The characterization of the Yeerks, they're not just Evil For The Sake Of Being Evil

-Visser Three is completely insane, I love it

-The high level of competence displayed by non protagonist characters

-Individuals having different goals instead of just melding together with everyone else who's on their "side". In particular the way the war having slowly shifted from "defeat the Yeerks" to "defeat V3" was perfectly executed IMO

-The high level of technical competence in your writing

-Rachel's character in particular. She's just so well written

-Version control morphs. Fuck that's so cool

-The way that all the characters' voices sound in their heads, they have different flows and cadences, you can FEEL whose head you're inside

Please write more TK! I'm eagerly awaiting the conclusion of the story. In the meantime I guess I'll reread it.
