So I hit Chapter 40, and a Tzeentchian Chaos Sorcerer has just started acausally trading (ala Timeless Decision Theory/Basilisk) and blackmailing with the Eldar and a Necron who I assume is Orikan the Diviner. They are using pre-commitment and future sight in order to fight whole proxy wars on the future timelines. It's interesting, if alarming.
