So, basically, it's a story about technophobic retrogrades left behind by the ones that did go FOOM. I guess that explains it.

It just seems silly that they are still on modern real world human level intelligence. I could understand the adaptive use of different levels of processing power and differently optimised cognitive systems in post-singularity society, but staying a baseline human just seems comical.

Thanks for the reply, though. It clarified the situation a bit.
