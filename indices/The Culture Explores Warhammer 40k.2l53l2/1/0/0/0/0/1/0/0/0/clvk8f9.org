  I disagree. Examples?

The Minds are surprised way, way to often. Presumably, they experience surprise when some prediction they were fairly confident in turns out to have been wrong. And they are constantly surprised by things a human could have seen coming. Just one concrete example for now:

#+begin_quote
  We have informed the Orks on the world of this matter and advised them to move to a different planet, even offering transportation assistance. *Unexpectedly, the Orks instead appear to be preparing for battle.*
#+end_quote

This is after several weeks (if not months) of studying the society and culture of Orks. A random modern human could have predicted this with ease and the damn superintelligence is surprised!

There are many examples of the short-sightedness and bad planning from the Minds in this story. It's almost as if they are doing whatever pops into their minds at any moment without any coherent unifying vision or strategy in mind. I could supply some more examples, of course, though I don't see much point. Your reading may well be different from mine and I don't see any particular value in convincing you that the Minds are stupid in this fanfic. It may diminish your enjoyment of the story and this would be pointless and mean. I have nothing to gain from it.
