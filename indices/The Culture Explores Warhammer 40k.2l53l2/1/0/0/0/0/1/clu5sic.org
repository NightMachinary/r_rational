  first uplift the intelligence in question to your best capabilities (without Subliming), while preserving their values,

This is considered impossible. In-universe, a "Mind" is an entity capable of Subliming by itself. The Culture makes at least one Mind per ship, and of the Minds created, nearly all Sublime on the spot. All those who remain are in some way slightly deranged; it is believed that any psychologically stable entity capable of Subliming will inevitably do so.

And all Culture citizens can modify their own intelligence however they like; most choose to stay at the same level as the rest, but this, like most other self-modification consensuses in the Culture, has long-term fads, and it may go up and down from century to century.
