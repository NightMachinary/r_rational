I see. There should still be some level of intelligence above that of a human to which one can safely raise it, right? So you raise it to that level instead then.

My gripe is not that it's prohibited or impossible to enhance yourself, it is the fact that superintelligence is not the norm.

In this fanfic, in particular, everyone is somehow really stupid. We get a peek into the thought processes of the Minds and it's all standard human-level dumbassery in there. I won't even go into the minds of standard citizens, since it looks like they are supposed to be human-level for some reason. Whether this is a fault of this fanfic, or the Culture canon I don't know yet, but the enhanced intellect is not shown at all. We are told they are smart, but shown how they act in all the stupid ways one would expect superintelligence to avoid.

Seriously, they are capable of intergalactic travel, but the median (demonstrated) intelligence level in their society is that of a 20 century Earth human. Am I the only one, who is weirded out by that?
