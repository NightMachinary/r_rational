Well, if you are dealing with some kind of sigmoidal improvement, then, of course, sooner or later the diminishing returns will make the decision to invest in further improvement irrational as far as world optimisation goes, if you have any other values at all.

What you appear to be asking, is how much I value self-improvement and the answer is: I don't really know. I've struggled to formulate a coherent value system for myself for some time and so far I have not really achieved much success. It certainly has some inherent value for me, apart from serving as means to some other end, but would I destroy another civilization to continue to self-improve? Who knows. Would probably decide on a case by case basis by comparing utilities of the alternatives, I guess.
