I'd say that's pretty accurate. I remember reading that very little happens in the Culture itself, so most of the stories tend to focus on other civilizations and the Culture's dealings with them. The Contact section is where most of the interesting, explorer types of people end up anyways.

I guess it's a matter of opinion whether it's a trap or a voluntary stopping point. To me it's like a town built at the foot of a mountain; the Last Homely House for organic creatures. People are free to climb and risk the danger and glory of Sublimation but for most it's a pleasant enough place to live out their lives. There is still some development in the Culture (technology improves a bit over the course of the series) but I get the impression that it's about as advanced as a civilization can become while still supporting human-level citizens with meaningful agency (and in that sense about as advanced a civilization as an author can write without diving into the murky depths of transhuman main characters). Still, their society isn't above criticism, even in the books themselves.

I'm glad we had this discussion too. You raised some interesting points that I hadn't thought about before, so thank you for that.
