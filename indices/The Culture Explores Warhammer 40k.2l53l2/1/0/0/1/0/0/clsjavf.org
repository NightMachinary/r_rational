I kind of see the concern but I think you're overvaluing intelligence, treating it as an end in itself. The Culture is all about quality of life and personal freedom and raw intellect doesn't have much bearing on that. Arguably being a Mind is actually something of a burden because of the increased responsibility. In a society like ours we have all sorts of concerns like how to survive and grow and become successful and we need as much intelligence as we can get but the Culture has already solved most of these and the only real question left is how not to get bored.

As for uplifting humans: first of all, personal choice is a big part of Culture society so uplifting someone (at least a sentient being) without their permission is very poor form, even if you think you're doing them a favour. Unless they're a complete degenerate, any sort of mind alteration (and even probing, in most cases) is only done with consent. Also, I'm not sure the uplift you describe is even possible, any more than you could make a human brain out of an earthworm's while "preserving its values". The vast majority of the new brain would be something fabricated during the uplift process, and going back down to its original level would entail destroying a huge amount of (newly-created) personality. Still, humans always have the option of having their consciousness integrated into an existing Mind's and a lot of them have done just that (or transferred to artificial bodies, or moved into a virtual realm, or any number of other things. The stories just focus on people with human bodies and human capabilities.) Or you could just ask a Mind to lend you some perspective and enough processing power to understand Mind-level philosophy.

That said, why don't you just read the books? All this stuff is covered and I think your misunderstandings are a result of trying to comprehend the world solely through second-hand accounts. They're good books and any explanation I give you will be imperfect and filtered through my own opinion so if you're as interested as you seem to be, just get it from Banks himself.
