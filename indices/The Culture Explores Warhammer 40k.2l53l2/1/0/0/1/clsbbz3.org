Hmm, I think if you actually read the books (not fanfiction) you'll see that "technophobic" is the wrong way to describe them. The reason there's lots of real-world level humans (besides the fact that real-world level humans usually make for better stories) is that life is already good enough that any sort of personal upgrade won't make it any better. Their level of technology is so high that they just don't see any point in further advancement so a lot of the focus (of the society and of the novels) is on philosophy and ethics and social interaction and technology is just a facilitator. Their technology isn't unique or even the close to being the best in their universe but what sets them apart is the stability and longevity of their society.
