[[http://lesswrong.com/lw/qk/that_alien_message][Some say]], that a true super-intelligence would create general relativity solely from observing three frames of a video of an apple falling to the ground. I'm not entirely certain of that level of cognitive ability, but you've gotta admit, that handing their tech out to practically everyone they meet is a bit of a dumb move. Especially when they are somehow surprised someone tries to steal it later. I don't care how much hedonistic eudaimonia you cram in your space arcology, if the citizens are approximately as dumb as me, then something has gone terribly wrong in your utopia.
