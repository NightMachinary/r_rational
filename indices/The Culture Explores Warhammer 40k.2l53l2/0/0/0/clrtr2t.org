It's really more of a thought experiment than a story, but it's a fun one.

There's an assumption in the WH40K universe that a culture as utopian as the Culture could never arise- the universe is presumed to be so cruel that any civilization would be crushed into a state of dystopia. To me, a fully formed Culture struggling against that assumption is an interesting enough premise that it works even in the absence of actual characters or human drama, though I can see how some would feel differently.
