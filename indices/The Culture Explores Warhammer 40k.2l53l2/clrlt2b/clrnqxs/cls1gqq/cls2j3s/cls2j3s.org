The harry potter cross [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3983128/1/Culture-Shock][Culture Shock]] came closest to not sucking of the culture fanfic I've read.

Spoilers for the fic follow hereafter:

Problems with it:

- Diziet Sma feels a bit Mary-Sue-ish, as does Harry. Dumbledore got run over a bit in the fic.

- The story was just getting to interesting bits when it stopped updating. At this point, six years since the last update, it's probably deader than Iain Banks and is unlikely to ever be continued.

- The canon plot was about to get hit by a truck - at the end of the last posted bit, Minds were about to absorb all magical knowledge meaning they would be likely to be uber-Hermiones and get all the plot details that are in any magic (or other) textbooks and, and they were also Uber-Harrys and get all the plot details that can be heard by being invisible (or operating flea-sized surveillance drones) and also have infinite carrots (in terms of wealth and the like) and also have infinite sticks (in terms of military power). So any continuation of the plot would have to cope with the fact that any villains are about as badly overmatched as it's possible to be - and also the principal characters (Harry, Diziet, Dumbledore, et al) are basically irrelevant in comparison the the Culture's temporal power.

- Why did the Culture stopped surveilling the Earth apparently after finding Harry there and seeing the whole flying motorcycle thing? I would think there would be 10+ major ships around Earth pretty fast and for the duration "until they worked out what was going on down there".

Good bits:

- Harry felt genuinely different as raised by the Culture, and I liked the Diziet/Harry relationship in the fic - it generated and used characters I cared about well.

- Dumbledore's (and others') perplexity was hilarious at times

- Writing quality was reasonably high / technically proficient.

- I liked the Troll 'fight' scene (if one can call it that) a lot
