As someone familiar with both, I tried this a while back and gave up several chapters in - it wasn't compellingly written or interesting, I didn't care about any of the characters so it was really tough to care about anything that was happening. In Iain Banks' Culture books, I always cared about the main characters. Even if I did not agree with their goals, methods, etc - as in, for example Use of Weapons - I still felt they were fully realized characters and was interested in how their stories played out. In that portion of the Warhammer fiction that's I've read that is not terrible, the same has also been true. However, in what I read of this fic before giving up I didn't care about basically any of the characters at all so the fic as a whole failed to engage me.
