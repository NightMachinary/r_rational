I went into this with no prior knowledge about The Culture and some about the WH40K and so far it seems ok. Not terribly engaging, but a decent procrastination aid.

I have a question though. How come the citizens of the Culture are so dumb? What in-universe explanation is given for this? How have they managed to develop that level of technology when they constantly make blunders a modern human of average intelligence could avoid?

From what I read so far the Culture seems to be a bit of a dystopia in its own right. An eternity of wondering the stars with ships full of stagnant human level intellects enforcing moral preference of majority on anything in sight with magic tech. Quite chilling.

And no matter how much you capitalise the M in Mind, they do not display any cognitive heavy lifting in story. Some good processing power is shown, but they apparently have about the same level of cognitive ability as a human (so basically they are dumb really fast). This scale of intelligence thingy that pops up from time to time is confusing as well.

Should I even try reading the source material or am I just going to be pissed off at how nothing ever went FOOM, even though the tech is apparently there?
