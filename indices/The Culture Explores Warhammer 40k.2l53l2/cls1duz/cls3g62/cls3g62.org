  From what I read so far the Culture seems to be a bit of a dystopia in its own right. An eternity of wondering the stars with ships full of stagnant human level intellects enforcing moral preference of majority on anything in sight with magic tech. Quite chilling.

Life in the Culture isn't really touched on in this fanfic, but what makes it a utopia in the novels is the degree of personal freedom and the complete lack of scarcity. Some Culture ships are worlds in and of themselves, with billions of inhabitants and enough room for every single one to live in a mansion surrounded by gardens if they chose to. Since Minds are willing to do all the work, humans and drones can choose to either help out, spend all their time creating artwork, pursuing hobbies and games, and having passionate love affairs, or do useful things outside of the Culture, usually working with Contact or Special Circumstances.

They're hedonistic and not extremely ambitious, but not really stagnant either- the Culture produces a lot of lower-case 'c' culture, and while it's implied that their level of technology is nearly as advanced as it can get without them Subliming to another plane of existence, they do make technological advancements from time to time.

In general, the Culture actually doesn't force its morals on other civilizations unless it's threatened. It certainly doesn't have a Prime Directive, but it engages in ordinary diplomacy with less advanced civilizations, along with the occasional back-room deal or clever bit of political intrigue to stop a genocide or stall an atrocity. Of course, when directly threatened, it responds very aggressively.

In the novels, the intelligence of the Minds is shown by them doing things like having individual conversations with millions of people at once, pulling off complicated Xantos gambits and conspiracies, or being able to imagine things far outside the scope of human capabilities. Not seeing a whole lot of the clever plans in this fanfic, but then they are trying to puzzle out this universe without the benefit of a sourcebook.
