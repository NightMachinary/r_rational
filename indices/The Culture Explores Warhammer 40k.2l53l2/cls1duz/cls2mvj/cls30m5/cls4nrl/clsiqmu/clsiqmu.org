I can understand the reasons for avoiding this nebulous "Sublimation". But why not just self improve without subliming? What bugs me, is that the default setting for citizen intelligence is "human level" instead of something better. Supposedly they know how to reach higher, and yet they don't.

It's a tricky subject, but my position would be this: first uplift the intelligence in question to your best capabilities (without Subliming), while preserving their values, then let the newly enhanced individual work out their best course of action themselves. If they decide that they are better served by being as dumb as a human, they can self-modify accordingly. Just leaving them at the default level seems a bit cruel and callous. It's like leaving an addict to his own devices. Sure from his current point of view, he may not even want to be cured, but it's not like it would be impossible to go back if you magically cured him. It's pretty fucking tough to read about the enhanced individuals (Minds) lording it over the whole society of average humans without uplifting them.

Are the Minds in source material actually smart though? Or do they just have a bunch of processing power strapped to human-level cognitive processes? I've been going on the assumption that the Minds are in fact more intelligent, and not just faster.

  Also Culture biological citizens can enhance and change themselves however they want. I think genius level intellect is standard

Somehow missed this part of the post. Still, current human level of genius is a pretty low bar to aim for. Compared to what they could achieve it's like changing the setting from "monkey" to "smart monkey" on the scale of human intelligence, sure it's higher, but not at all a significant improvement. My point about going as smart as possible at least for once in their lives still stands, I think.

Wait, what about the rest of them? I hope this specifier is there because non-biological citizens self-modify as a matter of course, and not because only the biological ones are allowed to self-modify.
