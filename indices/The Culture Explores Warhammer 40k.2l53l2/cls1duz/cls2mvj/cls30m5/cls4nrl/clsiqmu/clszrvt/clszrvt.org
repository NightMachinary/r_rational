Even if you have no interest in the books, you might be well-served by reading the wiki page for [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Culture#Citizens][the Culture]]. It goes into some detail about what the Culture actually comprises.

Citizens (biological or artificial) are free to modify themselves pretty much as much as they want - but the Culture is hedonist, and so more intelligence is not really the be-all end-all of their lives.
