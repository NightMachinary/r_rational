  I see. There should still be some level of intelligence above that of a human to which one can safely raise it, right? So you raise it to that level instead then.

As I said:

  And all Culture citizens can modify their own intelligence however they like; most choose to stay at the same level as the rest, but this, like most other self-modification consensuses in the Culture, has long-term fads, and it may go up and down from century to century.

Banks clearly does not agree with EY's notion in Fun Theory that the amount of fun available increases proportional to intelligence, and the humanoids of the Culture are looking for fun, not effectiveness. Superintelligence to a level significantly below that of the Minds would not particularly help them achieve their goals.

  Whether this is a fault of this fanfic, or the Culture canon I don't know yet, but the enhanced intellect is not shown at all. We are told they are smart, but shown how they act in all the stupid ways one would expect superintelligence to avoid.

I disagree. Examples?
