So far my reading is that people in The Culture have fallen into a sort of a cultural trap, in that they came to greatly prefer exploitation to exploration as far as living satisfying lives goes. This has created a stagnant pleasure cruise like environment where social expectation prevents a vast majority of individuals from ever trying to reach beyond their familiar type of existence and even the few who somehow achieve a significantly enhanced level of intelligence spend their time babysitting the rest of the citizens and perpetuating the same stagnant society.

I think that the thing, that bugs me the most, is that The Culture has apparently reached the apex of its development. There is a sense that no more is to be gained and everything is as perfect as it will ever be already. An impression that, should you skip a hundred years and take a look at what has changed in The Culture, you'd find nothing of note. It would certainly be a nice place to live for a lazy gentleman like myself, but as far as civilisational dead ends go, it's pretty scary.

I shall see if my understanding of this culture changes after I have read the source. It's certainly intriguing enough.

Thank you for this discussion. It was very satisfying and I have enjoyed it.

  Anyways, if you do come across a well-written character of that sort I'd love to know.
