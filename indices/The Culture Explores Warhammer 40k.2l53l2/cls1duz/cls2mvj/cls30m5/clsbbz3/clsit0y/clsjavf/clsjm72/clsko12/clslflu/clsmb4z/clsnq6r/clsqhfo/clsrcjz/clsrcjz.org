  Would you prefer one that never reached the Culture's level but was constantly improving?

That's the thing though. If it's consistently improving, then it will surpass The Culture sooner or later and I would indeed prefer the non-stagnant one.

There is always something more to do in the universe to make it a better place (whatever "better" means in accordance with your values). If your civilisation is stagnating on pleasure cruise ships instead of plunging into a singularity with all their might, then, somewhere, the universe you could otherwise improve remains suboptimal. Be it children starving to death or stars burning valuable fuel to heat up dead rocks or some civilisation being insufferably happy and peaceful (if you happen to have values of a cartoon villain for some reason) there is something you could have changed if only your civilisation was still improving.

Stability is a surrender. It's a decision to leave the unknown children to starve, when you could have done more.
