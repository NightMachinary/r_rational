  I think it should be answered by the most capable mind that has an optimal representation of the subject's values as opposed to the default intelligence the subject has at the moment.

A reasonable viewpoint, and the only thing I would say is that I don't think it's necessary for a Culture citizen to uplift themselves in order to do this; they can just plug themselves into a Mind and have the Mind do all the relevant simulations and whatnot while showing you the results. I suppose it requires you to trust the Mind in question, but I think a massive uplift presents its own dangers, like the newly created Mind developing a sudden case of self-preservation and refusing to go back to human form even if objectively the human (and everyone else) was better off that way, or a human with dangerous personality traits that are magnified by the transition.

  I think the first one is a bit more polite, but it's not really a deal-breaker in my mind.

/shrug/

Incompatible philosophies, I suppose. The Culture regards the freedom to choose very highly and so everyone has the right to make stupid decisions (as long as no one is hurt). I will point out, though, that there's no rush to make a decision when it comes to an uplift because you can quite happily exist indefinitely as a Culture human until you decide it's time for a change. Spending a few extra decades as a human when your true calling was Mindhood is no big deal when you're functionally immortal.

  I think it's human-understandable values all the way up.

Well, I can't refute this since we have no evidence but my gut feeling is that there value systems that are simply incomprehensible to humans. And I'm not sure direct extrapolation would make for a very good result because if you create, say, an adult with the values and morals of a baby you end up with a pretty poor excuse for an adult...

Anyways, if you do come across a well-written character of that sort I'd love to know.
