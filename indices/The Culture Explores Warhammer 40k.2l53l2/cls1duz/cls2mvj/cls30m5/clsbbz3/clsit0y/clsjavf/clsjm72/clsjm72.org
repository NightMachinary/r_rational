  I think you're overvaluing intelligence, treating it as an end in itself.
#+end_quote

I do value intelligence in itself a great deal, it's true. But I think this is a healthy position, the alternative is refusing to improve just because you are happy at your level and that is akin to wireheading for me. I do not condone it.

  Arguably being a Mind is actually something of a burden because of the increased responsibility.
#+end_quote

It would not be such a burden if everyone was that smart. The question is, of course, what would a bunch of superintelligencies do with their time and resources, and I would rather like to read a story exploring that.

  As for uplifting humans: first of all, personal choice is a big part of Culture society so uplifting someone (at least a sentient being) without their permission is very poor form, even if you think you're doing them a favour.
#+end_quote

As I said, a tricky subject. I fall on the side of doing a reversible action so that the mind in question can decide for itself using optimal decision algorithms. The Culture seemingly falls on the side of letting the addict drug himself into a coma as long as it's his personal choice. I think that kind of freedom works only when you have a society of truly rational agents, otherwise it really is sometimes better to force things on individuals for their own good.

  Also, I'm not sure the uplift you describe is even possible, any more than you could make a human brain out of an earthworm's while "preserving its values".
#+end_quote

Hmm. Sure, it would be a challenge, but it's not like there is scarcity in The Culture, so someone could work out a way to do this, unless there is some fundamental reason why this cannot be done, and I don't see that.

#+begin_quote
  That said, why don't you just read the books? All this stuff is covered and I think your misunderstandings are a result of trying to comprehend the world solely through second-hand accounts. They're good books and any explanation I give you will be imperfect and filtered through my own opinion so if you're as interested as you seem to be, just get it from Banks himself.
#+end_quote

Hey, It's not like the opinion of Banks is somehow privileged compared to your own, death of the author and all that. But you're right, I'll give his books a go myself after all. I just hope they don't hand wave all the potential away for the sake of having relatable protagonists.
