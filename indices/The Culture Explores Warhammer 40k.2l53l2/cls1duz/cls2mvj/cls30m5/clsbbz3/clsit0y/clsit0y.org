The out-of-universe reasons for human level protagonists are obvious. I just can't help but hope to find a good story about a truly superhuman protagonist. It's near impossible to write for a human author, but the hope remains.

As for their level of tech, I'm not conserned about technological advancement that much, what bugs me is the intelligence level inequality (see my reply to [[/u/okaycat]])
