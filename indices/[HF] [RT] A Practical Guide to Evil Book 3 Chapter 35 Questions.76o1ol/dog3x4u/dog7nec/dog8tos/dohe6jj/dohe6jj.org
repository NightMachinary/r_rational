so the king of winter is trying to shake up the story, but the prince of nightfall isn't as far as we know. Meaning that the 7 crowns and one are part of a story.

Given the high number, the most probable source of the crowns are princes of the principate, (She needs 8, the principate has dozens, and she's going to fight them anyway)

Sula doesn't want the prince to get whatever it is he's getting. The most obvious answer would be that it makes him vastly more powerful, tipping the balance between winter and summer.
