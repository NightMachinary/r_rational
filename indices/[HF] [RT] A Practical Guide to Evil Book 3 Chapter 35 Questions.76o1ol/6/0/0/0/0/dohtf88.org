  Given the high number, the most probable source of the crowns are princes of the principate, (She needs 8, the principate has dozens, and she's going to fight them anyway)
#+end_quote

The seven: Helike, Bellerophon, Stygia, Nicae, Atalante, Delos and Penthes.\\
The one: The Hierarchy itself

The solution has ties off things neatly:

- It ties together the so-far entirely separate Free Cities subplot with Cat's own story
- It means only one fight actually needs to take place to secure her side of the bargain, which is narratively convenient.
- It gives an actual plot reason for establishing the Hierarchy. "Seven and One" is different from "Eight".
- It leaves Cat with her own crown and power base in Callow intact.
- It means that a Praesi victory in the Free Cities doesn't actually lead to increased safety or stability for Cat's side.
