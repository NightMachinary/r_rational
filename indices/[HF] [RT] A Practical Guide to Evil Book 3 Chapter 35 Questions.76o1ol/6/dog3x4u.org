So the thing that sticks out to me the most is that Sulia won't tell Cat why the Prince of Nightfall must not get those crowns. Unless it's a magically significant thing that Maesgo will explain, I kinda think it's something Cat also has the power use since she is Winter and Named. Otherwise, there wouldn't be a problem with telling Cat, right?
