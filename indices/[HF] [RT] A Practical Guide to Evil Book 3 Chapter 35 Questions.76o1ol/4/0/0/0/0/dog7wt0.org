Interludes are a gamble. I'm not particularly interested in the First Prince or the Tyrant of Helike, so interludes focusing on them suck.

Stuff like the Calamities interludes we got, though, are great. Same with that glimpse into Thief's past.

I agree; if we get an Akua flashback rather than something more current, I shall be very sad.
