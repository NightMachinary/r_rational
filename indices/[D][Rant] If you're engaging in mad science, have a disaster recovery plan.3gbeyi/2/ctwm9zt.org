ant man? when i saw it by the end of the movie i was thinking "why did the guy didn't send the hornet suit miniaturized through fedex to Hydra three days before the party?" or keep a multi terabyte drive with the plans on him allways. fun movie though.\\
edit: now that i think of it did the pym particle produce energy? i mean the hornet suit had HUD, jetpack, enhanced strength,and multi kilowatt lasers with no arc reactor in sight! should iron man be concerned?
