So don't have people knowing the password personally. If the only information available about it is "The password only becomes available every 7 days for thirty seconds by an automatic process which only shows it in one location which has the usual security, cameras, guards etc etc", then the bad guys need to either break in or pull off some kind of time-sensitive caper plot - either of which increases the chance of detection.

Or, if you want to get a little more over the top, "The password is a brain scan of the main researcher thinking a certain sequence of thoughts while calm and unafraid."
