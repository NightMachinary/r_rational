I've heard this said a bunch, and it's indeed a great line. That said, lots of mad scientists throw around phrases like "Using my theory of Kopelson Intrinsity I'm gonna blow up the sun with my death-ray," especially before it was too cliche. So, they were mad scientists at /some/ point at least, before they became mad engineers. The true nature of Dark Science: failing to publish!
