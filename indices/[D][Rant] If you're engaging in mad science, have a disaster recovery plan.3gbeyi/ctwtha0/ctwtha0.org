The recent Fantastic Four movie is a bit like this as well. At the end, everything blows up, but the Stock Evil Military Guys have had a small army working on building the McGuffin for five years or so - and yet somehow they're unable to make it work unless Reed Richards is standing around within fifty feet of it.

/Yes/, he and Doom were the main scientist and instigator of the project respectively, and neither would be around afterwards, but does this mean that a paperwork-obsessed organization like the US military would somehow not be able to get to within epsilon of where they were previously just from backups, and then throw a lot of really smart people at the problem?
