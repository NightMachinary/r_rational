People taking oaths to vaccinate themselves would require that people be aware of how things worked, which they probably wouldn't given how early on I predict people would try doing this sort of thing. It's entirely possible that the very first person to find out about contracts starts using a plan like this and you can be quite sure that people would not know what's going on. After all how are they supposed to find out since the people in contracts will never reveal that information?

Also importantly you are likely to not notice this sort of thing spreading because you would want the controlled to act exactly the same except the part where they sometimes try to get people alone so they can force them into a contract.

Of course if somehow the information on contracts /did/ spread before anyone can implement this sort of plan then everybody would probably immunize themselves. The result of which would be that the existence of contracts doesn't matter that much short term.

Long term however even if people are immunized initially the next generation isn't. So you're likely going to get all kind of tyrannical results with governments indoctrinating children into total loyalty as soon as they get old enough to make contracts. Plus since countries that did so would have such a massive advantage there would be perverse incentives for every government to do so (either that or they get overtaken by countries that do).
