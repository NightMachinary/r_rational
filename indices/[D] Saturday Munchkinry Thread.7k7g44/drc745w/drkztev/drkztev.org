  Going a level meta, you're the God of Legalism.

  Applying mental pressure costs you power. You get power when people perform the contract ritual. And you get [some of?] the power sacrificed in penalties.

  How do you tweak the contract system so that it's used and you get as much power as possible?

I don't think you've thought this through. The solution as it stands is very simple: minimize the mental pressure applied, which reduces your expenditures. This also increases the odds of people getting the penalty, thus increasing the expected income from penalties. The practical balance is enough pressure that people expect the ritual to work (so they still do the ritual), but so much that it works extremely well, so the people are inclined towards maximizing the penalty to provide additional incentives (assuming higher penalty = more power to you).

If you have an individual choice in the pressure applied, it should be done on a case-by-case basis - those who are likely to invoke high penalties should be allowed to do so, but the pressure should otherwise be high enough that the ritual's reputation remains intact. An allegiance with the God of Probability (RNGesus) or a God of Business Analytics would be an excellent political move.
