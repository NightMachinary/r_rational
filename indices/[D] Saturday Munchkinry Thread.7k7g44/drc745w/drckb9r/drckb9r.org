What happens with overlapping contracts?

For example, if I swear this oath

#+begin_quote
  If you give me $100,000, then I agree to pay $150,000 back to you on 12/31/2017, or suffer the penalty of giving you my (one and only) $1,000,000 diamond on 1/1/2018 at 00:01.
#+end_quote

(or something like that) with a thousand people, what happens? Do I only owe the diamond to the first person I formed a contract with, and the rest of them are just out of luck, as that's something I can no longer give? Are there /more/ penalties for not being able to suffer specific penalties?
