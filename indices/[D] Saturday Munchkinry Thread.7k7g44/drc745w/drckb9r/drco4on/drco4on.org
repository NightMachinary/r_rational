Hm, that would be a good out. One solution might be that you get hit with 1000 "give diamond to X" geas and suffer some really awful compulsions.

Another solution could be that the God of Legalism requires escrow. Maybe you have to bring anything you're offering to forfeit to the ritual. If it's a physical object, it vanishes for the duration of the ritual.
