  In a world where such a system exists, I can't imagine the legal system looking anything at all like what we have now, and it would take more time than I am willing to devote to even come up with a hazy outline of what a reasonable legal system might be. Therefore, I don't think speculating about bizarre laws is even reasonable.

Fair. I was more looking from the perspective the God of Legalism (and the binding oath ritual) suddenly appearing in our world, as it is now. I agree that a society built upon those principles, would look extremely different than our own.
