By the way, I suggest you look up [No Game No Life].

It's a Japanese light novel about a world that is ruled by a God of Legalism. Or to be more accurate, the God of Games. But he more or less acts like a God of Legalism, with people setting rules for a game contract-style and swearing oaths based on the outcomes of the game. E.g. you can swear an oath to pay someone $X if you lose some game Y, and the God of Games will force you to pay up. You can even bet yourself or your thought patterns and the God of Games will enforce it.

And the games you can propose are open-ended enough that you could probably make games out of business transactions. E.g., make a game about delivering your merchandise to some location within a time limit, with a penalty if you lose the game by failing to do so in time.

(The story itself isn't that good imo, with most parts being horribly irrational wish-fulfillment, but it may contain a few ideas that fit your god of legalism concept.)
