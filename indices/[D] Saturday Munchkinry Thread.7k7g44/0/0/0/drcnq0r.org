That's a good point.

Let's start by saying that the God of Legalism likes descriptive linguistics. Your pile of metal objects counts as a "heap of coins" when ~90% of native speakers would agree that the pile is a heap, and that the objects are coins.

Magic is backed by a 'platonic realm' where everyone's expectations of 'coins' shapes a platonic form of 'coinness'. Every contract has to be in a language that's reasonably popular. And everyone involved needs to be speaking the same language.

So, "remain loyal" will only prohibit stuff that basically everyone in our culture would agree is solidly disloyal.

Concepts that are too vague or complex to have a well-understood meaning will cause the spell to fail. The common work-around for subjectivity is to explicitly name a standard. "I'll remain loyal unless the tribe chief banishes you."
