  Another solution could be that the God of Legalism requires escrow. Maybe you have to bring anything you're offering to forfeit to the ritual. If it's a physical object, it vanishes for the duration of the ritual.

I guess at that point, I'd wonder if the God of Legalism /also/ recognizes mortal laws.

For example, a country's laws of ownership. If a friend of mine and I meet at the Library of Congress, we start the ritual, and I say

  If you give me one dollar, then I agree to pay you back $100 billion within ten thousand years, or else suffer the penalty of giving you this building
#+end_quote

would the Library disappear for ten thousand years? Or would the God of Legalism first recognize the ownership laws of the U.S., before its own contracts could take place? In which case, if the laws of man take precedent, I'd imagine there are some crazy exploits that could be achieved by passing very specifically worded laws.
