If the God of Legalism recognizes descriptive linguistics as discussed before, the first example becomes impossible because 90%+ of English speakers would agree that you do not own the Library of Congress.

In a world where such a system exists, I can't imagine the legal system looking anything at all like what we have now, and it would take more time than I am willing to devote to even come up with a hazy outline of what a reasonable legal system might be. Therefore, I don't think speculating about bizarre laws is even reasonable.
