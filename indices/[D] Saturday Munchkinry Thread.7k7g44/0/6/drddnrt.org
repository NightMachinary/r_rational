  Standard form is something like, "If you do [thing I want] then I agree to do [thing you want] or suffer [penalty]."
#+end_quote

/[penalty]/ eh? Who enforces this penalty? The God of Legalism I presume?

So I assume that what you have in mind is things like "I swear to do X or suffer the penalty of death", and then if I don't do X, the God of Legalism kills me?

I'm so exploiting the hell out of this. Heck you can even avoid the mental pressure part entirely by having X be an impossible action that you have to do immediately. So you fail to do X instantly and the /penalty/ instantly invokes.

- "I swear to do X or suffer the penalty of the death of friend A": God of Legalism goes to kill X, (who I don't actually like, but I won't tell that to the God of Legalism).
- "I swear to do X or suffer the penalty of having more money than I know what to do with!": God of Legalism gives me money?
- "I swear to do X or suffer the penalty of being alone!": finally get rid of those pesky people you don't like.
- "I swear to do X or suffer the penalty of being too smart to fit in with other people": God of Legalism gives me int boost?
- "I swear to do X or suffer the penalty of living an eternal life, and thus experiencing more suffering than others would in their short lives": God of Legalism gives me immortality?

What are the limits here? Because I can phrase just about every good thing as a penalty.

/do [thing you want]/ eh? Who determines whether I have done this thing? The God of Legalism I presume?

So I assume that what you have in mind is things like "I swear to do give X 100 bucks", and then the God of Legalism can use his god-knowledge to verify whether I have given X 100 bucks.

I'm so exploiting the hell out of this. Heck you can even avoid the mental pressure part entirely by having X be an action that you have to do immediately. So you succeed/fail to do X instantly and the penalty instantly invokes. Then just make the penalty something trivial, like a stubbed toe.

- "I agree to spend the next few seconds of my life in a world where next week's lotto numbers are X, or suffer the penalty of a stubbed toe.": God of Legalism goes to verify whether next week's lotto numbers are X for me in the next few seconds, and I get a stubbed toe if it isn't. So I go win the lotto if my toe isn't stubbed.
- "I agree to spend the next few seconds of my life in a world where valuable treasures can be found in area X, or suffer the penalty of a stubbed toe.": God of Legalism goes to verify whether valuable treasures can be found in area X, and I get a stubbed toe if not. So I do binary search on areas, narrow down the locations with treasures, and go collect them, gaining all kinds of powerful artifacts and valuable items.
- "I agree to spend the next few seconds of my life in a world where my soulmate can be found in area X, or suffer the penalty of a stubbed toe.": God of Legalism goes to verify whether my soulmate can be found in area X, and I get a stubbed toe if not. So I do binary search on areas, narrow down the location, then go meet my soulmate.

What are the limits here? Because I can get the answers for just about any binary question in this manner. Heck I could probably do a lot more than that by including self references.
