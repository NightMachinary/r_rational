  "I swear to do X or suffer the penalty of living an eternal life, and thus experiencing more suffering than others would in their short lives": God of Legalism gives me immortality?
#+end_quote

The collective understanding of the punishment is not something that reality inflicts upon the oath-taker, but rather it's something the oath-taker feels a mental compulsion to do if they fail the original condition. Or, as [[/u/zarraha][u/zarraha]] put it,

#+begin_quote
  The power can't omnipotently activate by reading reality, it depends entirely on your knowledge of whether or not the conditions have been met. Further, the power cannot control reality to punish you, but punishments have to be something you can inflict on yourself.
#+end_quote

So you could make that oath, but it either wouldn't work in the first place, or you would just feel compelled to spend the rest of your life fruitlessly looking for a way to become immortal.

Additionally, none of your examples follow the given form, which was

#+begin_quote
  If you do [thing I want] then I agree to do [thing you want] or suffer [penalty].
#+end_quote

In other words, you actually have to make the oath with another person, not just against reality itself. Doesn't stop your plans per se, but just something to keep in mind.

Finally, for your last examples, e.g.

#+begin_quote
  I agree to spend the next few seconds of my life in a world where next week's lotto numbers are X, or suffer the penalty of a stubbed toe.
#+end_quote

That might be possible. My /assumption/ would be it follows Death Note rules, where it relies /your/ knowledge - that is, it would depend on whether you already knew if those were the next week's lotto numbers. So, if you don't know that the winning numbers are X, either you always feel compelled to stub your toe afterwards (even if next week's numbers DO end up being X), or the ritual just doesn't work in the first place. But I guess it all depends on how the system works.
