  something the oath-taker feels a mental compulsion to do if they fail the original condition.

Oooh! Okay, that's less exploitable than I thought, but still pretty useful!

What you mean is that making the oath "If you do [anything at all] then I agree to do [something impossible immediately] or suffer [the penalty of doing task X]": will make the God of Legalism compel me to do task X right?

So if task X was something I wanted to do anyway, but I had procrastination issues, I could make that oath to the God of Legalism, and he would mentally compel me to do task X instead of procrastinating.

It is also an awesome lie-detector. Get someone to make an impossible oath whose penalty is being forced to tell the truth in the next hour. The mental compulsion would make them tell the truth for the next hour, serving as valuable non-perjured witness testimony.
