  I think this is solved by the proper precommitment oaths. If everyone simply swears, as soon as they're developmentally competent, "I shall not swear any oath that compels slavery nor loyalty, nor shall I swear an oath under the threat of force," the worst of these scenarios are prevented.

I think you're forgetting that in the scenario where governments use oaths to enslave the next generation they will likely make them swear oaths /as soon as they're capable of doing so/. Plus governments with a fair degree of nationalism may well have a pretty big portion of the populace on board with swearing oaths to the government. Particularly since the oaths seem to have tangible benefits (people under oath are going to be putting in 100% effort into whatever task the government desires of them).

As for fine tuning oaths that don't just totally disallow any further oaths, I think you're overestimating how well thought out most such "vaccination" oaths are likely to be. After all there will be mass hysteria over the potential of mind control, so I don't think most people are going to end up using the most well crafted oaths in their scramble to immunize themselves (particularly since such things are probably beyond the cognitive capacity of most people to come up with).
