I think this is solved by the proper precommitment oaths. If everyone simply swears, as soon as they're developmentally competent, "I shall not swear any oath that compels slavery nor loyalty, nor shall I swear an oath under the threat of force," the worst of these scenarios are prevented.

Of course, one might want to fine-tune that. The threat of jail time, technically a threat of force, shouldn't prevent you from professing your innocence under a truth oath in court. Life-long debt may not technically be slavery. I'm sure lawyers would whip up something appropriate in no time if it actually became relevant.
