Ok so if you can inflict arbitrary penalty clauses then you can easily leverage this to godlike power. Thus I'll just assume that the penalty is something to do with mind control just like the "mental pressure". Of course depending on the strength of the contracts compulsion it may well be totally superfluous to even include a penalty clause.

Now if the compulsion that's part of the normal contract isn't good enough you can always set people up so they're guaranteed to fail their contract, and then have the penalty invoke whatever mind control you want here.

Anyway if this works like I think it does then the first competent person to get access to this will coerce some people into agreeing to a contract that makes them unquestionably loyal to him. Then all of those people go on to threaten /more/ people who are assimilated into the contract army.\\
Point is this inevitably ends either one person having absolute control over humanity, or several such empires in constant conflict.

Honestly given there's no limitation on coercing people into contracts it seems inevitable that this leads to political power becoming totally centralized, and thus allowing those in power to act with utter impunity since their citizens are literally incapable of opposing them in any way.
