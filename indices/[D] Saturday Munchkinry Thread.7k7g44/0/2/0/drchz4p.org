From what I read, I interpreted it as an entirely psychological phenomenon. The power can't omnipotently activate by reading reality, it depends entirely on your knowledge of whether or not the conditions have been met. Further, the power cannot control reality to punish you, but punishments have to be something you can inflict on yourself. That is, if you know (or believe) a condition has been activated then you will be pressured to punish yourself, if you don't believe this then you will not be pressured. It's effectively a form of pre-commitment, and could theoretically exist in real life with no supernatural phenomenon if a species had evolved an incredibly strong psychological aversion to lying or breaking promises.
