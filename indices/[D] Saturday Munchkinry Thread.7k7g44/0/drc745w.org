The God of Legalism created a ritual that lets people swear magical oaths.

Standard form is something like, "If you do [thing I want] then I agree to do [thing you want] or suffer [penalty]."

The ritual allows people to agree on wording in advance. Multiple people can make simultaneous promises, so you can deals like: "as long as you're loyal to me, I'll be loyal to you"

Once the ritual is done, people feel a strong mental pressure to perform their part of an agreement, up to the point where they invoke the penalty clause.

How would you exploit a world with magical contracts? What precautions would you take before swearing one?

--------------

Going a level meta, you're the God of Legalism.

Applying mental pressure costs you power. You get power when people perform the contract ritual. And you get [some of?] the power sacrificed in penalties.

How do you tweak the contract system so that it's used and you get as much power as possible?
