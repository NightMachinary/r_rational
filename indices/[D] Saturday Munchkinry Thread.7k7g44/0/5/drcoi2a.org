The motivation for this is that I've been reading a Kim Harrison book. The story uses the 'demons with detailed magic contracts' tropes.

There are parts of the trope I like. It creates room for cleverness, and gives the characters clear stakes. But, when I see the trope in stories, the contracts seem so exploitable that no magic society could really use them.

I'm trying to see if there's a way that they could work in genre fiction without being story-breakingly powerful, or so dangerous that no one would ever consider making them.
