  There are parts of the trope I like. It creates room for cleverness, and gives the characters clear stakes. But, when I see the trope in stories, the contracts seem so exploitable that no magic society could really use them.

Yea. I think language in general is so fluid and subjective that, while it's fun to watch a protagonist trick their way through a situation using contracts, it's not particularly "realistic" or believable. The types of contracts in these stories leave lots of wiggle room, and I think intelligent characters (whether protagonist or antagonist) would never knowingly sign such agreements.

One different interpretation of the contract trope that I particularly enjoyed was in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Booth_at_the_End][/The Booth at the End/]]. Essentially, people come to this stranger and tell him their wishes. The man looks the wishes up in his book, and tell them what they have to do in exchange. The wisher has to accomplish the given task(s) in a way that they /truly believe/ is valid, at which point they're granted their wish. There's no bargaining or restructuring of the contract: simply a lookup of "if you want X, then go do Y." It's actually fairly similar to [[#s][Brandon Sanderson's /Stormlight Archive/ spoiler]]
