I'm asking why you think ‘god AI governed dystopias' has any degree of plausibility. To me the idea is nearly nonsensical. Whereas the ‘AI is not particularly dangerous' and ‘AI is an existential risk' arguments have fairly straightforward ideas about what could actually happen to lead to that future (even if you think they're wrong), I don't know of arguments of a comparable nature that might lead people to actually forecast god AI distopias. This is a problem for me, I had hoped you could help.
