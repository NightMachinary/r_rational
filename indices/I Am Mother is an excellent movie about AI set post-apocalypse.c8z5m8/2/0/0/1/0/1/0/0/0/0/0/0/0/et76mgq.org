  Early tribal societies would be shocked by the sizable villages that came later, those sizable villages would be shocked by ancient Greek cities, ancient Greek society would be shocked by the industrial revolution, the industrial revolution would be shocked by the modern day.

You're ignoring the fact that there are anything between 200 thousand years and 1000-2000 years between those examples. That's still cherry picking.

But I don't care about this line of argument..

  Nothing you gave is evidence that P(Bostrom-style AI risk) is lower than the prior, or that P(god AI governed dystopias) is higher than the prior.

My claim is expert consensus yours isn't if anything you should be the one giving evidence. No shifting the burden of evidence here mate.

  Then you jump to “There is apocalyptic danger it's just less likely to be the case [than god AI governed dystopias].”

My point was that AI apocalypse and specifically an AI apocalypse where AI torture 1 human at a time psychologically while pretending to be repopulating the earth is less likely than AI god dystopias.

And I followed that when you started this discussion with AI apocalypse is less likely than 'no AI apocalypse'. Now you want me to give you evidence that X specific example is more likely than generic AI apocalypse. No thank you.

It might very well still be the case but it's a bad point to argue in favor of.
