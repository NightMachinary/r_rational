Sure.

God was used as a near unlimited power noun. Dystopia is fairly clear, most bad AIs would result in one. Governed just means AI is in control.

I basically meant an AI dystopia, which is fairly likely in case of a badly programmed AI.

Just as an addendum and interesting point.

It's possible, and some would argue likely, that people will tend to have a religious like behavior towards an AI overlord. Trying to do more things the algorithm tends to reward.. Ritualistic / religious like behavior that kind of thing.

It's an interesting analogy I read in a book a couple months ago. About people in the future being like our past selves, using rituals and faith to try to get rewarded, because of their they lack of understanding.

In the AI case we'd be talking about algorithms they don't understand, in the past they didn't understand science..
