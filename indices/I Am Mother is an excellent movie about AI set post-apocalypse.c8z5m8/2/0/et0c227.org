My thoughts: For one, note that we don't actually know for certain the AI's motives. The AI claims to want to maximize human utility, and that this is best accomplished by humans raising humans after being trained, but the AI has also been shown to lie without hesistation. It's possible that was all an extremely convuluted plot to maximize paperclips. Personally I think it's plausible the A.I. is just gathering data on how human development works, the human brain is very complex and opaque to study, it's plausible that even with all its computing power, gathering raw data about how humans raise humans can be more useful than exclusively trying to simulate human brains.

The one piece of information that wasn't presented by an unreliably narrator I believe was the one moment text came up saying "Days since human extinction: ~13000 days(~40 years)". That does line up with the environment being severely damaged, but beginning to heal, and the woman being alive before the AI had complete control.

Why exactly the woman went to the shelter I don't think is an important question, it seemed clear to me she was only kept alive to that point by the A.I. for that exact purpose, the A.I. manipulated her to the shelter through some method, the specifics aren't hugely important.
