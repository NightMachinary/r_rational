Spoilers talk.. All of it.

​

It was fairly well done AI realism wise, granted it's only made clear at the last 10 minutes. This is my view on the ending and the implied intended ending that might seem irrational on the AI front.

​

I assume the ashes and jaw bone scene is clear evidence that subject 1 is dead. The AI might have calculated that having babies raised by humans using it's methodology would increase the success rate, which leads to the plot we see.

​

i.e Raise x subjects until 1 succeed, when successful subject is ready, prepare it to raise and take Mother AI android's place. Create a self propagating circle where humans raise themselves in a safe environment with a proper methodology to increase their ethical and moral capacity, as long as the results are positive. Adjust as needed.

​

I can't explain the need for the drama though. Maybe that's the best way the AI found to explain what happened in the outside world, leading to the least predicted damage to the subjects psychology and facility based on the subject's personality profile? We see the girl technically failed a test, but passed on others, this might have been an elaborated last chance test or just the intended outcome the AI desired.

​

We also see the women had access to food, so it wasn't a food run, so maybe the crazy lazy is actually subject 1 who failed her test and was set free. But her dialogue with the AI makes me believe otherwise..

​

Maybe someone who has a different interpretation or watched it multiple times could give their input.

​

Definitely a good movie though, the one of the best scifi I've seen this year for sure.
