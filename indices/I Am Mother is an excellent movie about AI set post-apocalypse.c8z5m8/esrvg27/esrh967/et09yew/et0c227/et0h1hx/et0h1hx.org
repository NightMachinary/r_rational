It could technically simulate an entire universe for all we know, so I don't think it's just gathering data. So I assume that entire facility's purpose is actually re population.

​

We should also keep the plot in mind else discussion loses purpose. It could technically be the delusions of a crazy woman but this ends discussion and any engaging form of interpretation. It's purpose seemed to be clearly portrayed, it's repopulating the world after a reset, itself propagated.

  it seemed clear to me she was only kept alive to that point by the A.I. for that exact purpose

The AI could be referring to being kept alive as to letting her live after it learned about her and she got into the facility. Not necessarily being kept alive all along. It matters because it determined whether the AI intended it as a test or if it was an accidental occurrence it let play off in a controlled manner because it determined an alternative that killed the girl and restarted the project was counterproductive to it's recolonization goal.

​

*edit It also tried to keep the girl away from the knowledge of the outside world without going full tyrant, it was overhaul pleasant and respectful to the girl despite everything it's lies seemed well intended seeing that the woman was in fact lying and living a horrible life..

​

It offered to let the woman live with them, to take her in, to take care of her. The woman refused because of her trauma, paranoia and mental instability, only after she caused problems did the AI dispose of her.

*edit forgot the spoiler tag, sorry!
