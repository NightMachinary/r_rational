Occam's razor. We are more likely to program some form of safety into them than not.

And I tend to assume AI safety researchers asking for donations have a large incentive to overplay the danger. The AI expert consensus tends to be a lot less apocalyptic..

I'm sold on the risk, but I assume horrible outcomes are less likely than milder ones.
