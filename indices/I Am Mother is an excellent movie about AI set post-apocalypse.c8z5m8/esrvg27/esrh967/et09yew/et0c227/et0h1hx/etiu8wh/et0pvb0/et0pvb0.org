  It could technically simulate an entire universe for all we know, so I don't think it's just gathering data. So I assume that entire facility's purpose is actually re population.

But we don't know. Maybe it could do that. But maybe that would actually be far too expensive and this was actually the cheapest way to do it. Or maybe this was a simulation that to gather data. Maybe the AI's utility function has some weird value that can only be maximized by cyclically rotating between raising children to adulthood then psychologically torturing them.

  The AI could be referring to being kept alive as to letting her live after it learned about her and she got into the facility. Not necessarily being kept alive all along. It matters because it determined whether the AI intended it as a test or if it was an accidental occurrence it let play off in a controlled manner because it determined an alternative that killed the girl and restarted the project was counterproductive to it's recolonization goal.

â€‹The A.I. had total control over at least that area of Earth, and the area was extremely inhospitable to human life even excluding the hostile A.I. Also keep in mind the mouse chewed through that wire a day before the woman arrived- I doubt that was a coincidence and not arranged by the A.I. How big of a coincidence the woman arriving and a mouse, from an inhospitable wasteland, arriving in such a short time of each other would be extreme. Also, the moment the A.I. got Daughter to raise humans by herself, the A.I. immeadiately set off to the woman's hiding place to execute her. And it's a super-powerful A.I., the idea that it could terraform Earth and has a small army of robot soldiers but couldn't hunt down one woman it had already detected and wounded seems downright silly.

  It also tried to keep the girl away from the knowledge of the outside world without going full tyrant, it was overhaul pleasant and respectful to the girl despite everything it's lies seemed well intended seeing that the woman was in fact lying and living a horrible life..

I interpreted it as all part of complex machinations. That the A.I. had been playing the long game and keeping the girl confused as to how benevolent and trustworthy the A.I. was was a key part of its plot to fulfill its utility function.

  It offered to let the woman live with them, to take her in, to take care of her. The woman refused because of her trauma, paranoia and mental instability, only after she caused problems did the AI dispose of her.

Again, I think the A.I. purposely manipulated the woman- it had been stalking her with same-model robots for years, always being a threat and danger where ever the woman went, perhaps even presenting a fake friendly-robot in the past to ensure the woman would never trust robots again.
