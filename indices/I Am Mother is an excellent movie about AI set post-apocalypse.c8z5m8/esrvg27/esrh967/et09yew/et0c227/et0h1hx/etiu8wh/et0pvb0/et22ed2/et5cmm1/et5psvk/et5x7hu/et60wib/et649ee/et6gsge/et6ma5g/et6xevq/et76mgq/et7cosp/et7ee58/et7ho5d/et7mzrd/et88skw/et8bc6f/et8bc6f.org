Racist AI, Religiously biased AI, Politically biased AI, AI that doesn't adapt to future human values..

These seem self explanatory to me, AI likes things a certain way because it was programmed badly or didn't account for it. Or people consider X wrong AI doesn't because when it was programmed people didn't consider X wrong..
