  Dystopia is fairly clear, most bad AIs would result in one.

This is the part I'm not seeing. When I woke up I hypothesized that maybe you were talking about AI technologies used as a force-multiplier on an oppressive government, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/bvzc7w/d_has_anyone_noticed_a_lot_of_ml_research_into/][like is happening in China today]]. The progression from today to such a future is pretty clear to me---China just keeps getting more effective at governing, and other governments follow suit. But it seems you're still talking about an AI takeover scenario. What does such an AI look like? What are its goals? What makes the result dystopian?
