I just got around to watching it. Found it mildly interesting all the way through, but kept getting annoyed by thoughts like "if this were real then Mother would almost certainly be connected to the entire facility and be basically omniscient, knowing every button pushed and hearing every sound, [[https://gizmodo.com/scientists-are-turning-wifi-routers-into-creepy-radar-c-1794961990][if not more]]". The ending retroactively improved my perception of the first 2 hours.
