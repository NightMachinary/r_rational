The movie had nothing in common with ex machina i would say. It is not about the same themes or evokes the same feelings.

I would say there is a chance they would like it depending on what they thought was stupid about ex machina. But also i loved ex machina And i agree with taltosdreamer's comment. Soooooo .... I don't know?

I wish i could spoil it because that is the only way i could answer that.
