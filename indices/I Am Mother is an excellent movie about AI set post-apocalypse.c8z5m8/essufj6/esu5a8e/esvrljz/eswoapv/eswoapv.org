After doublechecking i was I Am Mother I was referring to, however I misremembered the format. What actually happened was that I watched until 40 min and at that point there isn't a clear plot trajectory, I don't know what happened to the rest of humanity, and Mother refuses to answer the relevant questions, and everything that have happened makes me distrust that the authors are going to give satisfying answers.

I can gather from your reaction that it gets better and might give it another shot.
