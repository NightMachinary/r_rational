  The AI could be referring to being kept alive as to letting her live after it learned about her and she got into the facility. Not necessarily being kept alive all along. It matters because it determined whether the AI intended it as a test or if it was an accidental occurrence it let play off in a controlled manner because it determined an alternative that killed the girl and restarted the project was counterproductive to it's recolonization goal.

The AI specifically said: "Did you ever wonder why you survived while no one else did. As if someone had a purpose for you. But not anymore." I think this sentence is very likely in a world where the AI is talking about not killing her along with the rest of humanity, and very unlikely in a world where the AI is talking about not killing her in the facility.

The beauty of this film is that the AI is not holding the idiot ball. Every single experience Daughter has, has been designed to produce the result the AI wants. It has determined that to produce an optimal humanity, it needs to kill the old one. But it has also determined that a humanity that relies on Mother would not be optimal, and that in fact, an optimal humanity needs to hate it for the genocide. It may or may not have genuinely needed several tries to achieve this, but the evidence that it had killed siblings is definitely there specifically for Daughter to find it. It didn't even get rid of the bullets it lied about.

Edit: This all makes sense in itself and is at the same time a metaphor for parents having to let go of their children. Or even better, not a metaphor, but a direct manifestation of the same underlying truth. Good scifi.
