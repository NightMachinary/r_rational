There are multiple very strong arguments against your money thing, but I don't want to cover it yet because I'm still trying to get a solid line of argument. Let's assume it's true---specifically, let's assume that there's a significant conflict of interest, and that Bostrom-style AI risk is likely to be a poor model. Take it as granted, and we can revisit later.

Then you jump to “/There is apocalyptic danger it's just less likely to be the case [than god AI governed dystopias]./” This does not follow. You have not argued this point. Nothing you gave is evidence that P(Bostrom-style AI risk) is lower than the prior, or that P(god AI governed dystopias) is higher than the prior.

If some drug company sponsors some research, and that research says their drug is effective, their results might be weaker evidence than unbiased research, but it doesn't de-facto become nega-evidence that the drug in fact doesn't work. Certainly it's not evidence that some other randomly chosen remedy is effective. Those conclusions just don't follow in isolation.

  PS for most of our history that assumption worked very well, you don't get to pick 1 exception and call it a factually bad heuristic. If a hypothesis is true most of the time, you assume like scientists do that it will likely happen again more often than not.

Yo, I did the furthest thing from cherry-picking. Early tribal societies would be shocked by the sizable villages that came later, those sizable villages would be shocked by ancient Greek cities, ancient Greek society would be shocked by the industrial revolution, the industrial revolution would be shocked by the modern day. Further, the degree of change permeates literally thousands of fields. Sure, back when inventions were few and far apart you had to wait a while for regime-changing shifts, but you're not arguing that the field won't advance, you're arguing that it will change but ultimately resolve in a mundane manner.
