  >! The A.I. had total control over at least that area of Earth, and the area was extremely inhospitable to human life even excluding the hostile A.I. Also keep in mind the mouse chewed through that wire a day before the woman arrived- I doubt that was a coincidence and not arranged by the A.I. How big of a coincidence the woman arriving and a mouse, from an inhospitable wasteland, arriving in such a short time of each other would be extreme. Also, the moment the A.I. got Daughter to raise humans by herself, the A.I. immeadiately set off to the woman's hiding place to execute her. And it's a super-powerful A.I., the idea that it could terraform Earth and has a small army of robot soldiers but couldn't hunt down one woman it had already detected and wounded seems downright silly. !<

It's clearly stated that the AI didn't, that's why she's shown fixing the woman's phone, and the women looks at it being on confused right before the AI shows up at her door. Which clearly implies she didn't know where the woman was or about her before the events we've seen.

The AI also increases security after the girl leaves.

  >! But we don't know. Maybe it could do that. But maybe that would actually be far too expensive and this was actually the cheapest way to do it. Or maybe this was a simulation that to gather data. Maybe the AI's utility function has some weird value that can only be maximized by cyclically rotating between raising children to adulthood then psychologically torturing them. !<

Expenses of any kind shouldn't be relevant for an AI, it doesn't care it cares about it's goals. Regardless, there's no hint of the AI being any sort of parperclip optimizer in the movie no allusions to it either. It has a broken weird morality that's all.

​

Anyway I got the movies plot down. AI resets humans, starts re population project, 1st subject fails, starts second, second is almost completed and it can start next phase, accident happens, woman shows up causes problems, it uses the optimal way to deal with her given the circumstances and how things develop. End.

​

This seems to be it, but it can be whatever you want for you. It can be an AI that likes torturing 1 human at a time for no reason after raising it for over a decade, and destroying the world just so it can play in peace. That's not likely the case given the evidence and events of the movie but you can interpret it however you like.

​

I don't think the writer knew about paperclip optimizers, paperclip optimizers aren't really the most likely or scariest outcome, just the example of an AI gone terribly wrong. More likely scenarios are just god AI governed dystopias / badly calibrated moral AI gods destroying us all by accident. EY used paperclip optimizers as an example, it doesn't mean it's the most likely outcome or that other authors like it and would use it.
