"Objective morality" in fantasy doesn't (usually) mean "objective", really. It means that morality is /observable/, but that's not necessarily the same as /objective/. You can cast /detect evil/ and detect that a skeleton is, in some sense, "evil". But does the fact that the spell's judgement and your moral judgement use the same term make them interchangeable? Would your moral judgment change if the spell was instead called /detect flarg/?

/The Second Apocalypse/ goes into this question a good deal more deeply.
