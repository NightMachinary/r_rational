Alignment is a negligible part of why D&D gets away with lots of murder. Almost none of the D&D designated targets are guaranteed, inheritably, bone-deep Evil. Human cultists definitely aren't. You're on the hook for kobold babies and Draco Malfoys regardless of where the folks you killed fell on the alignment spectrum.

(Not that you bothered casting Detect Evil on any of them before killing them anyway.)

The /actual/ reason why adventurers don't worry about it, yet somehow aren't haunted by starving kobold children, is an unspoken social contract between players and DMs that This Isn't What We're Here For.

And different groups will place different boundaries on the Thing. I have no doubt that there are people out there running the equivalent of a Koboldopolis campaign without rejecting the alignment system at all.
