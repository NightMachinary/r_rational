Magic leaves traces. So, "detect evil" becomes a family of spells like "detect necromantic energy."

Those spells reveal undead AND anyone who channels a lot of necromantic magic AND anyone whose class has necromantic themed powers.

"Blessed" weapons work mostly the same. Instead of disrupting Evil, they're disrupting the power sources that people use to increase their speed and durability.

The upside of this is that enough de buffs could partially solve the "quadratic wizard / linear fighter" thing.

Non magic classes have an advantage because they don't need to maneuver around localized de buffs.
