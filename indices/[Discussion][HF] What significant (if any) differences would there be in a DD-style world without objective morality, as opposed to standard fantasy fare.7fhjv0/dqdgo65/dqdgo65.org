The real change is non-mechanical.

D&D is combat heavy. A standard plot is, "go kill that clan of intelligent creatures." A lot of the payout is having the freedom to be a world-shaping badass.

'Evil' facilitates this. Grognar the Barbarian can cut his way through the Evil Cultists and their Evil Minions safe in the knowledge that they're Evil.

Things change if you make the world into shades of grey.

One option is to give the characters pre-modern worldviews. They'd think like Odysseus, instead of equality-loving moderns. I've never seen this pulled off, but would love to see a group do it well.

The other option is to plot the game around shades of grey. Easy mode is to have a conflict where several, equally sympathetic human factions are fighting.

A potentially more interesting option is to really run with the idea that characters have modern morals in a world where everyone else runs on Good vs Evil.

So, you kill all the Kobold warriors because the Kobolds are attacking human settlements.

But then, you've got a population of 40 young and infant Kobolds who haven't done anything wrong and will starve if you don't provide for them and rebuild their town.

You'd have a game where the PCs are carving out their own kingdom, in the middle of hostile and confused neighbors. They'd have to protect New Koboldopolis from rampaging paladins.
