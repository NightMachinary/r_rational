Technically, "detect evil" is probably just the opinion of the cleric's patron god and not actually an absolute measurement. We know the various gods in D&D are not omnipotent or omniscient, they have stats and can be killed by epic enough characters.

So I'd say the only difference in such a setting would be that it was common knowledge that someone showing up as "good" or "evil" when you cast that spell is just a matter of opinion, and that different clerics with different patrons gods could sometimes get conflicting answers if they cast on a particularly controversial target.
