False declaration of "False". Several versions of D&D fully allow you to kill gods.

For example, the original; the supplement /Gods, Demi-Gods & Heroes/ is explicit that Odin only has 300 hit points, rather than giving him an "avatar" or "manifestation" with 300 hit points.

Then AD&D first edition, as of /Deities & Demigods/, is very clear that its stats are for the gods, and that the gods, if slain on their home plane, are "absolutely and irrevocably dead". Rather than say players can't do this, it then goes on to say that if characters try to challenge a deity on its home plane, the god should bring to bear "all the powers that the being has." Which is very much not the same thing as declaring it impossible for the characters to kill the god; after all, if it was impossible, why would the god need to bring all its powers to bear? Now, six years later, in the /Manual of the Planes/ we first get rules that make a god unkillable; Greater Powers, if reduced to 0 hp, are transformed into a vapor that re-forms into the god in 1d10 days. But Lesser Powers and Demi-Powers still can be slain permanently on their home plane (though now Demi-Powers can be raised from the dead by more powerful deities, rather than their deaths being irrevocable).

Now, in AD&D second edition, sure, gods are invincible against mortals and the beings with stats are their avatars.

But then this changes back in D&D 3.x. /Deities & Demigods/ for 3rd does raise the option of making gods unkillable, but the default is that they can be "slain in physical or magical combat", and they have stats like hit points. And these stats are not just for avatars; entries for the gods have stat blocks both for the deity /and/ weaker stat blocks for their avatars.

4th edition eventually had explicit rules for killing gods, and designer posts on the Internet making it explicitly clear that yes, characters actually killing gods, not just manifestations, was intentionally allowed.

5th edition does not have any actual rules on the subject, and has no published deity stat blocks, either.

So, for what we might call the six "main" versions of D&D -- original, AD&D, AD&D 2nd, D&D 3.x, D&D 4th, and D&D 5th -- on whether characters can kill gods, the votes are "Yes", "Yes", "No", "Yes", "Yes", and "Abstain". By a vote of 4-1-1, gods in D&D "can be killed by epic enough characters."
