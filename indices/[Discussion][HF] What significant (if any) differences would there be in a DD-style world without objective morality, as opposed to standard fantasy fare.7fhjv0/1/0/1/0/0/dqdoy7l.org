Eh. I guess. I mean more in "spirit of the setting" sense. If you try to rule lawyer D&D down to the most minute details, you'll never get anywhere : at the lowest level, without a GM to house rule away ridiculous exploits, D&D is and has always been broken.

Anyways, if I were the DM, I'd rule that gods can't be killed in the same way you cannot ban electric fields from a universe. Gods control primal forces that will always be present. But you should be able to destroy a god's mind and replace it with a substitute, elevating some other being to be god.
