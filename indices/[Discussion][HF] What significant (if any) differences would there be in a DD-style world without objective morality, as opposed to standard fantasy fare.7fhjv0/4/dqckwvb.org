If objective morality doesn't exist, then objective good and evil doesn't exist. At which point, munchkinery might ensue.

There are plenty of powerful spells/magic effects that only work on targets that are "good" or "evil". Since there is no objective good or evil, gods/mages could munchkin by defining "good" and "evil" for their spells however they wish.

Define money as the root of all evil, and now your clerics can find treasures in dungeons better than any rogue using their detect evil spells.

Define everyone who doesn't follow your god as an evil heretic, and now your priests can wage a holy war with killer healing spells.

Define metal impurities as the taint of demons, and now your priests can be expert blacksmiths, refining metals with ease using "purify evil" spells.
