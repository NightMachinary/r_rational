On a somewhat related note I tried to make a consistent alignment system for use in D&D style games: [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/193mUyuiNWJxGYWQw9GS4yX-gGMJle5WFe_1iXxWx6AY/edit?usp=sharing]]

However the approach I used could be considered to be in some ways worse, because while alignments are well defined many people aren't going to fall into one of the alignment categories, which means it not an all encompassing system.

Still I think if you used the system for purposes of detect alignment it might be pretty useful. Though you might also want to use it in conjunction with other things like having the spell detect their alignment by the standard of a particular god, the caster or some other comparative metric.
