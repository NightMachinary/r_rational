Detect evil spell wouldn't work, or it would just trigger for certain creatures and magic and not inform moral judgements. I don't think much would change because we clearly don't need objective morality to condemn other groups as evil.

It might allow experimentation with necromancy without getting corrupted. (Although I think "White Necromancers" are already a thing with the alignment grid.)
