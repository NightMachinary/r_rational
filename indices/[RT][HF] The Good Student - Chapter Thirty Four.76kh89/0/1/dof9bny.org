I have noticed that with some of the group dialogue it feels like the author has a â€˜banter quota' he wants Fanny or David to meet that does make the scene feel a little contrived at times. To be fair this didn't stand out to me in this chapter specifically and the banter certainly has its moments.

On a related note, something I've noticed in the group dialogue of a few serials - not necessarily TGS - is the need to give every character something to say, presumably to remind the reader they're present in the scene, regardless of how jarring and contrived it is. The Gods are Bastards in particular falls to victim to this, where there's ten characters in the scene and every single one has to throw a couple lines in.
