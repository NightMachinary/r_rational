A pretty solid chapter. I wonder what Nic's going to do with the headmaster. I liked that it was from Brill's perspective. The back and forth between the boys was fun, it does feel a bit contrived like every character has got a perfect comeback if it was just two characters going back and forth it would have been less obvious but still I liked it because it creates this Sherlock Holmes-like aura around the three that makes them seem like intellectuals. I guess Brill is sort of Watson-like character as he was out of the loop and a foil for the audience in this chapter.
