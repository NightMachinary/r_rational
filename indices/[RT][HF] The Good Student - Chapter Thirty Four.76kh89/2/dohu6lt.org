Holy cow, that [[http://gravitytales.com/]] website is terrible to read at. It keeps playing a Jeep ad, and keeps jumping to where the ad is at, then I scroll back, find my place, start reading again, the ad starts over, and jumps back to its place again!

Hitting the pause button on the ad doesn't do anything, and neither does hitting the mute button. I had to mute the sound on my computer to stop hearing the ad.

I can't keep reading this story on this website.

Not to mention, after leaving and coming back after ten minutes, it takes a full 10-15 seconds for the page to scroll after I hit page up/down.
