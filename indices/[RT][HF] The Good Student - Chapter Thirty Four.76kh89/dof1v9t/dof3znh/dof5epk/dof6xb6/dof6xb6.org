Well, it should at least be clear that whatever you think of HTADDB it is written that way deliberately. If you don't understand why, or don't approve/appreciate/enjoy that choice, you should still be able to tell it's that way on purpose. I'm not brilliant on the weekends and then lose my mind during the week (although there are some weeks...)

Colin, for all his faults, is consistent. His personality enables me to go to some dark places, which I find interesting. How successful those storylines turn out to be is secondary to my need to just try stuff. The whole time travel storyline, for example, was a huge mess I barely held together, but it taught me a lot. One of the (few) advantages to writing for free is that I can do that. I'm not going to lose customers. I don't have any.

Similarly with the rape you mentioned. He was in a position where the girl he has regular sex with is under a spell that took away her memory and to break the spell he has to have sex with her, which she isn't willing to do because she has no idea who he is. Once he has sex with her, she'll get her memory back and won't care, but how he gets to that point is both horrific and darkly funny (to me at least). That sort of mindfuck is not something I can write about in a conventional story with a conventional lead. Nic would not do well in that narrative (plus I would get put on some sort of register).
