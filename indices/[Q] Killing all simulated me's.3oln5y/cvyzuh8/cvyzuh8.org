The real problem with Things of Interest is that it is difficult to formalize a system in which it is possible.

The story is basically throwing infinity at a problem and then saying "look, weird things probably happen when infinity is involved." Which is both obvious and not terribly relevant.

If you want a better example of infinity weirdness, consider the classic hats puzzle. You have a countably infinite line of people numbered 0, 1, .... Each person has a white or black hat. Each person can see the hats of everyone with a higher number but not their own or anyone behind them. Starting with 0 and going up, each person guesses what color hat they have. None of the people can hear each other's guesses or communicate in any way once they see the hats, though they can agree on a plan beforehand. Assuming axiom of choice, there is a strategy which guarantees that all but finitely many people guess correctly, even though this seems impossible.
