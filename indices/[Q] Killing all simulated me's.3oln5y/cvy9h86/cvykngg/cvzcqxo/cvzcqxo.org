Is the copy a perfect copy that doesn't even diverge after you created said copy? Like, once you start said copy, if you then decide to take an action knowing that there's a simulated copy of you will your copy take the same action?

If yes, chances are turning off the copy would be suicide.

If no, then the copy is distinct from you and deserves to live no less than you deserve to.
