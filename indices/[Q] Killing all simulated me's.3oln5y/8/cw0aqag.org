In such a situation, you must stop thinking of decisions you make as being made by you, for you, but rather as decisions being made by an infinite number of yous, for each of the infinity. Your decisions affect what happens to every simulation below you, but the fact that you would make such decisions at all makes it exceedingly likely that the simulations /above/ you would make the same decisions. Turn the box off, and it is almost 100% likely that someone above you chose to do that as well, and then you get turned off.
