rrobukef's argument as I understand it is:

- If you are identical to the person in the top universe, then, by some theories of consciousness halting another identical copy of yourself in a lower universe doesn't kill you in any way. (It doesn't matter how many redundant processors you run on, there is just one 'You', so halting all but one processor changes nothing.)

- If you aren't identical to the person in the top universe then your decisions aren't indicative of his decisions, and therefore choosing to spare the universes below yourself does not guarantee your safety.

Besides that... in the story the character does know which he is. He knows hes a simulation.
