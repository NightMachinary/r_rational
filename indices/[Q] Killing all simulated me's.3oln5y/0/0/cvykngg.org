You're not killing a world full of people. You're just stopping a full copy. There is no value in it. If you're in it you have no value. 'I as an equivalence class have no intrinsic value.' You should be saving entropy in your universe.

If you want them to have value they need to be different. And since the only way to make them different is to give them their number on the ladder. Which takes an infinite amount of space (and probably time).

I wouldn't know what to do if I knew a priori that I'm not a simulation. (But who cares about the 0%?) Don't care and you lose nothing, do care and multiply the amount of suffering and happiness with an arbitrary large number.
