First: simulated-you is still a person. Even if you're not simulating yourself and there's no causal relationship, turning off the simulation is still killing, well, a world-ful of people.

Second: the you that isn't being simulated (or the first you that diverges from the steady state going upwards) isn't you any more. Because when he turned around he didn't see a sphere. But the you directly above you and all the other ones up to the level where one of the yous had the idea of creating the sphere, they're all you and thinking and acting the same way. If you turn the simulation off, then so will all the yous up to that point because they're all identical. So you'll be gone.

The first one who didn't see the sphere, he might still exist because he may have made a different decision based on different inputs. He's also not the same as the one above him, because the one above him didn't think to create the sphere in the first place. But you're on a deeper turtle, one where it's statistically improbable that you aren't the highest level to consider turning it off.

So, it's probable that if you turn yourself off, the you in the level above did too.
