Technically, if all of me are /precisely/ identical, then turning off all the other copies of me will not destroy any information. For any of the simulated copies, being turned off would not be any different to being teleported into the place of the 'top' copy. The pattern continues.

However, due to quantum disturbances, the only way that all the copies could be precisely identical would be if their state was being continually refreshed from the top copy's state, in order to prevent them from diverging. So all the copies would be, effectively, mirror images of the top copy rather than separate lives. They can be created anew simply by switching the simulator back on - death would mean nothing to NI of me because it would be temporary and imperceptable. (And of course it would also be my choice.)

Now if the copies were allowed to /diverge/, that's a different philosophical question.
