Lets say you simulate yourself perfectly, standing in front of a box simulating yourself perfectly, standing in front of a box....

This goes on a while.

The point is that there are now NI simulated yous, and 1 'real' you.

*They are all identical, they will all make the same decision.*

They all have the same memories. They do not know they are simulations.

To each of them, they are on the top with NI simulated them's below.

If they decide to kill those below, all but 1 of them will die.

Because they have no information on which of them is the real one, that means there is a 1/NI chance that they will survive, and a NI-1/NI chance that they will die.

For reference, the air molecules in front of you have more of a chance of spontaneously reforming into a perfect copy of Elvis and beginning to dance.

So, you can either be a person who commits suicide NI-1 times, or one who doesn't.

Keeping in mind that the you thinking and making the decision has no idea which he is, no rational person chooses to kill themselves with near 100% probability.

So, that's why you don't turn yourself off.
