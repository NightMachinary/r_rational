Hey all!

Sorry for the delay, everyone. I got some new beta readers, and spent a lot of time dithering on what to do with the chapter. I ended up shortening it by about 3 pages because I felt Kakashi's backstory was not sufficiently different from canon (an issue which has been rightly pointed out by some of the reviewers) to justify including it in full, but I think the end result is better for it. If you still see any issues with the originality, flow, or style of writing, please do let me know in the comments below or send me a PM.

Anyway, the story should be going back to weekly updates now. Let me know if you enjoyed the chapter!
