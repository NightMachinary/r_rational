Ooh, review by Eaglejarl, this should be good.

#+begin_quote
  Very visual. I can see him clearly... Waves... nice bit of understated characterization... Okay, that was funny...
#+end_quote

I really like these little bits of blind feedback - it's something I rarely get to see otherwise, and it helps me get a feeling for what works and what falls flat. For example, my original betareader is not a Naruto reader and not a particular fan of rationalist fiction, and he thought the first part of the chapter was too cartoony. But now I know that you at least liked it, though I still have no idea what the rest of my readers think.

  Out of curiosity, you don't happen to be on Mac, do you? I've been trying to figure out how to type macrons and have failed to succeed. My fiction I write in raw HTML so obviously I can do it there, but it would be convenient for use in Marked for Death and other BBCode-based things.
#+end_quote

Sorry, no. I just add all the Naruto terms like j≈çnin to my dictionary, and then have Word correct it via spell check.

#+begin_quote
  Oooh, nice. I don't think I've seen that link before. Is it original, or is it from [fc]anon?
#+end_quote

Hmm, I've never seen it mentioned anywhere else, but I always figured it was implied: Kishi specifically stated that the Uzumaki were the original hosts and that they invented the technique to seal Kurama, and then they all mysteriously died right before the Kyubi's attack on Konoha. Seems like something the canon villain would have orchestrated in between starting Akatsuki and controlling the Mizukage.

  I really want every other character to turn to Kakashi and shout "SHUT UP, KAKASHI!" I get where he's coming from but yeesh. Dude, you're supposed to be a paranoid elite assassin/spy. Why are you objecting to a little extra security when it costs you nothing and someone else is doing all the work?
#+end_quote

I'll quote Jiraiya here from an earlier chapter: "Because fear and worry can kill you as sure as any shuriken." Being too stressed and overly cautious for too long a period of time will really wear on your nerves, and causes you to drop the ball when you actually need to be paranoid.

Or to put it in a different way: "Because being Kagome isn't /actually/ an advantage, all things considered".

#+begin_quote
  Why wouldn't he store it cooked if that's a thing he can do?
#+end_quote

Ahhh... good point, he totally would. Originally I had him store instant ramen instead, and Sakura complained about that, but I changed the wording to "uncooked ramen" because I wanted to get rid of the anachronisms in Naruto (Feudal Japan had no equivalent to instant ramen, I'm guessing). But you're right that now it makes no sense. Hmm...

#+begin_quote
  In your world, is it possible to put a campfire into a storage scroll? How are you defining "object"?
#+end_quote

My interpretation of chakra mechanics steers clear of ill-defined metaphysical terms, so yes it should be possible. The idea I have in mind is that you can story any object that is suffused with your chakra by placing it on top of a sealing scroll while you complete the seal. You can't suffuse fire with chakra I think (unless you're a fire user like Sasuke I guess) so an entire fire would be out, but hot charcoal would be possible, assuming you seal it along with a fireproof container so it doesn't burn the scroll as you seal it.

#+begin_quote
  Wait, what? It requires a jounin to use storage scrolls?
#+end_quote

No no, just to seal it. But the point is that it takes time for them to seal items, time which is better spent on the front lines - or if they do spend time sealing items, they're going to be using it themselves, not give those scrolls to lousy gennin.

#+begin_quote
  Nice choice to have him turn it into a teaching moment. The kids' reactions really frame their personalities, and that leads me to suspect that Kakashi may have done it partially as a psychological study to help him understand his students better.
#+end_quote

Heheh.

(Sometimes I worry that I'm being a bit too subtle with my hints and foreshadowing and hidden motivations, and that readers will miss it. But I guess in this case I did it just right.)

#+begin_quote
  Thanks for this; it was a fun chapter.
#+end_quote

Thank you very much for the feedback!
