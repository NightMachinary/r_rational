Okay, I'm awake at 6am and looking for something to read...hey, another chapter of TNTBS, cool. Okay, blind reading time.

#+begin_quote
  [description of Tazuna]
#+end_quote

Very visual. I can see him clearly.

#+begin_quote
  "I am the great...Waves."
#+end_quote

A little stilted, but maybe that's just Tazuna's speech style. As I understand it he's supposed to be pompous.

#+begin_quote
  "The land of waves doesn't have ninja"
#+end_quote

Waves

#+begin_quote
  "jōnin"
#+end_quote

Out of curiosity, you don't happen to be on Mac, do you? I've been trying to figure out how to type macrons and have failed to succeed. My fiction I write in raw HTML so obviously I can do it there, but it would be convenient for use in [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/marked-for-death-a-rational-naruto-quest.24481/][Marked for Death]] and other BBCode-based things.

#+begin_quote
  "Naruto barely heard [...] world."
#+end_quote

Really nice bit of understated characterization. I can picture this immediately, and have a very clear sense of how he's feeling.

#+begin_quote
  "The world's greatest [...] is there?"
#+end_quote

Oooh, nice. I don't think I've seen that link before. Is it original, or is it from [fc]anon?

#+begin_quote
  "Not to worry, I promise [...] alive.”
#+end_quote

Okay, that was funny.

#+begin_quote
  “Naruto, I appreciate you taking security seriously, but you know we're not actually at war, right?”
#+end_quote

I really want every other character to turn to Kakashi and shout "SHUT UP, KAKASHI!" I get where he's coming from but yeesh. Dude, you're supposed to be a paranoid elite assassin/spy. Why are you objecting to a little extra security when it costs you nothing and someone else is doing all the work?

#+begin_quote
  “What? I like ramen,” Naruto said defensively. “Just because I can store a cooked meal doesn't mean I've got to. Otherwise having more freedom would give me fewer options, and that's just silly.”
#+end_quote

Wait, what? He bought the ramen, he plans to eat the ramen, uncooked ramen isn't really good for anything aside from cooking or building contrived examples around in DADA class, and it's more time-efficient to cook large batches of food once instead of multiple small portions over time. If storage scrolls are time-frozen then storing cooked stuff in them is totally fine. Why wouldn't he store it cooked if that's a thing he can do? If he's worried about "more options giving him less freedom" then he should have figured this one out.

#+begin_quote
  and soon enough they were sitting around a small campfire, courtesy of Sasuke's fire technique.
#+end_quote

Hm, interesting tangent: In your world, is it possible to put a campfire into a storage scroll? How are you defining "object"? If a pile of logs can be considered an object, and the inside of a storage scroll is time-locked, then it seems like Naruto should be able to store logs (or at least a log) that happens to be on fire. Which, of course, has all kinds of military and civilian implications.

#+begin_quote
  “Ah, but that skill is even harder to come by. The Hidden Stone couldn't exactly afford to have their jōnin spend all their time storing supplies in scrolls for less skilled ninja to use, not when there was a war going on.”
#+end_quote

Wait, what? It requires a jounin to /use/ storage scrolls? Make them sure, but just /use/ them? I thought activating a seal was trivial -- certainly everyone throws explosive tags around easily enough.

#+begin_quote
  A rock ninja
#+end_quote

Rock

#+begin_quote
  [discussion about the Obito/Rin/Kakashi mission]
#+end_quote

Nice choice to have him turn it into a teaching moment. The kids' reactions really frame their personalities, and that leads me to suspect that Kakashi may have done it partially as a psychological study to help him understand his students better.

#+begin_quote
  “What do I think I did wrong?” [...] of course.”
#+end_quote

Ooh, sick burn.

Thanks for this; it was a fun chapter.
