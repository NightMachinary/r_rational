I just made a bunch of improvements to the site. Specifically: An email subscription option + RSS feed, recent comments visible on the home page, and a Table of Contents at the top of the page to make it easier to go to a specific chapter without having to scroll down and click 'next' or 'previous' each time.

I hope this makes the site more pleasant to use. Also, if anyone knows how to add 'next' or 'previous' to the top of each chapter also, or how to make it so I don't have to update the table of contents manually after each new chapter, please let me know.
