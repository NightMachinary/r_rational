The second season of the anime Re: Zero started this week. The first season was quite popular here four years ago, and the second one is looking quite good so far as well. Also there have been two excellent OVAs released in the meantime, I recommend them. They aren't required, but they add significantly to the world.

For those not familiar with Re: Zero, it's an anime where the main protagonist (Who gets Isekai'd) goes back in time when he dies, but does not otherwise have any amazing cheater powers. Unlike just about everyone he meets.

One of the great things about the show is that the main character doesn't just rise to the challenge all the time, he fails /miserably/ sometimes. He takes some /real/ emotional damage along the way, and forms attachments that become one sided when the people who got to know him no longer remember him after resets. He hurts so much. It's marvelous. Kotomine Kirei would be proud.
