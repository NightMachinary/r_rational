Multiplayer 4x games have this.. I'm not sure if it still exists but there were groups you could join where you played Civ V competitive online against other players. It's /very/ different from the singleplayer experience.

​

Completely different strategies, tactics, unit usefulness, build orders, diplomacy.. Yes betrayal, bluffs and all. People used to play in voice chat, negotiate through it and everything.

​

You can find some youtube videos of it. Also dominions 4 and 5, you can see some multiplayer series of that, same deal but the game is different.
