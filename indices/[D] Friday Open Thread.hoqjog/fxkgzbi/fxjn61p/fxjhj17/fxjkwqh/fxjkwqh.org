FWIW, [[https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/92415/skull][Skull]] is basically just social deception distilled to its purest form (you can play it with regular playing cards, just use a black card and three red cards each to represent the skull and the roses).

At the opposite end of the scale is [[https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/244992/mind][The Mind]] which exercises exactly the same people-reading skills, but cooperatively.

Both are jolly good fun.
