I've been toying with the idea of a numberless RPG.

Rather than a list of attributes and hit points, characters have a list of assets and afflictions.

*Assets* include /Wealth/, /Wisdom/, /Insight/, /Glory/, /Utility/, /Wanderlust/, /Minion/, and likely many others.

*Afflictions* include /Diseased/, /Wounded/, /Delirious/, /Destitute/, /Lost/, and other negative adjectives suitable for a player's setback.

Examples:

- A character has /Minion/, /Influence/ and /Wealth/ assets. The character spends a season grooming their /Minion/, a local caravan master, then spends their /Influence/ to promote this NPC into a merchant prince. They then spend their /Wealth/ and found a grand bazaar in their city.

- A character spends a season traveling, and has horrible misfortune. They arrive back in civilization again, with the /Wounded/ affliction, and must take an additional season to remove it.

At the moment, I'm thinking over conflict resolution in this game. I'm leaning toward a simple coin toss mechanism.

Actions will be categorized as follows:

*Trivial:* Action is automatically successful. Successful coin toss indicates the player may keep one asset they were planning to spend.

*Basic:* Action succeeds without coin toss.

*Challenging:* Toss a coin. If unsuccessful, player fails, loses an asset, and/or gains an affliction (GM's call as to which).

*Impossible:* Action cannot be attempted.

Does this system look workable? Are there ways that would make sense to modify it?
