I'm not quite sure if this is the right place to ask this, but whatever.

I like worldbuilding, I really do, but it seems that for the past few months I really can't get myself into the right headspace to actually do it. I can try getting vague ideas and outlines, but not any details.

I tried to get around it by generating a bunch of planets with the rules in GURPS:/Space/, but I don't seem to be able to replicate that success.
