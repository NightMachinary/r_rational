See thats kind of the opposite of what i thought.

I thought Homelander was the most interesting character...at first

He starts out pretty mysterious, you know he's strong but you don't know see much about him except that he's the leader. Then you see the justice league meeting and he's like 'lets tell stories about people we saved' or something like that.

He looks like a paragon of light among a bunch of shitheads. Perhaps he's so naive he doesn't see it, perhaps he is deliberately kept in the dark. It looks like he's lending his legitimacy to the rest of the crew. Cool, very interesting I was excited to watch.

Then they show that he's actually evil. Wow, he's hid it so well, no one knows except those who are about to die. Pretty cool, I wonder what his motivation is? Was this a greater good kind of thing? Has he convinced himself and everyone around him he's good while just rationalizing anything more complicated? Is he good? Maybe he's like hpmor Dumbledore who deliberately has Snape torment children, because Dumbledore he doesn't have any better ideas and he's ill equipped to handle the situation he's in and is just doing his best. But deep down, he's actually good? Or maybe there's a greater evil here that we're not seeing and we just don't understand the whole situation yet. Or maybe he's evil and he's palpatine-ing the organization from the inside!

Then they show that basically everyone is aware of him being evil within the group and he's just a creepy asshole with a lot of power, at the lead of a relatively corrupt group. It just feels a bit cliche. Every reveal removes depth from the character/situation and he ends looking pretty 2d in my opinion.

Its around that point that I lost all interest and stopped watching.
