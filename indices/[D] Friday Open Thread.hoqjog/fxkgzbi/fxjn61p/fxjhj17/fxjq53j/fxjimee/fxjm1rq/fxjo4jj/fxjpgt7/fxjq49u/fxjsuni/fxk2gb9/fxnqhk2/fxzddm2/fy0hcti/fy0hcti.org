Well, one thing that greatly benefits the show is the change of zeitgeist between 2006 to 2018. Superhero movies were much less of a hot market in the mid 2000s, so right off the bat, the comic felt like it was beating a dead-horse. It didn't help the theme seemed to basically be "nah nah, superheroes are for idiots."

The show meanwhile came out in a post MCU world, where superhero movies are obnoxiously over-saturated. And the show is a much more pointed critque of media capitalism and celebrity culture in general.
