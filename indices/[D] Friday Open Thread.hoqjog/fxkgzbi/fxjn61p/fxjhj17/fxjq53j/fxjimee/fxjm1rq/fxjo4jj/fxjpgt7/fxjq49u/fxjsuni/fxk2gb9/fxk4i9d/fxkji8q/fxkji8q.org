The ending episodes of the show give more context to his motivations and background.

None of the information is world shattering as far as the audience's view of the character goes. But he becomes a more respectable villain IMO because you can see why he's doing what he's doing. And also (Mild spoiler) He's more competent than you're initially lead to believe, and not just a man child grabbing for political power he can't control
