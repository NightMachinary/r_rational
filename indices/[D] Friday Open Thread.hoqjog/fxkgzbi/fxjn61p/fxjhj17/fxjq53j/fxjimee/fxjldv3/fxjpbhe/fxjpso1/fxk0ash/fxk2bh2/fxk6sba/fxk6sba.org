I also tend to have a lot of fun when I can play with skills and attributes to control the outcomes. That said, the fundamental principle I'd like to stick to here is to keep the game numberless to see how it affects the storytelling (I suspect it may enhance the game narrative if I pull it off right).

The coin toss isn't intended to be a strict pass/fail mechanism, so much as a way to add some randomness to make play less completely deterministic.

Players will still have agency in deciding what tasks they'd choose to undertake. The game is intended to have a competitive side, so there would still be wheeling and dealing between players, as well as a time element. (The earlier season automatically wins when this happens; the coin toss is a tiebreaker.) A later season would not be wasted if someone beat them to the punch; they'd simply have to re-use that season on a different action.
