My main issue with Re:Zero - and we did watch the whole first season - is I found the main character utterly narcissistic, and if he learned / improved at all on this front (debatable) it happened much too slowly to make me start caring about what happened to him.

Normally with a timeloop, the fun is watching the character progress; but here it feels like he only ever stumbles into doing the right thing accidentally after trying everything else, every time, even when other characters repeatedly straight up explain to him how his narcissism has been at the root of his pains.

Do we know if this aspect improves later? - does he actually get less obnoxious? - I mean, surely he must do eventually, that's usually the entire point of this story pattern; - so I guess I'm really asking, for anyone who's read the source material, do we know if he's likely to change much this season, or are they saving it all for some later climax?
