I absolutely despise the main character. I've heard people call him 'realistic' or a 'deconstruction', but to me, he can /at best/ be an unkind, poorly-thought-out caricature of an otaku. Never seen a real person in my life that acted with such... obnoxiousness. Even the most socially-awkward people I know are miles better than him, and with better self-preservation instincts, too. And even if he /were/ realistic, I still wouldn't enjoy watching him /at all/. There are ways to use an unlikable protagonist, or a protagonist that is a bad person. Re:Zero didn't convince me it knows how.

I can't believe he's anything more than a tool through which the author can inflict thinly-veiled failure porn. Maybe other people have different standards than me, can see the show in the better light. But I've read a lot of positive reviews and analyses, and they didn't really make an impression on me, so...
