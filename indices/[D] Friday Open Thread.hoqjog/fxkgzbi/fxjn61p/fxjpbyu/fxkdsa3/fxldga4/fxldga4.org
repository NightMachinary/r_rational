I think, instead of an obnoxious otaku caricature, those parts were /supposed/ to come off as a big mess of unhealthy coping mechanisms. I could easily buy Subaru's infatuation with Emilia, his peppy happiness, and his dogged determination being his mind desperately trying to create some narrative where his transportation to this world and all the suffering he's endured since all has /purpose/.

Thing is, though, if that were true, it's not showing. Maybe it's true and more clear in the LNs, but in that case the anime is a bad adaptation that turns Subaru from a tragic mess to a caricature of an idiot otaku.
