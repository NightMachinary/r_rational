A couple of months ago I started a forecasting newsletter, which I've since been refining. [[https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/5pMawW5pCA85tRcQg/forecasting-newsletter-june-2020][Here]] is the link for the last iteration (and [[https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/TDssNnJsZmiLkhzC4/forecasting-newsletter-may-2020][here]] for the much longer one before).

On the one hand, I feel this tangentially related to some of the interests of this subreddit (e.g., [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/ccbokt/d_mother_of_learning_finale_predictions_spoilers/etmx5mk/?context=8&depth=9][betting on things]] (spoilers for Mother of Learning)). On the other hand, a couple of years ago I signed up to an arachnology newsletter which I've found amusing ever since. Anyways, may the mighty moderators show mercy upon this comment.

In particular, there are several forecasting tournaments running right now which readers might be interested in joining: - if you're interested in money: [[https://www.replicationmarkets.com/][Replication Markets]]. - If you're interested in attempting to change the world ("influencing policymakers"): [[https://www.cset-foretell.com/][Foretell]]. - If you're interested in rapid iteration: [[https://www.metaculus.com/][Metaculus]]. - If you're interested in lots of questions and lots of other forecasters, [[https://www.gjopen.com/][Good Judgment Open]] or Metaculus.
