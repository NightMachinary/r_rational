I think my favourite aspect of board games that aren't captured well by any other genre of game is social manipulation and deception. Like in Risk, building alliances and choosing the right time to break them is very important, and not an experience to get elsewhere. Many other games are much better war simulators, or are more fun to try to calculate specific probabilities of whether you'll achieve victory, but few other games are so much negiotiating with people.

Similarly with One Night Ultimate Werewolf, trying to figure out who is lying and catching people in lies is a fairly unique experience to that genre of card game. And I love it and find it a lot of fun. There's some probability work, but it's really measuring how good of a liar you are.
