Yep. It's either too easy or impossible to hide information in video games often, so betrayal just feels unfair there. But in board games, if you get betrayed, it's probably on you.

But the most frustrating thing is when you get betrayed, and the betrayer doesn't even win- they jist screw it up so a third person wins.
