Me too! Bluffing games get to use humans as a component and those are way more interesting than what can be contained in the rulebook. I also like dexterity games, which get to import all of physics.

Bluffing game recs:

- Cockroach Poker - Almost the entire game is "is this person lying?" or "are all my friends spontaneously conspiring to lie to me?" Lying and telling the truth are mechanically identical, it's just a matter of identifying which. It's replaced Skull as the most pure bluffing game my group plays.

- Coup - Still a classic. I like that lying in this game is a purely proactive self-driven choice. You never need to lie in Coup, but you probably won't win if you don't.

- Sheriff of Nottingham - The theme of this (basically lying to a customs agent) and the rotation of who gets to be a corrupt official abusing their power, makes this pretty funny.

- Fake Artist Goes To New York - Hybrid bluffing/art game. It's a very funny setup.

Bluffing-adjacent game recs:

- Welcome To The Dungeon - Kind of like Blackjack but each player can only see some of the cards, and you have to infer whether the hand has busted or not from a mix of your information and what other players have done. I love this game but it doesn't click for a lot of people.

- 6-Nimnt - Kind of like Blackjack crossed with some sort of rock paper scissors prisoner's dilemma game theory thing. You have to guess what other players are going to play, but up to eight people can play at once so it's also part luck.
