...I mean, that's the main theme in the second half of the first season. He hits a low point with trying to declare himself Emilia's knight, getting gruesomely humiliated, and revealing his delusions and fucked up desire to be so important she can't live without him. The rest of the season after that is him having bottomed out and trying to climb out of the pit he put himself in. He has to acknowledge that he's basically useless on his own and needs to rely on others, even (especially) that knight he hates who carried out much of his humiliation.

I don't think it's accurate at all to dismiss him as narcissistic toward the end - the plot bends over backwards to beat that out of him. He's still /sassy/, but he learns that he is not very capable on his own and starts paying a lot more attention not just to how potential allies are useful, but to who they are and what they want. In the first episode of season two this continues, something bad happens (Surprise) and his immediate concern is minimizing damage done to others and looking for ways to restore what damage has been done. It doesn't gain him anything. It doesn't help him pursue Emilia. It isn't something he believes is easy to accomplish. He hates doing it, but he puts himself through crap to help other characters.
