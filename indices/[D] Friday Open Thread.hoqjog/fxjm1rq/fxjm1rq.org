I was trying to recommend Worth the Candle to some friends, in the context of recommending various D&D-inspired fiction. So I went looking for a sample that would

- be a few paragraphs long at most
- make sense when read on its own
- be fairly representative of what's good about WtC
- not a massive spoiler

(And also not show too much of the videogame aspect of it, since I was presenting it as D&D-inspired.)

This is surprisingly difficult! For comparison I was easily able to find a good [[https://i.imgur.com/Tpd558P.jpg][sample]] for [[https://readcomiconline.to/Comic/Dungeons-Dragons-2010/Issue-0?id=49727][IDW's D&D comic]], and [[https://i.imgur.com/JEpILGO.gif][one]] for [[https://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0001.html][The Order of the Stick]] - but those are comics.

I narrowed it down to [[https://imgur.com/a/xUtKxOL][six options]] and eventually picked [[https://i.imgur.com/7abGMpi.png][this one]], but I can't say I'm really satisfied with any of them.

 

This is also prep work for a blog post I'm thinking about writing to explain and recommend more ratfics, for my normie friends. I'm often asked what I'm currently reading, and really want to talk about it, but find myself unable to do so without a shitload of weird context. "So I'm reading this litRPG insekai harem deconstruction rational webfic... oh, you know about 'deconstruction', great let's talk about all the other words."
