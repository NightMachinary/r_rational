Yeah, if you're just showcasing, you should try to cut down how much you're showing as much as possible to retain interest. One or two paragraphs each. You could use bits of some of the parts you posted above, and they would work fine, but posting a whole screen of text isn't great if it's part of a larger post, because it bloats the wordcount.
