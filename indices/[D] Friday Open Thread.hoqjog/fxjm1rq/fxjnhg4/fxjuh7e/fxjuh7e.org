Another fun one:

  Can I talk, for a moment, about how fucking dumb it was that Aerb had tides? Both the Sun, Celestar, and the stars were in the same apparent position no matter where you were on Aerb, so even if there were gravitation from those sources, it wouldn't have caused anything that was much like tides on Earth (in theory, the sun's gravity should have pulled everything to the east at dawn, then everything to the west at dusk), and anyhow, the tides were hexal, meaning low tide happened at the same time no matter where you were on Aerb. So then where the fuck was all that water going or coming from? There were even spring tides and neap tides, caused, on Earth, by whether the sun and moon were working in concert or in opposition, but on Aerb ... who fucking knew. Every day, 1020 liters of water were displaced, and there were a whole bunch of complex theories about how it was happening or why, but the tides went in and the tides went out, and no one could explain it.

Slightly spoilery, but not too bad. You could remove Onion's name and it would be fine:

  If I had been fully myself, I might have told him off for being such a fucking cliche. What was next, was he going to remove the weights that he'd been training with? Was he going to reveal that he'd had his eyes closed the whole time? Or reveal that his sword was actually some super special sword forged by blah blah blah, its true power kept from me because displaying it before this audience would ---

  “This sword once belonged to Uther Penndraig,” said Onion. “It was one of his last acquisitions. We've pretended, for five hundred years, that all it would do is copy the powers of the sword you were fighting against. It's far, far better than that. If pride is another of your sins, you may take pride in the fact that you are the person that caused me to reveal it to the world.”

And then a virtue:

  Thrown Weapons 50, Richoshot: You can bounce thrown weapons off surfaces without respect to normal physics, up to three times in a row. Weapons bounced in this way do not have to follow the angles dictated by physics, the weapon does not lose speed, and you do not have to have clear sight to secondary surfaces or the target. Attacks made in this way provide a ten percent surprise bonus to attack, because this is stupid and should not work.
