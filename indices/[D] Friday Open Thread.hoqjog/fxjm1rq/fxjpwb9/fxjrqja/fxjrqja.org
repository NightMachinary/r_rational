  The old D&D group isn't the main plotline, so it's an odd way to rec.

Yeah, that's what made me dissatisfied with that excerpt.

On the other hand, it shows chemistry, rules-lawyering, creative and politically-aware world-building, and the enduring relevance of the real world (sadly unusual in insekai), which are among WtC's best qualities.

Most in-Aerb conversations with those properties are super-high-context and spoiler-heavy, though you can see I've showcased some of them in my other excerpts.
