Lady Blackbird is a free one shot RPG with a similar approach, you can look at that. For conflict resolution, you tally up all your relevant skills (e.g Guns, Fighting, and Bravery for a gunfight), roll a dice for each skill, and get 1 point for every 4+ you get. Then if your points are > than the difficulty the DM set for the conflict, you succeed.
