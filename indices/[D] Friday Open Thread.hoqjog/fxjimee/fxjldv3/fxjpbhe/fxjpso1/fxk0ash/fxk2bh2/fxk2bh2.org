I don't have a problem with a challenging game. My critique of 50/50 coin toss RNG is that to play a game, decisions have to matter. With a cointoss, it almost doesn't matter what I do.

I'm of the min/maxing type, heavy boardgamer. Unless I really liked the people I play with I wouldn't want to play a cointoss based game.
