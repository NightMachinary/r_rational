Thank you! Details follow:

Players are each in possession of a "Power Seed" - an internal source of quasi-magical energy. Each seed progresses as the player accomplishes goals that align with their power. The stages are New, Intermediate, and Mature.

The play is intended to be long term, taking place over about a year at a time. During this year, every player has /Spring/, /Summer/, and /Autumn/ assets, each representing an investment of time.

Each player additionally gains assets based on their seed type and stage. An Envoy Seed produces /Influence/, for example. With rare exceptions, assets are intended to be tradable.

I'll need to think this over a bit more. I agree that more assets is better, but I don't want the players to have more than one of the same asset.
