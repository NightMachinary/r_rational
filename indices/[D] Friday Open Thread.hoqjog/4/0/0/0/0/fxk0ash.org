I understand this concern.

It looks like the Challenging difficulty is potentially frustrating. This is somewhat by design, but I'll still need to be careful with it.

One of the ideas I've had is that true character growth comes from resilience in the face of failure. I'd reflect this by having a failed task give an alternate reward in the way of a /Grit/ asset, which would be required for a subsequent task.
