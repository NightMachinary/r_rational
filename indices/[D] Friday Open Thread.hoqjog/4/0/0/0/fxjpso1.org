Yeah, that aspect is fine, the whole "50/50, no influence possible" thing is the problem. Snakes and Ladders is very widely hated among adults, you don't get any influence on the die roll.

Whereas "Man, don't get angry" still has roll-to-move but you can select which of your 4 meoples you move. Like, its not a great game but tons better. Theres a minimal set of decision making that makes games playable, coin-tosses are not.
