If you are doing coin tosses as conflict resolution you might es well not have any randomness and just do a purely storydriven approach to it. Characters who are /wealthy/ should get better coin tosses/dice than non-wealthy ones at wealth-stuff. Thats the whole point for a large portion of players, to not just have 50/50% every time.

As an example of a RPG that does very well without RNG conflict resolution, Fiasco is very good, lots of fun and 1.5 page rules.

Numenara has something in the same vein as your assets. Haven't played it but studied the source book. â€œI am a [fill in an adjective here] [fill in a noun here] who [fill in a verb here]". eg Swift Shieldbearer who Rides The Lightning".

Conflict resolution is done via dice, but you are trained in your specialties, which gives you more dice.
