I think the anyblade section you picked out works better. The old D&D group isn't the main plotline, so it's an odd way to rec. If you want to play up the D&D thing, something like your unicorn example is good, as it shows the embedded story.

And yeah, you're right it's hard! I thought there'd be a good excerpt in the elevator scene, but no, everything in this story is tucked away across across multiple chapters of setup and buildup.

edit: I got ninja'd by sucutumbo. That's a very nice excerpt.
