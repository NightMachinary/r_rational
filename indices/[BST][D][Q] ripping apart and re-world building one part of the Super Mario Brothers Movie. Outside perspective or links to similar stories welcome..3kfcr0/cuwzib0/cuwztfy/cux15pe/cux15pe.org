Yeah, that's pretty much why I find the concept of an intelligent dinosaur interesting.

My best current insight on Fermi's Paradox is that I think people overestimate the likelihood of a species intellectually capable of developing civilization actually developing it. I therefore suspect that the likelihood of "intelligent life" evolving is potentially higher than most people estimate, but there's an additional probability to consider, the probability of intelligent life using its intelligence to form a civilization, which is potentially very low.

I would be surprised, but not that surprised, to learn that at least one animal on the Earth today is intellectually capable of forming civilization but simply has not, and they are impeded by physiological differences - probably either octopi or dolphins, seeing as crows and non-human primates come into contact with humans regularly enough that you'd expect that humans would have rubbed off on them. I think it's worth putting a lot of research money into making absolutely certain that we can't establish a line of conlang-based communication with dolphins, and octopi, too, however crazy that sounds.

I would be legitimately very surprised if I learned humans were the first species in the Earth's history to be intellectually capable of developing civilization.
