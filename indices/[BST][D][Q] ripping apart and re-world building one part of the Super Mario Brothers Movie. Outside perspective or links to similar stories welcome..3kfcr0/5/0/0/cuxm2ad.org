the other question is whether or not another intelligent species would have enough overlap in language development and capabilities that they would be able to be introspective and philosophical in the way that you suggest re: pondering their existence.

If they lack the language, they'd would be unable to conceptualize advanced concepts. also, being the first of a new species (or isolated), the language they'd need to use would be a human language and their tongue and brain may struggle to articulate and comprehend it properly.
