I think it stretches credibility for the recipient of the egg to have an intense curiosity about the intelligence of the creature it hatches, as least in the above scenario. For a collector to both love curios and discovering the scientific origin of each might work, but you'd have to spend time teaching the reader that is the character of the collector, and you didn't create a fragmentary person for whose sole purpose in life is to care for this egg.
