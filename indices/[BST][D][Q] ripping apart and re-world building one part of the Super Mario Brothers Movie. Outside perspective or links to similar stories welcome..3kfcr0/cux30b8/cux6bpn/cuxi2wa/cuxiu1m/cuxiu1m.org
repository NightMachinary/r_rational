The second is the concept I'm thinking of running with. Which brings me I guess to wondering just who in new york (for arbitrary source material nod and because I like the accent I'm thinking brooklyn) would satisfy the following criteria:

- Keep a ostrich sized egg for the few moments before it 'hatches' without freaking out entirely.

- Be willing to both keep and potentially compensate the needs of exotic weird bird for a few years?

I'm having trouble conceiving of just who would fullfill the second criteria, which is lending itself to me thinking that maybe our princess gets pawned off to some kind of 'expert' in exotic animals relatively early on but I dunno.
