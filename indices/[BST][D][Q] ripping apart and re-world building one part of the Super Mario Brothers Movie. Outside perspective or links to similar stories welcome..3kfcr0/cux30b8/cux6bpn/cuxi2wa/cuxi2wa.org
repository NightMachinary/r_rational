I suppose my first thought was to imagine how people react to others who are far outside the norm for humans. Like, [[http://mentalfloss.com/article/50078/true-stories-behind-11-famous-sideshow-performers][check this article]] about sideshow performers, notably Elephant Man and the Lion-Faced Man. If the from is close enough to human, people might just treat the princess like one of those people (which in the 80s and 90s probably /doesn't/ mean sticking her in a sideshow). You can plausibly explain away a whole host of "physical deformities" that just make her "look similar to" a dinosaur.

If the princess is more like a /Jurassic Park/ dinosaur but with feathers and human-level intelligence ... I think the outcome is more likely that you get an animal that's raised like an animal, resulting in a severe level of developmental retardation. Eventually, if it has the ability to speak and learns speech as a human does, that's where things get truly interesting.
