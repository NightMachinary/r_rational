I'm reminded of the webcomic Freefall. The main character was a wolf that was genetically modified to be intelligent. These wolves were originally supposed to only exist in the lab. Their designer didn't like that idea, and arranged for them to "accidentally" get sold to people who thought they were regular dogs. The main character's mother said nothing can prepare you for when your puppy is in your lap and then starts talking to you.
