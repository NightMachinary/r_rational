I feel like something capable of mimicking humans to that extent would have to be quite bright; maybe brighter than us. Certainly brighter than us /on average/. After all, they'd have none of the requisite instincts, right?

Imagine a high-functioning autistic person, who deduced pitch-perfect social behaviour from extrapolation.

It'd make an interesting excuse for a "rational" protagonist, I must admit, although it would be tough to write in first person. (And very /Ex Machina/ -like if it was in second-person.)
