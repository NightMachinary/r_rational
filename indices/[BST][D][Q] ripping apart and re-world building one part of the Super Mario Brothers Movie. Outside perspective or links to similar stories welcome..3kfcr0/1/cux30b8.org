It depends on how it's presented to the public.

There's a /huge/ difference between "this animal can talk" and "this person looks like an animal". If it's the former, expect it to be treated more or less like an intelligent monkey until the point that it can talk, after which there would be considerable attention (and people might contextualize it as a weird human rather than a true reptile). If it's the latter ... there would be some stories, especially in the tabloids, but a human with an interesting deformity isn't necessarily national news, especially in an age where people are becoming more politically correct.

To some extent, it also depends on how much attention that dinosaur gives to the media. If it stays indoors, eventually the media will stop paying attention. If it goes out a lot, people are going to take note. If it decides to go on talk shows, it would probably be a national sensation, at least for a little bit (as fame is fleeting).
