A starting premise - have her egg found and bought by a rich collector of curios in a shop of miscellany, and placed in his always roaring hearth as a conversation piece. The egg, heated by the hearth, hatches, and the collector treats the hatchling as his most interesting curio to date. He contracts experts etc. who determine she's of comparable intelligence to a human child, and thereafter he comes to view it as his daughter.
