That is the problem I think... I was originally imagining some one who would actually have very little understanding of exactly what they got but it strains credibility that they would subsequently KEEP some WIERD ANIMAL at the same time...

honestly on reflection I think it's more important to find some one that would hold onto the animal afterwards without it straining credibility rather then some one who could credibly get a mysterious egg.

Random doohickies can end up almost anywhere...

I was contemplating maybe the egg is actually found in an 'alcove' that was carved/buried in the bedrock of a skyscraper's foundation and some construction worker just nabbed it after the blasting revealed the egg (along with destroying several others presumably).
