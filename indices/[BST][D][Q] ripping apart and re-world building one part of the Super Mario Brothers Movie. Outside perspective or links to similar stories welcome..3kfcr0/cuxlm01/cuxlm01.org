I caught the tail-end of a story on Radiolab about a chimp named Lucy that is relevant and interesting.

[[http://www.radiolab.org/story/91706-lucy/]]

Imagine a tweenager that can rip your arms off when she gets frustrated with you. and she has the intelligence and emotions of a toddler. Despite trying to raise her in a loving home environment, she grew too strong for her family to care for properly. They ended up locked her up at home and cycled through numerous animal handlers until they found one that would accompany her in a transition back to the wild (but just like how we'd be out of place in the wild, the semi-domesticated chimp also suffers from a severe adjustment disorder.) Ironically, the animal handler locked herself up in a cage while she helped the chimps transition to the wild.

edit: my point is that even with a close genomic relative, we currently struggle with integration for another intelligent species. I'd shudder to think about how we'd raise a DINOSAUR that wouldn't eat us in our sleep.
