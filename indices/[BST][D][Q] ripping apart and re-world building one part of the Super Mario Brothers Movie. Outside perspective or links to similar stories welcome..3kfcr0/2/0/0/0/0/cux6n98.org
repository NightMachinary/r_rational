Oh. Well then, imagine two types of gun.

One "simply" activates atavisms in your genome, and "regenerates" your body into taking the new shape coded for, granting you body fur and tail for humans, putting teeth in chickens...

The other does the same kind of genetic revision trick, but it scans the other life on the planet to reconstruct phylogeny so it knows what it should be turning you into.

Sufficiently-advanced-technology level, but not absurd for a civilization of intelligent beings that's been around for 65 million years.
