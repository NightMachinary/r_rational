If you're gonna rebuild it, I would suggest changing the "evolutionary lines" of some things. For example... Toads, Goombas, and Princess Toadstool? Not supposed to be dinosaurs. Fungus. Dinosaurs didn't evolve from fungus. A devolution gun shouldn't turn them back into dinosaurs because they never were one. And using the devolution gun on Koopas shouldn't turn them into fungus. Because they never were one.

But that's because evolution is sort of my pet thing and I grump when it's misportrayed.

To answer your question of:

  What if we actually had something like a real dinosaur tool user of broad comparable ability to human intelligence and vocalization maybe around the size of the medium sized therapods (perhaps with an even better range).

  How would people deal with an animal that doesin't stay cute and 'stupid' but gets smart enough to both sass, ask difficult questions ponder about her own existence and figure out how to resolve any tool/technical challenges posed to it (or at least as good as a curious teenager-yound adult human).

  How would the rest of the world deal with this thing?

  Especially in the eighties and early nineties?
