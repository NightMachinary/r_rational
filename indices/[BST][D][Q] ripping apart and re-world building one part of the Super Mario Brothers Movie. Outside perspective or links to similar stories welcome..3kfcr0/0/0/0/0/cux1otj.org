Well it's tricky to determine how 'smart' something is based on the fossil record.

And it's a bit cliche but eusociality has already been around for I think 100 million years.

Which bares striking resemblance to a civilization.

I think the wierd melange of political arms racing and tool refinement that humans have stumbled into is probably pretty rare.

But for the purpose of this discussion I am posing that it's happened at least once more on the same planet.

That said there is enough room in a technological arms racing civ 100-80 million years ago to completely surpass present capabilities and leave them looking like pondscum.

So that might be the best 'background' explanation for a dinosaur 'princess' egg showing up in new york as any.
