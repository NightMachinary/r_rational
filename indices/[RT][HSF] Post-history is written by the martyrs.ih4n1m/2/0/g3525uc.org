To me, it seemed like GPT3's ability to flood the internet with content is being used not to be god, but to prevent a god-like AI. In other words, if all of the training data is written by AI, then it can't be used to train an AI beyond what GPT3 was trained on already. At least... as long as you don't already have an AI that can positively train itself recursively on its own output, which you can't get with JUST the existing data which is why the paranoia about archives of the historical internet.

However, the end result of all of this is a society where GPT3 controls almost all human communication. And the paranoia of a god-like AI was fanned by a research paper written conclusively by an AI. So there is, of course, the chance that the god-like AI already won and has taken over humanity, and the whole society is a look at a post-AI apocalypse with an emphasis on us having come to terms by thinking we won.
