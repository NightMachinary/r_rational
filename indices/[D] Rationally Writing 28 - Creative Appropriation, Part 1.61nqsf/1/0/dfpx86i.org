I've heard a bit about that tradition, but I haven't read any of the titles you mention (in large part because I don't speak Russian). I've read /The Last Ringbearer/, though, which I'd definitely call a remake instead of plagiarism - would you say that's a decent representative of the tradition?

(I've also read [[http://www.young-0.com/excerpt][this translation of the Chinese /Harry Potter and Leopard Walk Up To Dragon/]], which's so bad it's good. I'm not going to even try comparing the Russian tradition to that, though.)
