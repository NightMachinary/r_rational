I've read all the "classics" when I was a kid, but I'm mostly familiar with the originals only by Pop-Cultural Osmosis. The accepted wisdom is that they are not cheap pieces of trash to profit on the similarity e.g. like the modern "mockbusters", but "good faith" high quality remakes, but that could be just collective nostalgia. And not to give you the wrong idea, the cycle continues to this day. You can find direct translations of the originals if you put you mind to it, but the "remakes" are still the more widespread default option for these works.

For /Tanya Grotter/ I mostly just know that it exists. Before HPMOR I was pretty dismissive of /Harry Potter/ (and I still am, I just finally finished the books to get all the references in HPMOR like the Hallows), so obviously I wasn't and isn't interested in a culturally adapted "forgery".
