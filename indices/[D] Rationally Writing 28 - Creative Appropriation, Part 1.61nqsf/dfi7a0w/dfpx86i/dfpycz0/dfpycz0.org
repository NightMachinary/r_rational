  I've read The Last Ringbearer, though, which I'd definitely call a remake instead of plagiarism - would you say that's a decent representative of the tradition?

I'd say not. /The Last Ringbearer/ is more like HPMOR in essence, since it's a "subversive" fanfic. There are two other prominent LotR fanfictions in the vein of "Sauron did nothing wrong": [[https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9A%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8C%D1%86%D0%BE_%D0%A2%D1%8C%D0%BC%D1%8B][The Ring of Darkness / Кольцо Тьмы]] and [[https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A7%D1%91%D1%80%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F_%D0%BA%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B3%D0%B0_%D0%90%D1%80%D0%B4%D1%8B][The Black Book of Arda / Черная книга Арды]]. All three of them are published books, so you could say that they're a part of the same tradition of "legalized fanfiction". But the four titles I mentioned are more "straight" remakes of the original stories (again, some more blatant than others, the first book of /The Wizard of the Emerald City/ is the worst offender, it is almost exactly the same story, /Doctor Aybolit/ and /Hottabych/ are the least, a good lawyer probably could convince a court that they're only /inspired by/, not plagiarism, /Buratino/ is somewhere in the middle).

UPD: Forgot to say that /Kids vs. Wizards/ *is* close in spirit to HPMOR and /The Last Ringbearer/, except that it's a trash propaganda (or a troll so good, it's indistinguishable from trash propaganda).
