Regarding your mention of /Tanya Grotter/, you may be interested to know that in ex-USSR it's somewhat of a time honored tradition to write "remakes" instead of translations. Nobody /really/ cares about /Tanya Grotter/ all that much, but there are accepted "classics", namely:

- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wizard_of_the_Emerald_City][The Wizard of the Emerald City / Волшебник Изумрудного города]] for /The Wizard of Oz/
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buratino][The Golden Key or the Adventures of Buratino / Золотой ключик или Приключения Буратино]] for /The Adventures of Pinocchio/
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazar_Lagin][Old Man Hottabych / Старик Хоттабыч]] for /The Brass Bottle/ by F. Anstey
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Aybolit][Doctor Aybolit / Доктор Айболит]] for /Doctor Dolittle/

And even though it's all pretty blatant (some more blatant than others), since these were the only versions the people knew, imprinting and nostalgia are strong forces, so people would squirm and find excuses if you suggest plagiarism, e.g. /The Wizard of the Emerald City/ is at worst *very* AU fanfiction from the second book onward, not /really/ plagiarism.

There's also something similar to /My Immortal/ in infamy, if not in content, [[https://www.pri.org/stories/2016-03-07/lights-camera-propaganda-russias-paranoid-patriotism-gets-cartoon-movie][Kids vs Wizards / Дети против волшебников]], where you can't really tell whether it's serious raging religious nationalist anti-Rowling anti-West propaganda or a super massive troll.
