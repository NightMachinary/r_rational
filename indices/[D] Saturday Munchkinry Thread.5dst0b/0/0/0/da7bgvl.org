  Would you be able to climb a stone wall by forming handholds and footholds? If it is effectively wet clay, it seems likely that it'd just slip and fall with your weight dangling on it.

You could wear fingerless gloves or something for climbing. Dig into the stone with the tips of your fingers, hold yourself there with the covered (and thus powerless) sides of your hands.
