You have a bracelet that allows you to shape solid stone as though it were wet clay. All stone becomes malleable to you. It's not /actually/ wet, nor does it lose its normal properties, so when you're in the process of shaping it someone else could come along, poke it, and feel stone. The bracelet only affects your body; you can't shape stone using tools like knives, scrapers, wires, etc.

(Unless it's really neat, I'd prefer answers that limit tech level to 1700s, since it's for a fantasy story I'm in the middle of writing.)
