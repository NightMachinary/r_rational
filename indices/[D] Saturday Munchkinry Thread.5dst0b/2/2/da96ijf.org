"Expect" is a tricky term. If you expect X, it will happen, and the knowledge of this will give you a reason to expect X. And if you don't expect X, it won't happen, and the knowledge of this will give you a reason not to expect X. So if you're a perfect logical reasoner, you should be able to make X happen by expecting it--you normally can't control what you expect since your expectations logically follow from facts about the universe, but in this unusual case, you can.

If you're not a perfect logical reasoner, your ability to expect things will probably be constrained by instinctive "expectations" such as thinking that when you get shot, you'll be hurt. Exactly how well you do depends on how well you can make your expectations depend on reasoning and nothing else.

(Also, can you use this power to clone yourself by expecting yourself to undergo fission?)
