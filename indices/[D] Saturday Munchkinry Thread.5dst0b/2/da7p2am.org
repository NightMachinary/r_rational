You are afflicted by reverse body dysmorphia; your body will always be in the condition/shape/etc. that you expect it to be in. However, you are initially unaware of this. Therefore, if you get shot, you suffer from what you /think/ are the effects of a gunshot wound. This also means you cannot be anesthetized and murdered in your sleep or while unconscious, because you would not be aware of it and therefore it would not happen to your body.

Otherwise, normal human psyche and and body.
