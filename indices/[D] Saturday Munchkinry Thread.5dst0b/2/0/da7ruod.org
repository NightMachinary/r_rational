Hypnosis or pathological affirmation exercises? I'm invincible enough, I'm unstoppable enough, and gosh darnit, people find me undeniably attractive. Not sure how to become aware of it, unless you needed some kind of surgery where the disconnect between your beliefs and surgical reality made a surgeon say something that gave you a clue. But that would likely just lead to a distrust of doctors, instead of thinking your body was psychomorphic.
