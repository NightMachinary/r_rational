Hm, perhaps in that it can ignore injury based on the psyche's perception of injury, it may be that it has to follow the rules of biophysics - for example, breathing fire is possible, but you'd have to eat a bunch of ammonia beforehand.

So, you could lift and throw a car, but you'd do a wringer in your muscle fibers, unless you'd eaten a bunch of coal recently and really meditated on carbon nanoweaves.

So, to answer your question more specifically, I supposed the 'normal' would depend on what materials your body had to work with in order to fulfill your /pro/morphia. First day? Olympic sprinting and acrobatics, but unlikely to break records.
