What is "Stone" in this case? Here's what I got:

Mining Aid-1700s mining technology might be better, but this is more precise.

Castle Crusher-Shield yourself and once you get to a wall, it goes down quickly.

Since only stone is effected, ore refinery by scraping off stone with your fingernails is an option.

Gem carving, if gems are allowed, is probably a good trade.

Statue Carving, for wealthy patrons.

If it gives feedback, soil sampling/ore quality control. Eg, if it moves easily, it's x%, if its harder, then it's y%

Asbestos is a rock.
