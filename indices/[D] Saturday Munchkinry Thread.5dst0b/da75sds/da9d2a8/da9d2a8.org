If my fingernails and my hair count as part of my body I have a way to engrave in stone and even cut through it if I grow some long enough strands of hair.

I could crush a bunch of smaller gems together to make one large one which would be worth more than the sum of the small ones

As a potter I could throw a super thin marble goblet, or even a gemstone one if that's allowed.

I can make stone pipes and improve plumbing, though I'd have to use granite or something non-porous

A lot of this depends on how wet is wet clay. THe best pottery techniques use a range of wetnesses for different effects, like you need clay to be drier before you can attache a handle to a jug, but you attach it with nearly liquid clay. If it's wet enough you can make thin edges on clay which might be sharp on an appropriate stone. Moulding diamond would be awesome in this regard.

If you want more ideas I'd suggest looking at some pottery videos :-)
