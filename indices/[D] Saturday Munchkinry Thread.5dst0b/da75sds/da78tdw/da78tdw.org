I think you could easily hide things inside a stone wall and easily retrieve them . If you are in a prision that has stone walls and still have the bracelet you can easily make tools from the walls to escape or make a hole in the wall .other idea would be molding stone around the hands and feet of someone to make improvised cuffs. Or just make stone items and sell them. You could dig trough stone and destroy stone walls .You could make rock knuckles that would be hard for your enemies but soft to you.Also you will always have whatever tools oyour weapons you want that can be made of stone even some that normally can't be made of stone
