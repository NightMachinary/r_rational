As a material for tools, stone doesn't really have any advantages. It's heavy but not terribly strong, doesn't hold an edge well.

For that use, its only real benefits are that you can probably create your tool anywhere and quickly, and that you can remake them as needed (so it's more flexible). For long-term stuff, you'd probably prefer worked metal every time.

For non-tools, the main uses have been covered by others.

Would you be able to climb a stone wall by forming handholds and footholds? If it is effectively wet clay, it seems likely that it'd just slip and fall with your weight dangling on it.

You could sabotage stairs and the like by pulling a chunk off, then replacing it while not wearing the bracelet. Somebody may trip and die I guess.

Now that I think about it, probably the most effective use would be sealing doorways in stone buildings. Just fold a chunk in front of the door on the side it opens. If you do it enough, you'd effectively make a wall.

Oh, and anybody in a stone room could be sealed in, eventually suffocating in their airtight prison.
