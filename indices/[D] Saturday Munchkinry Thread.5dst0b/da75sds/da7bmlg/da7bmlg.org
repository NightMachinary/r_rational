  shaping it someone else could come along, poke it, and feel stone.

Hmm, the immediate thought is "soft" armour. Like the non-newtonian foam dow-corning makes, but better. What counts as stone? Anything approaching metal? Would be enough to provide some benefit against non-oathkeepers.

Shove some stone in a lock? Keep keys from working.

Entomb yourself? Decent for stealth against non-mentalists.

Stone tipped arrows? Less of a problem.

Volcanic glass opens up some possibilities, but not much.

Would make escaping constraints easier, as you can fashion simple stone tools. Presuming they don't take it off you.

All in all, it's not that powerful in this setting. The opportunity for a few tricks, but I don't know that there's anything groundbreaking, except literally.
