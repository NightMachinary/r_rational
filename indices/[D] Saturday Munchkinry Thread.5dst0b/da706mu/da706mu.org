I want people to munchkin the wish rock from my story for this fortnight's challenge. Use my characters, yours, or yourself. Maximize for one of the following:

- Your own values.

- Discovering its origins and exploring the implications and complications thereof.

- Saving humanity from the projected heat death of the universe.

- Fixing the entropy problem.*

- A series of increasingly odd trivialities that are very very silly indeed.

- Making any counterfactual a reality.

- Making any fantasy a reality, be it for just yourself or everyone.

- Anything else.

*(Yes, I know. It's intentional.)
