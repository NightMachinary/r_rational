The Masquerade is one of those things that you have to basically accept as suspension of disbelief, IMO. You just need to get your party on live TV, and say turn into a werewolf or whatever else would be convincing.

OK, I'll go with a werewolf party because werewolf transformation is easy to do and demonstrate. Apply for the James Randi prize (I don't think it exists anymore, but there are alternative ones - or contact Penn Jillette, Richard Dawkins., whoever is respected in the scientific/skeptical community), tell them you're werewolves, prove it under test conditions, and bam! the masquerade is broken. You'd explain the Masquerade and swear them to secrecy until a Big Reveal where all the people you've told announce it at once on their websites.

Of course nWoD werewolf rules say that there's "lunacy" and people forget the werewolves/misremember them, but that requires a failed willpower roll, so we're just going to naively assume that you'd eventually get enough respected scientists/etc to succeed their willpower rolls that it'd work out.
