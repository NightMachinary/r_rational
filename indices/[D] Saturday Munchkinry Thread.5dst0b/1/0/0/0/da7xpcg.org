It's tricky. You'd probably want to watch one (let's say Neil DeGrasse Tyson) for an extended period of time to observe whether they're a supernatural of some stripe (maybe take a mage with aura readings, actually - that tells if they're supernatural right away, right? Unless they are hiding their aura. Eek), and then have "hub" person send sealed letters to a bunch of other respected colleagues containing proof (not sure what would be considered sufficient proof, though).

Another thought - be a mage with a rote spell of controlling coin flips (that shouldn't cause too much paradox, right?). Then you can win a bunch of challenges at it might be a subdued enough power that nobody would notice you were a mage until it's too late. Maybe? I'm not sure.

I think going to respected scientists is the best way.
