No. Their 'sight' shows them nothing about itself. At 59:50 they see that nothing happens unless they take action. At 59:55 they see that the n will appear regardless, and remember that they were instructed to press at this point. However, they could still choose not to press.

I suppose we could complicate the situation by hooking them up to an MRI that presses for them when it senses a spike in brain activity. But even then, the way the power works in my mind is that it doesn't work, because the future they see is what they would see if they took actions XYZ and had no ability to see further ahead. And if they could not see ahead, nothing interesting would happen at 59:55.
