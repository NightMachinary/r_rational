They can, sorta. I simplified and said five seconds, but really it's 1-5ish seconds depending on the Seer. A Seer who can see further ahead will have an advantage over one who can't see as far, but they can both identify each other immediately unless one is asleep/paralyzed/whatever. In theory one could pretend not to have the power, but they would have to precommit to things like not reacting ahead of time if someone tries to stab them out of the blue or call out their name.

When two seers try to outdo each other, you have two PCs in a world of NPCs. They see normal people as simple flow charts, but with another seer they are simulating /you/ while you are simulating /them/, so things get a little more complicated. They still see a cloud of possibilities that they can pick and choose from, but... It's a bit like the end of Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows, where Holmes and Moriarty both see the outcome of the fight ahead of time (Except Moriarty would know what Holmes' backup plan was). You can pick the best course of action you could theoretically choose, but your opponent will choose the exact best counter. So they arrive at a Nash equilibrium immediately. Of course, that's still just a few seconds ahead. You can still lure a seer into a situation where, once they fall for it, no course of action could save them from the nasty trap that triggers ten seconds rom now.
