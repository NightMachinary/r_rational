So. Let's say there are two Seers. Call them Alice and Bob.

Alice has a water balloon, and wishes to throw it at Bob. No matter where she throws it, Bob can catch it without it bursting.

So. Alice sees a cloud of possibilities. Throw the balloon at Bob's head, at Bob's feet, at Bob's chest, don't throw the balloon, shout "Look behind you!", all of that and more. And Alice sees the results of these possibilities. Notably, she see /no/ possibility where Bob is soaked.

Bob sees a cloud of possibilities. Move his hand /here/, catch the balloon - do anything else, get soaked. He sees /many/ possibilities where he ends up soaked.

Would that be approximately accurate?
