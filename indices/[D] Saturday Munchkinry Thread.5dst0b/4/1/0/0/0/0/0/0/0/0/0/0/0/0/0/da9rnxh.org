Well, there's a difference. No new information is coming during the water fight. Alice decides where to aim, Bob sees how to catch the balloon, no outside interference. However, in the computer program case, at 59:54 Alice does not know she will press in only a second. The mundane world holds a future of Alice sitting still, waiting for the program. At 59:55, she is surprised by the sudden knowledge that the n will appear on its own in five seconds, so she changes what she was going to do. Pressing was not in the cards before then.

Is this a distinction that makes sense?
