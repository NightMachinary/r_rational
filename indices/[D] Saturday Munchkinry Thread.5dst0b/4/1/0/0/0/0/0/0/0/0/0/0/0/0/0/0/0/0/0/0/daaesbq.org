I've used "Cecil Sea" under similar circumstances before.

These Seers are going to be dangerous with any weapon, and /particularly/ dangerous with a crossbow or rifle; they can see /exactly/ where to fire to hit their target. Apart from everything else, they're perfect snipers - except against each other.

Hmmm - but a seer with a cellphone app could snipe another seer. Consider; Alice keeps a rifle trained on Bob but doesn't fire. Bob doesn't react, because he doesn't See a bullet arrive. Alice continues not to fire until such time as she Sees - at the edge of her range - that her cellphone app is beeping, at which point she immediately fires. Bob gets shot /without/ his usual warning, quite possibly leaving him too surprised to dodge...
