I have a challenge for you, fellow RF and WoD fans.

World of Darkness, be it the old or the new one, is a very well-written setting, describing several very different magical entities and their relationship within themselves and between each other. Mages, werewolfes, evem mummies and, of course, vampires - everything actually exists, if in a different form from the common myths, and every conspiracy theory you heard about is true. Yes, even that one.

However, different those entities are, they all share a common point: something the vampires call the Masquerade. That is, they are hidden from normal, low-magical people. And excuses for continuing to maintain the Masquerade are quite often pretty flimsy. And generally boil down to everyone wanting to maintain it, even those like Sabbat, who openly disdain it.

The challenge is simple: destroy the Masquerade. Use a party of no more than 2 characters who may be fairly powerful, but not very (something like basic character +15 exp, perhaps?), from any book as long as those can reasonably meet and team up and have an actual motivation to destroy the Masquerade. Be prepared that other magical creatures will not be amused. To make things fair and even possible at all, the Internet is not completely under control of supernatural, and even the New World Order or Virtual Adepts can't edit the whole Net on the fly.

What do you think? Also, should I make it a separate post or keep it here?
