Okay, so, as I understand it... Paradox is backlash for doing something that people /in general/ will not believe. Even if they're not there to witness it at the time.

So, let's say you have some convincing proof of magic. (The specifics don't matter to this argument). Whatever it is, it's good, it's convincing, and if you go on TV with it, maybe release the video on YouTube, then anyone who sees it will realise that magic exists.

This implies that whatever you're doing - even if it's just tossing heads a million times with a coin - whatever you're doing for proof is something that's so unbelievable, so "out there", that the best explanation for it is "magic is real". And now you're going out and putting that proof in front of every human being on the planet.

Wouldn't this /automatically/ produce a Paradox backlash so strong that there's little left of you but a funny-coloured stain, and maybe a still-smoking skull?
