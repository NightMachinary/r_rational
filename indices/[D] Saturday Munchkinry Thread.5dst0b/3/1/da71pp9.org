Unless there was some Dark Twist in the story that I missed, the wish rock is essentially omnipotent and reads the user's intentions telepathically and flawlessly. It can make any fantasy a reality - the really interesting question is /which/ fantasy you would make real if you could.

Did I understand the story correctly?
