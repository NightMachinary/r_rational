Humour would be a large part of it, yes. You've got one guy who's basically the Brawn, big and strong and pretty near invulnerable (definitely invulnerable to sneak attacks) and another half his size who spends the whole story frantically running around trying to save his 'mentor' from himself /and/ deal with the Villain Of The Week on the side.

It might make quite a good parody of the superhero genre.
