Hmmm. This opens the door to all sorts of shenanigans.

Let us say that Alice and Bob have a bit of time to make plans. Then Bob goes to infiltrate some company or villainous organisation or... something.

Bob finds some crucial but short information, which can be described in terms of a five-letter code. However, having discovered this Secret, Bob is permanently under watch. Bob, by pre-arrangement, passes Alice on a regular basis.

Bob has precommitted that if Alive says a number, he will state the relevant letter of the code. So, say the code is ABCDE. If Alice says "one", Bob will say "A". If Alice says "two", Bob will say "B". And so on.

Alice says nothing. Bob says nothing. The people watching Bob - even if some of them are Seers themselves - see no information passing from Bob to Alice. Yet, after that brief non-conversation, Alice knows what the code is.
