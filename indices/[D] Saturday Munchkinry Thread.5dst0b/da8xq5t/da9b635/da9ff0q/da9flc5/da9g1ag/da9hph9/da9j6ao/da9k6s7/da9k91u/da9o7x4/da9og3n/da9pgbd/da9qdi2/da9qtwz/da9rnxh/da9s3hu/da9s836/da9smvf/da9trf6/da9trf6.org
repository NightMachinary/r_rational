I decided long ago that I could not handle arbitrary learning speeds, so while the power lets a seer analyze an insane amount of information and act on it in the moment, they can't retain more in their memory than you or I could of things we see with our eyes. So they can learn a lot that would be costly for others to learn (say how somebody would react if you punched them), but they can't learn at a (much) faster /rate/ than normal.

In the case of a paper held up to the window of a moving train, yes, it's fair to say she would get about five seconds' worth of scanning it. Might not be able to read small print, though, but that can be worked out with the accomplice in advance.

I read the wikipedia page for Thiotimoline and I like it. Thanks for that as well. If you were a background NPC scientist in a fantasy world's Nazi Hogwarts/Moria capital of magic, what would be a good name for you? I usually just steal usernames, but CC_037 does not exactly roll off the tongue.
