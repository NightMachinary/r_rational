Another idea strikes me. Let us say that Alice is watching a train go past. On that train is an accomplice, who holds a piece of paper flat against the window.

Now, the train is going at eighty kilometres an hour. Even forewarned, your average person will not see the paper for more than in instant. But Alice can see it in advance. So, she gets to spend five seconds studying what, from her perspective, and perhaps after some practice, appears to be a stationary piece of paper... not enough to read /much/ of it, but a few words, or to get a sense of the picture...
