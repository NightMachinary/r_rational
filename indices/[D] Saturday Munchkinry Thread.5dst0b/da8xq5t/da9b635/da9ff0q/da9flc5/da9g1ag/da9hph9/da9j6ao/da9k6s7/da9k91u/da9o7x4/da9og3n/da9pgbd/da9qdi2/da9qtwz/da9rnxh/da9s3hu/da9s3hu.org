Ah. So, Bob can see what Alice will do over the next five seconds, under the assumption that Alice spends that time completely ignoring any new information from her Seer talent. Presumably, no matter what the mechanism for information to travel backwards in time is, it cannot reach more than five seconds into the future. That... works well enough for fiction.

(Incidentally, on the subject of things that can be affected by happenings five seconds into the future, are you familiar with Asimov's fictional compound Thiotimoline?)
