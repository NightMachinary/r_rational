Hmmm. It goes further. When Alice looks at Bob, Alice doesn't see the course(s) of action that Bob will choose /not/ to do. Alice sees what Bob /will/ do (if Alice does X).

So, let's return to the computer program. Now we set up two computers, such that what Alice types appears on Bob's screen, and vice versa. We ask both Alice and Bob to press 'N' the moment that they see that an 'N' is /going/ to appear. At time 60:00, an 'N' appears on Alice's screen (if it's not there yet).

So, at time 59:55, Alice hits 'N', and thus an 'N' appears on Bob's screen.
