A small fraction of people, not including you, have the ability to perfectly predict potential futures up to five seconds ahead. That is, they 'know' all the sensory information they would receive if they stayed in place/looked around a corner/punched someone in the face/bared a secret/asked a particular question, etc, as long as the result is evident within five seconds. Other than putting a five second delay on every password check ever, how would you as a high up politician or military officer defend your faction from seers with bad intentions?
