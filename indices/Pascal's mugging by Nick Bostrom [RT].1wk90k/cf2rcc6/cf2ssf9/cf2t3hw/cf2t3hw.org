The problem is that this debate has been conducted in probabilistic terms, because Bayesian probability theory is mathematically "stronger", in the sense of being more consistent and better axiomatized, than the actual scientific method we use in real life.

The actual scientific method says: any theory that hopes to correspond to reality must make falsifiable predictions, and experiments must be done to test those. Utilities are only ever calculated among hypotheses that /could/ have been falsified by evidence, but /weren't/.

Notably, probability theory was constructed in order to deal with games of chance in which all hypothetical outcomes were at least /possible/. Probability has no concept of "impossible", since, as they say, 0 and 1 are not probabilities. Real life, however, very much /does/ have a concept of "impossible". This is why attempts to translate real life into probability theory tend to fail.

In theory, Bayesianism is stronger. In real life, Bayesianism gets bogged down performing probabilistic computations while the scientific method throws out the overwhelming majority of possible theories to deal only with those for which non-falsifying evidence exists.

I think we need some (possibly new?) mathematics for converting between "possibility", "plausibility", and "probability", with some way of ensuring that hypotheses need to pass some notion of a truly rigorous evidential check before being treated as sufficiently probable to enter our decision procedures.
