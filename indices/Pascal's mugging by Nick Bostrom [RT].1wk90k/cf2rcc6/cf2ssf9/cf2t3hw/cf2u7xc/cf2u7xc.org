  Real life, however, very much does have a concept of "impossible".

Well, that's the issue.

If you use the kind of reasoning FAI advocates very often use and take things to their logical extreme, you'll end up with truly absurd concepts, like how everything is possible and you should always take into account what the insane god emperors on the other side of the acausal gulf think about your decisions, and how your actions impact the trillions of sentient beings billions of years from now etc. The infamous [[http://kruel.co/2013/01/12/rokos-basilisk-everything-you-need-to-know/][Roko's Basilisk]] is an example of this (beware, Yudkowsky and few others believe you significantly raise the chance of getting eternally tortured if you receive information about Roko's basilisk... depending on how seriously you take this information). [[http://clubofsc.blogspot.fi/2011/08/my-topic-universal-dovetailer-argument.html][Universal Dovetailer]] is a contrived version of computationalism that not only says that everything is possible, but everything that is possible will happen [[http://kruel.co/backup/Ontological%20Therapy.png][and more mindfucks]]. Some modern cosmologists think that it's probable that the universe is infinite and this on its own could do nasty things to the traditional concept of impossibility.

You might even say the FAI argument relies on some of these absurd conclusions because the payoff is that you could "save" those trillions of souls in the future from extinction and that justifies the research even though we don't know how small the likelihood is for any of this. If you use a coherent and consistent framework of sound argumentation based on unsupported inference to argue for FAI research then how's that any different from using the same kind of argumentation to argue that [[http://www.simulation-argument.com/][we should pay more attention to the Dark Lords of Matrix so they don't pull the switch?]] Which is more "impossible" and why?
