  Also, the former Singularity Institute's AI fearmongering is very wrong while also being a much better approximation of the potential problems than the standard "TAKE OUR JOBS" or "OMG SKYNET" fearmongering or "YAY UTOPIA! YAY THREE LAWS!" hopemongering.

I agree, but I'm still not entirely sure how I feel about their approach. The use of hyperbole and science fiction-y concepts is, or at least used to be, a bit annoying and the fact that many of them have little or no formal education on the subject. But maybe it doesn't hurt to allocate some money to them. Fortunately I'm not the one who decides how much.
