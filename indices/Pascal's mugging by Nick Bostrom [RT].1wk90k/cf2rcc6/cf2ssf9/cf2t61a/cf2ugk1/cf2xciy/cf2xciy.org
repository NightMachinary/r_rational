It's /really/ annoying. As in, I continually badger them about it, because, you know, science ought to be done by people with a scientific education, or who can at least /pass/ for having a scientific education, rather than people who come across as philosophizing self-educated dilettantes. Nothing wrong with being one of those on the internet, /lots/ wrong with demanding people give you tens of thousands of dollars to save the world while being one of those.

EDIT: On further reflection, what the fuck am I saying, I don't even know anymore. I'm a graduate student, and it's not like actual, tenured scientists who've been publishing papers for longer than I've been alive /actually seem to know their shit/. Seems sometimes as if plenty of real-life professional researchers with formal educations have just managed to successfully overfit themselves to passing exams and publishing papers. I feel very sad and cynical about the whole Science thing now.
