Ok, so I do think your criticism works. This feels like a real gap between our ability to write down computational descriptions of worlds, and the actual amount of things that have to happen to really generate such worlds.

I mean, look at it this way: a world with X people in it, each weighing 40kg, requires X * 40kg of /mass/ in it. Since /reality/ is specified in terms of /mass/, we should ideally be rating hypotheses about reality in terms of how much mass, energy, and time they take up. Larger should be considered worse, even if you can write down a very simple computational description of the Very Large Things.

Or alternately, I can be less stupid and revert back to my basic evidentialism that I actually make bets on in real life.
