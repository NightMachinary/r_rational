I spent some time thinking about it and actually posted my answer to this supposed "conundrum" on LW.

#+begin_quote
  The thing is that while K-complexity of "I'm from outside the Matrix. Give me $5 or I will torture X people forever" is enormous for every possible X, it's very easy to invent tremendous numbers with negligible K-complexity (3^{^{^{3,}}} 4^{^{^{^{4,}}}} Ackermann function of them, etc).

This would be true if you just valued the size of the number rather than valuing actual people represented /by/ the number.

The K-complexity of /X real things/ scales linearly in the number of things. X people are /at least/ as complicated as X * K-complexity(one person).

Which means that if you try to write down a description of a universe containing X people, its prior probability will drop faster than the utility rises (provided, of course, that your utility on people rises linearly in people rather than exponentially).

O(X) / 2^{-O(X)} -- the denominator will win this battle.
