Oh, and then there's also the issue that a Pascal's Mugging is /not actually simple at all/. The "message" in a Pascal's Mugging has a very /long/ description length, since it involves /parts of my utility function/, which, as a human being, is very complex.

Message: "I'm from outside the Matrix. Give me $5 or I will torture 3^^^3 people forever."

You'd think the Kolmogorov complexity is very small, since you just wrote down the message in a few short words. Actually, it's very large, since the definitions of "outside the Matrix" and, most importantly of "torture" and "people" are actually references to /concepts internal to my mind/.

Now I'm already starting to wonder where you've got that many people from, and what they're like, and if they're even people as I understand them, and noting how you haven't provided many details about such things. Blah blah blah. It suddenly comes to mind that "This man is lying to me" is a much /simpler/ hypothesis than "There really is another whole world containing all those people, who are the kind of people I care about, and this man is telling the truth."

Now, if I'm an AI and there's no prospect that my own hypothesis space is /deliberately lying to me/... But the problem gets thornier, as I said in my other comment, but it occurs to me that I shouldn't invent hypotheses about people so aimlessly, perhaps? Huh. I feel a need to resort to my evidentialist stance, there.
