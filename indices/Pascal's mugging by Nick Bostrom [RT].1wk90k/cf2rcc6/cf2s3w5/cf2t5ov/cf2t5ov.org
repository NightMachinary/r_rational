  It suddenly comes to mind that "This man is lying to me" is a much simpler hypothesis than "There really is another whole world containing all those people, who are the kind of people I care about, and this man is telling the truth."

It's definitely simpler which means it's far more likely. But there *is* some non-zero probability that the man is speaking the truth and the mugger is always able to provide so big negative/positive incentive that basic expected utility calculation suggests that you should always pick the mugger's offer. It's an interesting problem because normal rationalist reasoning breaks down and even Yudkowsky has basically given up and said:
