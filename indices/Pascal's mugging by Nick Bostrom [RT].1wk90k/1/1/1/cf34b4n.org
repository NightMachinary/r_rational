It's my intuition that lead to those three possibilities, rather than just accepting Pascal's mugging.

EDIT: Also, I rely on a combination both and I think that's best. You can't avoid relying on intuition, of course, because if nothing else you'd be relying on the maths because it was your intuition that it's best. But I think it's sort of odd to criticise maths as a route to solutions for real world decisions in a subreddit like [[/r/rational][r/rational]]... :P
