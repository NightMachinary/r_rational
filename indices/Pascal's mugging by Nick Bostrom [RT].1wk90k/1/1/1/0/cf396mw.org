I guess what I'm saying is that if your mathematical solutions have real and obvious problems, that's a good sign that there's something wrong with the model at its very core. You can apply a patch like "don't bother with anything whose likelihood is lower than one in one billion", but if you're doing that, you're admitting that the decision making model has a flaw without actually identifying why that flaw exists. If this is the flaw that we see, that implies to me that there are other, unseen flaws.
