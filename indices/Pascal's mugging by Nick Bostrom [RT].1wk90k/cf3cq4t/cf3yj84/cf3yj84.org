So? Every single mugging has a probabilistic increase in utility, right? If I take a bet at ten to one odds that has a twenty times greater payout, it's still a consistently good bet even if I end up losing repeatedly. Maybe you increase the probability that the mugger is lying after the tenth time, but the mugger can always just increase the reward, and it's still the "correct" thing to do unless you have some way to deal with this flaw in utility maximization.
