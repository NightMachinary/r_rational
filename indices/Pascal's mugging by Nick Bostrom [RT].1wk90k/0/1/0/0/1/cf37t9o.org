  (beware, Yudkowsky and few others believe you significantly raise the chance of getting eternally tortured if you receive information about Roko's basilisk... depending on how seriously you take this information)

/That's/ why he censored it from LW? I thought it was because some people were seriously upset by the possibility of the Basilisk, and were reporting depressive or suicidal thoughts. If he actually believes it, well, that significantly increases my confidence in the "Lesswrong writers are all crazy" theory.

Edit for clarity: I wrote a couple of articles on LW back in the day, so please take the previous sentence as partially joking self-deprecation.
