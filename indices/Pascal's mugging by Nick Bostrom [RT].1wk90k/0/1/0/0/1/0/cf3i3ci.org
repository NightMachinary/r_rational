I don't think he believes that it /will/ happen, but there's a very small probability that it could happen and there's nothing you can gain by talking about it except possibly infinite negative utility. [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/mp/0_and_1_are_not_probabilities/][There's no such thing as zero probability]] so you have to take all scenarios that involve very high quantities of negative/positive utility seriously - especially if they happen to involve your pet theory.

Except then you have to take all other versions of Pascal's mugging seriously which means you can't live a normal life.
