/disclaimer: I strongly suspect I don't understand your position and just pattern-match your words into a strawmanship. Sorry about that, could you be more clear on this matter?/

The thing is that while K-complexity of "I'm from outside the Matrix. Give me $5 or I will torture *X* people forever" is enormous for every possible X, it's very easy to invent tremendous numbers with negligible K-complexity (3^^^3, 4^^^^4, Ackermann function of them, etc).

So, whatever K-complexity of this proposal is, I always can substitute something simple and colossal for X, and then expected utility will be positive.
