This seems like a very neat hack with a convincing justification.

However, I should note two limitations. First, it doesn't work if I care only about number, not details.

Second, you are mistaken here:

#+begin_quote
  X people are at least as complicated as X * K-complexity(one person).
#+end_quote

What if I care about perfect copies of one person? What about X perfect copies of one person, but each with some unique experience? Unique experiences are very simple to create: take a planet, take a future brilliant writer and tell him "/write about hobbits/" *or* "/write about spaceships/", run simulation for 10 years, done (yeah, K-complexity is enormous, but it is very easy to scale; bonus points for running simulation for 1000 years and using all descendants of this writer). There are many ways to create X people without having to describe each one of them.
