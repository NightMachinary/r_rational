Is there a solution to this? It seems to have to be one of:

- it's NOT desirable to bet on absurdly long odds, expected value be damned, or
- something strange happens to odds when considering contrived scenarios, such that the expected value can't be manipulated like this, or
- it is in fact desirable to acquiesce to a Pascal's mugging.
