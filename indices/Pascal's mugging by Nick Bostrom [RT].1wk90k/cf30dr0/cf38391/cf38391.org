  it's NOT desirable to bet on absurdly long odds, expected value be damned

I think it's this one. In your lifetime, you may have two or three million-to-one chances actually happen, so the median outcome of all those million-to-one chances combined is pretty much identical to the mean outcome (i.e. the expectation). But if you roll a trillion-sided die every second, it's still unlikely that it will come up a 1 in your lifetime (extreme life extension notwithstanding). So the expectation doesn't correspond to what's actually likely to happen (median or mode), and you need to rethink your assumptions.
