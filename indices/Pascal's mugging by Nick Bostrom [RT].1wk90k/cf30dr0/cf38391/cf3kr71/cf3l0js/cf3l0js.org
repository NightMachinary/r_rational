On reflection, it's also the fact that humans lack intuition when it comes to large numbers - I don't trust myself to spot the difference between a one-in-a-quadrillion chance and a one-in-a-quintillion chance, because even though they're three orders of magnitude apart, they look pretty similar to me. So I'd take the safe option, particularly if there's a mugger who's actively trying to take advantage of me.

The other difficulty in dealing with trillion-to-one chances is that there's a very high chance that I've made a logical error in my reasoning (perhaps as high as 1 in 5), so the trillion-to-one outcome is a lot less likely than the outcomes I haven't thought of.

I know, I know: By this point, I'm transparently altering my reasoning to fit my intuition. Maybe I'm wrong to do so.
