Ah, so you break out of Bayesianism's "how strongly do I believe this" and look at Frequentism's "how often can I expect this to happen", notice that your own life history probably will never see such an unlikely event, and refuse to bet on it.

Of course, this would mean that your AI would start engaging in more and more Pascal's Wagers the older it got.
