  The biggest point of interest is what would happen when two players come into conflict.

If I was designing this game, I'd try to have a library of cliche plotlines for each combination of classes that might bump into each other up to some size. So a smuggler, an aristocrat, and a rebel leader meet, and it pulls events from a pool for that 3-tuple, rather than from each individually. If the max size is 3, it'd pick three characters at random from a group and pull a plot based on their classes.

With just the examples listed above and only going 3 people deep, that's already 125 combinations. You probably want more than one plot for each of those, and it expands horribly with more classes, even worse considering more people. One big corner worth cutting is doing fewer variants of 4-person events than 3-person, more of those than 2-person, and more of those than solo.

And then this leads to how I'd suggest [[/u/Missing_Minus]] could abuse such a system. Figure out there's only one variant at 4-person events, start trying to force different ones, and find the most beneficial or at least least murdery plot among those. Then when you find out the only plot it knows for a sith, a bounty hunter, and two rebel leaders is a redemption arc where nobody gets killed, those four stick together and avoid anyone else with a character class.
