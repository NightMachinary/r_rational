Working on some new dragons for a D&D campaign, players be warned, spoilers ahead.

All dragons have a demiplane with them, linked to their dragonheart. They can go in and out of the demiplane nearly at-will (unsure on what kind of restrictions there are on this), but in order to pull something in or push something out, they need some kind of ritualistic or engineered magical solution.

A dragon's early life is marked by doing a lot of normal dragon things, like stealing sheep and raiding villages, but as they get older, they tend to rely on and expand their demiplane more and more, until eventually the great elder dragons have an entirely self-sufficient space, hundreds of miles across, with all the food they could ever want, and usually a population of captured people, some of whom are so many generations removed from the real world that they have no idea it even exists.

The aging of dragons, in relation to their habits and demiplane:

- Wyrmling: Hunts creatures, sleeps in a cave or the woods, sometimes antagonizes civilized folks, inhospitable and tiny demiplane primarily used for emergency retreat.
- Juvenile: Starts pulling rock, soil, air, and water into their demiplane through planar circles built away from prying eyes, still primarily eats through hunting/pillaging but spends a lot of time in the demiplane, especially once it's been seeded with enough plants that the air is permanently breathable (or they've used the planar circle to steal enough air).
- Adult: beginnings of a well-developed demiplane with lots of land, some inevitably pulled in from the elemental planes or other places where enormous quantities of materials won't be missed, sometimes by temporary attaching the demiplanar to those planes rather than the prime material. Initial kidnappings usually happen now, but they might happen earlier in isolated ways. Typically an adult dragon will be drifting toward making their demiplane able to fully support them. Magic is often used in the pursuit of this, especially to lower the demands of meat/plant consumption.
- Wyrm: Almost all the dragon's time is spent in the demiplane, with the exception of quests for relics or attempts at finding a mate (which can be quite difficult give that wyrms spend so much of their time in demiplanes, hidden from both the world and each other).

I was thinking about this for yet-another-dragon-variant, since I like to play on the classics. I think it's got a lot that I like, such as hiding dragons away to make them more rare and mysterious, and giving them a proper, interesting "hoard" (accessed by others via the dragonheart?). Plus I don't think that I've seen it done before, and I have an abiding love of demiplanes.

In theory, the players can be introduced to this particular variety of dragons through an multi-session questline that starts with some mysterious disappearances, leads to a criminal crew that's been hired on to enact those kidnappings, and eventually leads to the dragon herself, who has orchestrated the whole thing and converted the basement of a large building into a planar processing center (still working through the specifics of this). Dragons being quite rare, this means that the players are uncovering a secret of the world at the same time.

*Thoughts or interesting things to add?*

There are some conceptual problems that come from having demiplanes, like where the light comes from, or how the air doesn't just dissipate, or what's beyond the bounds of the area, but that's nothing that can't be solved with "it's magic" (though I would like more interesting answers to those questions, if possible, especially if those answers can include plot hooks or clues to the true nature of dragons).
