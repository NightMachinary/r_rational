There is no light in the wyrmling plane, nor the early juvenile. The mass the dragon can generate and/or steal into the demiplane (per second) scales up along with the square of its own body mass. When a sufficient quantity of hydrogen has been absorbed, a self-sustaining fusion reaction births a small demistar, providing light and heat and allowing for plant seeding and an oxygen/water cycle. Most wyrmlings die before this happens, and once dragons reach this state they're on easy street.

Also, that's how they breathe fire--an internal portal to the demisun's emissions.

Also, of course, our universe is itself the demiplane of the biggest known dragon, Yahweh.

Or not, obviously! I do think it's a very cool idea.
