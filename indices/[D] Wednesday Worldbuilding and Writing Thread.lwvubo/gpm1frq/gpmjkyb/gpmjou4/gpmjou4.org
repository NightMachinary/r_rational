Some thoughts:

The dragons seem to be trying to create a personal demiplane that is reflective of the material plane.

The material plane is a combination of the various elemental planes and outer planes, so depending on the dragon's ideal, they could perform persisting rituals that would "pull" energy/laws/concepts of the Planes into their demiplane.

They could be lazy and just pull the "finished" version of the laws directly from the material plane (and they likely will initially as a juvenile), but elemental planes are less populated, less likely to be disturbed/noticed, and allow for better customization.

I would imagine these persisting rituals to "drain" the area near them. In the material plane, these rituals would make materials more crumbly, the air thinner, gravity weaker, light dimmer, etc. Things that enter slowly become diminished versions of themselves, but things that leave will slowly restore to their relatively normal versions. It would basically be stealing the energy of an area in the material plane to fuel the demi-plane. Without personal protection, these rituals would be relatively easy to disrupt.

In the elemental planes, it would be able to be tailored to be much more specific and with much less concern of sentients. It's still similar to an "it's magic" answer, but things would continue to persist in the demiplane because they are being conceptually solidified by the energy/concepts stolen with the rituals.

For plot hooks, it would probably have to be a younger dragon that is still learning the ropes or a dragon that is less in control of their desires. Their persisting ritual is too noticeable, and they are constantly defending it. A dragon decides that setting up a ritual where a population currently lives is worth the trouble. An impatient dragon kidnaps people and forces them to help them make the demiplane (that they now live in) sustainable or die. A young dragon has gotten a decent demiplane going but now desires a hoard that includes talented people and royal blood.

What's beyond the bounds of the area?

Depends on planar mechanics, I guess. It could just be an unbreakable boundary. The boundary could push into nothing/the void/ethereal plane/astral plane/weirdness/unreal space/generic demiplane space and create more demiplane. The dragon would have to make more or expand existing rituals to support more demiplane.

I'm not really sure if it is ever explained where demiplanes are, even in the demiplane spell.
