So, a game where the world moves itself to make it interesting for you. I'm thinking of scifi, and these examples will be very star-warsy to have something to work off of for now.\\
So, you could be a sith, a bounty hunter, a rebel leader, an aristocrat, a smuggler, etc.\\
The world would move in ways that provide an interesting experience consistent with that character. A smuggler (especially one with a 'heart of gold'), is far more likely to get events like someone sneaking on their ship who is running from bad people. A sith is likely to get opportunities to commit acts that play into their usual anger issues, and get the opportunity to get an apprentice.\\
Other aspects of the world would also work for them. If you were to steal from the mafia, then instead of getting shot you might get recruited or rescued at the last moment. You could still die, but you have an absurd amount of plot resistance to it.\\
So, you have this world that bends itself over to give the players an interesting experience, and you go for the "all the players get transported into this universe permanently".\\
The players would run into the issue - once they realize this is a legitimate universe and that these probably aren't just NPCs - that some of them would not want to continue what they were doing. Most of the people playing sith-lord wouldn't want to /actually/ go around killing people for fun.\\
Yet the 'game' (or whatever is influencing it now, doesn't really matter) still puts them in scenarios that reflect their choice of class. Even after your bounty hunter has tried switching to being an accountant, they still get strange and interesting offers in the mail. Etcetera.\\
So, essentially they influence plot to emerge and include them, but while they certainly get tropes they aren't completely influenced by them. Ex: It isn't interesting for the 'player' if they become a mentor and then die because of that usual trope. They can still get heavy downsides, but the aim is to be interesting to the game players (but may be less interesting/enjoyable to the players in the actual world that runs on this).\\
Any thoughts? Common sci-fi character-types? Ways to try to abuse/avoid the 'plot'? Perhaps, what would you attempt to do to study the behavior of the 'plot'?
