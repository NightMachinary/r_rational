  There are some conceptual problems that come from having demiplanes, like where the light comes from
#+end_quote

Have you already solved the "where does light in dungeons come from?" problem? It could be the same answer. I usually include a "sunstone" mineral that catalyzes an [ambient magic + C02 => light + O2 + soot] reaction. This lets there be breathable air and light for plants down below, so you can have dungeon denizens and weird underground jungles. If you have an equivalent idea, dragons could just steal loads of sunstone to light their demiplanes.

  or how the air doesn't just dissipate
#+end_quote

I always thought a demiplane was a closed space. The air diffuses to the size of the demiplane, then maintains whatever pressure that is. If the demiplane is expanding, you'd be constantly losing air pressure, but that's just another thing a dragon can solve by stealing (air).

  or what's beyond the bounds of the area
#+end_quote

It's a closed space, so nothing. Some options for what to do at the boundary:

- There is no boundary, because it's curved in N+1 dimensional space, and wraps on itself as a hypersphere. I think this is what most people think of when they think of a wrapped space. But actually picturing how you navigate the surface of a hypersphere is a bear though.

- Curved in N*2 dimensional space, wraps on itself as a hypertorus. This is the one where space appears to repeat itself infinitely in each dimension.

- Wall. Probably has a color like true black, perfectly diffuse white, or mirrored.

- Invisible wall. Beyond the wall is an illusion of similar-looking contents to the plane itself. But it's not actually there.

You could also discard everything I just said, and make the boundary of the plane be endless dragonfire. Solves the lighting problem, explains where the dragon gets its fire from.
