I was going to take some examples from HPMOR, Harry Potter and the Natural 20, and my own writing to see if it could help you, but then I realized breaking down what makes something funny isn't the same thing as knowing where the funny comes from. If you told me to "write something funny," I wouldn't know what to do, and I'd probably fail. But as I conceive a story, comedic possibilities are just /there/. And when I imagine a scene, I can just hear the dialogue spiraling off into something absurd.

It might help to have a comedic setup. I write funny things, but not everything I write is funny. Sometimes it's very serious, and when I write serious things I don't have to force myself not to write jokes. The jokes simply don't come. Because they shouldn't be there. Because the setup isn't funny.

HPMOR, Harry Potter and the Natural 20, and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10856258/1/Harry-Potter-s-Time-Traveling-Twin-Sister-Who-Is-Also-a-Ninja][my own magnum opus]] get a lot of comedic mileage out of a fish-out-of-water scenario. Harry sees the magic, that is not physically impossible, he explains with big words that an eleven year-old shouldn't know, cue laughter. Milo applies game logic to Harry Potter world, with silly results. Hariya Potter lectures the Hokage on the Geneva Convention. All these things are funny, but they're /natural outcomes of the premise/. Milo doesn't have to force jokes about D&D. He /is/ D&D, and his character played totally straight is a comedy machine. Similarly, it's totally in-character for HJPEV to babble about how turning into a cat violates...everything, just all of the things. And I have to imagine that at that point, if you know where the scene is going and you have a strong grasp of the characters, the jokes write themselves.

So maybe you should look at your premise and your characters. Does the premise have comedic potential? And do you know your characters well enough for the comedy to come naturally as a function of their interacting with the premise?
