Thank you for the reply! I'm pretty sure that everything that can be done can be learned, I just haven't figured out how to do that with comedy yet.

The thing is that I actually can make jokes spontaneously(in a conversation or while thinking on random things), just not intentionally. Unfortunately, to write funny things I need to be able to make jokes that fit into a particular story/scene, and that doesn't work at all....

I absolutely love comedy, and I watch it all the time(that's why I want to write it so badly). It's weird, you'd think that brain would pick up on the pattern by now, it's interesting that it doesn't....
