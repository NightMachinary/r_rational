Hilarious person here. Mostly it comes naturally. Read funny things closely, see how the humor works, and try to replicate it. Mostly it just comes naturally, but the trick is to pay attention to every that is funny or could be funny, including and especially other people's stuff.

If comedy really baffles you so, it might not be your thing. I've never heard of someone who absolutely wasn't funny and studied comedy to become so successfully. I'm sure it could be done, but I've never heard of it.
