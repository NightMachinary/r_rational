So, a few years ago I wrote two one-act plays, one year apart.

The first play was awful. Frankly, I've blocked large parts of it from my memory. Why? I wasn't good enough at writing to start having fun with things. I didn't understand what made different characters interesting to the audience, and I didn't do enough exploring the range of plot ideas to just pick out the fun ones. And I wasn't ridiculous enough.

A year later the new play was called "Hammerface," and was /much/ better. Characters that actually had distinct personalities and funny traits, more absurdity and extremes, a light tone. It was, like, comedy.

To get from point A to point B, step one was thinking a lot about what I wanted from my writing and what had to change - see above. It may be helpful to have an example of the sort of thing you want to achieve that you refer to while thinking about what to work on. My solo practice was mostly writing character monologues. The most useful practice, though, was writing a scene with an experienced partner.
