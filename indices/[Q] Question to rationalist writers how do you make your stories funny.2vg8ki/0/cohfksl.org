Seconding that it mostly comes naturally. Now, with that said:

If you're trying to make something funny, the easiest well to draw from (in my experience) is the unexpected. Reversal or subversion of expectation forms the basis of a lot of humor. Here's one of my favorite jokes of all time:

#+begin_quote
  Two hunters are out in the woods when one of them collapses. He doesn't seem to be breathing and his eyes are glazed. The other guy whips out his phone and calls the emergency services. He gasps, "My friend is dead! What can I do?" The operator says "Calm down. I can help. First, let's make sure he's dead." There is a silence, then a gun shot is heard. Back on the phone, the guy says "OK, now what?"
#+end_quote

So with the caveat that explaining a joke is a good way to make it not funny anymore, this joke is funny /primarily/ because it's a reversal of expectations (but also because of taboo breaking). This kind of humor is pretty easy to set up.

*Let's do a small workshopping example:*

A boy and a girl meet for the first time. There are lots of cliches around this, because it's a common thing to happen in fiction. We'll give it a vaguely fantasy setting, both principle characters are in their late teens, etc. We can decide everything else later, but it shouldn't really matter.

Two characters meeting is not interesting by itself, not to mention not funny. What we need (if we want humor) is to subvert our expectations of this meeting. The best way to do that is to first set up some expectations to subvert. So let's say that our male character is something like a hero, and our female character is a damsel in distress - which is a complete cliche, but a cliche that we can make work for us by subverting.

So the hero "meets" the princess as she's unconscious and slung over the back of some brute walking down the road. They're moving in opposite directions. In the non-funny version of this, the brute stops in his tracks, the hero defeats him, and stays with the princess until she wakes up, whereupon some Plot happens (the hero escorts her back to her castle just in time for them to see it burning to the ground from a dragon attack, or whatever). In the funny version, we start adding in subversions. (/note: these are ideas meant to be taken in relative isolation - you run into both timing and logic issues if you try to use every subversion that comes to you/)

- The brute doesn't stop at all. He's whistling a merry tune, and nods to the hero as though this is just part of his normal day.
- The hero attempts to stop the brute, but they get into an /argument/ instead of a fight. First ideas: the brute might argue that the more heroic thing might be to wait for the brute to get to his camp, or that the hero should wait for the damsel to wake up so that she can see the rescue (if you're going really silly, they can agree to sit down together until that happens), or perhaps the brute will argue that the damsel is not a damsel at all, but rather his drunken sister despite appearances (and perhaps, if the hero presses for a fight, the brute might actually be telling the truth).
- The brute and the hero fight, but the hero is inept - he's hardly had any training with his sword. It's usually better for the protagonist to have a flaw, because self-deprecating humor is more enjoyable - the brute being soundly and immediately trounced is less funny, unless ...
- The hero outclasses the brute by several orders of magnitude, and yet the brute keeps spoiling for a fight. The hero is worried about hurting the brute, or worried about hurting his feelings (a subversion of the expectations that a fight is about winning).
- The princess, when rescued, is not what she seems. She wasn't helpless, she was just pretending to be unconscious so that the brute would bring her back to the hidden camp - as soon as the brute has been dispatched, she pops up from the ground and berates the hero for spoiling her plan while at the same time pulling hidden daggers from within her dress (this is a good idea to use in tandem with a clearly outmatched hero, because it reverses the expectation that the hero saves the princess).
- The princess is not a princess at all - she's another hero dressed up as a princess as part of some convoluted plot, or a foreigner who only looks like a princess because of the way that he dresses.

I'm not terribly sure that advice is useful to you, but hopefully it helps.
