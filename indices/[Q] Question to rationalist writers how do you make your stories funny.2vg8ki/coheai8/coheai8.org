On my front I find delivery is everything. But also I think we probably have different talents for kinds of comedy. I'm good as a foil/straight man/satirist. I give the impression of great seriousness. So I try to cultivate and use that in most of my attempts at comedy.

A useful thing to do is pay attention to what you might do that makes others laugh (either at our with you) my odd perspective and somber kind of tone works real well for snark (But I endeavor to do so nicely).

Really comedy has a lot of flavors, there is probably a branch of it your suited too.
