Scot Adams, the creator of Dilbert, has a formula he's recommended. He published it in one of his books, which is more extensive, but [[http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/07/writing-funny.html][more conveniently he blogged a copy too]].

Apparently the writer of Pearls Before Swine follows these rules much more strictly than Scot Adams himself even does, and it's worked out pretty well for him.

That's still just a tool in a bag; humor is a craft, and has a lot to it. For example, you can [[http://youtu.be/607rVXC32e8?t=52s][watch someone like Jay London]] tell merely okay one-liners and knock an audience out laughing with the quality of his delivery. A lot of his technique is built out of timing and expectation-handling, which are both outside the lines of what part of his act looks like a joke.
