Let's start with an example in children's fiction, rather than rational fiction, because it is simpler and "innocent" in that it doesn't require layers of reference to understand.

Here, I'll write a quick children's punch line:

*The elephant lumbered over eagerly. "Let me help!"*

*STOMP STOMP*

*"No! No!" screamed the mice.*

*STOMP STOMP!*

^ This is just a punch-line. In order to actually be funny, it needs a build up. The funny part is that the elephant thinks he's being helpful, but the mice are panicking. There is humor in the dissonance of expectations. You can imagine reading and miming the STOMP STOMP part in a way that make children laugh. But it's not truly funny yet because we don't have insight into the mental process of the elephant or the mice, so the dissonance is pretty superficial at the moment.

Try imagining various build ups right now? Maybe the mice had just been painstakingly doing something really delicate, like making a card castle. Maybe the elephant has been trying to help people the entire story, maybe he just keeps sticking his big nose into things and they keep getting worse. (I'm intentionally keeping this vague to prompt the reader to imagine humorous build-up scenarios. In real life, the build up is life itself, and you deliver the punchline, but in fiction while jokes do spontaneously emerge from plot it can also happen in the reverse way... a funny situation might float into your head and you must think up a way to build up to it).

So, two steps for Dissonant Dialogue: 1) Audience must understand the state of mind of both characters 2) the two characters completely misunderstand each other (not like, an argument. More like silly way that probably wouldn't happen in real life).

--------------

Now lets talk about Peekabo. Everyone knows its a game. The parent /pretends to be a character who hides, and pops out/. The child /pretends to not know, and be surprised/. Everyone knows what's going on, but there is a /misunderstanding between the characters of the game/. It's basically identical to the elephant example - the writer and audience both know what's going on, but we're playing at a pretend-elephant who is clueless.

Now let's reduce the adult jokes of HPMOR down to "peekaboo". Since we're all good reductionist philosophers here, we understand how Harry thinks about physics. We understand how McGonagall thinks about magic if we read the Harry Potter...but while reading we pretend to be (mentally simulate) Harry and McGonogall in turns, and /Harry does not know/ that it's totally mundane to turn into a cat. McGonogall /does not know/ why it's reality-breaking to turn into a cat.

--------------

I explained the "Dissonance Dialogue" brand of comedy here, but I also used several other types of humor. Admittedly, none of these are HILARIOUS, but you might have at least felt a little smirk in the back of your mind when you first read (or visualized) them:

Physical comedy *STOMP STOMP*: it's dissonant because you're not /supposed/ to walk around stomping on things, but one of the characters thinks its okay to do so. Violation of social expectation is inherently funny. That's why streakers are "funny"...what are they doing? They're just being naked, in the context that they're not supposed to be. That's the /entire joke/.

Wordplay: *maybe he just keeps sticking his big nose into things*, it's dissonant because I pretended to innocently use an idiom, but we secretly understand I was also literally referring to the size of the elephant's nose. It's punny to use idioms literally. Coming up with these happens spontaneously (this one was an accident) and if you asked me to come up with them on demand, i couldn't.

Sarcasm: *Since we're all good reductionist philosophers here* - speaking about "good reductionists" alludes to "good Christians" or "good Muslims", drawing a funny parallel between two dissimilar groups. /Someone or something/ is the butt of the joke here ...and this is why Death of the Author is at least partly a Valid Thing: I honestly have no idea what this joke /really/ meant and your interpretation might easily be more correct. Is this self-depreciating humor directed at reductionists like myself? Is it mocking religious folk's terminology and characterizing them as quaint? Was it a comment on the homogeneity of the community? I'm not sure - I made it myself and I felt the "playful" emotional state while writing it, yet I didn't even realize it /was/ a joke until reading it a second time. I think people just naturally weave these little bits of "play" into speech, with multiple complex meanings that somehow bypass explicit processing, and that's why sarcasm is often difficult to explain to someone from another culture. Complex humor is often funny in ways that no one can quite articulate.

As you go higher up the "sophistication chain" (sarcasm, dark comedy, anti-jokes) that requires more and more cultural knowledge in order to be "in on", the audience of people you'll have laughing shifts, but you'll notice all of these inherently involve a pretense that everyone laughing see through (except for the sarcasm, which sorta-kinda sometimes implies /actual hypocrisy/ that people can see through.)

--------------

It's all about play behavior. Your friend spontaneously steals your hat and wears it. Two dogs tussle over a bit of rope. All this play behavior involves pretend characters doing pretend things which do not signify what they really mean. (The dogs don't actually care about the rope, your friend hasn't truly stolen your hat). Of course, in a story /everything/ is pretend, but only some things are humorous... what's the distinguishing factor?

"The elephant wanted to help, but couldn't because he was big and clumsy" is gradually moving to "Serious" territory, though not totally serious because we still are dealing with elephants acting like people. "The boy was eager to please, but too clumsy to be of any help" is basically the same thing..but it's no longer a laughing matter because the boy is sad and so is the audience. Everyone, fictional or otherwise, is on the same, sad page. No dissonance. We /actually/ feel sad about the fictional boy and empathize. (And I think this is one of those uniquely human adaptations, to create pretense that /isn't/ all fun and games).

Whereas in the case of the two dogs, both dogs know that even though they're pretending to fight, it's actually all great fun. It's maybe not a /joke/ but it has the fundamental, playful, pretending core of a joke, and that's what makes a story humorous.

(Thanks for prompting me to write that out, I had never to this degree explicitly thought about this issue before! Sorry it is winding.)
