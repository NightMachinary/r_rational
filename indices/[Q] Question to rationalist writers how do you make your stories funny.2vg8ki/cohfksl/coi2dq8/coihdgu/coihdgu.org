Well, humans skip a lot of steps. A full process would look something like this:

- Establish a situation.
- Define the expectations/assumptions.
- Generate ways of subverting/inverting/reversing those expectations/assumptions.
- Test which of those are funny and discard those that are unfunny.

But no one would ever write humor like that - it's an algorithm that a computer would use to brute force it. And because humans are good at pattern-matching (relative to computers) we can mostly just skip past all of the variations that intuitively aren't funny.

And I'm skipping over a whole lot - comedy isn't /just/ about the unexpected. Here's one of my other favorite jokes:

#+begin_quote
  Two muffins are in an oven. One of them says, "It's getting hot in here." The other says, "Holy shit, a talking muffin!"
#+end_quote

That's an easy joke to dissect - it's funny because it has two layers of humor to it, the first being the subversion of the joke's premise and the second being the subversion of the muffin's self-awareness. But why muffins? I've actually thought about this a lot - this is a common joke, and I've heard it many, many times. But it's always been muffins. /In theory/, the joke works the same no matter what the two things are, but in practice, the fact that they're muffins lends something non-obvious to the humor. Is it because muffins are traditionally thought of as bland? Is it something to do with the sound of the word "muffin"? Jokes undergo memetic mutation, but this joke always stars two muffins, which says to me that it must be the most funny variant. But I don't know why.

There's this whole field of "intrinsic" comedy that I have a lot of trouble with. If someone gets hit in the face with a fish, and that fish is named, 90% of the time that fish will be a mackerel. If there's a vegetable, it'll probably be a zucchini, in disproportion to their representation among vegetables. Partly this must be down to the sounds that they make, but saying that a hard "K" sound is inherently funny only raises further questions.

Anyway, if you really want to get good at comedy (and I don't claim that I am), what you need to do is develop that instinct, and the best way to do that is /not/ by following a formula, but by watching and reading enough comedy that you can begin to have those patterns etched into your mind without having to bother with the intermediary stuff.
