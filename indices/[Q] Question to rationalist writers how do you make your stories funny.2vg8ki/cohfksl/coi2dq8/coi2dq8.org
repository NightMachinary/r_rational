I think this is a pretty good explanation of how humor works.

Though I think a step is missing from your explanation..

You give a situation, and then examples of how it could be made funny, good examples, but you don't show the process of actually getting them(which i suspect is the hard part that won't come naturally to most people).

Maybe adding a step where you list all of the assumptions\cliches that apply, and then offer suggestions of how to subvert them. After which you get a list of subversion where you should be able to tell which are funny and which are not..

Also, you'r hunters joke would fit [[http://myanimelist.net/anime/15751/Senyuu.][senyuu]] like a glove.. :P
