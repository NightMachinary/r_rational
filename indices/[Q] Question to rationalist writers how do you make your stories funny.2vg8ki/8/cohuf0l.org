Humour often comes from situation. One particularly rational situation ripe for humour is when a character makes some long chain of (perfectly reasonable) deductions, based upon some "fact" that they believe for reasonable reasons (involving lack of information), but is not actually true.

This works particularly well if they are interacting with other people who are aware of the truth, but don't know that the original character is unaware of it.

There is the rather nasty variation of this where rational A, B and C are talking; A & B know something that C doesn't, and A & B amuse themselves having a conversation that will be misinterpreted by C. [This is also done without B].

Most people don't trust long chains of logic, as they assume they will make a mistake somewhere. Many people who think of themselves as smart and/or rational will erroneously trust themselves to long chains of logic.
