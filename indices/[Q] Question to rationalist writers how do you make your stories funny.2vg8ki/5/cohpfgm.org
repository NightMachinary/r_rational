This mental process is mostly opaque to me, but one interaction with the 'rationalist' part of rationalist fiction comes from the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_act][Double Act]] aspect of comedy, in which the rationalist can either play the Straight or Only Sane Person via bringing a logical perspective to an illogical situation, or the Banana Person via bringing a confusing foreign perspective or thinking outside the box.

To introduce the setup for a comedic situation, you need both craziness and the perspective that reacts to the craziness. I don't have a deliberate theory behind this; both the craziness, and writing the reaction to that craziness, come naturally to me. But it's the best advice I can offer.
