I see. And the total number of arcs isn't planned?

That is, the way I see it, the plot seems to have a clear ending condition: resolution of the demonic threat. I assume it would be resolved in finite time, with the conflict not being stretched on and on. If the number of arcs isn't limited by that... Oh, but that would be spoilers, I suppose.
