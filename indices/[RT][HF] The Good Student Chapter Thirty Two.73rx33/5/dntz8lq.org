All this talk of money makes me wonder about the war between Ranvar and the demons. Arcanum seems to be metaphorical shavings and filings left behind during the minting of magic, so to speak... I wonder what Davo's thesis would be about the demon war?

I don't think we know enough about demons yet, but I imagine that the War over Value will play a role in the story to come.
