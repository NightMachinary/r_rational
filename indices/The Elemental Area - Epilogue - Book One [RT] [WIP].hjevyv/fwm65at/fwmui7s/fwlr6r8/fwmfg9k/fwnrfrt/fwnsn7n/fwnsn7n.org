It seems that any kind of reward doesn't apply until the player looks at their wristband interface. This tends to disable the player, if not knock them out altogether, so nobody does so in the middle of a fight.

My own headcanon is that the reward does not exist until the player checks their interface. When they do, Meg then calculates, applies, and notifies of the reward. Take this with a grain of salt.
