Hmm, I had to stop reading when I consistently saw him take the physical option after spending a million lines describing why the mental option would be powergaming but he couldn't afford being weak. It made sense in the beginning but seeing him continue with the SAME choices even when he clearly saw that he was, to put it in a word, much stupider than other members of his team, felt like a cop-out that artificially wanted to keep his power level low.

Also, the Swedish lady is so fucking annoying and a simple apology wasn't enough for me to start liking her.
