Oh man. I picked up on the 5 members of the oversight committee = 5 elements, and completely spaced on the elemental affinities/constructive-destructive cycles = personality conflicts and who gets along with whom.

Although, I did find it interesting to note that of the greater ascended identified in this chapter, only Tygerion, a lesser ascended, has a name that doesn't appear to be quasi/elementally related (unless I missed something).

[Edit] clarified Tygerion's status vs the council members
