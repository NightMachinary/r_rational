There's a lot of (sometimes literal) world-building in the epilogue. It looks like the elements are, themselves, the five highest beings in the Immortal Collective. Tygerion appears to be an ascended Fire user who (logically) doesn't get along with two of the five.

The sequences with other players hint that there are a /lot/ more features hidden around the Arena than the ones we've seen so far.

We also see a couple more of the rival species. One of them appears to be both brutish and monstrous - a likely common rival for Maya's presumed federation.
