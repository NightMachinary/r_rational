I think Tyggy is tricking himself about how real Meg's friendship with him is. Seems like if it is/was lonely it has the power to fix that.

Rather, I think it relating to him in this way for/in roughly the same reasons the others are rolling their eyes at his cheating. She/they find it to be cute young ascended behavior to think he is putting one over on them.
