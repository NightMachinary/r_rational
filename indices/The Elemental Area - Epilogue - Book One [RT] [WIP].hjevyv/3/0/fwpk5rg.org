Things have changed. Details below, if you're interested (but a bit spoilery for you).

Nathan's skill growth is mixed between Physical and Mental, but his primary NP investments have continued to be Physical. That said, Nathan is very likely to see Mental skill-ups in the near term. A lot of his better skills are enhanced by, or increase his Mental attribute.

Johanna is still around, but has all but vanished from the narrative.

Nathan's performance and interactions with the other players continue to be a mixed bag. Players learn and grow, but this comes at the cost of occasional moments of disharmony that have made me wince. The story is gritty, and characters earn their successes.
