Has anyone gotten NP in the middle of a fight? I think no one gets anything until the fight is over. Keeping a monster alive would be something to try, but I wouldn't be surprised if it prevents any NP or other benefits from the group it came from, or eventually despawns, or has some other effect that would break this plan.
