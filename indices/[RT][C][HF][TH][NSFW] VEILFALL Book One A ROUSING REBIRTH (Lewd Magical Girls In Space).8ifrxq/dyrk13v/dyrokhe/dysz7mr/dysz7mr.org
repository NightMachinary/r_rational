The article you linked wasnt about rationalists, it was about "plasticbrains" which from the sound of it seems like just another word for people who have high functioning autism/aspergers, unless I'm really missing something. IIRC, there is a higher rate of high functioning autism amongst rationalists than the general population, and a higher rate of transgender amongst people with high functioning autism than the general population.
