ARR is set in a near-future alternate history where supernatural phenomena are real, but have been hidden from the public eye by a memetic masquerade/perception filter (known in-universe as the Veil); although most people don't know that magic is the cause, magic has had many effects on society, including prompting earlier development of fairly advanced (hard-science) technology for colonizing the solar system.

The deuteragonists are Cameron and Eelesia, two different Magical Girls. Cameron is new to being a Magical Girl (new at the "Girl" thing, too*), and she juggles her new life as an extremely sex-positive porn star with her new life as a sex-positive warrior of lewd justice against erotic horrors; Eelesia is an experienced Magical Girl on the outs with her Lawful Stupid patron, the Beacon, both for breaking sexual taboos and for her long-term goal of tearing down the Veil.

(*which only proves that this novel is rational, because as we all know, [[https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2017/02/23/plasticbrains/][rationalism and transness are highly comorbid]] /s)

Cameron and Eelesia's respective adventures and misadventures end up entangling them together, and, of course, taking them across the solar system, which includes some fairly diverse human (and non-human) cultures.

All in all, I absolutely loved this story and recommend it; but it is very unflinching and straightforward in being what it is, so personal tastes may object.
