  I suppose I miscalculated the extent to which those words have completely ceased to have anything like their literal meaning even to readers who are at least in theory supposed to know politics is the mind-killer and think for more than five seconds about context before going with their flavor-of-the-day knee-jerk reaction.

The entire point of reactions is that you don't stop and think about which one you're going to have. And politics is also spiders, in that it's hard to reason well about it well when you're reading a book and suddenly one jumps out of the page and AAARGH IT'S ON MY FACE. That phrase threw me out of the flow of the story, and I did have to stop and think about it. For someone who's already a bit put off by Cameron's actually-strange approach to sex, I can see how it'd be a breaking point. For me, a bit more context and Cameron's general approach to things sufficed to help me read the phrase differently.

  But fine. Nothing is lost if I edit two words into a less topically-fraught descriptive phrase, I suppose.

Yep.
