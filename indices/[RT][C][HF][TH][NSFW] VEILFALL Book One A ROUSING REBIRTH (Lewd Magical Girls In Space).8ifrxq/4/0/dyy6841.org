At first, I was very confused about how that could possibly be a complaint.

But, of course.

I suppose I miscalculated the extent to which those words have completely ceased to have anything like their literal meaning even to readers who are at least in theory supposed to /know politics is the mind-killer/ and think for more than five seconds about context before going with their flavor-of-the-day knee-jerk reaction.

But fine. Nothing is lost if I edit two words into a less topically-fraught descriptive phrase, I suppose.
