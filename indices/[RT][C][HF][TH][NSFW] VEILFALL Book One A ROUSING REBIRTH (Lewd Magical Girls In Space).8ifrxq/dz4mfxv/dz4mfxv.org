I read the whole thing and greatly enjoyed it, before I saw it linked here even. It was only afterwards looking through your QQ index post that I connected you to Forever After Earth and the Whatley fanfic version of Cameron. Your writing has greatly improved since those. In particular, this felt better on the story-structure level of having a good overall plot, +and I quite liked the original setting.+ The Veil seems like a masquerade which could actually exist, and I fully give it my suspension of disbelief (which can be a problem sometimes for masquerade/urban fantasy settings).

Edit: ok, after reading the CYOA it's based on, the setting is less original than I thought. Still, some parts -- soul mods, the crossroads, have been fleshed out a lot, and the humanity-throughout-the-solar-system thing is new and adds a lot.
