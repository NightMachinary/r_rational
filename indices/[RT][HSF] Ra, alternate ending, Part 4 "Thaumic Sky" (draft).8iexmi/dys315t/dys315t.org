Oh jeez. I can really feel for Laura- as far as she's concerned her entire existence is a sick joke - nothing she ever does will "matter." She's not in heaven, she's not in hell, Natalie has killed them all.

Except it's a little more complicated than that and they didn't really have any way to win there. But I still feel for her.
