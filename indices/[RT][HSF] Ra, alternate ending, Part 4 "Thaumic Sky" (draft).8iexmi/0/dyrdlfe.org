The new state of affair seems way better than the older ending, although there's still a sort of danger left.

In the end Laura isn't wholly wrong but also trying to overload the simulation and kill everyone in it isn't exactly the right way to go to solve the problem.

Perhaps there's some exploit in the new simulation...

Also I wonder if somebody can build a new akashic record within the simulation
