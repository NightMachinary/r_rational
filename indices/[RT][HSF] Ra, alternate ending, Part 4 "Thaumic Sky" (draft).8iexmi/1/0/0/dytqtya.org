I don't actually think that's it. They got shafted with the worst of both worlds. If they were the other sort of virtuals, they'd have the ability to change internal fundamental laws at a whim and almost costlessly impose their wills on their virtual universe, while still being able to send emissaries to the real universe. Their particular flavor of virtuality only permits them to use the resources available in the simulation. They can't reach out in any way, and they know it's all fake, with nearly no hope of rescue---indeed, if their universe is ever discovered by the original virtuals, existence could be snuffed out instantly, with zero notice.
