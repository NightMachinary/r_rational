At this point, it seems like Natalie successfully preserved the status quo, for the sake of all the inhabitants in the recreated world. From her perspective, the alternative was annihilation. There was no escaping virtualization, and to dump all of the existing consciousness into unrestricted virtual existence would likely have been equivalent to dumping a load of goldfish into the open sea.

I'm guessing Laura (not a status-quo person) is going to push for a controlled release into the greater virtualization. I've read nothing to suggest she's a real-reality ideologue - in a sense, the virtualization is more real than the world she's known (it developed organically, while her world was carefully recreated and tampered with).
