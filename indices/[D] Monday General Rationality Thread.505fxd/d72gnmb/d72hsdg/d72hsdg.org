I struggle with a similar issue. It leads to a lack of motivation for sure. My greatest success in overcoming that specific feeling of accomplishing nothing is to find something with a small cost to me in terms of effort and yet creates or causes something I value. In short, to accomplish something fairly easily. I can then point to the fact that one more step had been taken towards my goals as actual evidence that yes, I do in fact get things done.

Measuring progress towards a big goal in terms of sub-steps also helps me keep a realistic sense of progress.
