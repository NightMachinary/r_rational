  The problem was deciding what a node is. Do you have a node for “heart attack”? Well, one study says a certain risk factor increases the risk of having a heart attack before 50, while another says that a different risk factor increases the lifetime number of heart attacks. Does this mean we need two nodes?

IMO you have two nodes, and start pushing for a (very large) set of standard measurements. Essentially I think there's a disproportionate value in the final approach to 'as accurate as possible'.
