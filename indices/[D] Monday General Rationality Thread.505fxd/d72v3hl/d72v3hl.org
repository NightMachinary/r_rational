In November, I'll be attending a conference in California entitled "Reducing Diagnostic Error in Medicine" which is basically the Less Wrong of the medical world.

It'll be my first time attending the conference and while I'm interested in doing research and publishing on the subject, right now I'm struggling to find the right angle. My medical school would fund research with medical students, but I'd probably be limited to doing something about early cognitive biases and dysrationalia overrides. My real passion is in a Bayesian-styled probability generator/calculator for differential diagnoses based on signs, symptoms, and testing, especially if we could train a Watson-like system to scrub for the data in electronic medical records that link s/sx/labs to diagnosis codes.... but to be honest, I don't think that the broader medical community is really interested in this. The biggest threat to build such a Bayesian system, to be honest, is the drive for documentation is driven by reimbursement by insurance companies and the threat of malpractice, rather than the genuine desire to capture a patient's information accurately in a narrative format.

Networking with rational doctors and sniffing out alternative funding sources for research are my two main goals for attending such a conference, but I'd also be interested in reporting back on my findings here, although that depends on medical rationality interests of the community.

I've inquired a few times before, but is anyone interested in medicine on this forum? I think [[/u/gnimhey]] used to frequent this reddit and even wrote an awesome crossover fic between Worm and Shadows of Limelight.
