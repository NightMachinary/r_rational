So I'm starting me 3rd semester of college right now, and have noticed something really interesting. When I first started college, I was super motivated all the time, and basically was always working on projects. Once summer started I lost all that motivation, and felt like it was probably just a result of the novelty of my first year. However, I feel the same this semester. The college environment spikes my productivity by at least 10x, and to an extent that seems crazy when I'm not in this mental frame. I've been trying to figure out what it is that kills my akrasia so I can utilize it outside of the schoolyear. I think a big part of it is that other people have expectations of me, and I know other people will recognize/praise my accomplishments. I'm pretty sensitive to other people's opinions, so this makes sense to me. Ideally though, I would value my own opinion of my work as much as other people's. Doing so would make me less dependent for motivation, and more resilient to social pressures. Does anyone know of any techniques to make yourself value your own markers of success more?
