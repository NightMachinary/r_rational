I'm not really sure of what works, but I guess I have a long list of things that don't work, or look like they work but don't make things better long term.

My current is strategy is to rely as little as possible on lists, physical constraints and external tools, because they make it easier to fall into a cycle of bad habits when I no longer have them (ex: relying too much on website-delaying plug-ins means resume wasting my time on the internet as soon as I switch the plug-ins off or get a new computer). I'm trying to be as mobile as I can, and never rely on tools I can't easily replace.

Otherwise, I try to notice the relevant choices when I'm making them, and analyse their consequence. My reasoning, based on past experience, is that at some point I'm too drained of willpower to do anything productive or sensible, but most of the time, when I actually have the energy to make good choices, I fail to make them because I don't pay attention to the fact that there's a choice at all.

Everything I just said didn't make a lot of sense, and I doubt it could really apply to anybody else. I'm just trying to explain/rationalize my current philosophy regarding akrasia, which is mostly a result of non-shareable experience and a lot of trial-and-error, and I'm still doing it wrong anyway.

As for measuring productive time... actually, I should do that. The main problem is that automated tools only measure one type of activity and a manual tool can give skewed results if you forget to switch it off, but that's probably not too hard to work around. I'll just have to figure out how to log activity time on unix systems.
