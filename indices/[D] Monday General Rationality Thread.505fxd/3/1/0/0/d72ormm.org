  Only things I could possibly value is ones requiring grand plans
#+end_quote

Give us an example of something you would value that cannot be accomplished but by the use of a grand plan?

It would be a little odd, to me, if something could be accomplished with a "grand plan" but not be broken down into smaller ones.

Like if your grand plan was to start a country-wide company that helped the homeless. Sure that seems impossible to just /do./

But you can make those sub-steps. The way I see it you could divide that grand plan pretty easily into two sides: the business/company-running side of it, and the actual help given to the homeless.

*/Business Side/*\\
You need to know how to start a company.\\
You need to know how to run said company successfully.\\
You need to know how to fund your company\\
You need to know how to staff your company

*Substeps*\\
Learn how to start a company. Either internet research, business school, or finding a business owner who is willing to take you under their wing as a kind of apprentice.\\
Determine the most successful companies in the same or a similar industry and compare them to see what they all do, and what they all /don't/ do\\
Go to a bank and ask a qualified professional to help you understand everything you need to know about gathering starting capital or a business loan.\\
Take a management course or hire someone with management experience to handle it for you.

*/Homeless Side/*\\
You need to know what the homeless need most.\\
You need to know how to get that thing, and distribute it.

*Substeps*\\
Approach similar companies, soup kitchens, homeless outreach centers and find out what item or service is missing or can't be accessed for some reason.\\
Determine which of the things from above are either most needed or easier to get and distribute.

The point is, it's very rare that there's a single, grandiose step to accomplish any given goal or task that cannot be tackled bit by bit.

For each of those steps and substeps, if it seems like it's beyond you or your current capabilities you look to see what, exactly, it is that is holding you back from being able to do it. Once you know why you can't move forward, you make a plan to deal with that issue or shortcoming and continue on from where you had to stop.
