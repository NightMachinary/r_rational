To track time I used successfully [[https://toggl.com/][toggl]] and its chrome extension. It's built for freelancers, so you can track different types of activities if you wish. One click on your browser and it starts counting, and it's smart enough that if you were AFK it asks you: "you passed the last N minutes away from the computer, should I consider it or not?"
