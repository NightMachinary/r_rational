Actually, yes! I recently read a PDF of a book called /How to munchkin D&D campaigns, get your shit together, construct GAI, and become immortal/ that I found linked in a [[/r/science]] comment.

Well, that is, I started reading it, but I only had the link saved on Reddit and the comment was deleted for being off topic. Typical.

So the lesson is, always save the PDF itself. Never just the link.
