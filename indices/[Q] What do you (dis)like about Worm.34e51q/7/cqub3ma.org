I think this is largely a selection effect, where people who don't like Worm don't finish and therefore just don't talk about it first. This was my experience--I simply found Worm to be Just. Too. Wordy. I have tolerance for very long works of art, but Worm just exhausted me in a way that, say, Homestuck or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom][Prince of the Dark Kingdom]] didn't. I've tried to start Pact and Twig and given up for the same reason.
