I'm completely biased about this, but if you're talking about the troll introductions, they're over faster than you think and then the good parts start.

And HS is not like Lost where we never get resolution, shit gets solved faster than new mysteries appear, especially after the part you're in. Anyway, I recommend you get back into it if the troll introductions were the only part you disliked.
