Nah, the troll introductions weren't all I disliked.

I disliked the solutions to several of the mysteries when they showed up. They seemed forced - as if the universe was bending over backwards to allow something to have a neat minimal solution within the scope of previously shown elements even if it works with completely ir/rational/ methods by the sidebar definition. Everything happens because the plot requires it.

The story, taken separately from the mysteries, seemed mediocre, with flat characters, small scope and no world-building beyond the strictly necessary for creating confusion.

I have seen this response to posts saying someone didn't enjoy something which they therefore decided to drop often. I'm not sure how often because of selective memory, but in two cases I've seen different people say the same about two different points in the same serial medium, both just a short while after the person they were talking to decided to drop it. So you're right that it's probably some kind of bias talking.
