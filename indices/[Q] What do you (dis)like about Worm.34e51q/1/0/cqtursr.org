Agreed with the lack of downtime. That being said, I loved the pace, there was never a dull chapter.

One thing I really loved reading from other characters perspective. It made the world seem more realistic and interconnected as opposed to a single playable character. The other viewpoint chapters would usually be the highlights of section.
