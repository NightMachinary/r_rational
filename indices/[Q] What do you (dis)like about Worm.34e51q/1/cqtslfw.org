A criticism of Worm that I've heard before, and can somewhat agree with, is that it constantly escalates with little to no breaks in the tension. Aside from a few (and I mean very few) miniscule happy moments in the earlier sections, it all just kind of goes to hell. And keeps descending. After the Leviathan attack (not that things were that happy before) things just keep getting progressively worse and there's little to no relief, barring the end. And even THAT comes with its own baggage and hangups. It's less of a “Happily Ever After” and more of a “Well...at least we're not all dead?” sort of vibe. So yea. Worm isn't a happy story. And unlike other stories that aren't happy ones (mysteries, horrors, etc.), Worm is especially massive in length. It's a long time for things to just be depressing all the time. I believe that's the main criticism people have for Worm.

Overall, Worm is wonderfully gripping. It's deep, thought out, was updated at a RIDICULOUS pace (Seriously, I wonder if Wildbow wasn't some sort of AI, he'd write 30k words in like 2 days!) packed with action and superpowers, in a unique way. It's just...you never feel like the main characters are winning. At least for more than a chapter or two, because an even bigger threat rears its head almost immediately.
