What do I dislike about Worm. From a entertainment point of view, very little.

From a rational point of view? Probably the origin of the entities themselves. The entire idea of a planet of trillions of independent beings existing for millions of years in fierce competition, and none of them coming up with the idea of cooperation until one brilliant individual happens to consider it is... difficult to swallow. The fact that they all immediately agreed that it was a good idea, and then ate the innovator just makes me throw up my hands in the air with a giant WTF.

But that was backstory :)

There's plenty of other things that don't make sense. Wildbow doesn't write rational fiction. Worm is more rational-feeling than most super-power fiction (IMHO) because it's a grey-morality world instead of the typical black-and-white super-powered world, and the backstory gives a clear reason for the irrationality of capes.
