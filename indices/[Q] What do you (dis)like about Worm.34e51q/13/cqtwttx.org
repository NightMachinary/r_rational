Worm has an eventually compelling main character, some good arcs (16-23), a lot of cool, neat powers, a ridiculous update schedule, frikkin endbringers, and, like, lots of bugs. It's smart and tense and you always want to know what the next guy's power is and how they're gonna get out of this one. As far as serial fiction goes, it basically does everything it should, constantly ramping things up, introducing new characters and plot elements and powers, always ending on a hook, never giving the characters any time to rest. It's probably better read as serial fiction chapter-by-chapter than in big chunks.

I think it suffers from a lack of clear motivation in its main characters. Before we find out about the shards, it's unclear why the Undersiders are motivated to fight other parahumans rather than use their powers to make money or just live a normal life. That seems like something an edit would have a hard time addressing unless it wants to reveal more about shards early on. Also: character voices and personality types are too similar and limited, probably something the edit will struggle with as well if that's just how Wildbow writes his characters.
