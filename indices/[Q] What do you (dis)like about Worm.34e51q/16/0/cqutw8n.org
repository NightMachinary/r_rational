That's curious. Do you often find protagonists unsympathetic? How about people or 'losers' in general?

I've only had that happen once with Walter White. I explained that as a (morally) reprehensible choice too close to choices I face for comfort. (As opposed to The Godfather or House of Cards, which seem fictional).

So, why do you think you dislike her?

The fight scene and everything else gets to be long because the reader is supposed to be invested in Taylor at that point. Similarly you're willing to buy some weird worldbuilding. It seems like she could be your single point of failure.
