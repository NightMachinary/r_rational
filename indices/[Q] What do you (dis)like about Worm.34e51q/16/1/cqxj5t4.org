Really? Wow. I was bullied a fair bit in high school and I felt that Taylor was incredibly relateable from that perspective. I was actually pretty surprised to find out that the author was a bloke, because a lot of male authors don't realise how thoroughly fucked-up teenage girls can be to each other, and how much "learned helplessness" you can end up with as a result.
