I think Wildbow intended for her to be deeply flawed. The superheros in this world are "birthed" through trauma, invariably. Outside of the Cauldron capes (which make up a small percentage of the parahumans of the world) every single hero has to have a deeply traumatic experience to "trigger". In essence, powers in Worm are a *really* kickass form of PTSD. With the added bonus of alien mojo pushing you to seek conflict. That's a lot of power and crazy put together. And Taylor is heavily damaged, that's part of what makes her interesting. We get to watch her heal and grow. Now, whether who she heals /into/ is healthier is a debate for another day.

And to address your comment about how she seems at the beginning of the story, and her "magic powers that could easily solver her problems", can I ask you to propose some ideas as to how she'd do that? While we've grown with her and seen how she grows to munchkin her bug control, it's not THAT strong of a power without the experience of it. What could she do to fix any of her problems? Do you suggest she attack her attackers? That would lead to her being discovered. And if she attacks them in a way that can't be linked to her, then what's the trio's incentive to stop the bullying? Ok, let's say she decides to incapacitate them. What's the incentive? While their effects on her psychology are titanic, they haven't done anything worth being injured to that degree, especially to someone like Taylor who just isn't that mean. And do you not consider her resourcefulness a positive quality? She's not a happy person. So she's not going to have happy thoughts, at least not a lot of them. But she's resourceful, intelligent, strong. Those are fairly good qualities, wouldn't you say?
