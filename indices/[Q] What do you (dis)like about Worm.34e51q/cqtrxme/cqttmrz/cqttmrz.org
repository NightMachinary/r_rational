  Power/scope creep is real. I found it fun, but looking back on it, it's kinda ridiculous just how far things escalated, from running into some genuine difficulty with taking on a handful of young capes in the process of robbing a bank, to defeating a whole swarm of cloned S9 members without really seeming to break a sweat, and then having to basically fight God.

That.

It's like reading early Doc Smith (except without the racism). If you've never read the Skylark series, every couple of chapters there's a new super-science power-up.
