It's good, but it's very.... dated.

This is where HJPEV gets "Kimball Kinnison" from, he's the main character of the first few novels.

Reading through it, you can tell it was made in the 30s. Sexism is pretty rampant. They have spaceships /with no electronic computers/. Everything is done manually. They have adding machines, but no automatic systems.

At one point, Kinnison has to set up a widget with some string and levers to /randomly pull direction levers/ because their interstellar starship doesn't have an autopilot.

It's flat Good vs Evil. No grey areas at all, and no problem wiping out entire enemy planets because obviously anyone on their side is irredeemably evil.

It's very much a heroic story, Kinnison is the focus, he's a larger than life self-effacing hero, who is good at literally everything he ever does (excepting perhaps, talking to women, which is again very traditional). He's basically a Solar Exalted.

The technical details tend to be written as "they took a wrench to it and fixed it in 20 minutes" or "the boys back at the lab licked the Death Star Laser problem". Though there is a scientist who tags along on one mission who seems to be an alright sort.
