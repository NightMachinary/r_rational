As a devout Worm-lover, two criticisms of the "bad". It's pretty explicitly said that Taylor /isn't/ close to the Chicago Wards. Except for Golem, it was all a working professional relationship, and even with him they weren't so much "close" as "on the same page".

And as regards the S9000, the 9 of them were battle-hardened, veteran cape psychopaths, with years to decades of experience. The 9000 were phlogiston and b-roll memories cobbled together with secondhand tinkertech. Considering the forces of "basically everyone" arrayed against them, it didn't really break my suspension of disbelief at all - on the contrary, I found those segments as suspenseful as anything else. At least the parts actually shown, I think most of the slaughtering happened off-screen.

But I do have to second the time skip criticism. I think the story really needed another 1-3 arcs fleshing out that transition, expecially with some more breathing room.
