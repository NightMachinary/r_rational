The good:

- The setting is interesting and reinvigorates the idea of a world populated by super-powered costumed hereoes and villains. The idea is a bit inherently silly but suspension of disbelief holds up.

- The characters are varied and well-realised and their powers are diverse to the point of there being no exact duplication - not an endless parade of "Dudes who can shoot energy beams and punch stuff".

- Also on powers, a lot of them require some genuine creativity in their application, and not everyone is a tank capable of trading heavy hits, so there's some subtlety to the fighting rather than levelling a city block in every encounter because the only way to make a point of hitting someone /hard/ is to throw them though a building.

- The plot is moved along mostly by people doing stuff for their own reasons rather than people doing stuff because the plot needs to move along.

- The action moments in the big fights are suitably intense, but there's also some good down-time and character fluff and humour in between them.

- Our protagonists seem intelligent and relatable but not overly perfect, and the antagonists aren't just evil for the sake of evil - they have their own stuff going on which we occasionally get to see through interludes. Mostly. Not always. Some of them are just psychopathic assholes.

- Speaking of interludes, interludes are pretty awesome as a change of perspective - either to see the villain's side of things or explore some backstory, or occasionally to be shown a decidedly /different/ kind of mind.

- Similarly, there are some chapters that feel like Wildbow was daring himself just to see if he could take something that's difficult to render into prose and make it /work/, and it generally /does/ and that's pretty cool.

The bad:

- At times the 'intensity' of all the fights hits the point of oversaturation, and can become hard to follow when you're reading at the pace the text feels like it demands... this is somewhat a criticism wrapped in praise, since it's generally a sign of something good when the inherent pace of the text is able to make me read faster.

- Examples of the above would include the first 8 arcs where it seems like they're fighting every other group in the city one after the other without much pause, and also some of the arcs leading up to the end... I need to re-read those some day because I really didn't manage to follow the details of where they actually /were/, to be able to picture the setting beyond "underground tunnel" or "generic research facility".

- The time-skip is abrupt and jarring and weird and leaves us in an odd place where we're /told/ that Taylor has been with her new team for longer than the entire rest of the story before that point, so now she's theoretically closer to them than the Undersiders, but we never got the opportunity to make that journey with her and really feel as close to them as we do to the "good ol' days", or to develop the same understanding of who they are as characters. I mostly just kept wanting her to go back to the old team ASAP.

- I have real trouble keeping the giant character-roster and their respective stories/powers straight in my head. Although that doesn't actually impact too badly on reading the story - if it's plot-relevant then there's generally an easy reminder and then I go "Oh, it's /that/ guy".

- Power/scope creep is real. I found it /fun/ (if I'm honest I'm torn as to whether this is a bug or a selling point), but looking back on it, it's kinda ridiculous just how far things escalated, from running into some genuine difficulty with taking on a handful of young capes in the process of robbing a bank, to defeating a whole /swarm/ of cloned S9 members without really seeming to break a sweat, and then having to basically fight God.

I'm sure there's more to say on both sides (I'll probably think of more and edit it in) but this is what came to mind first.
