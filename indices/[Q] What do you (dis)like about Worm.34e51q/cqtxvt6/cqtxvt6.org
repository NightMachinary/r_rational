The timeskip, I didn't like the S9000 much because the Slaughterhouse 9 was so horrific, and I really didn't want to revisit that. But probably my least favorite of all was taking such a long break from Taylor's POV to get the entire backstory of the Travelers. I did not care that much about them and certainly not so much to be happy reading about them while Taylor's stuff was unresolved.

There needed to be a bit more downtime than have every chapter be a cliffhanger, I know it was serial fiction but if it ever gets edited I'd want some more downtime to process events. If Taylor actually got to a plateau or mini-resolution, and was stable and happy, maybe THEN take a walk down memory lane and spend so much time on the Travelers.
