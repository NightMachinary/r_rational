I, um, didn't finish it. So some of this might resolve later in the story.

If I had to put a finger on /why/ I didn't finish it, I think it's because there's just too many powers for me. Too many superpowers, too many variables, the entire game can change with new Super at any time. There's no way for me to predict things, solve puzzles, or really explore the implications of a single power.

Also, it's too action-oriented for me. If I had some of those powers you can bet I'd be involved in stuff unrelated to plotting and combat. And the characters mostly interact as allies and enemies, rarely on any other plane. And while I enjoy a good machiavellian plot as much as anyone, my suspension of disbelief breaks whenever there are several extremely convoluted ones interacting.

For the above reasons, I'm not really sure why worm is "rational". But, I think these criticisms say more about the genres I enjoy than they do about Worm, though.
