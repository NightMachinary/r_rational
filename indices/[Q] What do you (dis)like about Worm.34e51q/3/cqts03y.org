This will be an entirely positive and constructive conversation, I can already tell.

  What do you think the good and bad parts are of Worm? What was it that made it stick so hard in the memesphere of our community and adjoining communities?
#+end_quote

Its length, and a dedication to a specific brand of gritty "realism"--in answer to all three questions, Good, Bad, and Stickiness.

*Good*: it's long and well exceeds certain minimum levels of plot-driven storytelling and world building.

*Bad*: it's too long and wallows around torturing characters and the world itself with +almost+ fetishistic fervor and detail.

*Stickiness*: people at a time HPMOR was sleeping really wanted large servings of speculative fiction that wasn't YA, Hunger-Games-esque /meh/ or modern comics and their endless plotting failures. There was better stuff out there I'm sure, but Worm was in the right place at the right time, for the right price (free), and in huge heaping servings regularly updated. It continues to stand out because it was many people's first original, uncompromising rational fiction, among other obvious reasons.
