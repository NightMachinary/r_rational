It doesn't take a good author or a good story to have a loss of control. A story escaping the control of the author is sort of like a car escaping the control of the driver. Sure, it might result in some momentary excitement and a rush of adrenaline, but there's a big risk of a crash and burn. Worm never really crashes, but it does teeter wildly out of control in a few places.
