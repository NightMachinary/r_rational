Yeah, Twig is doing better for me, because Sy always seems to have a plan, or is at least able to tweak his enemy's nose. We get the feeling that even if the odds are against him, he knows more than he lets on.

Blake, on the other hand, almost never had any idea what was going on. This is a plot gripe, not a character one; it was entirely reasonable to be in the dark when he was thrown into a new world without any guidance. I /liked/ Blake, maybe even more than Taylor and Sy -- Taylor seemed too inconsistently ambitious and passive for me, and Sy is a little too nonchalant about everything except Mary, which hurts my idea of what's at stake. It's just that even Blake's temporary victories are usually framed as defeats. I think that the only time in the entire story that Blake had an unambiguous win of his own that didn't foreshadow doom and didn't involve an extreme sacrifice of his future happiness was the fairy with Sephiroth's sword at the beginning, and even then, the lawyer's presence was kind of tainting that.
