Yep. I've said it before, I'll say it again: I didn't even realize how "grimdark" Worm was while reading it until afterward when someone mentioned it and I thought back on the story. Taylor is such a strong, active, and oddly /optimistic/ character, even when she doesn't seem to be, that I never have time to wallow in the darkness of it all. No matter how bad things get, she just powers through in a heartening and sometimes heartbreaking way, such that the few times she has moments of self doubt, I'm just like "Don't sweat it girl, you got this."

No matter how bad things got, I knew Taylor would never, ever give up. That was the light at the end of the tunnel that kept things from seeming as bad as they were, for me.
