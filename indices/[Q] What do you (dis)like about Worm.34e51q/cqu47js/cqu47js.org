I found a lot of worm really good, it scratched a lot of itches I had at the time.

As a criticism I think it kind of drifted from 'OH GOD NO!' moments of horror which I'd call good to "NO YOU ARE AN IDIOT WHY?!" which is on the edge of 'bad'.

It however has the BEST example of a villain defeating a 'hero' with a witty quip I've ever seen.
