Fair enough, even though I don't understand what you mean by "everything happens because the plot requires it" as that's an inherent quality of fiction. I also disagree with the characters being flat, apart from Jade and a few of the trolls, they're all pretty deep.

But if you weren't satisfied with those solutions, then you're not going to enjoy Homestuck, so it's pointless to argue further.
