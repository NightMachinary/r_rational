(I'm at 47%, but don't mind spoilers. Taylor drove the Slaughterhouse 9 away and is struggling with Coil.)

The universe and world building is amazing. Creative and rational in the sense that Wildbow tries very hard to keep things consistent. The characters seem realistic, although I cannot empathize with Taylor's constant guilt-depression. Probably subjective.

I would prefer more celebration and moments of awesome without a depressing overtone. E.g. there should be a heartwarming party after Leviathan is gone. Humans need such consolation even after depressing catastrophes. The Undersiders should celebrate after successfully robbing the bank.

Too long, but that might just be due to the "web serial" format. It should be split into 10-20 books with clear endings and only minor cliffhangers. Compare Harry Potter.
