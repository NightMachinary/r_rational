OK, so with spoiler warnings full in place:

First of all, I read the whole damn thing because for the most part it was compulsive, well written and exciting. There are some interesting themes to grapple with and mostly I enjoyed the ride.

With that over:

-The underlying idea is super nihilistic. Everyone conflicts with everyone, and this really isn't limited to people with shards. Many adult characters are incredibly unsympathetic and horrid (directors, school teachers, excetera), to the point where we somehow find ourselves liking the Indian supervillain in the Behemoth arc over the various directors who then tell Taylor off for helping him!

-It is too episodic for such a long story, to the point of hurting pacing. There are some later fights which feel utterly inconsequential when you know the world is going to end.

-As other have noted, it's too long, and some characters are introduced far too late for us to care about them, or really understand what their point is in the story.

-The escalation is sometimes a bit frustrating. The Slaughter house 9000 arc was just a bit trying for me

-The Slaughterhouse 9 somewhat stretch my suspension of disbelief too much anyway. The idea of a group of working together sociopaths who follow a set of rules except when they don't. There's only so much you can excuse with shards, you know?

-And of course, there's the extreme body horror and explicit violence. It get's really unpleasant in the first slaughterhouse 9 arc.
