I've heard a lot of people say that Worm is too dark to really enjoy. I might have felt that way at first, but after some time I became fairly secure that Taylor and her allies could take whatever came at them. This was obviously shaken a few times, but a story should do that.

In terms of what I don't like:

To me, Wildbow's writing style seems too suited for the serial format. Some stuff feels very rushed, he sometimes slogs on in a scene for too long, and his descriptions of locations, complex concepts, or action can be a little too limited for me to get a clear picture. Taylor's goals seem a little all over the place, and it really seems like the Undersiders are destined to fight literally every group they hear about.

On the other hand:

What I like about Worm is what makes it different from other stories. Worm kills off major characters at a rate that keeps things interesting without becoming predictable (I'm looking at you, George R. R. Martin, and your once-a-book slaughter). It keeps the stakes high and holds a reader's attention. Obviously, the worldbuilding is top-notch, and the power use on the street level is amazing. Those are its real selling points, and it does them just about the best I've ever seen. On top of that, Wildbow made me care about his characters, and his picture of a frightened young girl trying to cope with a shitty life and a conscience at the same time was really captivating.

In Pact, Wildbow improved on his descriptions, though the esoteric nature of what he was describing was so out there that it sometimes made it just as hard as Worm. On the other hand, it was like watching your college roommate get into an MMA fight with a 250-pound 'roided-up Krav Maga enthusiast, then get wheeled out, broken and bleeding, only to have his girlfriend spit on him and break up.

It was just the tiniest bit difficult to read, is what I'm saying.
