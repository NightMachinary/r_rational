Mostly criticism, since you said that's mostly what's harder to find:

- Action scenes go on too long. Wildbow does a great job of describing action, but he often continues with a blow-by-blow with uniform detail throughout the scene. Tons of these scenes would do better with "and then we did that some more" or just deciding that the first hit wins more often.
- Many arcs build up to a climactic point, then nothing happens, then we build to something with less weight behind it, then that works. I remember feeling this way about the S9 and Noelle arcs, but can't remember exactly where the faulty climaxes were anymore.
- Early in the story, we have massive changes on a regular basis - Taylor joins the undersiders, Leviathan wrecks the city, Taylor starts trying to be a proper supervillain with turf - and I was very impressed that the status quo never was restored (especially after Leviathan). Later on Taylor settles in to a routine of mostly fighting, and the city gets re-trashed repeatedly, and very little has deeper consequences until we hit the timeskip.
- The timeskip is badly executed.
- Occasionally we get character development moments where Taylor talks about something we haven't seen her think about much for a long time, and how that influences her decision to do something that seemed unlikely before.
- The order that the arcs are in is hard to remember, because many of them are just a series of threats.
