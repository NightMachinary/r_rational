I think the Endbringers were originally intended (in-universe) as a device to be used by the Entities to spawn conflict, force capes to find creative uses for their shards, and prevent the world they're inflicting themselves on from uniting peacefully by periodically fucking some nation up, or acting as roving sentinels along borders to physically divide the world up.

I seem to remember mention of there being significantly more of them held in reserve that, had they been used to full effect, would have allowed them to be a constant presence but simultaneously less continent-wrecking and more an environmental hazard for area denial.

/But/ Eden went and crashed and died, so the normal plan mostly went to hell. Then Eidolon had his critical moment and the "worthy opponents" comment was perfectly calculated to utterly wreck him psychologically, by implying that they were only active because his power manifested something for him to fight, regardless of whether it was true or not (which I'm still not sure of).
