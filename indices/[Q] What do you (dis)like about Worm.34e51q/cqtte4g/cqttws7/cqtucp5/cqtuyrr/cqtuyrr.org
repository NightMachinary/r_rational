Can you please not do this?

Your plan remains incoherent. Taylor would never have done something as drastic as that without the destruction of the earth already underway to motivate her and by that time it would have been too late to set it up. Even if she had somehow been motivated to set it up in advance, how would she get the bugs into the people, set up the hostages without herself becoming a threat to be fought against by all?

And if you find solutions to those things as well, then we're obviously not talking about the "SIMPLY" you shouted at us about, we're talking about an entire and complete rewrite of the entire second half of Worm.

And what exactly is it that you're /objecting to/ that this is supposed to be the solution? You've just strung words along like "A cry tear saga, oh noes she is losing her mind story", as if we're supposed to know what it is you're objecting to already. You've not offered a coherent description of anything we're supposed to dislike, and yet you're offering an unfeasible 'solution' and bashing Wildbow for not writing the story as you would have written it.
