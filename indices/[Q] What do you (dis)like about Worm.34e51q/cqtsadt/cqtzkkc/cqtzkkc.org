Them and Endbringers. Remove endbringers and suddenly heroes are allowed to be a lot more ruthless with villains, worldwide productivity gains are not overshadowed by wiped-out cities, and tinkers with idealistic goals are allowed to make a lot more progress towards utopia without being murdered. And when you learn the Endbringers' rather unsatisfying origin story, you can't help but see them as a contrived plot device to keep the setting from straying.
