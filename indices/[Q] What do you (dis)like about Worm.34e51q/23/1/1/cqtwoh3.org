Wait, is that what bupkiss means? I just assumed it was a country slang for something to do with butts.

I agree with you points, except 7. It had to do with Taylor wanting to gather info on Undersiders, so she stayed a villain for too long. Problem is the info gathering is too weak in comparison to other Taylor's INT applications, so it does feel forced. The transition itself is good, it's the delivery that's the problem. This could be fixed by actual data gathering and possibly spying on teammates via bug tracking or something like that.

I am doing a reread at the moment, and it looks like EDIT: I forgot what I was gonna say next.
