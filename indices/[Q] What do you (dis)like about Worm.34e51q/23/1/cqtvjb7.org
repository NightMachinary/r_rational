Hah. That's the first time I've ever been called 'nothing.' And you're right, I didn't do the archive dive; mea culpa.

Before I read the comments on that thread (so as not to be influenced by others' opinions), I'm going to lay out my own thoughts about Worm.

The good:

1. Inventive setting.
2. Many intriguing characters with complex motivations.\\
3. Really interesting and unique powers.

The bad:

1. Only Taylor is allowed to munchkin her powers.
2. Superhero villains make no damn sense. Just [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutLexLuthorACheck][CutLexLuthorACheck]]. Sure, maybe there would be one or two crazies who want to put on tights and rob banks, but society would rapidly say hello to them with a sniper rifle (or etc) and then get on with their day.
3. Many of the major villains (e.g. Slaughterhouse 9) are [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz][EvilForTheLulz]]
4. Power creep was ridiculous and fighting gods is boring.
5. As several people remarked, it's got a bad case of [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarknessInducedAudienceApathy][DarknessInducedAudienceApathy]]
6. Wildbow set up this cool thing in the beginning: there are parallel dimensions with parallel people, and there is trade between them. After that brief mention he never did a damn thing with it until the last few pages. The only other dimensions that we actually spent time in were unpopulated, making them no different than a random location in the middle of nowhere on Earth.
7. The early part of the story amounts to "Taylor wants to be a hero, Armsmaster is mean to her, so she becomes a villain."\\
8. Wildbow set up an interesting, clever, reasonably articulate protagonist with relatively weak powers that she munchkined into really powerful powers. He then turned her into a mute, somewhat crazy(ier) character with overwhelming powers who was [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne][the only one]] that could save the day.
9. The biggest issue: the only way that Wildbow could find to make sense of all this was "alien worms are mind-controlling them to make them fight." This is a narrative cheat of the highest order.

Now that I see the responses in this thread I realize that yes, I have seen one criticism: the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarknessInducedAudienceApathy][DarknessInducedAudienceApathy]] seems to be a common objection.

As a question:

The Endbringers exist because...um...Eidolon needed an opponent? Or, as an incentive for capes to fight? I think? They were spawned by the worms, I think? I remember most of the stuff about the worms--aliens, absorb bits of other races to increase their own powers, came here to spawn, dropped shards to get us fighting, etc. I don't remember anything about the point of the Endbringers. Can someone clue me in?
