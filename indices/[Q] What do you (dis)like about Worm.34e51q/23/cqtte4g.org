Eaglejarl you bupkiss (edit: apparently I meant bumpkin) . Go check the archives.

Here let me just:

This has further links to even more plot hole pointery as well as a pastebin with some snide and condescending remarks by me.

Just remembered another thing. You know how at the end Taylor gets all superpower and shit. Well Wildbow could have avoided all that unnecessary, plot induced, "It all returns to nothing EVA cry tear saga", oh noes she is losing her mind story, IF HE SIMPLY LET TAYLOR PUT BUGS IN EVERY LIVING PERSON TO CHEW ON NERVES AND BRAIN IN CASE SHE DIES OR AS PAIN INTIMIDATION.

Same effect and fear inducing control, without having to play a telenovela drama crossbreed with snuff porn.

We already know she can sense parasites into dogs and this would have been a great foreshadowing.

People need to stop calling Worm rational. It is not a rational story.

Now for the good things:

Long.

In comparison to other stories, the world and effects of superpowers are more detailed and reasonable.

Updated regulary.

Long. Like so long, goodbye, I'm off on a trip to the moon, will return in a year.

Creative solutions to problems. Ants on a string? Yes please.
