Insert worms trough cappilary, or just veins, or just ears, or in lungs or wherever. Do the same to Portal guy and his pal SeeAll guy, which is same as in canon btw. And with bigger range it will be even harder to stay out of her way. She is always motivated, considering she gave herself brain surgery in canon, a little body horror is acceptable. And it is simple for a girl like Taylor.

As for the EVA cry tear saga, I am referring to her losing her mind, then people being turned against her because of her power, then finally dying by bullet to the head. The whole part is supposed to make us feel sorry for her and how she lost everything and how its all returning to nothing.

That whole thing was done for audience to feel bad for her, when you later find out she gets better because Contessa gave her power canceling brain surgery with 2 bullets to the head.

Is that clear enough for you?
