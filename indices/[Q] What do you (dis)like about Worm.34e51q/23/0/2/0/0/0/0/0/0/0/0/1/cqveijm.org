I thought I'd just drop by to mention that I downvoted a couple of your comments here, rationalidurr. Your basic idea, which is that Taylor could try to pull a Bakuda, isn't inherently objectionable, even if I don't think it would be a great plot device. The way Taylor's personality and powers change near the end certainly feel like an asspull and I think that there is a good point you could have made here.

I think the way you presented your case though was pretty bad, and bad enough it made discourse worse. I downvoted you to reduce visibility and because I have precommitted to downvoting certain kinds of behavior, and explaining why I do so. I think in general you have been caustic and not explained yourself well, and then acted more caustic when people didn't immediately buy into your explanation or agree with you.

Things like "wildbow get it together", "suck on these facts", accusing people of being irrational, and calling people liars just because they disagree with your alternative idea for a worm plot arc are unacceptable. I have therefore downvoted those comments, and this message is here so that you can adjust your behavior in future discussions and avoid future downvotes.

Keep up the good work discussing things, and try to do better in the future!
