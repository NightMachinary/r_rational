Canon has her be able to directly administer them, not be forced to rely to threats of pain and death to force her will upon them.

  As for the EVA cry tear saga, I am referring to her losing her mind, then people being turned against her because of her power, then finally dying by bullet to the head.

Even assuming that was an accurate summary, which it isn't, what exactly is the problem with that story that your story supposedly overcomes? Or do you somehow think that torturing the whole parahuman population of the world with bugs in their heads will not turn said population against her, and will not necessitate a bullet to the head?
