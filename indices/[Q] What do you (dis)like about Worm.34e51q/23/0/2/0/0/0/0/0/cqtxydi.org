Okay /finally/, we manage to get from you a single meaningful objection: That you believe the enhancement/modification of her powers via Panacea's brain-surgery to have been an "asspull".

I could grant that but nonetheless feel that your solution is worse. "Natural application of her powers" perhaps, but (a) completely impractical to the point of impossibility, and (b) not something that Taylor would do.
