I probably wouldn't have thought of doing that specific thing, but I wouldn't have thought of putting capsaicin on bugs either. My biggest issue with Worm was that a lot of the characters spoke and acted much older than they actually were. (I'm not exactly a genius, though, so that might be part of the problem.)

But I would have hurt people. I'm not proud of that.
