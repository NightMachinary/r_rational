I am going to assume that this thread is spoiler scoped for Worm.

One of the big things that made it stick was length. Worm is 1.68 million words, which means that to get to the end requires a very, very large time investment. People are a lot more apt to talk about things that they've spent a month reading than they are to talk about something they read over the course of five minutes. Worm wouldn't be nearly so popular if it could be read over the course of an afternoon.

Worm also does characterization well. The interludes are all fantastic, and for every character you get the sense that they were fully fleshed out and thought about - from the skinheads to the PRT.

The powersets of the characters are also really well done. They have enough flaws to be interesting, and enough variety that each one that gets introduced is their own little treat.

Things that I /personally/ didn't like:

- Every character is holding the Conflict Ball. This is explicit to the setting.
- The time skip isn't any good. It bypasses too many important things while at the same time not changing the status quo /enough/.
- The setting limits itself in certain ways that I find displeasing - the Manton effect and the nearly complete lack of mundane utility, and the fact that the world has been designed to resembled comicbook worlds instead of growing into that organically. It's a lot of clever ways of getting to a Superhero Kitchen Sink world, but taken all together it feels false to me. Tinkers are one of the biggest offenders here.
- It's too dark and grim, without enough spots of light or breaks in the action. The edit will probably fix that.
