The eponymous beings were rather disconnected from everything else. The ending wasn't terribly satisfying, at least Taylor's role in it (plus how she reached that role, which seemingly contradicted some of the lore about the source of powers). The whole crapsack world getting slowly worse deal, spread over what would be sixteen standard novels, proved a bit of a grind.
