A baby, already born, is a human life, though perhaps not a sentient one. It has a functional brain, so qualifies for my definition of person-hood. This means killing it is reserved for lifeboat type situations (in my morality).

So it would need to be a situation where killing the baby would prevent a clear, assured, immediate danger to at least 2 other people that cannot be prevented in any other way. The danger and necessity would need to be as certain as the success of the ritual.

This is the very very lowest bound. The level of certainty I'd need to actually perform the ritual is unlikely to exist in real life though.
