If my pen is made of exotic materials, is it still a pen?

Any definition supplied is going to be an approximation; the question is then: do you err on the side of inclusion or exclusion?

Genetically, a member of a species can be exclusively recursively approximated as "an organism capable of creating another organism of the same species". This, of course, excludes sterile individuals and prevents "mules" from being a species, which may be "accurate" - hence the "exclusive" part of the approximation.

You could also suggest a sort-of memetic recursive definition: "an organism capable of propagating ideas to and from other members of its species", although that probably only differentiates between degrees/categories of sentience (including "non")

What I'm getting at is that I don't think "when does it become not a baby" is an important question given the context of the OP.
