  I for instance would be willing to sacrifice huge amounts of lives, innocent or no, to safe the lives of immediate family and friends

  my lower bounds for one baby, freely and secretly given by its mother for an amount of money I can pay would be the complete immunity to mental diseases for a random member of my immediate family
