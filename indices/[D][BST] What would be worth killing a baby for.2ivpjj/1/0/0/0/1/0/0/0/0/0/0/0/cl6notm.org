Oh right! I get you.

Well then, as I said in my own top-level comment, for me it's simply about how much I want to either keep or 'use' (like to give to someone who wants one) a baby versus the outcome of the spell. If the spell cleaned my room for me I'd probably sacrifice that convenience for the sake of giving the baby to someone who wanted it more than I wanted a clean room.

I think OP /was/ asking about how much we'd need to be bribed with to be willing to do something that is on some level immoral. My response is that I don't think it's at all immoral. So maybe 'no lower bound' is where I stand.
