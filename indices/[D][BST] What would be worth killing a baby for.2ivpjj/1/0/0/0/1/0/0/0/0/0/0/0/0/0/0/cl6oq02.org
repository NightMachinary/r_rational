  Do you think that's moral?
#+end_quote

No. But you were talking about bribery. Accepting bribes isn't moral. Except if you use whatever you were bribed with to help society by an amount greater than the damage done just through facilitating corruption. But yes, under specific circumstances I am bribable.

  Might "an amount of money I can pay" not be the key factor here?
#+end_quote

Not in this case. As of yet (I'm not very rich) I value money less than not having to carry the psychological burden of being directly responsible for the death of a specific human. I am assuming here that I have to procure the baby to be sacrificed and that the ritual doesn't work like [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJQ-LZYAMBQ][this]].

  would you sacrifice the baby to just cure a family member's current mental illness?
#+end_quote

Several issues. 1.) Not all mental illnesses are worth a baby. 2.) The risk of the severe guilt/anger/despair produced by curing a mental illness through baby sacrifice just to have the same person suffer from some other mental illness that may be even worse just a few years down the line (small as the chance may be) seems to great for me 2.) I have no family members with mental illnesses. Seeing them succumb to a bad enough mental illness may change my stance on point 2.

But maybe if I could tap some steady, cheap and risk-free supply of babies it would be different. After all, immunizing my whole family would cost 4+ babies while your alternative only costs at a case by case basis, which would start at 0 and probably not rise too high.
