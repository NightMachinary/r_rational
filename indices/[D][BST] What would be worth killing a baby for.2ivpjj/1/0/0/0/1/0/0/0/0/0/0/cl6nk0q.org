I mean that OP asked for lower bounds. But not a single person has tried to approximate that in the slightest. Instead everyone seems to be vaguely talking about lives saved in tradeoff or discussing the intrinsic value of babies or the implications of utilitarian surgeons on society and variations thereof.

But then again, I can't think of anything much better either.
