Oh. I was thinking what was requested was a limit that is morally ambiguous enough that most would be abhorred while some that put thought into it actually judged the ritual /good/. But maybe I misunderstood.

In the case it is as you say though it becomes even more subjective in my opinion. Because I for instance would be willing to sacrifice /huge/ amounts of lives, innocent or no, to safe the lives of immediate family and friends. In that case my lower bounds for one baby, freely and secretly given by its mother for an amount of money I can pay would be the complete immunity to mental diseases for a random member of my immediate family, given that I know who it affected after the completion of the ritual.

EDIT: With enough persuasion and with extra assurances of secrecy and ability to avoid both legal and social repercussions I may even be persuaded to lower my bounds. Not easily though.
