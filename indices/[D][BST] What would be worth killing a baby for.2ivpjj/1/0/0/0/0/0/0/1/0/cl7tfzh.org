  There's a lot of assumptions wrapped up in this bundle of characters called 'sentience'. What is sentience?
#+end_quote

Great question. I can only give examples, not definitions of the term. I don't claim to understand minds well enough to give an exact definition. I can say "that human is sentient" and "That cow is not" and "That gorilla might be" though.

  Also, does a thing that is infertile but otherwise resilient to deterioration while existing in moderate conditions environmentally and provided with the appropriate amount of energy to continue preserving itself outside of equilibrium...is that thing a person? Why the requirement of 'fertility'? Why the biological requirement?
#+end_quote

We were discussing biological beings. Species may not be the best word to use in the definition. It was not intended to be completely exact.

  Does something that fits your mental category of 'sentient' but exists as an artificially constructed system, be it physical (not naturally evolved) or even in software, does that constitute a person? If not, why not?
#+end_quote

Yes.

  What about mentally handicapped individuals that are genetically homo sapien and are not fertile. They don't show behavior that fits your mental category of 'sentient'. Are they persons? If they are, you're using some conditions as a special case it seems; what are those additional conditions, if any
#+end_quote

Part one of my definition specifies members of a species generally recognized as sentient. This would include all members of homo sapien, regardless of actual mental ability, provided there is some electrical activity in the cerebral cortex.
