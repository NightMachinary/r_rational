  So a baby with a genetic condition rendering it infertile isn't a person?

The keyword in this case is healthy. Having a genetic disorder is not healthy. If the disorder did not exist, or could be cured through gene therapy, fertile offspring is possible. It's a person.

  Okay, what if you made an 'artificial' baby, with all the same mental capabilities of a natural human baby, but which would never grow up or mature. Is that a person? But one which can mature is? Despite their being presently identical in mental capacity?
#+end_quote

The first answer is I don't know. I am unfamiliar with the cognitive abilities of the average human infant.

I do know that sentience is most probably a function of the cerebral cortex, and that the cerebral cortex begins to have electrical activity approximately 21 weeks after conception, and finishes development approximately 25 years after birth. A human baby is somewhere on the scale between a non-sentient fetus at 20 weeks, and a sentient adult at 25 years. A human toddler is, by my estimate based only on personal interaction, significantly closer to the 25 year old than the infant is to the toddler, in terms of demonstrated sentience. Which indicates to me that the scale between the sentience level of a fetus and the sentience level of a toddler is a very steep curve, that later levels off, and slowly matures over the remaining development cycle.

Assuming the curve to be sufficiently steep, an artificial infant that cannot increase its sentience level, but can learn behavior, could be sentient, and demonstrate that sentience, thus qualifying as a person with ethical weight.

If the curve is not as steep, the artificial baby is non-sentient, and ethically irrelevant. I would, however, assume it to be sentient until such time as I had a better understanding of the mind we are dealing with, and grant it the ethical weight of person hood.

If the artificial baby, and the cognitively identical natural baby, are both non-sentient, the natural baby loses some level of ethical weight, but because it is probable that it will eventually qualify for person hood, it has more weight than the artificial baby.
