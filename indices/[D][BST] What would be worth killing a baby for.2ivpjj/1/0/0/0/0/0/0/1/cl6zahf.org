There's a lot of assumptions wrapped up in this bundle of characters called 'sentience'. What is sentience?

Also, does a thing that is infertile but otherwise resilient to deterioration while existing in moderate conditions environmentally and provided with the appropriate amount of energy to continue preserving itself outside of equilibrium...is that thing a person? Why the requirement of 'fertility'? Why the biological requirement?

Does something that fits your mental category of 'sentient' but exists as an artificially constructed system, be it physical (not naturally evolved) or even in software, does that constitute a person? If not, why not?

What about mentally handicapped individuals that are genetically homo sapien and are not fertile. They don't show behavior that fits your mental category of 'sentient'. Are they persons? If they are, you're using some conditions as a special case it seems; what are those additional conditions, if any?
