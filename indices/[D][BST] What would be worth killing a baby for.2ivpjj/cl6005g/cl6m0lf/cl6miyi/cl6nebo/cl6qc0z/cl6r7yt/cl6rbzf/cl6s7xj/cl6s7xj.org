How do you know about any scientific findings done with none of your personal acquaintances as witness? You or a source you trust reads the relevant scientific publications coming from several independent experimental results.

Anything else would mean that you disbelieve in pretty much all of modern science.

So the only buy-in required is that the black magic researchers were diligent in their record keeping, made and experimentally disproved each others theories and were funded by someone trying to profit from their findings by implementing practical applications. Hell, maybe they captured it all on video.
