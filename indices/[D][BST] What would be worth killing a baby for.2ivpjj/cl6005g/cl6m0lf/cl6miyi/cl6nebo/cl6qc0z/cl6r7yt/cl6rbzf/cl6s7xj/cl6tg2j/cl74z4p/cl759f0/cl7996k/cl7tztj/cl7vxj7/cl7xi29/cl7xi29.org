I think you are correct about even rational-minded people who are unfamiliar with psychology assuming they would be "fine" after making such a calculated choice, simply because it was logical based on their knowledge and assumptions.

I'm not sure how that might affect the original hypothetical or the later story plot point based on it. It depends on what the author prefers to say on the matter.

Briefly, to butcher is /also/ to skillfully dismember and prepare a corpse for consumption. I meant to emphasize that the killing (specifically killing cattle) was usually very disconnected from the blood and guts of other parts of the process, though this point might not be important. If they had to also repeatedly complete the process, stripping down the animal they had just killed, the impact would likely be even greater.

Dead animals, ones not linked directly to immediate consumption, have a strong effect on other animals. It is stressful being around dead animals, more so those close to the same size as or identifiable as being of the same species. Humans are no exception.

The point was, most people on that stage of processing, the actual killing, don't last in their jobs as long as others, often reporting that this was because of the psychological weight of the active act of killing repeatedly.

But even doing so once changes someone, if in no other way than making the next time usually either easier or harder to enact. The contextual elements of being on a farm help cushion this, as does the support from society for doing valuable and historically honored work. I think there is plenty of evidence that killing animals as part of farm work is psychologically damaging, if relatively minor and easily compensated for in western society.

Though do note that many Asian cultures make those who kill and handle dead bodies of animals and humans the lowest of low classes, castes that are sometimes literally referred to as "untouchables" now in popular media. This was historically done for religious reasons, but is starting to die off as those societies become more modern and rational in their outlooks. I think it would be interesting to see what effect this had on values and psychology of those involved, but I am not aware of any studies on this and it seems far beyond the scope of this discussion.

I guess if you take the next logical step with this story idea, and have a world where such rituals were common place, it might be important. The practitioners would surely be part of a destructed and maligned subclass, in that case.
