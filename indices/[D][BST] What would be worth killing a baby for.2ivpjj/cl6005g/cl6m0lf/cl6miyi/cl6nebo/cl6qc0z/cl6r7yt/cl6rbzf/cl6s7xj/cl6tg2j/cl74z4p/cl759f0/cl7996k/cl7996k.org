I didn't mean science doesn't work. The scientific method always works, except if there is an outside force actively disrupting experiments. For which in this scenario there is no indication. What I meant is that often in such settings the new "magical" phenomenon can often not be deconstructed into smaller parts based on known physics. Similar to the nickel in [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2ib7ua/dmkmunchkin_this_nickel/][/this/]] thread. As in "imagine a world were all known laws of nature are true except there is also this weird additional thing". Is this all really that hard to understand for someone who has read at least /some/ of the rationalist fiction like HPMOR and such, which is what this whole subreddit is based on?

So he elaborated on it later on. Is that a crime now? And I am getting really confused about what /you/ are trying to discuss in this thread. What did you understand the question to be and/or OP's goals for stating it? I dearly hope you're not just ascribing malicious intend on OP's part.
