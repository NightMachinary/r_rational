You experience the results of modern science every day, in every part of life. Science working as suggested is the most useful theory for interacting with reality as observed.

OP posited an entirely new branch of science that results in a specific, immutable result, with no other supporting technology or scientific assertions. That is what I have a problem with, that sort of "it is known" statement without more world building around it. Because people make those sorts of statements in the real world, even about science, and it is usually a logical fallacy built on a pile of bad assumptions.

Maybe it is only a small step in this world. Maybe sacrificing lab mice gets similar but lessor results. Knowing something like that would help, but it wasn't indicated. Maybe people making that decision have already done those experiments, have grown up in a world where that was okay, and place less value culturally on certain things. In which case the question is /also/ poorly stated.

What was given was just a leap straight to the conclusion. It begged the question that this was horrific but necessary by its set up, implying all sorts of other odd things. That leap is not rational to make outside of hypotheticals, so I reject it almost automatically.
