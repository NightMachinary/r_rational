I recognize a stock anti-Objectivism trap when I see one. Well reformatted for this rationalist audience, of course.

The answer for a value calculation must include effectively your own death, you see, because most people's sense of identity would not survive such an act. So it is also an act of self-sacrifice nearly the same as if you were killing yourself as well in whatever ritual.

Add uncertainty, the very real chance you are missing something or personally mentally ill, and it is almost impossible to construct even an extreme, world-ending event that would make such an act worthwhile. How do you /know/ that would save everyone, after all? Or that the threat to the world is that assured?

But you'd need to start with, "what would I be willing to die for?", with the usual uncertain results in mind.
