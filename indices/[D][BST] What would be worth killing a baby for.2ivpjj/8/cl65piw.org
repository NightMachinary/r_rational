I think there is an additional problem with the societal impacts of unethical sourcing of babies. I don't want to live in the kind of society where people will be trying to steal babies to get X - in order to be okay, X must outweigh the problems it brings to society.

If baby-murder that involves /additional/ crimes (child abuse, kidnapping, breach of contract) can be controlled somehow (ethically sourced babies only) then X doesn't have to be too big - saving the lives of two babies, or sufficiently large amounts of natural resources (say, enough so that society can afford to train an extra doctor) or something.

But probably, dark magic will have a negative impact on broader society, and that raises the standards on X a lot. I'd prefer a factor of five at least, possibly more.

To put a different spin on this, imagine two babies were dying and you were babysitting someone else's baby. By refraining from doing the ritual, you perform a different sort of ritual - you sacrifice a baby so that a society can exist where people can hire babysitters.
