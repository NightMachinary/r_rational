How intimate is the killing? Do I have to look at the baby, hear it, and kill it myself with a knife? Or is this something I can do at a distance, with no pain or fear involved for the baby? Better yet, can I simply tell someone else to kill the baby in a painless way and not personally be involved at all?

If I can order an underling to take an unwanted baby that's been disavowed by its parents, give it to some other underling, and make the entire process as detached and trauma-free as possible, it significantly lowers the lower bound.

In general, it would have to be something that could not be produced via 9 months of labor by a healthy human. This is inefficient and leads to using up our surplus baby reserves in a stupid way. We don't want to become reliant on baby-killing to feed a hundred people if we could have farmed/hunted/gathered instead; otherwise post-peak-baby we're gonna have a serious problem. Exceptions could be made for high-priority items that are needed immediately and cannot be achieved in other ways.

Also to consider - what are the social consequences of killing a baby? If I'm an average american killing his neighbor's baby I'm likely going to be abandoned by everyone I know, hated by all of society aftewards, and may face serious legal repercussions. If I'm the president and the baby is in a Middle Eastern country, I don't have to worry much at all. Maybe a few vocal websites will write some angry words before everyone moves on.
