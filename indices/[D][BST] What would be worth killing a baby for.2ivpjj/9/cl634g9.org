Lowest bound? Saving the lives of two babies who otherwise /would/ die. Preferably more.

I /might/ accept saving the life of one person old enough to reach sentience, since a baby isn't there yet and therefore less valuable.

Of course, that's presuming I can act as a complete utilitarian, and not get caught up in the squishy human feelings of it all. Realistically, I ain't gonna be killin' any babies. Not for anything less than preventing something on the order of /thousands/ of deaths or more, anyway.

That bound is lowered /significantly/ if I can mass-produce guaranteed not-ever-gonna-be-sentient babies with cloning technology and still have it work. Then the reward just has to be greater than the money required to make one clone. /That/ kinda system I might actually be able to get in on in real life, too. It's basically just creepier stem cell harvesting.
