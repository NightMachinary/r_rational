He's not their child, they stole him from an orphanage.

A lot of these comments are about the prevention of some bad thing happening, but right now I'm thinking that the ritual was intended for some positive measure - some enhancement of some kind. Perhaps the ritual would prevent their deaths by anything short of decapitation, and they reasoned that the life of an infant was worth less than potentially centuries of continued youth.

The big thing I'm worried about is that the boon they hoped to gain can't be /too/ good, because otherwise the reader will be left scratching their head about why /everyone/ doesn't try to kill babies all the time. But it also can't be /too/ bad, because otherwise the dark wizards become irredeemable for having decided to kill a baby for such a small benefit. I don't know - it's not hugely important to the plot, but it is something I'd like to decide on.
