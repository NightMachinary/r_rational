Makes sense, I just think you're going to have trouble finding equivalents to the trolley problem in terms of icky-but-justifiable that don't involve preventing harm. Anything that's a "boon" is just too self-serving to justify murder, I think.

But not everyone would agree with me. After all, there are plenty who think harming others for profit is justifiable. What if it's for an alchemist ingredient that's in high demand on the black market? "Crystallized Empty Soul Shard" or some such. The "if we don't do it someone else will" rationalization would apply.
