Oh, they're both men. So that won't work.

The plan is for dark magic to (for the most part) have a lot of things that are moral but also icky - it's shunned because it's equivalent to a socially unacceptable answer to the trolley problem, or the utilitarian transplant surgeon. Killing one person to save two others /makes sense/, and it also makes sense that a kingdom which considers itself "good" would not do it. And the story is sort of about the difference between good and evil, especially when considering the corner cases of morality.

So I guess what I'm shooting for is morally defensible, mildly selfish, and somewhat unpleasant to System 1.
