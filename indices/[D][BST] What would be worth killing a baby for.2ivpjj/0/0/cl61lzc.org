  Looking forward to seeing the story that spawned this :)

The story opens with two dark wizards about to sacrifice a baby in a dark ritual. They end up raising him as their own instead, because they can't bring themselves to do it. The boy is then the protagonist of the story.

I've been toying with when he'll learn about the ritual he was destined for, and what the ultimate goal of it would have been. His parents are meant to be morally ambiguous but mostly sympathetic, which means that there needs to be a fairly sound logic to their decision-making - something that you could argue might actually be "right", or at least something that sympathetic characters could have agreed was "right" before being presented with the reality of actually having blood on their hands.
