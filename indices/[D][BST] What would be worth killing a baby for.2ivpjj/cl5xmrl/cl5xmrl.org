Hmm.

Well. Lets say we assume babies have 0 value as sapient beings. They would still have the value of being 9 months of work to produce. Maybe a bit less if we learn to mass produce them in the future.

Point is, sacrificing them for truly trivial things is definitely out. If it takes less than nine months of work by one person you probably don't want to waste a perfectly good baby on it.

Now realistically, I'm not exactly sure what I would put as the intrinsic value of a six pound baby, but it almost assuredly isn't zero.

I'd say its probably lower than the value of a more developed mind, so sacrificing them for immortality might be acceptable. How much utility a human life is worth in the first place is a somewhat open question, but we've already managed to get some economic estimates of it [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_of_life]].

But there's another layer, Some societies just can't handle sacrificing babies. Our current society would certainly be outraged at almost any baby sacrifice, so even if it was one baby a week for the immortality of the rest of humanity, (definitely worth while) I think we'd still have to ease it into the culture.
