  If it takes less than nine months of work by one person you probably don't want to waste a perfectly good baby on it.

I mean at some point we're going to be refining production of babies for this ritual, either artificial wombs, inciting twins or octoplets etc.

Obviously there's a point where the value of the material and energy going into producing the child is less than the value of the ritual, but up til then there are efficiencies to be made.
