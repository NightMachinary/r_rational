This exact situation comes up in a Harry Potter fanfic I've read, where the nobility sacrifices a child every seven years to make the country more secure. Every character who learns about it considers it to be evil, including the main antagonist. Keeping it a secret made it more evil than it needed to be since a consenting volunteer couldn't be used. Instead it was done by lottery.
