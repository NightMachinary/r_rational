Munchkining ethics: if Simurgh hands you series of babies that genuinely will cause massive global harm if you don't kill them then you can ethically kill each one as they come. You'd also be ethically obligated to make her stop but still.

At some point you'd think some sort of minimally unethical baby facsimile would be sufficient, but if it has to be similar enough then the ethical cost would be nearly as bad.
