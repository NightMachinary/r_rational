Well, I suppose that's a fair enough objection. Although you have to be careful, since rocks are also non-verbal and we generally assume they're not people. But obviously babies are definitely somewhere on the path to /becoming/ people.

I don't think you need to be able to speak to 'demonstrate' that you're a person, though. I think it's safe to say that, for babies, the world is so confusing (they don't know how to deliberately use their bodies to accomplish anything or how anything works in physics) that at best they're living in a perpetual state of "just what the fuck is going on here I can't understand a bit of it" and therefore have never managed to form aspirations or think about the future yet, which is what I think makes it immoral to kill a person - robbing them of their planned futures.
