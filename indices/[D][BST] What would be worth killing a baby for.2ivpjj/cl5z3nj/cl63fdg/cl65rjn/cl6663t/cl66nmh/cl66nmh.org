#+begin_quote
  What counts as a member of a species?
#+end_quote

Capable, or reasonably expected to be capable, at a healthy maturity, of producing fertile offspring.

#+begin_quote
  What if the baby wasn't conceived and born naturally? What if it was constructed molecule-for-molecule by some advanced technology?
#+end_quote

If it meets the above qualification, or is reasonably expected to, it is a member of the species.

#+begin_quote
  What if it didn't have a body but was just a brain? Or a simulated intelligence of the same level? What if it wasn't human on any level, but was just a constructed or simulated intelligence with the same capabilities as a human baby brain? It's not hard, if you try, to think of ways to make something with the equivalent intelligence of a baby that isn't 'a member of a species'.
#+end_quote

If it was any of these things, it could qualify under the second definition of any individual member of any species. If such a thing became commonplace, and generally qualified as individuals, then all members of the species would be presumed to qualify.

#+begin_quote
  Also, importantly, what does it mean to you to consider something a 'person'? Are you just using it sort of academically, or does it have ethical significance?
#+end_quote

A person is a life with ethical significance. A cow is not ethically significant (unless it demonstrates sentience). A human is. Koko the gorilla probably is. A wild gorilla is more likely to be than a cow, but uncertain

Having ethical significance means it is generally immoral, outside of lifeboat situations, to act violently against the body or property of the being in question.

A lifeboat situation is a catchall term for a situation where an otherwise immoral act must be performed to prevent a greater immoral event from occurring, such as prioritizing passengers on a lifeboat when there is insufficient room for all, or the trolley problem where one must redirect a trolley to kill one person in order to save 5 others.

Sorry if anything is confusing, I'm not in the general habit of pinning my words down quite this exactly.
