What counts as a member of a species? What if the baby wasn't conceived and born naturally? What if it was constructed molecule-for-molecule by some advanced technology? What if it didn't have a body but was just a brain? Or a simulated intelligence of the same level? What if it wasn't human on any level, but was just a constructed or simulated intelligence with the same capabilities as a human baby brain?

It's not hard, if you try, to think of ways to make something with the equivalent intelligence of a baby that isn't 'a member of a species'.

Also, importantly, what does it mean to you to consider something a 'person'? Are you just using it sort of academically, or does it have ethical significance?
