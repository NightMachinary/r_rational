I define a person as any member of a species generally recognized as sentient with a functioning brain, and any individual member of any species that demonstrates sentience.

Since an infant is a member of a species generally recognized as sentient (human) and has a functioning brain (at least a partially developed cerebral cortex) it counts as a person.

It's not a perfect definition, but it's good enough for most purposes.
