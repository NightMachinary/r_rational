It would have affect a significant percentage of the population and relieve an immense burden from society as a whole, i.e. wiping out AIDS completely and instantly. That's greatly benefiting something in the ballpark of 35 million people for today's Earth. Although we've got a better handle on it now than we did thirty years ago, that's still saving a lot of lives now plus all the potential lives of the children of those people and anyone they would have gone on to infect. That's roughly .5% of the current population plus potentials affected, and many of them saved from death. Depending on a world's total population...I'm not sure how I'd make that percentage scale, but just based on right now, I seem to be ok with it as is.
