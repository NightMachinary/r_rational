Personally, I'd say the only moral consideration of any significance here is the question of whose baby it is and what they think. I consider a baby as property, something that has been worked for and would take time, effort and resources to replace, and may well have become sentimentally important to someone and become irreplaceable as far as they're concerned.

That is, assuming the baby's demise doesn't include discomfort. Torturing babies is a different matter.

But grieving parents and torture aside, the practical consideration would simply be whether the expected utility of the spell's outcome is higher for you than having a baby.
