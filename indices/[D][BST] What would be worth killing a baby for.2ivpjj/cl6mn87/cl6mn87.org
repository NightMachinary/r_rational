Late to the party, but how about this:

The Ritual of 6 Pounds (as it will hence be called) is what gives supernatural magical powers to a single human. Or better yet, a wieldable artifact. The powers are limited (think of it as a battery requiring 1 baby to be charged) and can be used for many small things or a few medium things or one larger thing. No spell fueled by one baby can directly save more than one life though. At least not in the straight forward sense of curing several diseases and such. This will immediately make sure that even non-stupid people would find the practice reprehensible.

What it /can/ do though is things like increasing the quality of life for *a lot* of people in minor but noticeable ways. Or be used as a powerful weapon, thus saving lives in terms of self defense and such. Or it could also be useful in a logistical sense. Maybe granting flight to large objects or creating things akin to Portable Holes.

Best would be that it has a variety of uses so that the first reaction would be that someone is sacrificing babies just to personally wield an item of mediocre power, while utilitarians who think about it can clearly see that several lives could be made better or even /saved/ (transporting food/winning wars) for the cost of merely one semi-sentient entity with "potential" to become something greater but no actual experience lost.

--------------

Another way to go is that the enhancement is percentage based with large amounts of net gain that are not immediately visible. An example would be 20% increased physical strength, reflexes, resistance to disease, and slower aging for a 100 people.

EDIT: Now that I think of it, this may not work at all if you don't want society to crumble. I guess the effect must be something that does not increase lineally the more babies you sacrifice. Neither in regards to the benefits for one person nor the amount of people benefited. Pretty much what [[/u/bkkgirl]] said:

  Hmm. Having read your comments about how the ritual is used, I'm having trouble coming up with something that would both be uncommon and morally defensible to most people. If 1% of people are willing to do it, all the babies will die (or society will get restructured around protecting babies) unless there is some limiting factor. Also will this be the only magic ritual possible, or are there others? That might affect it too.
