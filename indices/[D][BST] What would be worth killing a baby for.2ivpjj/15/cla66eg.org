Late to the party, but it looks like you didn't really get what you were looking for, so I'll give it a shot.

- Creating food/fertilizing crops to feed a bunch of people - during a famine, or if there are poor people starving. Open an /eeevil/ soup kitchen, basically.
- Warding a village against /mundane/ disease. Just bam, no more disease for this village. (Wouldn't work narratively if there's a plague on, because then everyone would die when the ritual fails.)
- Becoming smart/powerful enough to catch [& defeat], say, a werewolf, or a serial killer. Something that will kill, say, a minimum of five people and a maximum of thirty.
- Preventing miscarriage, death in childbirth and infant mortality (within reason) over, say, a small town. (This has a nice equivalent-exchange ring to it.)
- Helping to postpone something that will /eventually/ destroy the world in the absence of babies. A world-killing archdemon that will wake in [100+10*babies] years or something.

It's surprisingly tricky to make the Dark choice clearly right - because the sympathetic good guys want to use it - /and/ unpalatable enough that Good People will revile it, including the (non-evil) legislature. I think these have about the right balance, though.
