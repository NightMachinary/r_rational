Hmm. Having read your comments about how the ritual is used, I'm having trouble coming up with something that would both be uncommon and morally defensible to most people. If 1% of people are willing to do it, all the babies will die (or society will get restructured around protecting babies) unless there is some limiting factor. Also will this be the only magic ritual possible, or are there others? That might affect it too.
