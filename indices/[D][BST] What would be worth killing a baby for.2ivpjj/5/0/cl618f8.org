More seriously, there are /two/ pretty much separate questions embedded here - "what would be worth purposefully killing a person for" (I think I'm a utilitarian consequentialist here) and "what are babies worth, morally?" (for which my bounds are "neither less than a half, nor more than double of a 50 year old human, and /definitely less/ than a 1-14 year old human - I intuitively feel plotting "intrinsic moral weight" with "age" gives a curve which peaks somewhere in early childhood, assuming life spans of 80-120. )

I encourage thinking about how your answer would practically translate to the real world which does not have morally inconvenient magical spells; I'm immediately reminded of the Utilitarian Transplant Surgeon.
