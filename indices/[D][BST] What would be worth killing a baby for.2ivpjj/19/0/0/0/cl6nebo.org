Didn't quite get that.

But you're right, now that I think about it if we want to be objective then the life of any innocent person that is as healthy as the ritual performer and not a direct danger to anyone's life should be valued at least as high as his own (the performer's).

/Except/ if probability clearly indicates that the ritualist is still needed to safe more lives which the sacrificed would very (/very/) probably not be able to.

What I /do/ disagree with is how sure and/or how large the alleged catastrophy that is to be avoided must be. For instance sacrificing an innocent baby (or even a 6 year old child that is more clearly sentient and with all his life before him) to decrease the chance of humanity's extinction within the next year by 10% is /far/ from lower bounds. Keep in mind that in OP's scenario this dark ritual has gone through enough science and experimentation for every informed person to be sure it works.

In other words, there are moral scenarios where sacrificing innocents is the right choice even if instead one could have sacrificed oneself.

And all this is without the arguments that some seem to state here that a newborns life has less ethical weight than that of an a bit older human being.
