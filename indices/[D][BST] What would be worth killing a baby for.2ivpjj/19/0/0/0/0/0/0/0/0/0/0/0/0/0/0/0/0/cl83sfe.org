I think that last question is best answered: history was a shitty time, people did shitty things to each other pretty much all of the time. Those tortures were so extreme because they affected viewers and kept them in line. It was a literally brute forced solution to crime prevention and civil order.

It is much better now, and people aren't expected to be exposed to that sort of extreme violence and death on a daily basis. There are some theories that civilization has been selecting for people saner and saner, breeding for humans who are calmer and less chimp-like in their behaviors. This doesn't work with natural selection, too short a timescale, but it might with other selection effects.

So it could be that historically, people were simply less sane, and these things affected them less. But I think that unlikely. It seems more likely that people were just traumatized from birth, and simply went through life damaged in that way.
