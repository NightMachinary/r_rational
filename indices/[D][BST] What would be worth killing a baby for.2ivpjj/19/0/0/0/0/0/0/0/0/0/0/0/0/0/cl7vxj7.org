I must say this is really well written. So well written that I am sad it is hidden in the "continue this thread -->" section. I finally understand what you mean by self sacrifice and you back it up with sound arguments I couldn't discern before.

And I agree with you that you have pretty much "won" this discussion, at least the one we two are having.

The only part I intuitively disagree with is the severity of "a)". That it really is an irredeemable loss of self almost akin to death. But who knows, that may well just be my inexperience on these matters. I don't know anyone personally who I know has killed another human being as far as I know.

I don't think this invalidates all the other posters contributions to the problem though. Because a character who made the "false" value calculation (last paragraph of your section 5) and came to the conclusion that doing it is the right thing, going so far as to procure a baby and convincing a friend to assist him, just to back out in the last moment because of human psychology and emotions is /exactly/ the kind of sympathetic character I feel OP is going for. This thread alone shows how easily it seems for many of us to imagine going down the same path. (EDIT I mean imagine themselves having chosen such a path, not accurately imagine the consequences. That would be really hard.)

And one last question:

#+begin_quote
  Even those working in the agricultural field who have to kill *(not even butcher)* animals for a living are deeply affected.
#+end_quote

What do you mean by this? Do you mean that butchering is somehow different from killing and thus butchers are /not/ thus affected? Or that "butcher" is a wrong word to use because "kill" is a better word to show the psychological weight of it?

If it is the former I am confused by where the distinction is. Maybe when you have to kill an animal unexpectedly (as opposed to one you planned to do it from the beginning to for food)?

If it is the latter I can only say that many of us have family on the land that don't seem in any way damaged or unwholesome even though they have killed animals with their own hands, sometimes not even using tools.

Thank you very much for your effort.
