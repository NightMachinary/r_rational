  OP posited an entirely new branch of science that results in a specific, immutable result, with no other supporting technology or scientific assertions. That is what I have a problem with, that sort of "it is known" statement without more world building around it. Because people make those sorts of statements in the real world, even about science, and it is usually a logical fallacy built on a pile of bad assumptions.

No. OP posited a /fantasy world/, a parallel universe if you will, where a nation deemed evil by its neighbors /applied/ said technology on a larger scale.

  Maybe sacrificing lab mice gets similar but lessor results.

From OP:

  We know that it can't be short-circuited in all of the obvious (or even non-obvious) ways that you might immediately think about trying.

I would say this includes substituting mass animal sacrifice. Remember the ritual is magical, not scientific. Similar to the teleporting nickel.

  Maybe people making that decision have already done those experiments, have grown up in a world where that was okay, and place less value culturally on certain things.

The "Evil Empire" part seems to indicate that the society that did most science didn't put much value in the life of babies. Or at least not its leaders and its scientific community. Else they wouldn't be willing to sacrifice babies in control group experiments and in purposely botched rituals and such, which would be necessary for sound science.

The culture judging (fighting) the Empire, which eventually won, seems to /not/ be okay with it. And judging from OP's later comments I'd wager that the protagonists "foster parents" were from the "good" culture, tried to replicate the ritual a considerable amount of time /after/ the fall of Evil Empire amd in the end couldn't go through with it because of morals/feelings of guilt. Quote: "they can't bring themselves to do it."

  I've been toying with when he'll learn about the ritual he was destined for, and what the ultimate goal of it would have been. His parents are meant to be morally ambiguous but mostly sympathetic, which means that there needs to be a fairly sound logic to their decision-making - something that you could argue might actually be "right", or at least something that sympathetic characters could have agreed was "right" before being presented with the reality of actually having blood on their hands.

All OP wants is not to trap us or who knows what. He wants our help. Our opinions on what the lower bounds need to be for the almost dark wizard foster parents to not be considered monsters even if they /would/ have gone through. The lower bounds where the main character (who narrowly escaped sacrifice) has difficulty judging such actions unambiguously even /after/ getting past the bias of loving his foster parents.

Or at least that is how I understood it.
