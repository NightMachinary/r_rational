  Is this all really that hard to understand for someone who has read at least some of the rationalist fiction like HPMOR and such, which is what this whole subreddit is based on?
#+end_quote

There is a difference between assuming a specific effect violates known laws and being asked to change critical thinking approaches simply because "it is known".

Your previous attempts to frame this as a reductionist argument about scientific proofs shows you don't understand this, which combined with your chosen arguments in this discussion makes me doubt your rationality and or your intent.

That does not inspire me to continue debate.

  I dearly hope you're not just ascribing malicious intend on OP's part.

Your hopes are very close to my heart, so be assured that I meant simply that OP had chosen a classic ideological trap hypothetical as a basis for what was later explained as a plot point that wouldn't even actually occur in the story. I get a nice little cross on my post instead of reasoned debate because [[/r/rational]] is an echo chamber and because I didn't respond with the usual valuation shibboleths, like the other posters. At least half of those who cared enough to respond at all, decided it wasn't a valuable post.

OP fell into the trap, as well as most of the posters in this thread. It is false to assume the result is the one that needs the most focus to answer OP's question. The cost is not simply a six-pound-plus baby, but the context surrounding that choice as well.

The usual reaction by skilled debaters to this sort of trapped hypothetical is not to engage, but I have a better solution. One that doesn't seem to have been appreciated or even understood here. First, some context.

--------------

The classic trapped question which this mirrors is a lose/lose, with an appeal to emotion at one end and either a loaded question or a conclusion that begs the question at the other. Here is how the trap usually plays out.

Someone who isn't very rational asks something like, "would you kill a baby to save thousands of lives" -- which is closely analogous to the results generated from OP's question.

Though /clearly/ not what the OP meant, the questioner is usually trying to get the respondent to say either:

"No, I would not. Because taking positive actions-"

In which case the questioner can say, "Ha! You don't really believe in <Objectivist/brand-x utilitarian/etc> ideals then, or you would do it based on the cold, hard value of human lives."

Or the respondent can say, "Yes, it would save so many lives that I would do it, even though-"

In which case the questioner gets to say something like, "Ha! You baby killer! Everyone look at this baby killer and scorn all their future answers, because they would kill babies."

This is never productive debate, but it does allow the questioner to score social points with their equally shallow peers.

But this ignores what I see as the scientifically-based correct answer to such hypotheticals, and in real life.

--------------

There is an easy and rational answer to this trapped question, but no one was using it. That is why I suggested that people weren't taking into consideration the effects on themselves and their social and psychological situation. I'm sure many people in [[/r/rational]] /think/ they are a cold, calculating internet superheros with a "secret dark side" who'd make the tough decisions after long and careful consideration. That they'd be sad but firmly resolute after making the right choice, before zooming off to do good elsewhere.

Anyone who thinks that is full of shit. Modern psychological medicine says so.

The OP's scenario suggests, and as you point out as well, that the society that the ritualists live in does not accept the act they are considering. They consider the act similarly to how we do, as does their society. They are not psychologically prepared to deal with the aftermath of performing this act -- they can't be, no one can -- and that must be taken into consideration.

The best minds in the world can't make a training program to generate solders who can kill /other people trying to kill them/ without /enormous/ psychological damage being inflicted, either in training or on the battlefield. And that act, killing in self defense or in wartime as part of a sanctioned military action, is usually something the society they will eventually return to is at least neutral about.

People who kill, even in self defense, are damaged. Period. They were before hand, with severe ASPD (so called "psychopaths"), or they were after, with some level of PTSD. No one who has been in a combat situation escapes without long-term PTSD, to some extent. Drone pilots and rear area medical support personal have severe, long term effects from their experiences as well, though not the same ones or to the same extent as people who have been shot at. Even those working in the agricultural field who have to kill (not even butcher) animals for a living are deeply affected.

Personally and ritually killing an infant, an act of cold-blooded murder, is so far off the scale of psychological trauma that it boggles the mind to even consider what it would do to a person. The results would be devastating. /Especially/ an intelligent and self-reflective person who knows exactly what taking a life means. The simplifications people in this thread are making are absurd and short-sighted.

--------------

That is why:

a) I believe there are scientific reasons that such an act would be a self-sacrificial one as well, one that would destroy who you were forever and replace it with something psychologically damaged and less than what you were before.

and

b) The initial question was not really a positive one for getting the realistic and rationalist results the OP wanted.

This has nothing to do with some sort of magical doppelganger (what the fuck?) but is the certain result of such actions, as determined by modern psychology. You are not a special rationalist flower -- this means you, too.

Unless the person is not a rational actor, or is still in high school or otherwise ignorant, they would never sacrifice their own identity as a person who doesn't kill babies lightly. They would know what that does to people psychologically. And if they didn't, they would /still/ likely crack when asked to actually wield the knife.

It can therefore not be reduced simply to the value of items in question -- babies vs. X, solve for most minimal acceptable X effect -- without considering the ritualist's own worth as an psychologically undamaged person who lives in a society that frowns on ritual baby murder. That goes on the BABIES side of the equation. No one was doing that rationally, so I did. And the hivemind, and you, gave me blinkered and disengaged grief for it.

--------------

This is just about all the effort I am willing to expend on the topic, even though it appears throughout your own contributions that the entire thing wasn't simply a trolling.

That was what I meant about ratios of effort. If you can get a troll to spend at least as much effort in a conversation as you are, their trolling has failed in large part. Usually, they won't bother. Hence my being unwilling to respond to single sentence disagreements early in conversations with multiple paragraphs of clarifying discourse.

Given that, I'm getting almost nothing out of this -- no insight or useful feedback on my ideas -- so I see no reason to continue after this summary post.
