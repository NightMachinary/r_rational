I know several people in my village who have strangled chicken or broken a rabbits neck before proceeding to clean them. The psychological damage must be really minor. And that is not even taking in to consideration how many people hunt with a gun and such.

But maybe it adds up if done routinely and repeatedly instead of only once every few months or something. I wouldn't know.

Anyway, this has little to do with killing humans. All of this has made me very curious how people managed these problems in the days where raids, war and slaughter were more common. Especially when you hear of some torture-executions that were typical punishments for some transgressions.
