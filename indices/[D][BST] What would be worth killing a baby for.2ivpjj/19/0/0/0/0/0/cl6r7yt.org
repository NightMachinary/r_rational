Distrust of "Nazi wizard science" is beyond the scope of this post.

  This magic has been *extensively studied*, and its limits have been mapped out by an evil empire whose *scientific methods were strong* but whose infrastructure and ability to withstand invasions was not. *We know* that the baby-killing magic works. *We know how it works.* We know that it *can't be short-circuited* in all of the obvious (or even non-obvious) ways that you might immediately think about trying.

Also, how would you personally verify without, you know, dead babies?

Why would we lose our identity? What exactly do you even mean by that? People have done worse things without being suddenly replaced by doppelgangers. And if you mean change in personality because of guilt or something then it is probably by far not as severe as heroic suicide.

I think there is a large failure of communication going on between us two.
