Preventing loss of life is pretty much the major metric I'd judge its worth by.

There is a short story called "The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas" where it's heavily implied that one child being neglected and mistreated its whole life leads to a perfect utopia for everyone else. Everyone at some point in their life is shown the child and made to understand its suffering once, and then can ignore it/live with the knowledge. Some tiny minority of people end up leaving, unable to bear living there anymore knowing what the cost is.

I have mixed feelings about Omelas. I think the mistreatment and neglect of the child is hard to stomach for the intended purpose of "make everything perfect" since the lack of suffering/death isn't really singled out: most forms of utopia I imagine though has mostly conquered these things. At the same time, our society is far less perfect than Omelas, has far more horrible fates done to far more people in it, and most people are pretty okay with the status quo.

Compared to both these things, sacrificing the life of a newborn infant to improve society isn't so strange. If I cared that much about keeping babies alive, I would give most of my money to natal care facilities in third world countries.

So if the baby's sacrifice is done to achieve a true utopia, I have to admit that that's acceptable to me. If it requires multiple babies, even. How many is a good question that I have no ready answer for: for now all I can say is my System 1 is uneasy with more than one per year.

But if the spell does something more practical/realistic like save the country from imminent slaughter/destruction, that too is acceptable, since the loss of life is clearly weighted. Let's say you could sacrifice a baby to power a weapon that would help you win a single battle. In such a case, using it for self-defense is perfectly acceptable, since much more life would be lost, and much more suffering spread, by being slaughtered... including the child's own anyway.

Much farther down the totem pole, individual improvements are harder to accept. Sacrificing a baby to restore someone's health and youth, for example, is rather ghoulish, and has the potential to be seriously abused even if intended to be done with good intentions. Again, I can't come up with an exact number at the moment, but my System 1 is most uncomfortable with less than 10 lives saved for one baby, and less uncomfortable with every factor of ten increased after that. A baby for a hundred lives seems necessary, to me.

In addition, selection is something that should be addressed as well. To make it the most acceptable, no one should have their children taken from them against their will. There should be a pool of well compensated women who are okay with basically providing a steady supply of babies for possible use. These children would be well treated and raised communally until they pass the age where it's no longer possible to use them for the spell, and then given to foster programs. Youngest babies would be prioritized if one needed to be picked at any given time.

Looking forward to seeing the story that spawned this :)
