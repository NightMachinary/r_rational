Could you transform into a doppleganger already shaped into a exosuit? (Looks like changelings are totally different in Pathfinder) Or is it the same as old rules where you have to have seen the creature to change into it? "Perfect copy" is under "special abilities" it lloks like.

Another approach: Shape change into as weakly corrosive of an ooze as she can then engulf the husband (with a diving tank to breathe). The ooze should still have her magical toughness just like the human form does. If the seen animal is a prerequisite this could still be used in emergencies, because it's disgusting, with animals that can engulf humans. With her current size I think it would have to be some giant constrictor snake.

Sorry, I misunderstood the age statement thanks for clarifying.
