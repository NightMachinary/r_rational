Just read through this from the beginning. Enjoying it a lot. The switches of perspective and new magic systems were a bit jarring at first but I like how it's drawn together into a larger narrative. I like the general idea of drawing from fiction, always felt like in settings where magic was powered by belief it was strange that ancient Egyptian gods were running about, but not modern fiction that people have much more investment in.

The relationship between the two main characters feels solid and realistic. They feel like smart people but without falling into the trap of ridiculously competent super rational protagonists some stories have.

I felt like the depiction of the military leader immediately falling into the hardcore religious interpretation of events was a bit on the nose. But I've not spent time in that area of the USA so couldn't say how accurate it is. Given the degree of redundancy built into these kind of disaster response command and control things you'd think there would be some kind of coordination remaining, even with all the magic outbreaks. But plausibly if there's an active enemy group trying to prevent organisation

In story speculation: I think the aslan entity implies that this is drawing on some kind of collective unconscious, with the "magic" individuals just acting as a conduit.
