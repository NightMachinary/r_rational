No, polymorph doesn't work like that in Pathfinder. You don't get any magical abilities of the form you turn into, it is effectively a skin deep transformation. You get certain listed abilities based on the list provided in the spell, but this is things like dark vision or scent, not major magical features.

And dragons have no middle age, dragons have 12 scaling age categories of their own.
