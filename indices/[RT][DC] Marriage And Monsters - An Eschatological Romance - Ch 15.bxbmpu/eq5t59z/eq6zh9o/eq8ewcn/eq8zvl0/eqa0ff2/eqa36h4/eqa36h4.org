You would not get the doppelganger's shapeshift ability at all, and even if you did, it also duplicates alter self, so it would not change anything.

You also can't change into an ooze. Only animals and humanoids with the dracionic racial change shape.

Once she gets actual spells, there are very good ways to protect others (protection from arrows works on bullets, add resist energy to avoid basically all the damage on average from a rocket launcher shot, or stoneskin, etc). At higher level spells, nothing is actually a threat anymore because you can contingency away or use Ghostform to become flat immune to non-magical attacks.

Also Time Stop, Gate, Wish, etc. They should go get a lot fo diamonds though.

Plus, dragons can use wish or limited wish to duplicate cleric spells to raise the dead. Death is nothing more than a slightly more effective status debuff at high levels in PF.
