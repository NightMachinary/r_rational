I have not listened to the podcast.

Based solely on your summary, this feels like one of those cases where somebody takes a weak, unsurprising but true claim ("carps have more chromosomes than people") and inflates it into a paradoxical, surprising-sounding and untrue or borderline-meaningless claim ("carps are more evolved than people! [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge%27s_law_of_headlines][are carps the next step in human evolution?]]")

I don't think children are smarter than adults. Even the smarter ones often struggle with logical problems that adults solve much more quickly. There's a reason you'll learn more mathematics during a single semester in university than during the first 4 years of school. There's a reason they adjust iq tests for age. I don't think we should twist the truth of all that so that we could say something that sounds surprising.

That said, as far as I can tell kids do seem to have some... let's call them "weird mental superpowers", and the younger they are the stronger those powers are. They learn languages quickly. They learn games like Go or Chess quickly, to the point where it becomes embarrassing for the adults. There's probably much more that I don't even realize. The podcast probably gives some other great examples.
