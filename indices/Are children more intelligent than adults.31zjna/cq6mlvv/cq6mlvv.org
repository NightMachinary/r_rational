No. The reason it can seem that way depending on how you list the data is that "intelligent" is a poorly-defined term. Children are typically more observant than adults, but less capable of reasoning about consequences. They are more plastic in the way that they think (more capable of picking up new mental skills or habits), but less able to make logical inferences and rule out classes of solutions at a time.
