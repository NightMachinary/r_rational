Haven't listened to the podcast, but that doesn't sound like 'more intelligent' to me. It sounds like children and adults have different approach to the 'exploitation vs exploration' dilemma, which makes a lot of sense. The children brain should be much more open towards looking for new solution / learning new laws. The adult brain, which has collected much more signal, can and should rely more on previous knowledge.
