On the topic of highly intelligent people that are outside the realm of most intelligence testing. If you haven't spent much time around extremely good machinists and other tradesmen, you might not be familiar with just how shockingly good some of them are with their hands and tools. It's not just manual dexterity and a good eye. Some of them simply /know/ the materials and tools of their trade better than most people outside the trades would believe. They aren't common, but they aren't rare. I've worked with a few, and most of them were not good candidates for a higher education.

Back to the child comparison. If you give me a task today that I could not succeed in when I was younger, how much of my success is due to my learned patterns, my lifetime of optimization? How much of it is due to raw intelligence? Have my learned patterns pruned my intelligence by making my life easier? Do I only seem smarter now, because some of the lessons life threw at me managed to stick? Do I learn new things faster now?
