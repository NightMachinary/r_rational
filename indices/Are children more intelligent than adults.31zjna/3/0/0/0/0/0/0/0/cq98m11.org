  There are, of course outliers. A fairly substantial number of them.

I disagree, in terms of rates outliers are rare.

  Here's an example from myself. When I was in third grade, I could open any book I'd ever read, to any page, read two or three sentences, and know if I'd read it before. I learned to do that because the book covers for a lot of the books I was reading at the time were different at the school library and the public library.

  Today, I just read the names of the books.

  Was I smarter then, or now?

First up since we know that the IQ scores of Lesswrong types are very high , and [[/r/rational]] certainly is a lesswrong affiliated sub you are probably in the very high range were the predictive validity is not that good anymore. Second, you are smarter now. If I give you an intellectual task you are more likely to succeed now.
