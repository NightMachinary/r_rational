I suppose my wording wasn't very appropriate to the question. I do agree that we have ways of measuring certain aspects of mental ability which will typically allow us to identify high intelligence in adults. There are, of course outliers. A fairly substantial number of them.

Here's an example from myself. When I was in third grade, I could open any book I'd ever read, to any page, read two or three sentences, and know if I'd read it before. I learned to do that because the book covers for a lot of the books I was reading at the time were different at the school library and the public library.

Today, I just read the names of the books.

Was I smarter then, or now?
