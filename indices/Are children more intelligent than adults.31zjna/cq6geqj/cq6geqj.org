The older you get, the more heuristics your brain learns to use to prune and filter and summarise the inflow of data it gets. Most of the time that's advantageous - it lets you get to the important details of a situation more quickly and make more accurate guesses from limited information, but the misdirection used by magicians is /specifically designed/ to exploit your heuristics and pull your attention towards the irrelevant while concealing the real trickery.

It does also have other effects - from what I hear children are more able to tell apart (for example) individuals in a group of animals, because they haven't yet learned a mental filter that categorises all sheep as "A sheep" so they're still genuinely looking at the individual details. By the time you're an adult you've learned that the specific identities of sheep are rarely important, so they all look the same because you're not really paying attention (unless you're a shepherd, in which case those individual identities are useful information and you either don't learn or gradually un-learn that filter).

The adult brain has its advantages too; if memory serves there are whole regions of the brain that don't become fully functional until you reach your mid-20s. Which perhaps explains why teenagers are prone to risky behaviour and short-term thinking - they literally don't have the circuitry required to properly assess risk, or appreciate long-term rewards. Thinking at high levels of abstraction is also a skill that takes time and age to develop, which is a useful component of 'intelligence'.
