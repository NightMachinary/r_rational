  On the topic of highly intelligent people that are outside the realm of most intelligence testing. If you haven't spent much time around extremely good machinists and other tradesmen, you might not be familiar with just how shockingly good some of them are with their hands and tools. It's not just manual dexterity and a good eye. Some of them simply know the materials and tools of their trade better than most people outside the trades would believe. They aren't common, but they aren't rare. I've worked with a few, and most of them were not good candidates for a higher education.

Sure. But if the entire population would be in such trades I suspect that iq would be a good predictor for ability. It is in most jobs. It would not be everything however. Intelligence as defined by psychometricians is the ability to solve abstract problems and this ability is an exceedingly good predictor for success in many areas but not the only one and correlations are never perfect.

  Back to the child comparison. If you give me a task today that I could not succeed in when I was younger, how much of my success is due to my learned patterns, my lifetime of optimization?
#+end_quote

Memory tasks on smaller sets are probably the key here. I have been playing Magic (the trading card game) since I was a child. Back then I knew every card I possesed by heart. Now there is no chance to remember them all there are thousands and most of them are irrelevant. The grown you has read hundreds of books, many more than the child you and the large set is harder to keep in focus and the brain begins to optimze by forgeting useless stuff.

  How much of it is due to raw intelligence?
#+end_quote

Intelligence in raw (crystalized+soft) terms is much higher in your adult life. You are a better problem solver.

  Have my learned patterns pruned my intelligence by making my life easier?
#+end_quote

Yes. And they will continue to until your 50s or so.

#+begin_quote
  Do I only seem smarter now, because some of the lessons life threw at me managed to stick?
#+end_quote

No. Your soft intelligence or transfer intelligence is higher now too.

#+begin_quote
  Do I learn new things faster now?
#+end_quote

Yes. Languages become easier to learn as adult provided you have learned languages as well as child and done some preorganization.
