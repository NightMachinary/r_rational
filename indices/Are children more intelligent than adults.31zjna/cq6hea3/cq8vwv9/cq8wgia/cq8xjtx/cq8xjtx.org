  Is a wildly successful investment banker more intelligent than the creative genius that generates a hit TV series? Is a mathematician who can operate at the highest levels of theory more intelligent than a private detective that has the uncanny ability to get inside the heads of other people and predict them?

I can make predictions that all of these people test in the high percentiles on iq tests and it would be one hell of a fluke if they did not. That being said iq tests have greater predictive power and repeatability in the middle of the bell curve so exceptional individuals may lead to a false picture of the volatility of such tests.

  That doesn't mean we understand what intelligence is, and how to measure it except in very small slices, apples to apples.

Nah that is just wrong. All these fruits correlate with very high correlation coefficient to the apple the iq score, so much so that psychometricians talk about g - the general intelligence factor that translate between very different tests and explains the performance. There are almost no tests of cognitive ability that are not g loaded, meaning that people with high scores on iq test outperform medium performers on aggreagate which then outperform low performers in almost every test ever devised (and those where it is not so are e.g. revognizing faces not something which we would particularly count as intelligence).
