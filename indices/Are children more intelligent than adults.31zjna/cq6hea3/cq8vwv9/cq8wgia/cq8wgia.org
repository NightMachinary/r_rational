Is a wildly successful investment banker more intelligent than the creative genius that generates a hit TV series? Is a mathematician who can operate at the highest levels of theory more intelligent than a private detective that has the uncanny ability to get inside the heads of other people and predict them?

Specific examples aside, we can certainly test ourselves against one another in certain aspects of intelligence that we all agree are important. That doesn't mean we understand what intelligence is, and how to measure it except in very small slices, apples to apples.
