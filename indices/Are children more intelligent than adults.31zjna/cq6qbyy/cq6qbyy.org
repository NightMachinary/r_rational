Children have the same number of neurons as adults, but more synapses (i.e. more connections between neurons). This means more neuroplasticity - children are better learners than adults.

So yes, children might well be "more intelligent", depending on how you define that. I don't think that's a completely accurate picture, but it's pretty close to say that children are "as intelligent" as adults. Someone once said "a child is an adult with less experience".

You can certainly give a fairly good understanding of quantum mechanics to an eight year old, if you can get them to sit still long enough. You just have to start from first principles a lot more often than you would with an undergrad.

I have not listened to the podcast, they probably said most of this.
