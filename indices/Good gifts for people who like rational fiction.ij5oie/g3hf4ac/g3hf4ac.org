If the person is into coding etc... maybe an arduino starter kit ? They are available in multiple price segments and even just a super small beginner one is awesome and are not that costly (10-20â‚¬). And it opens follow up presents like sensor kits etc. If not that, maybe a cool quote from one of the fav stories like Red Rising printed on a tshirt
