This is a hard question to answer. Especially because I haven't read either series. The quotes printed on something is a good one and probably better than the suggestion I am about to make. I only make it because it's general advice for gifting for anyone who likes video games.

If you have access to his steam / wish-list (I'll note that this can be as innocuous as asking to friend him on steam) that might give you an idea of the games he plays, likes, and wants (this works well for anyone with a steam account I find). It could be as simple as buying something from that list (steam has gifting features), though not everyone uses that list for actual things they want (sometimes just things they like, or want to pay attention to) so be careful.

Of course to make it more personal one would have to look through that profile and pick something that you have played and think he will like based off of your experience that is related to what he likes (e.g. has a lot of hours played on; this can also be useful in narrowing down a wishlist). Which is not really something *I* can do. Given his interests I suspect he has likely purchased a lot of the games he does like and is aware of games like Factorio and the [[https://store.steampowered.com/publisher/zachtronics][Zachtronics]] /puzzle/ games (and not so much their non-puzzle offerings) - which both have lots of critical acclaim and are relatively safe recommends (even people who end up not thinking it's their cup of tea still tend to review the games positively and dump at least a dozen hours into them before hitting their limit). And anything beyond that would be too personal/subjective on my end for recommending.
