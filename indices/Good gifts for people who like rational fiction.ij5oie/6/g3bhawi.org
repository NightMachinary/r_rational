Maybe a custom printed t-shirt using some art from his favorite series. Like [[https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51qzuPNcLVL.jpg][this]] or [[https://i.pinimg.com/originals/4a/b2/a7/4ab2a7029fedaf3ff8beee1e5ca52cf7.png][this]] with some editing. Or maybe [[https://ih1.redbubble.net/image.208346172.3937/ssrco,classic_tee,mens,heather_grey,front_alt,square_product,600x600.u2.jpg][this t-shirt]] for an inside joke if he's a fan of SlateStarCodex.

Or just get him a game. Plenty of new releases. Baldur's Gate 3 early access is coming out in September. The Outer Worlds was recently recommended here and has DLC releasing soon.
