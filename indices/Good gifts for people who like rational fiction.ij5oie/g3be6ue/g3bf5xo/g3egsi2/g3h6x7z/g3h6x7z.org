This might sound sappy, but: one of the best gifts you can give a friend with a niche interest, is to get into that same niche interest. If they're anything like the average rational-fiction reader, they likely don't know any other people (in person, at least) who they can talk to about what they read. Outside of a few places (e.g. the SF Bay Area), our community is still /very/ small!

For them, you could be that person. Ask your friend for some rational-fiction recommendations, read them, and talk to your friend about them!

Mind you, the thing that'd make this a "gift", is that you'd put in a bit of effort in doing this: you'd push yourself through and keep reading, even if you hit an initial stumbling-block of the kind that'd /normally/ make you give up on a story --- like the story using lots of words you don't know when you don't normally want to read stories like that, or the story doing something that's not to your taste. You'd keep faith that your friend saw /something/ good in the book, and recommended it to you for a reason. So you'd power through,

I can't speak for your friend, but personally I would appreciate this gift a lot! Certainly more than, like, socks. (And I love me some socks.)
