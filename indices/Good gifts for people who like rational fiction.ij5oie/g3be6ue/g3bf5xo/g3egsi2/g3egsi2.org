...is this me? I don't recognize OP's user name...

Though, I do have to wonder if it's just a coincidence of birthdays. I'd imagine the odds of me sharing a list of interests with someone else on this sub is significantly higher than anywhere else on the internet.

I'm tempting to leave a list of things I'd like, just in case.

But then again, if it is me, I wouldn't want to influence the selection process.

Decisions, decisions...
