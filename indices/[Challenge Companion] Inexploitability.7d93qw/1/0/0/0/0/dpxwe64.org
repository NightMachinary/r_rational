I didn't mind because the emotional state the book had put me in left me wanting goofy cliches like that to happen and I thought the reveal made sense even if there wasn't any lead up to it. The other books aren't any more rational, though, so if you didn't get attached to the characters the way I did then I wouldn't recommend them. The story only gets more pulpy as it goes on, which I enjoyed because I wanted to see these people's lives get less horrific.

I'm the kind of reader who considers the rational elements of a story to be a bonus rather than a requirement. I'll read anything if it can get me to care about the characters and themes, regardless of whether it makes logical sense. The Way of Shadows definitely has Breaking Bad-level complexity and planning on the part of the author, but there are still a couple Rule of Cool/Drama moments because he wanted to adhere to a fantasy formula as much as subvert it.
