I absolutely believe that was what the author intended for you to feel. Out of all the victims of sexual abuse in the series, she was supposed to be the one who had been utterly broken by it from a young age. Her arc was all about realizing that she could have emotional connections with other people and rebuilding herself from the hollow shell her experiences had turned her into.

She was a direct contrast to Kylar, who had suffered abuse as well and done just as many horrible things as Vi in order to survive, but always managed to hold onto his humanity no matter how much he loathed himself. The fact that he hadn't become the sociopath she had inspired Vi to try and change who she was.

I won't pretend that I liked Vi as much as Kylar, his struggle against despair and self loathing deeply resonated with me. This book came into my life just as I began to acknowledge that I had depression and helped me understand what I was feeling as well as how to combat my particular brand of it. Seeing Kylar still have hope and keep fighting when the whole world seemed out to get him was inspirational to me too.

I still consider these books to be /trigger warning: the series/ so if there was a part you just couldn't stomach I totally understand. It's miraculous that the author knew *exactly* how much detail I could tolerate hearing so as to make me to do internalize the existence of real horrors that are uncomfortable for me to think about without forcing me to look directly at it.
