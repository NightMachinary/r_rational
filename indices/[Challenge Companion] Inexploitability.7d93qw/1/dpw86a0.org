I think the Night Angel trilogy has one of the best examples of this. The magic system is highly exploitable and that makes the munchkin characters extremely powerful, but it makes perfect sense how cultural taboos and medieval-level infrastructure has put the world in such a position. The first book may be my favorite, by far, but the power progression over the course the series is among the most rational I've ever seen.

Magic can do basically anything, but is so difficult to learn for the relatively rare people who can do it, which they won't even know if a trained mage doesn't find them, that most mages only master a few spells that they can make a living with. Magic schools study and teach spells academically, but kingdoms are afraid of how powerful such institutions could become so force them to be discriminatory in a way that ends up encouraging trade skills over science or management skills.

For example, an all-female school was immediately accused by neighboring governments of attempting to breed super wizards with mages from an all-male school that already existed, so they had to forbid faculty from marrying and expel any student who got married. As result, over half the students end up moving back home to help out their husbands with the family business.

The munchkins in this world are the handful of people with the wealth and motivation to travel the world and learn everything they can about it. Nearly everyone else stays in their homeland due to political conflicts and widely varying cultural taboos that were created by geographical barriers, so travel between countries is the exception rather than the norm.

Even the exploits munchkins use are all about taking advantage of their opponents limited knowledge like using spells they wouldn't expect to see. Combat mages are vulnerable to attacks they haven't been trained to counter, and that level of specialization resulted in a divide with civilian mages that only an outsider perspective could bridge when they had to organize an army out of random civilian mages.

The evil mages have access to spells that allow them to communicate faster and build up a larger knowledge base, while also incentivizing members to explore the world in order to better subjugate it, but their strict religion combined with the influence The Dark Side has on their psychology hampers their ability to munchkin. No matter how smart the cultists and psychopaths are, they can't think outside of the box their minds are in.
