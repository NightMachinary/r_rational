Other people are saying "no because, X", but that's essentially kinda true. Inexploitability is like Murphy's law, it's especially true when you're not aware of it. People who have a bright new fanfic idea and don't stop to check if it's been done before are likely to find out that all their ideas were already done better by someone else.

The solution is to study what's out there, then focus on your comparative advantage.
