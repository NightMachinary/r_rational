Huh. Okay, then I did find the right series. I hazarded $11 on reading book one, and while it initially seemed promising, the end reveal of the big bad's identity felt like it was insulting my intelligence to the point where I didn't continue. Maybe if the munchkinism had started earlier, but it didn't start in volume one.
