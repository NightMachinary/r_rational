[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheNightAngelTrilogy][This one.]] Keep in mind that even though I consider the first book to be a masterpiece and the whole trilogy a fantastic series that seamlessly shifts genre from low fantasy to heroic fantasy to high fantasy, it is one of the darkest, most disturbing, and disgusting things I've ever read.

Remember all the horrible thing that happened in the show Jessica Jones? That stuff happens to /children/ at the beginning of the first book. I absolutely despise gratuitous violence or sexual content in fiction so I would not have liked this story, let alone loved it, if it wasn't handled perfectly with extreme tact in how much is shown vs told.

I'm convinced the only reason it was done so well is because the author's wife is a psychologist for human trafficking victims, and made the central theme of the story about confronting abuse and despair. It's still a tough read, intentionally so, but it takes you deepest pit of nihilistic depression so it can pull you back out into the light of hope.

At least, that's what the first book does. The second is more like a really dark alternate version of Mistborn where the characters have superpowers that they use to fight an evil empire, while the third has them become archetypes fighting a mythological being with the power of destiny and Shakespearean drama. It's still great reading and develops the characters further, it's just not the masterpiece like the first.
