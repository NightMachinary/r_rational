Im toying with an idea for a munchkin/rational Alt History version of WW2, focusing on Poland specifically.

It starts as it did in original timeline, on September 1, 1939. The immediate difference is however:

Whenever a Polish soldier dies (any member of the Polish armed forces) their strength, speed, dexterity, durability and theoretical knowledge and skills (not personal knowledge or intelligence though) is given to the nearest Polish soldier, atop of their own.

(for example, if there were two Polish soldiers who could benchpress 60 kg, and one dies, the other can now benchpress 120 kg).

Im working through the possible long term and exponential consequences of that "national" superpower. At what point does the number of "Super Poles" is enough to overwhelm the technological advantage of the Nazis, and the number advantage of the Soviets? At what point will they be able to go on an offensive? What would be the most optimal tactical and strategic use for a soldier who is Double (or Triple, or Quandruple) as strong and fast as normal human?

Assuming the Polish government and military cadres are rational and bloodlusted to win, how can they munchkin this power to maximum utility?
