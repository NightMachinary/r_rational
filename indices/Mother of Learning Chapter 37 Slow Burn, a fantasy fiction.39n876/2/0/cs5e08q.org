[[/u/nobody103]] please notice me sempai

Is there some easier way for readers to submit/edit typos for chapters? Like [[http://www.baka-tsuki.org/project/index.php?title=Mother_of_Learning][Mother of Learning's page on Baka-Tsuki]], where users can make simple spelling/grammar corrections.

Fictionpress doesn't allow copy+paste afaik, and Baka-Tsuki doesn't update fast enough and might not have enough visitors to make it worthwhile.

Also, any update on expansion to sites with more readership/traffic (Wattpad)?

Thanks for the new chapter!
