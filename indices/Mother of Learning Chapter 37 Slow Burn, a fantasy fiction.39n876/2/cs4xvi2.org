Typo thread for [[/u/nobody103]] . I love MoL and I offer these typos in the spirit of improving it! :->

"Not in a way I had expected or *planed* for" - should be "planned".

"Domination and suggestion *represents* spells" - when you say "X and Y", that's plural, so it should be "represent". For example, Murray and Cantwell represent Washington in the Senate.

"spells that *enforce caster's* will upon the target" - missing "the".

"Suggestion and *Illusion* are subtle methods." - the other mentions of techniques aren't capitalized in the middle of sentences.

"these things were all *unquestioningly* useful" - instead of an adverb, you want "unquestionably" here, which is an adjective.

"the Yellow Cavern *guardians* lost both their matriarch" - should be capitalized.

"causing *to whole* the whole thing to blow up" - extra words.
