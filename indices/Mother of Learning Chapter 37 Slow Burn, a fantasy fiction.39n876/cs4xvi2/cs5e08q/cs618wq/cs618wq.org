  Is there some easier way for readers to submit/edit typos for chapters?

Sadly no. Fictionpress and Baka-Tsuki are the only places the story is posted at for the moment. I do have plans to check out Wattpad one of these days, but somehow I always find something more pressing to do.

Fooling fictionpress's stupid copy block is a simple matter of going View>Page Style>No Style, at which point you can copy whatever you want. If you don't want to install one of many workaround browser extensions, that is.

If you don't want to clutter the threads on this subreddit with corrections, you can always send me a PM to this reddit account.
