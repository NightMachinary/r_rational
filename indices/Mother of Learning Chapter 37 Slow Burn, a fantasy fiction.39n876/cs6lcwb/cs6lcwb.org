  We do have excellent low-light vision though. *But we're getting off track.*

Can I say that that second sentence somehow screams great writing to me. Being able to give a small bit of trivia and then getting back to the meat, all the while making it sound as natural and normal as we do in everyday conversations is just awesome. I think the part where +D+*Z*orian goes through things just like I could imagine myself with all the highs and lows of life that that involves is what I love most about your story.

That and the rational D&D style magic world of course.
