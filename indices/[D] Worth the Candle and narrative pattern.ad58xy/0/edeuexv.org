I don't think the author will be that formulaic with his writing, and I don't think the GM will either. Any similarities to the hero's journey exist as much to be subverted as anything else. I don't think things are going to end with Juniper going back to earth just because "the hero's journey says he has to!". The narrative may have a role to play, but I doubt it'll be that blatant. I mostly believe the GM that he doesn't have set outcomes to everything in mind, and while I'm sure the author does, the in-story narrative appears to mostly take place firmly inside of the fourth wall, I doubt the author himself is ever going to be relevant to the story.

Besides, the pattern DOESN'T really apply to the journey so far. He hasn't really refused the call as such, he was thrust into the situation with little choice but to go along with it, and didn't really at any time complain about "wanting his old life back". He misses a few of his friends, but he'd very clearly rather be in Aerb than on Earth. And while he's had a few mentors over the course of the story so far, I wouldn't say he's met THE mentor.

You may have a point with some of the arcs being micro-scale hero's journeys, but I doubt the overall story will be one.
