I'm just saying it's common for stories to end where they started. It just wraps up loose ends nicely. That's Dan Harmon's story circle which is a simplification of Campbell's work.

Refusal of the call is a bit unclear, it's not that they haven't thought of it but all the discussion about narrative that we get points out to how much that would be a bad idea. Juniper expresses distaste for becoming the new Uther numerous times. Maybe it kinda counts? It's thin I'll give you that and it's the one subversion so far. [EDIT : Actually, we're more in a situation of [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/THeHerosJourney][Resigned to the Call]] which is a variation] However I think it reveals thoughtful character design and the opposition of his want and need

- Usually, a hero would have a distinct WANT and NEED. The WANT is why the hero engage on the quest : find the graal, stop the bad guy, get a ton of money, restore peace on Aerb ; whereas the NEED in the true hole in the hero that gets highlighted by the trials. By the end of the story, the want can be given up because the need is the most important.

- In Juniper case, the WANT is to forever live in Aerb, the land of fun and magic, where he made friends, where he's super-strong. It's a comforting place for him. But the adventure and the entire world is designed to push him to his NEED which would be to come to term with the loss of his friend, to understand how he's hurt people close to him and to give him the will to apologize and be a better person

As for the mentor, there's one in each mini-arc from Amaryllis in the first one. In the grand scheme of things, I'd make a strong case for the GM being the mentor. Before meeting him, the story was simply about surviving the immediate threat but he provided an endgame that gave the hero determination to proactively engage on the journey. The mentor is the one that steels the hero's determination to undergo the journey, he's not necessarily good.
