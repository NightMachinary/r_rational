There was:

#+begin_quote
  “Any chance that you'd have indexed the Second Empire's research efforts on the loci?” I asked.

  “Possibly, but unlikely,” said Raven. “No one has had any cause to go looking for them, given they've been assumed eradicated for centuries. I should warn you that late into the Second Empire, it was standard practice to lace classified documents with cognitohazards.”
#+end_quote

But I think Raven knows some countermeasures, and Joon has Spirit which should help, and Bethel is immune, so between them they presumably can deal with that.

Actually, I think they already went through the loci research:

#+begin_quote
  The day before we were set for our expedition to Darili Irid, Amaryllis and I spent a week in the chamber together, mostly so that I could read through the books her other self had written, and she could read through the other books (notably, the locus materials and Fel Seed manifests) and practice her newfound skill in Spirit.
#+end_quote

So it seems like it wasn't helpful; I guess they risked the infohazards, or had Bethel check it for known infohazards, or else it wasn't from that late in the 2nd Empire and there wouldn't have been infohazards, or maybe it just wasn't classified because all the loci they knew of were dead by then. (I think there is a line directly to that effect that the research was useless, but we can infer it from this one anyway.)

#+begin_quote
  my point was that everything remain on standby until something happens or someone come forward with information that makes one matter more pressing than the others marking the beginning of a new mini-arc
#+end_quote

They have been mostly reactive, which they have noted in-story, although the current Atheaenium arc was pretty much chosen by them.

I don't think that's the same as refusing the call, though. It's more being unable to answer the call directly, yet.

They definitely are trying to get to the point where they can tackle major priorities directly, though.
