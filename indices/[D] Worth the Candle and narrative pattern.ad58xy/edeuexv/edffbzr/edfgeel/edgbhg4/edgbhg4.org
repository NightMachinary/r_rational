Campbell's work is descriptive of mythology and includes a number of notable stretches. Dan Harmon's [[https://channel101.wikia.com/wiki/Story_Structure_101:_Super_Basic_Shit][story circle method]] is a prescriptive adaptation of it, much looser in the steps, and largely predicated on what makes people see "story" rather than "series of connected events". If you did [[https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Areddit.com%2Fr%2Frational+%22story+circle%22][the following Google search]], =site:reddit.com/r/rational "story circle"=, you'd find that the author of /Worth the Candle/ is responsible for almost all the hits that you'll get, and has [[http://thingswhichborepeople.blogspot.com/2014/09/pre-writing-for-national-novel-writing.html][written a blog post]] detailing how he planned to use that method in a prior work.

(The author's personal opinion is that Harmon /also/ overstates the case about universality, but that this method of storytelling probably /is/ wired in people, specifically in terms of what people desire from stories, and it's likely the similarity to the "comfort zone" social science model isn't coincidence, but more studies would need to be done to determine a social or biological basis for what makes stories tick.)

The extent to which /Worth the Candle/ applies either the monomyth or story structure methods, or subverts or plays with them, is an obviously an open question until the work is completed, but that's as much evidence of authorial preference as I think exists, excepting whatever may or may not have been said in episodes of Rationally Writing (there, I think [[http://daystareld.com/podcast/rationally-writing-11/][Story Structure pt 1]], [[http://daystareld.com/podcast/rationally-writing-12/][Story Structure pt 2]], [[http://daystareld.com/podcast/rationally-writing-26/][Tabletop RPGs vs Writing]], and [[http://daystareld.com/podcast/rationally-writing-42/][Worth the Candle]] would probably have the most insight, but I haven't relistened to them.)
