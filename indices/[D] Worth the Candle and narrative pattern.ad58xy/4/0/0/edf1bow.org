  “I haven't read through all the books yet, but we were able to get all of the Second Empire's research into the nature of the loci. It's knowledge that was paid for in blood, but I'm hopeful that I can find something in there that gives me a hint as to what I can do to help get the locus established in the outside world, some way to spread its power and let it take on new lands.”

The thing I'm thinking of is Glassy Fields, given that the bottle is glass...that might be high on their list of priorities, given that they almost went there before Kuum Doona.

Also, the Locus probably /isn't/ the most pressing matter, given that it's stable with Solace back and has been for a while.
