  Staying in the comfort of the mastered magic world would be the selfish choice whereas coming back to make a change for better is the heroic choice.

Uhhh... Earth doesn't have 9000 hells or all the threats Aerb is facing. The heroic choice is staying to fix Aerb, at least for now. Juniper would be able to fix his personal problems on Earth, but he's an utilitarian and he's not going to prioritize making 10 people happy over twenty-four billion.

Are you perhaps under the impression Aerb isn't "real"? I'm pretty sure that was Uther's conclusion, but Juniper wants to believe, and so do I.
