It's hard to know how to answer if people didn't *share* your complaints. e.g. when you say too many 'faux-important philosophical debates', how shall I know if debates in more recent arcs will be likewise seen as 'faux-important' or not, if I didn't see the early debates as 'faux-important' in the first place?

Not sure I agree with your review's rush to judgment on whether Cindy's mom has supposedly changed attitudes about sex mid-story. Her later characterization did surprise me, but even back in 1.3 she was okay with Cindy just straight-out telling her "I'm probably gonna lose my virginity soon". In my mind it it understandable she had probably not talked about sex to Cindy much, because given Cindy's body issues, that'd be like pouring salt into the wound, talking to her about good things that Cindy could not have. Cindy's mom was not very well-defined in the early chapters (and probably not well-defined in the author's mind either), but neither do I see her as /that/ inconsistent with her later appearances.

Not to mention that I'm not certain Cindy's Mom had actually existed before the Erogame started. It is always possible Cindy may have simply selected the hidden 'Mom' perk, changing reality and her memories to give her a good and supportive mother, as opposed to an abusive/neglectful one.

"intends to solve the obesity problem of others by forcefully changing their bodies without their consent" is again a mischaracterization, I feel. She doesn't *intend* or *plan* to do it without their consent, instead she's put on the spot, asking her to decide right then and there 'Would you do an unambiguously very good thing to people without their consent, if they can't trust you enough to give such consent' and she decides the answer is Yes, because she knows that she's thankful to the Erogame which similarly did something very good to her without *her* consent.

Some elements of your review I do agree with. E.g. the DOM/SUB stat is indeed basically useless IMO, and there are other aspects of the gameplay which are similarly unbalanced. This the author has also recognized, and if you see the Threadmarks/Extras, the author has proposed a [[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-erogamer-original.5465/page-189#post-1926610][slightly different set of rules]] for other people wanting to create Erogamer stories, given his experience after the fact about the gameplay aspects that were subpar.

Now that having been said, things that have changed and might affect your opinion:

- It's a very crucial plot point in recent arcs, that Cindy ends up regretting, repenting, confessing and apologizing to Charles for her deception.
- The obesity cure she does eventually end up creating is not designed to be done via coercion towards anyone, nor without their consent.
- The ERO stat *has* actually increased to over 30, the boundary for science fiction/fantasy stories.

However, if you hate that much the idea of e.g. sometimes multiple chapters going by without sex scenes, or of alternate POV characters whose chapters don't contain gamer mechanics, these things do continue.
