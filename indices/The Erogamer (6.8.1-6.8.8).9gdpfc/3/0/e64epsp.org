I have an /extremely/ different read of the story than you, to the point where your review just makes me feel like the story just isn't /for/ you if that's what you've gotten out of it so far, so maybe this response won't be helpful, but...

Pretty much everything you listed seems overblown or misinterpreted, to me... like calling her perspective "obesity apologism," as if she's not, you know, just a /teenager with a clear eating disorder/, and the whole rape thing, which is /acknowledged in-story as unhealthy and bad/, even back then, even before recent chapters where it's brought up and explored much more in-depth.

I dunno, it just seems like you're taking the protagonist's perspectives as author-tracts on what's True and Right without actually treating her like a character that can just be wrong about things and have traumas and flaws that she's struggling with, which is pretty poor way to read fiction in general, I'd say. You're not totally wrong, there's definitely some whiplash with her mother's characterizations for example, but the majority of your criticisms are just obviously "missing the point." You're criticizing the story for having bad BDSM when the very nature of good/bad BDSM is something the characters argue about (I can't remember if it happens by 3.4.3, so maybe this is a justified criticism from your perspective) and "several pages on hair" is just you clearly missing or not appreciating the references and foreshadowing that whole thing is making, which came off as awesome to me.

Sooo... I mean, I think the story is amazing and just keeps getting better, and as I pointed out a number of these things are brought up at some point, so for what that's worth maybe try it again and see if your concerns are addressed? But also maybe it's just not for you, and that's okay too.
