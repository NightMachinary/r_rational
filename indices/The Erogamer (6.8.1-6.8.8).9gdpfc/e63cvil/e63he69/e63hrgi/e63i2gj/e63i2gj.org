Well fair enough if that's what the author wants, lets at least add a <requires login> tag.

I mean, no, it's not /that much trouble/, it's just a design of high traffic public spaces thing. For every person like me who speaks up, there are 50 people who click on it, see a login, get confused, and wander away. For each person it is a trivial inconvenience, but when anywhere between 50-500 people might get trivially inconvenienced over something it becomes worth addressing. The inconvenience is less visible because its online but it is still there.
