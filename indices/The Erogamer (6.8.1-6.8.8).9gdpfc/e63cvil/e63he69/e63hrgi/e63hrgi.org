Is making an account in QQ really that much trouble?

I think Groon has said that he doesn't want to maintain two separate copies of the story, as it'll be harder to keep them in sync, when he makes minor fixes to previous chapters from time to time. Moreover he *wants* people commenting, discussing and voting, so he does want people coming to QQ and interacting with the other readers there.

EDIT: Found the quotes in a conversation on his profile in response to the question "Would you be willing to have a mirror of The Erogamer hosted somewhere not behind a loginwall? That would lower the barrier to recommending the story to others substantially.":

  I don't want to have to maintain it, and I don't want to have to worry about updating two different sites in synchrony when I go back through a dozen chapters and retcon available stat points because I miscounted and put in an extra 5 stat points, like I did yesterday.

  Though aside from that I wouldn't mind, especially if it only mirrored Book 1. I do feel like I get most of the psychological benefit on my end from readers who are voters, and I don't want to have to track votes in two places, so people going to QQ to read the last chapters would be better from my perspective.\\
  6.a would do pretty well on its own somewhere and is semi-SFW, I'm just not sure where to put it.
