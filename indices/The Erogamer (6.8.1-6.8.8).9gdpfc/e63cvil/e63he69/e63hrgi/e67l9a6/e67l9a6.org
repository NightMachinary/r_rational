  Is making an account in QQ really that much trouble?

My problem with it is that things behind a login-wall can't be targeted by offline-reading extensions like Pocket or Instapaper. Or by scraping change-notifier bots like... I don't know if any exist any more, but there used to be Dapper. (Coincidentally, this also means that Tumblr blogs behind a login-wall don't have RSS feeds, which is the literal Worst Thing Ever.)

Also, even if I could use Instapaper, the fact that there are other forum posts on the same page wrecks the content-scraping algorithm the offline-reader extensions use. This problem I also have with Dungeon Keeper Ami, which has lead me to copy-pasting its updates into a pastebin in order to Instapaper them.
