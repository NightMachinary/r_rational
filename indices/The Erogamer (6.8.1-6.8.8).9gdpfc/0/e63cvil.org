I think that having a thread for The Erogamer per sub-arc here is appropriate, even though having one per chapter would probably have been excessive.

I hope that's a fair compromise, compared to not having The Erogamer threads at all, since it's one of the works often recommended and discussed in other threads, and I think most subscribers of this subreddit generally seem to feel it does belong here.

You'll be needing a Questionable Questing account to read the story, since it's very NSFW. That's a minor annoyance, but I feel I can guarantee this quest is worth it.
