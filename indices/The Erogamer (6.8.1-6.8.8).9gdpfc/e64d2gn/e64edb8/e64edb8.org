Characterizations have stabilized significantly. A reasonable explanation for early sudden character shifts does exist, but they haven't changed much since. At this point there's a ton of general existential horror about what is going on and why, from everyone, which I find very realistic. People do start leaning into game mechanics as a means of accomplishing goals, but I honestly find it very realistic that they didn't do this at the beginning, given that the game's mechanics seem to have nothing to do with how reality used to work. The most recent arc had every on-screen character deliberately using game mechanics and recognizing that was what was going on, more or less.
