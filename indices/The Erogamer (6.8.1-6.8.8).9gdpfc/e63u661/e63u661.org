The author has had some seriously heavy psychological and existential drama in this, and it's actually quite relevant to this sub.

There is a character in the most recent arc who I am fairly certain is meant to be one of us. The author calls out to [[/r/rational][r/rational]] by name on several occasions.

I highly recommend this. Come for the porn, stay for the existential thriller.
