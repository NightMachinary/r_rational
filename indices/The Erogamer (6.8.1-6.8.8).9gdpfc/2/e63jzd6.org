I've seen this recommended before, and so seeing it recommended here several times makes me inclined to try and read it.

However, I've got an aversion to reading about ugly people having sex and the main character starts out at a 1.5/10 on the attractiveness scale. Do you know how long it takes for her to level up into being attractive?
