I'm the author so if you ask me it's the best thing you've ever read :P

This is actually the second time I've been asked that recently, so I have a response I wrote last time:

--------------

It's marked as romance, but romance is not the main thing in that there's no quivering members or anything like that; at its core it's an urban fantasy story set in 1944. There are no sex scenes in the story, though characters do canonically have sex (you know, the old "in bed, fade to black" sort of teen-appropriate way).

Standard human-vampire romance (both men, which seems to turn a lot of people off offhand, but eh), but there's deep worldbuilding. Starts out with the MCs falling for each other, but then it becomes about the obstacles that start falling between them being together and how they overcome it.

Apart from the worldbuilding (which I literally have had a phD mathematician who also has a physics degree help me get right), I've been told people consider the writing itself high-quality (I've aimed to have it be very polished and well-edited).

The reason it's rational is because this is not a romance where the conflict is from comical misunderstandings: the partners communicate with each other, they work on their relationship, and they experience growth because of it.

Here's some praise I've got from an [[/r/rational]] perspective if you'd like to hear what others have to say:

--------------

"It's not Animorphs the Reckoning but dangit sometimes I just want Visser Three and Marco to sit and drink coffee for ten pages and maybe kiss" - [[/u/Callmesalticidae]]

"Normally I go [to [[/r/rational][r/rational]]] for munchkinry and fun, but this was good and gripping, and I read the entire story to date in one sitting." - anonymous

"You know what you do well? Presenting strange information to our blank slate stand-in and have him actually ask questions about how things work. He's asking questions I actually want to know" and (for a recent chapter) "This chapter is a delight, tight and careful and slightly horrifying." - [[/u/leakycauldron]]

--------------

That said, it's not for everyone: I'd recommend you read the first chapter. If you want a taste of the "action", you can go to the previous chapter - I have no idea how it stands alone, but it's pretty representative of the worldbuilding and character type stuff that happens, and is very light on the romance, so it might be worth a shot: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13710744/chapters/58964515]]
