Thank you for your critical analysis. It's helpful to read the behind the scenes from the writer's perspective. I loved the setting and the unique worldbuilding which was a character on its own right -- in a city full of hungry tinkers and greedy makers, it's brimming with potential energy in the sense that a powder keg is set to explode.

In my uninformed opinion, on its face I'd say that Jess was the protagonist, Rob was the relationship character, and... before we delved too deeply into the whodunit, I was pretty certain that someone from the battlebots arena who was friendly and sympathetic would turn out to be the murderer.

Re: the antagonist: I suspected that the murderer would have have values and skills similar to Jess, either as an HPMOR!Quirrell subverting mentor, or as an HPMOR!Dumbledore repentant manipulator. /The story requires a Lex Luthor level evil genius if a Rob/existential threat is the driver./ Even if they aren't present in the story early on, their impacts should be felt. Perhaps Brienne runs the power company, the academy, or. the entire city-state? I don't think you had the initial plot in mind, of x-threat vs sub-AI killer... and lacking the choking pressure of a level 20 villian is probably the reason why it didn't get the traction early on that you wanted. When was Quirrell introduced into HPMOR though? I don't think he was there in chapter two... Harry wasn't even introduced to Voldemort until Diagon Alley, IIRC.

Jess was the "student" who had a lot of disparate atypical skills in magic from helping out her mad scientist dad, so it didn't bother me that her magic/rune-scribing skills varied as the story progressed. Rob was shaping up to be the "mentor" to his younger sister... starting off clumsy, reliable, and slow, but every time he gets upgraded, he provides the exact level of skills training that Jess needs to level up too. I really liked the potential inherent in that, because it strengthens their co-dependence on each other. Rob's ability to self-improve seemed like a great way for him to provide lessons in rationality while still remaining limited by mana resources, processing speed, and ...hexabits(?)

Speaking of hexabits, it wasn't clear to me if the inscribed runes all needed to be on a single "sheet" in order to be executed, or if it was just a sequential process and the runes could be all buried in different parts of the rotating magesteel cluster at different orientations and faces. The method by which they spun around also boggled my mind because I was thinking of a gear-like system rather than some sort of expanding/contracting/rotating levitation system instead. It seemed mechanically intensive for its purposes and in my mind, probably burned mana inefficiently to spin physical objects around. Why not invent a liquigel system similar to digital clocks or highway traffic signs with a series of interconnected lines or dots that light up when needed? If the runes could be drawn from such a cruder low-res display, Rob would basically be a jar of magesteel beads that flicker on and off rapidly and he could even inscribe 3D runes that way. (Perhaps Rob's intelligence jumps when Jess starts makes the upgrade from mechanical to digital later in the story, if you return to it.)With the Singularity/God-eating-Paperclipper ending, a scintillating, calculating mass of Rob-magedust simulating Jess' idealized world would make for a possible vision of the future.

Re: the "Just So" ending. my biggest beef with it, aside from the style and tone change associated with a bedtime story by Rudyard Kipling about the terrifying ending of the world enacted by your best friend.... it seems to turn Jess from the "435" character you wrote before into a "111" background character. Sure, she'd be overshadowed by the all-consuming Rob-beast, but Jess is his highest priority.
