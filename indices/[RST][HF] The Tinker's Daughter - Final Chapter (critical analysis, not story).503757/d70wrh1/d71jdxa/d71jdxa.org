  I'm just wrapping up the characters bit and I don't agree completely with your self assessment... I think you're being too critical - not wrong, exactly, it's just that some of it was a non-issue in my opinion... I'll elaborate more when I'm not tired. Although that might change my opinion, too...

I'll look forward to hearing it.

  Also, you could ask people things if you get stuck figuring things out... How to go from having a name to finding a person in this society? Shit, run it like a story/rpg campaign hybrid with a few people playing Jess. Give them an objective, let them ask questions about the specifics of the setting, and they could propose a plan of action.

Could do. When I write it's generally with the intention of publishing, though. Last time I published something that I'd asked for suggestions on I caught a lot of flack. I'm already writing for one quest ([[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/marked-for-death-a-rational-naruto-quest.24481/#post-4925222][Marked for Death]]), so I don't have time to do a second one and still do anything else.

  Also, I really liked the setting. Got any worldbuilding notes you would share? Love to run a tabletop rpg in it.

Cool! Yes, I do. Let me look through it.
