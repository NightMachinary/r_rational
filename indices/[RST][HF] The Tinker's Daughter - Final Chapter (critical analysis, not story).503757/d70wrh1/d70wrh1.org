I'm just wrapping up the characters bit and I don't agree completely with your self assessment... I think you're being too critical - not wrong, exactly, it's just that some of it was a non-issue in my opinion... I'll elaborate more when I'm not tired. Although that might change my opinion, too...

Also, you could ask people things if you get stuck figuring things out... How to go from having a name to finding a person in this society? Shit, run it like a story/rpg campaign hybrid with a few people playing Jess. Give them an objective, let them ask questions about the specifics of the setting, and they could propose a plan of action.

I'd have been down to do something like that.

Also, I really liked the setting. Got any worldbuilding notes you would share? Love to run a tabletop rpg in it.
