  Ok, for Jesse, I'd rate her as 435...
#+end_quote

Good, sounds like I did what I set out to do.

  The main thing though is that this didn't feel like half of the book, it felt the first quarter of the book and it's totally ok for the antagonist not to appear within the first quarter.
#+end_quote

Not sure I agree with you on that one. I'm looking at the published books on my shelves:

- Ender's Game: Strange book from a narrative structure. More of a connected series of short stories than a novel. Each segment has a separate antagonist -- Bonzo, Rackman, the buggers. In every case they show up very early.
- Changes: Duchess Arianna shows up very early, and the Escobars even earlier.
- Live Free or Die: Actually, this one supports your point. The Horvath don't appear on screen until the very end.

Okay, valid point.

  I'm also not sure that the relationship character needs to be clearly defined by chapter 2.
#+end_quote

Maybe. Seems like sooner is better, though.

  The only thing I really think wouldn't work at all with the story as told to Jess's grand niece was your plan to have Jess spend a quarter of the story or so in prison. This would have made the flow of the story difficult I feel.
#+end_quote

I don't know that it would have been a quarter of the story -- once Rob started improving things would have gone very quickly. I'm not sure it would have been more than a chapter or two.

  Things that I think went well

  I agree with you on most of your points. I believe that to date, this is your best work in term of characters. They were all differentiated, and very likable. In term of world building, this was also your best work I feel.
#+end_quote

Thank you! Much appreciated. There was a crazy huge amount of stuff that never got shown. I might reuse that in the future.

#+begin_quote
  In term of the rule of cool, I don't completely agree with you. There are a lot of startups or companies that become big and successful because they used an arbitrage opportunity that they discovered. Of course, it can't be too simple or else it's unrealistic but with both Jess and Rob, they could have found a plausible business model.
#+end_quote

Oh, they definitely could have. It's just that the one I thought of first would have required RoC to work.

#+begin_quote
  As said, I also don't think your primary viewpoint character was mismanaged since I really thought she was perfect for the role.
#+end_quote

Thank you, that's very nice to hear.

#+begin_quote
  In the end, I have to say I'm pretty disappointed since it was the first work you did since the Two Year Emperor that I really enjoyed (I liked Anko at the beginning but found the plot too messy in the end). I didn't read the Change Storms series beyond the first two chapters though. Will have to do that one day.
#+end_quote

Yeah, the second act of Team Anko wasn't ideal. What made you stop with the Change Storms?
