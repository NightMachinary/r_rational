*Characterization*

Ok, for Jesse, I'd rate her as 435 (or maybe 445) character. Her competence level is quite clear in that she's very competent for her age (as befit a daughter taught by her father who is 5 on the competence ladder) and so her hacking the museum protection while not being competent enough to recreate a golem like Rob from the grounds up isn't surprising. As the main view point character she's very sympathetic. In term of proactivity, Rob also comes up with quite a few suggestions so she's not the only person leading the story.

The main thing though is that this didn't feel like half of the book, it felt the first quarter of the book and it's totally ok for the antagonist not to appear within the first quarter. It wouldn't really have been a problem to have an increased presence of Brianne after. As an antagonist, she could have been quite interesting since from her point of view she would have seen herself preventing a catastrophe while from the point of view of Rob and Jess, she would have been seen as an evil jealous person. I'm also not sure that the relationship character needs to be clearly defined by chapter 2.

The only thing I really think wouldn't work at all with the story as told to Jess's grand niece was your plan to have Jess spend a quarter of the story or so in prison. This would have made the flow of the story difficult I feel.

*Things that I think went well*

I agree with you on most of your points. I believe that to date, this is your best work in term of characters. They were all differentiated, and very likable. In term of world building, this was also your best work I feel.

In term of the rule of cool, I don't completely agree with you. There are a lot of startups or companies that become big and successful because they used an arbitrage opportunity that they discovered. Of course, it can't be too simple or else it's unrealistic but with both Jess and Rob, they could have found a plausible business model.

As said, I also don't think your primary viewpoint character was mismanaged since I really thought she was perfect for the role.

In the end, I have to say I'm pretty disappointed since it was the first work you did since the Two Year Emperor that I really enjoyed (I liked Anko at the beginning but found the plot too messy in the end). I didn't read the Change Storms series beyond the first two chapters though. Will have to do that one day.
