Actually, the more I think about it, in that first part of the book, the antagonist is the environment. The fact that Jess and Rob need to fend for themselves generates tension and this also helps with making all the exposition flow quite nicely. Brianne is not introduced quickly but the reader still knows that there's someone who killed Jess and Rob's father and who might kill them (which is why Jess and Rob try to stay undercover). So, really, I think that not having an antagonist is a problem for this story.

For Change Storms, I read the first few two chapters, I wasn't that captivated and I started reading Excession from Banks around that time (I'm a big fan of Banks so it's hard for any piece of fiction to compete with that :-))... I'll give it a try again.
