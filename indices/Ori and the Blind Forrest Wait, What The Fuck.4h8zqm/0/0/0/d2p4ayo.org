I think it's fine as a top-level post since you are discussing aspects of fiction and how it can be rational or not. But in the future I recommend posting it in the Friday Off-Topic Thread first and then only posting it as its own post if you haven't gotten any answers.

Note that I'm not a moderator, and this is simply how I would have done things as someone who has been posting here for a while.
