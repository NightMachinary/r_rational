It is an assumed default, yes. But while this game does have mystical elements, there is nothing to say that Magic A Is Magic A as a trope is not in effect. It's just that under the spoiler is something so absolutely massive that I want confirmation from more rationally minded people to help me confirm if I've missed something equally massive that would make it make sense. The story certainly doesn't seem irrational otherwise.

Edit: And like I added in my post, I don't mind trying to delete the post if it doesn't belong.
