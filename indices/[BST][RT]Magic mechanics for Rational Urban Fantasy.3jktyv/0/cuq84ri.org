I'd go for something like the Mystborn system (8 powers, total, each of which is relatively minor).

For something broader, I might look at 4th edition D&D's Rituals [[http://dnd4.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_Rituals]] . They'd be nice because a character would know a very small number of rituals. And the effects are super-specific, so the reader could reasonably learn the main character's whole set of options.

More general than that might be something like Larry Correa's Grimnoir chronicles. In the book, people get one of a few super-hero type powers. You could probably adapt that list so that the effects came from drawn designs instead of internal effort. Then you could have stuff like "the seal that holds back water" or "the inscription that lowers inertial-mass but not gravitational mass."

For rationalist UF, I'd go for really weak or hyper-specific powers. It's feels weird to read all the books where a world with powerful, general-purpose magic turned out just like the contemporary US.
