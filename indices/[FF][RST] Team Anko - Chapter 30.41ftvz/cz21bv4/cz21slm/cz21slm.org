You're not wrong. I poked at it, but couldn't find a way that I liked better. Anko was going to get the team out of there so fast their shadows had to catch up, and it's only about a three-hour run to Konoha, so there wasn't a lot of room for other events on the way. I could have put in the scene of them arriving and being brought to the Hokage, but that just felt like filler.
