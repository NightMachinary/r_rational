Exactly. I'm glad we agree. You're the only reasonable one in the entire friggin' audience -- everyone else is all "Oh, Kurama is such a liar!" "Oh, Kurama is a giant Primordial town-destroying monster, he must be lying!" or "Oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god please stop eating me Kurama!" Never any sympathy, any tolerance.
