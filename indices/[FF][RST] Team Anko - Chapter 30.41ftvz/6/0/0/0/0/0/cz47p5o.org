I have a document where I keep track of when everything in the story happens. For example, remember back in chapter 19 when Hinata went to Orochimaru's lab and he threw things at her? That started at 9am on July 29.

An author needs to keep something like this for anything longer than a short story or things get tangled up. I was forgetful at the beginning and didn't start it until I was several chapters in, so there's one day early on where the times actually don't work out -- a certain section of the story should have happened after sundown, but it didn't.
