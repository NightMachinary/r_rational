The negotiations between the Fox and Orochimaru went on "for hours" (Direct quote) and then the team (possibly sans Naruto/Fox) slept. The Fox said "Good morning" at the start of the chapter, implying it was the next day. I think I must be missing something, but it seems rather unclear how such a small amount of time has passed.
