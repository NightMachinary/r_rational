With Cat thinking there might be a possibility that the powers of Night could somehow heal Nauk's mind (even if it is a longshot), it seems strange to me that she still has an injured leg.

Was there an explanation I missed for why she does not try to heal her leg with the power of Night? If she can contemplate healing a damaged mind, it seems like a leg should be child's play.
