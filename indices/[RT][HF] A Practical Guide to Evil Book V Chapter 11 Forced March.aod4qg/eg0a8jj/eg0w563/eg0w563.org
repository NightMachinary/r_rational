Any bets as to what role the drow are gonna get when they merge with the main force?

So far I'm thinking saboteurs. They operate during the night, are good at moving fast and stealthy, are powerful, have experience fighting against single opponents and have tricks to confuse and retreat.

Give each a pack of goblin munitions and let them "hit and run" the opposing army during the night. Combined with traditional forces to fight during the day gives you a 24-hour working army.
