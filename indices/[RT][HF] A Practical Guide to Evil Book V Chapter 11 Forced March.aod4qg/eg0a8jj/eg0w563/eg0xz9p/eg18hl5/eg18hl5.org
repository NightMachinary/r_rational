If they actually keep their power from the previous book, you don't even need to fight during the day. There was that one drow which was supposed to be extremely weak as far as Mighty went that could create a giant surface of acid that melted everything it touched and caused real trouble to cat's demigod butt. Just sneak up on the camping enemy army and use that repeatedly, whole army dies more or less instantly with no way to counter. And if a hero shows up that can counter that trick, well, use a different one, they had a buttload of them. A single ten minute raid by a team of high-level drow should absolutely flatten any normal army without very specific heavy magical defences tailored to work against drow specifically.

It's like if in real life artillery cannons, the kind that can flatten a small bunker with one shell, could be used in handheld form and didn't require basically any supply lines.
