The number I quoted you is about a factor of 10^{11} larger than the number would be if she was in orbit - which is about equal to the multiplicative increase in speed, squared. Flicker may experience high acceleration, but that itself doesn't have much impact on gravitational radiation.

Now that I think about it, there are probably some interesting (special-) relativistic corrections - there's probably at least a relativistic mass correction, and maybe something like synchotron radiation, where you get higher-energy radiation along the direction of motion (though gravitational waves normally radiate only weakly along the direction of motion). But the literature looks like [[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1310.1528.pdf][this]], which seems like too much work to understand (note that gamma in that paper refers to a mixture of constants proportional to mass divided by radius (equation 225), and is not the Lorentz factor), and I'm pretty sure that the corrections are not big enough to overcome a starting point of 10^{-31} (or 10^{-28} ).
