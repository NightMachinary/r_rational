Yeah, the 'now that I think about it, some interesting things are probably happening' part is what got me 8-) I don't know enough about how they derived that gravity wave equation to even know the right exponents for velocity and the Lorentz factor - there is that r^{5} in the denominator that I have no idea how they derived. So I'm sure they wouldn't be as strong - but the Moon is a /lot/ closer to her, too. And Earth isn't all that far away. I can get 10^{30} easy if the exponents are right--which is why I'm hoping a GR expert will find it interesting enough to comment. 8-)

Edit: Took a quick look at the work you linked (not all 185 pages yet 8-)) and the biggest problem is that the best approximation is the Post-Newtonian one, which assumes v small compared to c--which Flicker completely blows away 8-)
