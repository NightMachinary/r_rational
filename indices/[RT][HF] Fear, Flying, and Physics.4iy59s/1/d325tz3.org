I was at a talk on gravitational waves last week, and from what I can tell it's all pretty straightfoward except for measuring them :P (This is a joke, please do not hunt me down, gravitational-wave astronomers).

There's a straightforward power equation (can be found [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_wave#Wave_amplitudes_from_the_Earth.E2.80.93Sun_system][on wikipedia]] - well, sort of, you have to substitute angular frequency back in), and I'm pretty sure it doesn't matter that Flicker accelerates herself - it's all about the rate of change of the quadrupole moment of the moon-Flicker system. But there's a bit of trouble, which is that the power is still proportional to the inverse square of the moon's radius, and the constants out front are still G^{3} / c^{5} (i.e. so tiny that things need to be heavy, fast, and close before they give off measurable gravitational waves). So, as far as I can guess, Flicker is spending a measly 10^{-31} or so watts on gravitational waves.
