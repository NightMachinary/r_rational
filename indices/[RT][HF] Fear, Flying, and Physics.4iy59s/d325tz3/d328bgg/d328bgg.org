Unfortunately, that is how strong the gravitational waves would be if she were in orbit, moving under the influence of gravity--and gravity has almost nothing to do with how Flicker moves. In fact 4.32 x 10^{16} g's is way above the surface gravity of a neutron star, which is about 7 x 10^{11} and started me thinking about GR and gravity waves in the first place.
