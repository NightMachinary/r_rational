  Out of curiosity, are you predetermining the specific powers of vampires or leaving it more vague in your own mind?

Without too many spoilers, I'd say it's a little of both? I'd worked out most of the big details of vampire biology pretty well in advance, I think that while having stuff planned out is valuble, you should always be open to both changing that plan and be open to new ideas as they come.
