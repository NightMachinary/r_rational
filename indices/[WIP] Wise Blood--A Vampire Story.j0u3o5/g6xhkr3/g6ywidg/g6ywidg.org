I'm really excited for this to progress. You have a gripping writing style.

In an attempt at constructive criticism, I thought that the opening scene with the drop off needed a few more distinguishing characteristics expressed for each character; we were introduced to three new characters very quickly so I think it would have been a stronger scene with a little more characterization to differentiate for clarity.

It's a great beginning. You paced the opening really well leading up to the inciting incident. I'm curious and ready for you to show more of the character of Nick.

I was certainly thrown for a loop with the final sentence, my expectations were that you were building for a slow burn towards the world of the supernatural. I'm looking forward to these characters being thrown in the deep end.

Out of curiosity, are you predetermining the specific powers of vampires or leaving it more vague in your own mind?
