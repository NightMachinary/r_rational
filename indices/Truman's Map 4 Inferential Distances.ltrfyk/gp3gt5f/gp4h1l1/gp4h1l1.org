Thank you for this detailed critique. It really helps me see what I'm doing well, what I need to put more emphasis on, and what Truman may have missed.

I'll clear this up for now: Truman is definitely getting out of jail and he can leave that up to his mother and the lawyer. The question he's really facing there is how he's going to understand the extent of his power and use it against the mayor to save Linda Groupon's career. However he does that will be the focus of Their dilemma.

No comment on your prediction :)
