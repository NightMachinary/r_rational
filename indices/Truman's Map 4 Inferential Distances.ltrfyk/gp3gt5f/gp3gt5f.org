This is... not a good plan. Granted, good for him in spotting the problem with only bringing one rack down, but Truman knows (or should know) that they have a whole town's worth of people in on the conspiracy. His plan should take into account that they have sufficient manpower to look under the racks *and* chase after him, and assume that the latter will happen.

A good plan has redundancy, has contingencies for what should happen if everything does not go according to Plan A. so far as I can tell, Truman hasn't planned for "They're not convinced by me faking my death."

And it feels a lot like he burned more time coming up with his "fake my death" plan than that plan is going to buy him. At this point, he should be seriously considering the sunk-cost fallacy.

  God, I hoped Linda was right. Because that was the only way I could save her.

That's an interesting dilemma he's posing for the showrunners. Either they let Truman win, in which case, there's someone there who is both indebted to him and willing to break character, or they don't let Truman win, in which case, they have to find some way of letting him out of prison despite his protests of guilt.

My prediction is: Truman is let off, but Linda ends up going over a cliff of her own, and Truman is left to solve her "murder." Tie everything up in a neat little bow. Which, of course, will raise suspicions of its own.

I love this running gag.
