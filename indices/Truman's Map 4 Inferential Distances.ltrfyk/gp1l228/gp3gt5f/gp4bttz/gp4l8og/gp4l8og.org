Kayfabe is a new word for me. Thanks!

I'm glad you found it realistic.

That reminds me, I forgot to add an authors note that the privilege discussion involved a real life line that I like. Fran√ßois Clemmons, who played the police officer on Mr Roger's Neighborhood, originally said "I grew up in the ghetto. I did not have a positive opinion of police officers". Linda's reason for joining the show is basically his.

I'll have to update the posts to add that note
