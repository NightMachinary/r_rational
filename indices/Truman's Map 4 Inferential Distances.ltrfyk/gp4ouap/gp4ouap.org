Just found the fic and read all the way through. I'm really enjoying it!

Truman is going to find that even as Mayor he's going to have a lot of power in some directions, and almost completely helpless in others. Which, by itself, shouldn't be that surprising, a politician must satisfy those that maintain their power, whether they're a dictator of a country or a small town mayor. Can't wait to see how that interacts with Their work to maintain the facade.
