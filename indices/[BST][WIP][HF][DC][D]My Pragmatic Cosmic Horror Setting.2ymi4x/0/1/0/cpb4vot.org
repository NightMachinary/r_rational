Hmm. So all effects produced have waste heat? What if you're using the energy to cool something? Waste heat in the area AROUND you?

From there, seems like a simple jump to invisible heat dump chute first into a lake, then miles into the stratosphere, because infinite energy! Then all it takes is an idiot trying to make lots of dirt into gold and venting all the heat into the upper atmosphere to cause major climate change and destroy the planet.

I don't think ignorance as a limiter is feasible, especially if this shit has been around a while. First, there would be groups or individuals looking to invest in shuraheima for profit. These individuals would seek to track down and contract with shuraheima, perhaps educating them (in a controlled fashion) about their powers, perhaps drugging them, whatever, in order to use them to generate economic returns/influence/military power. Then you have a government, with all the resources and minds that entails, with the power of a god. How long does it take for two such governments warring with each other to destroy the universe?

Alternatively, law of large numbers. If you have 20 planets with 5B people each, that's tons of shuraheima. All you need to destroy the universe is one who's a reasonably intelligent sociopath who experiments a bit with his powers before trying anything huge. The tools are all there. There is literally nothing stopping a single person from ruining everything as you have it laid out.
