Never read or seen Darker then Black, but interesting I'll have to check that out a bit. The entropy measure is a little bit black boxy on my end but I've teased some stuff out from asking "what happens when you do this".

So some mechanics I do know: You could compare the entropy of an action as roughly equivalent to if you had just had some power source to do all of the work related to it in the first place assuming you/your body is the zero/origin/reference point for all events being done.

So if I wanted to lift a bucket of water up to a height and then pour it over a water wheel using abyss touched powers. I would need to shed the heat equivalent to some kind of engine or machine moving that water up to that height and position as it is relative to me.

If I wanted to do it faster I'd need to shed more heat/disorder.

Where this heat or entropy GOES is one important balancing trick for shuraheima.

Without them doing something extra otherwise all of the extra entropy/heat/disorder that their spell work is 'building up' is going to be dumped right into their bodies.

A shuraheima that is untrained and tries to do something big is liable to vaporize, fission their atoms or collapse themselves into a lump of iron.

If their not particularly trained a shuraheima will either kill themselves or turn into a broken long before they can crack the planet open.

Especially because most of them don't even understand what is possible when they first 'wake up' to their abilities.

This is less like a human from modern society getting the powers of a god, and more like a possibly well educated craftsperson during the middle ages getting the powers of a god.

And the fact new shuraheima are initially ignorant of what their own potential could be is part of the safety measures to deal with their existence.
