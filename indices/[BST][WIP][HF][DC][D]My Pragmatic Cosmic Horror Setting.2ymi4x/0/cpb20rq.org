I'm getting darker than black vibes here. DTB contractors are basically your dreamers to a T.

I'm assuming that humanity is vastly expanded beyond earth at this point? With your Shuraheima rate, if my quick math was right, you'd get 70000 with JUST earth's population. And EACH of these individuals is capable of world-destroying shenanigans without even trying? Like, if they mess something up too badly? I'm not sure this universe you've built is going to be around for too much longer.

Side note: your equivalent entropy limitation is vague. Specify and give examples.
