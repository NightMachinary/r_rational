I realized that I needed more story writing and art practice before I could do the setting justice, so I'm currently doing an 'easier' training project to develop the necessary skills.

It's also going to be tricky because I'm going to have to depart from my usual comfort zone of interactive fiction to a more plotted and 'sit down and write all of it' mode of production due to time shenanigans having an important aspect of the story and world in general. which I've not been ready to do yet.
