Alright. Is there an in-universe origin/explanation for the Abyss? I'm assuming it's not known to the characters, but... Is there one planned out? In my own world the origin of the magicy thing didn't exist until I'd been thinking about the world for years, so I'm curious if yours came with a reason or if it is just something that exists, like magic in Harry Potter.
