I like this. I'm assuming there is some sort of organization/set of organizations that specializes in destroying or containing abyss-related threats? I get that some things will be impossible to contain and that some abyss-touched people that remain sane can do a great deal of good, but I can't imagine there wouldn't be a lot of effort spent on making sure fewer worlds and settlements are lost.

Also, is there (currently known or not) some way to game the system and increase the chances of getting non-Broken outcomes, or does it depend on factors that humans cannot realistically hope to manipulate?
