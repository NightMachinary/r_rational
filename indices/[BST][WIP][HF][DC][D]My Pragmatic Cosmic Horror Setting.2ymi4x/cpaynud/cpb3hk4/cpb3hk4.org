That is a little complicated. But one of the ramifications of the Time shenanigans and fate markets stuff that I mentioned at the end is that it's very hard to pin down precisely what the beginning of anything even is.

The 'territory' of the civilization as a whole is bordered by regions of space/time that no one ever comes back from. And within those regions there is a lot of interference from both the future and the past.

The broad 'earliest' border of the whole thing is roughly equivalent to the start of human beings being able to create and respond to visual depictions.

So the beginning of how all of this started as a human phenomena could be said to come from a bunch of early tribes of human beings finding tablets that had instructions for how to create a magical circle and receive some one to get them working on whatever was the most economically useful to get started at the very dawn of human civilization (a surprising amount of which is burying things in the ground for some one later).

And yes it is intentional that if you think too long about the larger structure of this entire 'universe' it gets horrifically bleak and soul crushing.
