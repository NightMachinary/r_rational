The factors don't seem to be reliably within human control because of reasons of the chaotic nature of occurrences of an event contact.

The event itself is deeply chaotic and trying to instigate one to swing one way or another is a bit like trying to predict the equivalent of spatially 12 dimensional weather to the hour twelve years in advance.

Even if they know EXACTLY what would cause a particular person to become a particular kind of abyss touched it is not reliably possible without effectively having to utilize the rest of the entire universe.

A story element I suspect is that the societies that exist and the precise makeup of normal human brains and bodies is actually tailored to make the occurrence of the various types as positive/useful as it is already and trying to push things much further gets diminishing returns.
