I'm envisioning a twist where one dreamer is responsible for all shuraheima existing by virtue of poor initial assumptions about the effects of the abyss, and must be kept alive to maintain humanity's control of the uncontrollable. There is great potential for meta-reality-warping considering that much of it occurs through human belief systems, including belief systems about the abyss.
