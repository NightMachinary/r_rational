What is the base rate for an abyss contact? It must be a low percentage, because you need a working society. If 90% of the population experience an abyss touch, then 0.9*0.999 of the population is Broken.

It seems humans can force a touch, but probably not perfectly reliable. This would suggest one or more organisations (monastery, military, secret order, secret service, etc) to exploit this systematically. It makes sense to hide it from the general population, because it is obviously dangerous. There are still the occasional trauma-touched, which is a great start for drama.

With a 7 billion population and a 0.1% touch rate, we have 7 million touched people, of which 6300 are dreamers, 630 are stalwarts and 70 Shuraheima.
