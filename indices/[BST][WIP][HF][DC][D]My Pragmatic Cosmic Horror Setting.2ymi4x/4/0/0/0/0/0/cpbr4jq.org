No that's a fair thing, I'll probably change it.

I've had some other people mention the names being a bit jarring in the past.

Originally I called dreamers Angels and the spellworking ones Demons but that seemed absurdly cliche and also not quite accurate.

I got the current name by crossing Hebrew/judaic words for demon/men and some of the linguistic extrapolations for Asura and related entities in the myth from india.

The real meaning of all that jumbled together stuff is "POWERFUL THINGS" so really anything that suits that meaning would work for me.
