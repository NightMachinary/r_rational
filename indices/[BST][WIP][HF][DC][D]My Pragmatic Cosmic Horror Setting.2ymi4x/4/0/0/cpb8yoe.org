For the first group yes that would make a lot more sense, the way you were first describing it was kind of the concept in a fic (edit: [[http://www.sagaofsoul.com/][it is saga of soul]]) but the way they solved it is that there were people monitoring universes for magic and enslaving or murdering anyone who gets it because the typical result of magic is the destruction of at very least the planet the wizard is on but typically the entire star system.

As for the dreamers, I guess that makes more sense? The way it is described at first makes it seem like most of them are like wizards who believe that they can cast spells if they talk in bad latin and wiggle their fingers. I am not sure how you would disprove that.

As for the names, maybe sticking with a theme would help a little. How about broken, patched, and weavers? There are a few ways you could go on that but making up a word or using a long foreign word always makes it sound silly and/or pretentious.

As I think about it, I kind of like the idea that the "abyss" is just full of random crap, just filled to bursting with junk code so much that it is spilling out. Maybe it is just the internet of beings that exist on another plane of reality and the fact that it touches our world and we can interact with it is just coincidental, like radiation coming off of powerlines.
