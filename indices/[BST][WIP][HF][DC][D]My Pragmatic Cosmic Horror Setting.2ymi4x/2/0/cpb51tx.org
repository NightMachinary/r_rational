Broken have the disadvantage/advantage of the majority of them being effectively none-sentient or severely damaged/impaired sentient minds. One of the foundations of the magitech of the setting is indeed using broken or their byproducts to produce various effects. Most of the means that are used to rapidly transport individuals is the use of specific broken or groups of broken in conjunction to perform the necessary infrastructure for magical transport circles and the like.

Dreamers are tricky to use in large groups because breaking their worldviews can lead to making a particularly nasty form of broken.

Not all dreamers have compatible 'stories' pertaining to what their power is/does and as a result what the very nature of the world is.

So they need to be handled gently by any involved.

The shuraheima are indeed uncontrollable as far as a human is concerned, but not un-containable for other shuraheima. Which is what a good majority of their culture is about.

Not being 'rude' enough to simply pop all of the mortals in a given continent.

Still good catch on some one wanting to utilize the dreamers who are at least moderately controllable instead of trying to wrangle something comparable to a poltergeist or infectious psychotic rage spirit (broken). The goal of the setting is the shuraheima occupy something between classic pre-harry potter wizards and the great old ones like cthulhu. And then there are things in the universe even more uncaring of mortal humans (comparable to the outer gods of lovecraft lore, but far more impersonal)
