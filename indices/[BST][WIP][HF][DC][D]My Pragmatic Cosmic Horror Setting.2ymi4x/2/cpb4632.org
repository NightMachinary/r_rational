With 100 times more Dreamers than Shuraheima, I'd expect them to contribute just as much to the tech and the magic. Someone who was making use of Abyss technology would surely have much more use for a few people who believe in fairies and weave straw into gold or do other things of that magnitude, than for a single uncontrollable demigod.

Broken even more so, of course.
