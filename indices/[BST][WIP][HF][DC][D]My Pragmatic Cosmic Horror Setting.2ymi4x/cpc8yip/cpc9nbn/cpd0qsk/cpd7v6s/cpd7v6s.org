In human society a Shuraheima generally ends up having whatever position it wants to adopt. They can effectively shapeshift to look however they want too, so the roles they can play as regards human beings can range from the monster that is the reason "here there be dragons" to some fae/fairy/witch/wizard like being in the woods you can go and ask favors of.

As a result you could probably make a case that Shuraheima themselves resemble many depictions of fairies, spirits and intelligent beasts/gods/giants/old wise ones from human myths and posit that they WERE REALLY THERE.

That said in setting the only Shuraheima that actually live as god kings among humans are viewed somewhat similar to a bum that likes to live among pidgeons.

It's a sign that particular individual is abjectly a failure in shuraheima society at large.

Shuraheima have their own society between themselves (mostly because their not delusional and also because it's somewhere they can do crazy things and discuss the universe without accidentally breaking a human), in which their roles and positions fill out an enormous breadth from business tycoons to simple 'laborers' (the labors they undertake are the kind that semi godlike beings are capable of, but over the breadth of the setting there are enough shuraheima to support personal heirarchies of wealth and power).

If you were to describe the Shuraheima as gods then the pantheon of the setting could be viewed as one that is dictated by the economics/exchange of their labors/time with one another.

The fates are literally dictated by a marketplace, not by anyone's grand plan.

On the nature of the abyss. It is in story terms a kind of abstraction of what dealing with life the universe and everything DOES to people. Sometimes life just breaks you, some times you hide from it. Sometimes you find yourself strong.

Sometimes you figure it out/are lucky and 'succeed'.

As that being the metaphor, the abyss in universe is utterly prevailant.

The entire universe IS the abyss and you cannot actually hide from it anywhere. it's sitting there waiting to be discovered and 'contacted' it's hiding beneath the fiction of your life waiting to be noticed.

the abyss is not 'seperate' the separate thing in the setting is the little story humans tell themselves inside their own heads.

After all we are talking COSMIC horror.

The abyss is what really is, the way people are used to dealing with things comfortably is the lie.
