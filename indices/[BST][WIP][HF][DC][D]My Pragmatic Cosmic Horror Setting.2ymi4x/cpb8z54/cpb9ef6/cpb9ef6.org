My expectation is that unless the people engineering the technology are high functioning broken or the more benign versions of the other groups It would be difficult to attain a population as high as humans have on modern day earth on single planet without really upping the population density. The existence of broken are liable to be known and protected against in SOME form, even if those protections are dictated from some kind of authority or by trial and error traditions.

Abyss contact is mostly a factor of lifestyle, personality and happenstance. It is relatively easy to induce intentionally but doing such has a lot of cultural discouragement.

In a similar way that one does not appreciate their fellows setting fire to their own house, signs of some one showing risks of inducing their own contact with the abyss are discouraged.

The degree to which there is actually a masqurade is more of a 'local flavor' for the setting and probably has a great deal to do with occurrences.

Likely no matter the degree to which the existence of the abyss is nominally "out" or not to the population at large I expect 0.1% touch rate is an idealized fantasy for most populations of humans and in particularily bad parts of the setting it can be as high as 5-10%. Much higher then that and it sort of cascades and the entire population can end up being triggered by the horrors of the rest changing.

Leads to messy messy situations, but potentially very valuable/useful broken may be able to be found in the wreckage after all the dust settles.
