While this seems interesting at first as I think about it more and more it seems like you would need so much hand waving and statements about "rudeness" that the world seems unreal and silly.

I'm desperately trying to think of ways to fix it but i'm not seeing very many. Perhaps what the main group (you should seriously change that name) doesn't create spell effects on the fly but has some way of constructing the spell effect in the abyss then using it, that would take out all the "stray thought" and "if they aren't careful" stuff which would destroy the universe long before anyone could do it on purpose and leave you with the creative stuff. Thinking about it that would make an interesting way for the other two groups to come into being, the dreamers (this is an ok name) stumbled onto a preexisting set of abilities that someone left behind using their personal style and the broken hit or accidently created a big pile of junk code. I also find the dreamer drawback really strange, if I can do fucking magic what are you going to show me that means i'm wrong about there being magic? When skeptics ask for proof, the ability to shoot lasers out of your dick and spit wormholes would pretty much do.
