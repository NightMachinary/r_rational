Hum, I actually put quite a bit of thought into how that word was being constructed, but I can understand the sentiment of not wanting to just use endless chains of foreign words.

The trouble is that at the same time you can end up with your story/setting full of descriptive nouns.

Not the most pleasant solution either.

I'm not sure that the Shuraheima name is actually in consistent circulation/use and I kind of want to fit several words to represent each type, from different cultures and linguistic roots. For example an entirely cliche description to give the Weavers or 'Awake' abyss touched is to just simply call them Wizards, Magi or Magisters.

Pretty bland really but it fits, however just as viable a name for any that meet one after it's done with the awkward decades of figuring out how to design and formulate their abilities might as well call the things gods, angels, demons or elementals.
