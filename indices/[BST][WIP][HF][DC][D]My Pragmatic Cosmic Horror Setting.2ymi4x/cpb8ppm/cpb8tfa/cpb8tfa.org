Hmmm I agree with you on the creative side of things, stray thought is a bad way to describe what they are supposed to do anyway. They are SUPPOSED to be about the ones that consciously control the nature of the abyss because they 'understand' it and can make it perform the acts they want.

It is a good distinction to make that they 'engineer' the spellworks before hand and then use them as needed.

The freedom/power they get as a result of their approach though is still a pretty solid part of the way the heirarchy settles.

Do you think keeping the process wholely and very strictly intentional/designed/engineered would really resolve the problems you had?

In the case of dreamers they don't precisely pick what the basis of the fiction that they explain their powers with is.

it is generally that they used their ability to get something that is not present in the world, They create a dream to blot out what is lost. The easiest example of this to take apart is the child who cannot believe anyone around them dies. So they animate and puppet the fallen around them. They make a very good effort of it. Their expending immense amounts of energy and no small amount of their own 'sub conscious' focus.

But the people that child is 'keeping alive' are still puppets. The child only can only manifest what they KNEW about the people before they died.

Prove to the child that he never successfully brought his parents back, or strain him to the point where he cannot maintain the puppets and you get the child suffering a second breaking.

It is not precisely easy, but it is ABSURDLY dangerous.
