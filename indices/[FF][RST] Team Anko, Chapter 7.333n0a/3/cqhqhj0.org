Interesting. Orochimaru is doing some very odd things. I don't know what level he's playing at, but I suspect his answer would be "one level higher than you."

Very nice of him to correct some of Naruto's taijutsu, regardless of purpose. Not sure about the earth jutsu. Was Hinata's affinity earth?

It seems that Orochimaru likes being a teacher. c: Too bad about the whole evil scientist thing.
