  Was Hinata's affinity earth?

No, she's Lightning and Fire. She doesn't do battlefield control -- not enough chakra and she's a close-range fighter. Naruto is the BFC on the team.

EDIT: They've actually got a good complement -- Hinata is close range, Shino is mid-range, Naruto is long-range, and Anko is free safety. Hinata provides perfect close-in spying and enemy detection (her Byakugan has a range of about fifty or sixty yards) all the time, Shino provides good mid-range enemy detection IF he's set it up in advance, and between the three of them they are aces at information gathering.
