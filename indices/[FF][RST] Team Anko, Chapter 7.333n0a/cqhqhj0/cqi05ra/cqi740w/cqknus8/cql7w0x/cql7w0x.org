Hm.

Helping Naruto prepare for Akatsuki, if they're in this fic? Endearing himself to his student's students? Endearing himself to the jinchuuruki of the Nine-Tails? To a relation of the Senju, IIRC? To a member of the main Hyuuga family? For use as a vector to Konoha? All of the above?

Yeah, I can't actually think of a reason why Orochimaru /wouldn't/ be a gracious benefactor to Team Anko.
