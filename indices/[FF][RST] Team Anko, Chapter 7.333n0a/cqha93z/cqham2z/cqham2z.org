#+begin_quote
  And is it possible for Naruto and co to just fly/jump really high
#+end_quote

Fly, no. Jump, yes. Higher for Naruto than the others, lowest for Hinata.

#+begin_quote
  to run away
#+end_quote

No. Jumping is a standard ninja travel mode in certain terrain. Whatever the team can do for traveling, the Sound nin can also do.

#+begin_quote
  and then flap/glide on some sort of chakra sheathed wings?
#+end_quote

No.

#+begin_quote
  How rational, rationalist and scientifically accurate will this new superhero story be?
#+end_quote

Respectively: very, where appropriate, as much as I can make it after you grant the existence of physics-defying superpowers

#+begin_quote
  Will there equal intelligent division so that everyone (and i mean everyone who has a reason to be involved) is allowed to be smart
#+end_quote

Yes.

#+begin_quote
  what's the scale of events
#+end_quote

Reply hazy, ask again later. Less than world-destroying, more than local.

#+begin_quote
  and how long will the story be?
#+end_quote

As currently envisioned, long. I have several novels worth of ideas. It depends on sales; I'm making a living on my writing now and can't afford too many non-profitable projects. Project Anko is the only thing I intend to do for free long-term.

#+begin_quote
  Also what mood, if any, will it be written in? Happy fun times,
#+end_quote

No.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Somewhat.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

No.

#+begin_quote
  interpersonal drama
#+end_quote

Somewhat.
