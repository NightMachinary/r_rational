Yeah, couldn't figure out how to make that work and I'm on my phone so it's irritating to experiment. (EDIT: Back on my laptop now, still couldn't make it work by having something before the linebreak. I'm not sure Reddit can actually do multi-line spoilers.)

As to when I'll start: I'm planning to wrap up Squiring the Phoenix soon--hopefully next chapter--and will be starting Currently Unnamed Superhero Story after that.

Note for those who missed it: chapters in CUSS...hm, that's actually an unfortunate acronym; hadn't realized when I wrote it. Ah well, it's amusing.

Anyway, chapters in CUSS will be given out for free via download link to people on my mailing list. A few days later the link will stop working and the chapter will only be available for purchase on Amazon. I would like to leave it permanently available to list members, but Amazon's TOS does not allow that.
