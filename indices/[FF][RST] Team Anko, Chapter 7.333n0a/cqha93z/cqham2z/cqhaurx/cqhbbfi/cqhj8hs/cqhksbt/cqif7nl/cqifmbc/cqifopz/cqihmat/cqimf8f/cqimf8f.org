*EVEN MORE WORM SPOILERS*

Taylor lost control over most people because Doormaker used up all the batteries on his power.

Taylor remembered that Zion had predicted everything using his version of the path to victory shard, but realised that Zion is stupid enough to be wrong about what he was seeing.

Zion was enacting the path to bringing back his partner the entire time. So Taylor threw Oliver at him. Oliver's power is to become the perfect image of beauty to whoever looks at him, so when Zion looked at him he turned into Zion's partner.

Zion realised he hadn't /actually/ managed to bring back his partner with his precog powers, only to find someone who /looked like/ her, and that the cycle was well and truly over with nothing he could do about it, and in his despair he destroyed himself.
