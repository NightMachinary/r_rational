Is it okay to marry people based on reddit comments? Because I think you earned my love with that post there.

All joking aside I am loving that you're going to avoid all the bad's of Worm.

I disagree with costume opinion though. What do you feed a 600 pound Gorilla? Anything it wants! What does a pyromancer wear? Anything it wants!

If anything supers should wear what's most comfortable to them and what they like. I don't know how you feel about requests, but please have at least one person in CUSS wear a snuggie with kevlar coating and bunny ears.
