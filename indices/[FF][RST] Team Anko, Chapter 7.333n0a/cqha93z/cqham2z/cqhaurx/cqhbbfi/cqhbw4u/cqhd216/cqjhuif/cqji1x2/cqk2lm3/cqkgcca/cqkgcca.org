  What uniform do you wear if you fight crime with superpowers? "Uhh... spandex!"
#+end_quote

I would really like to believe that everyone who thinks this:

1. Goes to the trouble to make the costume
2. Puts it on and looks in a mirror
3. Thinks "huh. I'm not 8 heads tall and built like an anatomy model (male) or supermodel with HH breast implants (female). I actually have body fat, and therefore do not meet the comic book standards for spandex."
4. Throw the spandex in the trash, buy some tactical gear and go to town.
