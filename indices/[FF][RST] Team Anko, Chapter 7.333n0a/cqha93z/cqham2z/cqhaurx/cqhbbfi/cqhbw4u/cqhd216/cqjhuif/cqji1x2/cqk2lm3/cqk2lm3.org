Role scripts.

People could take their special supernatural talents and map them into any reference frame---being a super-gambler, for instance, or a super-doctor, or even a super-inventor. Those sort of people don't wear costumes, but they also don't get in fights, or think of themselves as "super." They just have a savant-like ability to do something, and work that into their lives.

Some people, though, take a supernatural talent and map it into the reference frame of comic book narratives. They wear the spandex for the same reason they fight (or cause) the crime: because that's What You Do When You're In A Comic Book. Not because it's a /good/ idea, but because it's a /cached thought/. What uniform do you wear if you fight crime with superpowers? "Uhh... spandex!"

(Though this would suggest that the more epistemically-rational a character is, the less likely they are to decide to wear spandex on their own, because they know to look past the cached thought. Were there any particularly /epistemically/ rational characters in Worm? Like, the Luminosity!Bella kind of epistemically-rational. I don't remember any.)
