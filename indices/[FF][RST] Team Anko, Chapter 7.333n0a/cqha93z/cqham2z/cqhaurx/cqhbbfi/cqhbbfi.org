EDIT: On a phone, can't make multi-line spoilers work. Here be Worm spoilers.

  How similar would you say you plan it on being to Worm?

Pretty much not at all aside from "real world + superpowers". Worm was a groundbreaking work with some really interesting characters and ideas. It is justifiably popular and has (at least partially) spawned a new genre. It also had quite a few failings:

- Only Taylor was allowed to munchkin her powers
- Power creep was off the charts and fighting gods is boring
- The entire concept of super powered people putting on costumes to fight / commit crimes / stop crimes is ridiculous. See '[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutLexLuthorACheck][CutLexLuthorACheck]]' for why. Even if they DO decide to commit crimes, a brightly colored set of tights and broad daylight is just stupid compared to dark colors at night
- The only reason Wildbow could find to justify this stupid behavior was 'alien worms infest their brains and make them do stupid things' which is a narrative cheat of the highest order
- Many of the villains (esp. Slaughterhouse 9) were [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz][EvilForTheLulz]]
- Wildbow set up this interesting idea of parallel dimensions with parallel people, mentioned trade between them, and then never did a damn thing with that until literally the last few pages. The only place where parallel dimensions were really used was people-less evacuation points -- basically, glorified bomb shelters
- Wildbow established an interesting, articulate, inventive protagonist with a cool but not overwhelming power set that she used cleverly. He then turned her into a mute with a completely different and overwhelming power set and made her be the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne][OneTrueSavior]], the only person who could save the day against the final boss.
