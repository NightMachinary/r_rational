Denier as in person who denies things.

Okay no flying for Team Anko, how about digging, I'm sure Anko herself has some super duper earth digging techniques, and could be supercharged to dig on a much faster scale.

In fact that's what the railroad should be, a deep long line between Land of Tech (forgot name) and Land of Fire, heck teach Naruto building skills and you can economically pressure people to move in to your land via cheap buidlings.

Ok good to hear on the super story thing, will join the Google group.
