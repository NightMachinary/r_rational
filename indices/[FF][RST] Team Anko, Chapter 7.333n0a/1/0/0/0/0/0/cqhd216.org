  Is it okay to marry people based on reddit comments? Because I think you earned my love

It's absolutely fine, but I must politely refuse; I never marry online. ;>

And yes, supers CAN wear their underwear on the outside if they want, but who in their right mind would? Seriously, if you suddenly developed super powers and, for Dawkins knows what reason, decided to use them for crime...would YOU put on a brightly colored spandex costume? I doubt it very much.

  but please have at least one person in CUSS wear a snuggie with kevlar coating and bunny ears.

That is too hilarious not to do. It might just be a mention or a cameo, but I will make that happen.
