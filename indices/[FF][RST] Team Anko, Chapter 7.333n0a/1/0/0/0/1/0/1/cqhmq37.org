Yeah, agreed. There are definitely downsides to that kind of plot. And yeah there's power creep, and narrative cheats, and EvilForTheLulz is flat characterisation - but these things have their strengths too. Or maybe, they are the price paid for making other areas of the story better.

Fighting gods... if you're fully invested in the characters and plot by the time it happens, you don't worry about idiot balls and such, instead you cheer when the enemy makes an error. And the awesomeness of it makes everything better.

To summarise, I don't think it's a good idea to see them as failings. They're choices. And, if you choose to avoid them, you end up with a different story, not a better one.

Again though, if you're primarily worried about writing a rational story, it totally makes sense to see them as failings...
