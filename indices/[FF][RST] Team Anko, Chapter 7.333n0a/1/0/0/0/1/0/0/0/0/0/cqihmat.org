  that they didn't beat god. Taylor bullied him into commiting suicide.

Hm. You know, I actually don't remember how it ended -- by that point I was really just reading out of stubbornness.

What I remember is that Taylor took a power boost that she was explicitly told would probably do horrible things to her and, oh shocker, it did horrible things to her, including making her mute. She then got with Doormaker, grabbed control of every cape in existence and...did something. The next thing I remember was her getting shot-but-not-really and then ending up in Dimension X talking to her mirror universe mom.

What actually happened in between?
