  Fighting gods isn't boring, it's awesome.

Not wanting to get too tangled up in this, I'll just respond to this one item.

Fighting gods is boring, because there's only two stories that you can tell. The first goes like this:

1. God/heroes come to battle.
2. God holds the idiot ball and decides to toy with his opponents.
3. Heroes lose, lose, lose, lose, lose, lose, lose, WIN! Yay, heroes!

The second story you can tell goes like this:

1. God/heroes come to battle.
2. God wins.
