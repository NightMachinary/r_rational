Fair enough. I don't think that invalidates my point though -- there's two scenarios: either god (is an idiot / holds the idiot ball) so that the heroes have a chance, or he isn't / doesn't and the heroes lose more or less instantly.

Rationalfic or not, characters shouldn't be pointlessly stupid -- whether you call that 'their character' or 'carrying the idiot ball', it's still bad writing.[1] If the only way you can have a fight /not/ be a curbstomp is for one character to carry the idiot ball, then you need to find a way to write your story so that battle doesn't have to happen.

[1] The only time that I think you /can/ have a character be an idiot is if they're only there for comic relief. Even then, you really want to go lightly on that note.
