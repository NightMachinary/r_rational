(It suddenly occurs to me that maybe when you say failing, you mean that it fails to be a rationalfic. In that case, please ignore this)

Can you really call it a failing if it allows the story to grow in new interesting ways? Wildbow told a story that hadn't been told before, and if you 'fixed' all those issues (without growing the story in new and nontrivial ways), what you'd have left is something way less interesting.

Can you really call it a failing if a repair job doesn't make it better?

It's not power creep, it's a dramatic increase in scope. Fighting gods isn't boring, it's awesome. It's not a narrative cheat, it's a setting.\\
Horror story monsters are EvilForTheLulz, too. Does that mean horror stories are bad? No, it just means the story isn't about the villain.

As for Taylor's power, she really should have been a thinker 12 or something. She had a massively parallel brain - the real secret of the story is that she was overpowered all along, it just took her a while to figure it out.
