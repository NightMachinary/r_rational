Okay Orichimaru the plan Denier is so far the best character in this fic, possibly any Naruto fic ever, what with his friendly goody free technique baiting and problem solving. More of him please. And is it possible for Naruto and co to just fly/jump really high to run away, and then flap/glide on some sort of chakra sheathed wings?

Now for the other mater.

How rational, rationalist and scientifically accurate will this new superhero story be? Will there equal intelligent division so that everyone (and i mean everyone who has a reason to be involved) is allowed to be smart, what's the scale of events and how long will the story be? Also what mood, if any, will it be written in? Happy fun times, spy/inteligence thriller, grimdarkedgy, interpersonal drama or something else?
