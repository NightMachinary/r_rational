  Orochimaru controls Hinata's entire family and is responsible for her abuse.

This reminds me of a a crack theory I once had, back when Orochimaru was first introduced in canon as the BBEG, that he had been alive for hundreds of years already (being a master of disguise and having several ways of overcoming old age) and had mad-scientist-genetically-engineered the Sharingan into existence in order to one day possess it, in a very Dune-esque way. Itachi, also being a genius in his own way, found out about this through Secret Ancient Lore or something, murders the entire rest of his clan just to throw a wrench into Orochimaru's plans (because he really was that dangerous...) but at the very end, just can't bring himself to kill his younger brother. Racked with guilt, he manipulates Sasuke to the path of hatred and vengeance (probably to fast-track his training as an anti-Orochimaru measure) and then flees Leaf because they'd have his head if they ever caught him.

Upon hearing of Orochimaru's invasion of Leaf, Itachi shows up literally immediately afterwards, under the pretense of scouting out Naruto as a demon host, just to confirm Sasuke is safe...
