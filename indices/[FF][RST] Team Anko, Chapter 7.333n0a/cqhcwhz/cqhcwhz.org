Oh gods, Orochimaru is hilarious in this fic. He's just so friendly to them, despite essentially holding them hostage. Affably Evil villains are the best :D

As far as other comments go, I see yet another change from canon regarding how the Nine-Tailed Fox has been dealt with. Seems the 4th used the Reaper to grab the fox from across the village, instead of teleporting it elsewhere first as in canon. No mention of Tobi, but it could just be that wouldn't be known from observation.
