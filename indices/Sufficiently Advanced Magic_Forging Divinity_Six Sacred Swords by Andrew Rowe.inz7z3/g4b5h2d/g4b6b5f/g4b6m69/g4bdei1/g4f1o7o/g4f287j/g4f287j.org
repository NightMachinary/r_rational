I think looking at his overall grades actually supports my point, since you can see that his performance varies drastically from class to class, and his overall grade is a 'B', which isn't exactly exceptional.

Moreover, the classes themselves demonstrate that intelligence isn't the primary factor in grades. Corin's highest grade comes from mana manipulation, which is a result of repeated practice of a very specific skill set and having two attunements with synergistic power sets, not intelligence. He also has classes that relate to other things entirely, like Physical Combat.
