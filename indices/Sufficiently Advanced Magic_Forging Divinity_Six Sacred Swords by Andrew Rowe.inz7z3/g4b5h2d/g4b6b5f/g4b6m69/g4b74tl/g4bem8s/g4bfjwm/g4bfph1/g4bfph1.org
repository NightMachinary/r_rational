The audio always takes a bit longer than the other formats, since the narrator can't start recording until the book's text is finalized, the narrator has to find time, and production (editing, etc.) always takes some time. We definitely want the audio out as quickly as possible after the Kindle format, but it's probably going to be at least a few more months.
