  That is, we're told he is intelligent, but he's only as intelligent as the plot requires, and often the plot requires that he be dumb and ignorant.

Was he supposed to be intelligent? lol. I don't actually remember even being told he was intelligent and he certainly didn't do anything that could be called clever. He had a magic specialization that should have been geared towards planning ahead and preparing enchanted items for expected future difficulties... and he never really used it. The many fights and challenges he faced all appeared to be surprises to him, and he managed wins through luck and some vague amount of combat savviness, not through any actual insight or thinking or planning.

Anyway, not sure I need to say so much just to agree with you. It annoyed me how little the main character seemed to be engaged in actual thought or any real effort to solve the challenges he faced is all.
