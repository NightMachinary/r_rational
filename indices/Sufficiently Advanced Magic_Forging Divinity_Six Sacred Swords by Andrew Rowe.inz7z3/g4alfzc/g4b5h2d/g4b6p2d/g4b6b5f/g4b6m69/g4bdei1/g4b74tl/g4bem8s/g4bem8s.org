Author here!

If you didn't like the first book, you probably won't like the rest, either.

That said, a few quick replies.

  Was he supposed to be intelligent? lol. I don't actually remember even being told he was intelligent and he certainly didn't do anything that could be called clever.

He's never called intelligent in the book.

He's supposed to demonstrate very specific forms of intelligence, while showing gaps in other areas. In terms of "cleverness", that's really very subjective. More on that in this article.

Most of Corin's moves that I would consider "clever" are small, subtle things, like:

- Taking the time to loot some of the apparent attunement-granting water from the last room of the Judgment
- Taking notes in areas where he suspects his memory may be wiped later
- Designing an item specifically to measure safe mana capacity to work around his own fear of overusing his mental mana
- Deliberately overloading Jin's shield sigil to make it explode
- Figuring out how Derek's compulsion works and forcing him to recite the plot to a novel series while fighting
- Etc.

Because they're being presented to the reader in a constrained narrative with foreshadowing, they may seem extremely obvious. That's one of the dangers of writing with a lot of foreshadowing: it's harder to make specific points come across as clever for a protagonist when they've already been advertised as being possible.

That said, these things were largely written because of how many books where they /don't/ happen. I've read hundreds of magic systems with serious costs for mana overuse, but I can't recall a single instance of another character inventing a mana watch to measure their mana and prevent them from going beyond safe values, even if there are plenty of other stories where that /would/ have been relevant.

I hope that makes sense.

  He had a magic specialization that should have been geared towards planning ahead and preparing enchanted items for expected future difficulties... and he never really used it.
#+end_quote

The opening line of the book is, "It was the day of my Judgment, and I was prepared in a thousand ways that didn't matter."

This is a major theme for Corin: his specialized preparation for his Judgment was essentially useless (his father was really just abusing him), leaving him with a risk-averse mentality. His response to this early on is to focus on enchantments that are almost exclusively generalized rather than specialized and defensive in nature.

For this reason, most of his enchantments in the first book are things that are either designed to solve his personal problems that are keeping him from more enchanting, like the mana watch<! or items like >!improved shield sigils for his entire group, which are generally useful in virtually any situation.

He's also extremely resource starved and doesn't really know what he's doing yet. He does a /lot/ more enchanting in the second book, but it's still mostly general-purpose enchantments, rather than situational ones.

  The many fights and challenges he faced all appeared to be surprises to him, and he managed wins through luck and some vague amount of combat savviness, not through any actual insight or thinking or planning.
#+end_quote

I suspect that part of the issue here is that you were expecting a character with a focus on situational preparation: that isn't Corin, for the reasons I stated above. He tends to build his enchantments for the possibility that /anything/ could go wrong, then rapidly adapt his combat tactics based on what happens. He builds his skill set more clearly in this direction in the sequel.
