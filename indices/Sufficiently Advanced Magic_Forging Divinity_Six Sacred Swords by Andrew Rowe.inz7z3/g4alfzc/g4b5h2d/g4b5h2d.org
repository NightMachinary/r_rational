I read the first book, was not impressed. All the beats felt very predictable. Better writing than most litrpg I guess, but by the numbers plot, a setting full of recycled tropes, and one dimensional characterization. Somehow he managed to make the typical magic school plot/setting even more banal than usual.

I would have kept reading despite all that but the magic system felt boring and uninspired.

How's the second book?
