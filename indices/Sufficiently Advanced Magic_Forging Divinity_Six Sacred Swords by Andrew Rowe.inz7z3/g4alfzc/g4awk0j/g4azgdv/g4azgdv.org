I don't remember where the comment was stated, but I asked this to Andrew once and he said that it would possibly be 7-8 books in the Arcane Ascension series alone. It's definitely not going to end as a trilogy at the very least though.

He also said that there is a possibility of more series and books set in this setting beyond the three series we have now.
