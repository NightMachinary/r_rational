It is hard fantasy which /can be/ rational adjacent, but my main problem WRT to this being rational is that the MC felt... conveniently intelligent. That is, we're told he is intelligent, but he's only as intelligent as the plot requires, and often the plot requires that he be dumb and ignorant. Inexplicably ignorant for a highly motivated "smart" noble in this setting, but very handy for exposition dumps. Not satisfying at all.
