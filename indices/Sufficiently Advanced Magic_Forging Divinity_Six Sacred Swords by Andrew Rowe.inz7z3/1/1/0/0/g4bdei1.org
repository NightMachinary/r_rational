Author here!

If you didn't like the first book, you probably won't like the second.

That said, I'll respond to a few things.

  That is, we're told he is intelligent

Corin is never referred to as intelligent anywhere in the text. He's written to have some very specific forms of intelligence (lateral thinking, visual memory, rapid arithmetic), while demonstrating gaps in other areas (interpersonal intelligence, linguistic intelligence, memory for any subject that disinterests him). This is how I write characters in general: I prefer characters with intellectual specializations, rather than just being generally "brilliant" all-arounders. More on that in [[https://andrewkrowe.wordpress.com/2018/12/08/writing-intelligent-characters/][this article]].

  he's only as intelligent as the plot requires, and often the plot requires that he be dumb and ignorant.
#+end_quote

The gaps in Corin's education are explained in the novel. He was pulled out of school years before the story starts by his abusive father, who 'trained' him exclusively in dueling, to the exclusion of his normal education.

Moreover, some of the things that he "learns" aren't actually new to him, but rather Corin narrating things for the benefit of Keras, a foreigner from a continent with a different magic system, who is part of the audience in the frame story.

#+begin_quote
  Inexplicably ignorant for a highly motivated "smart" noble in this setting, but very handy for exposition dumps.
#+end_quote

Corin is behind in his education due to being pulled out of school years earlier, the victim of years of abuse, and not neurotypical.

I recognize that these elements did not come through to all readers clearly enough in the first book, and the second book makes some of them much more apparent, especially that Corin was physically abused, his lack of education, and that he is explaining certain things for the benefit of a foreigner in the frame story.

All that being said, if you didn't like the overall style of the first book, you will very likely dislike the second book as well. Corin's way of thinking is deliberately very specialized, and if you don't like his style of thought process, you probably won't like anything where he's the narrator.
