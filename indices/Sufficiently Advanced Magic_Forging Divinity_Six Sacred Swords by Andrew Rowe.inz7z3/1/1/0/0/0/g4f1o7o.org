It's mentioned a few times that he's in the top 200ish in his division out of ~1500, so I would call that implicit mentions of his intelligence, even if other characters don't directly state it. At various other points he's shown that he does very well compared to other students, top 10% or so. I would characterize it as the author saying he's intelligent even if the characters don't.

Admittedly, he probably spends a lot more time doing school stuff compared to other students who probably have things like active social lives and/or hobbies, and school is hardly a perfect measure of intelligence.
