It's been over 2 years since I last read the books and I can't remember the details too well so take what I say with a grain of salt.

I think there was a good chunk of character growth for Corin due to meeting his brother/family drama, the magic system is fleshed out more but not too much more, and there's a lot of detective work in finding out other people's secrets. He's also prepping for the final school exam too. A lot of stuff in the first book ended up being set up for the second book to take advantage of.

The final exam trope got subverted in a very interesting way. So it's not a repeat of the first book's midterm exam.

I'd say that Andrew has avoided the common issue of the second book slump and that it's better than the first book, but if you didn't like the first book, then I can't recommend the second book either.

Sorry if my comment's a bit disjointed. I just typed out anything I could think of to answer your question.
