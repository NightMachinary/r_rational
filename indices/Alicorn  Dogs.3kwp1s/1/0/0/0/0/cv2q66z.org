that only really works because the animals still have built in death clocks. It does indeed change the formula but if we were mapping this kind of 'kindness' the 'civil' thing to do in this scenario is no longer allow access to body upgrades or immortality serums or uploading unless you submit to certain alterations of your mental architecture so that you can be properly 'aware and capable of performing the necessary actions'.

Letting that particular trend continue with more and more complex and diverse entities of mind means no human ultimately is allowed to exist that even necessarily resembles us because that would be 'too cruel'.
