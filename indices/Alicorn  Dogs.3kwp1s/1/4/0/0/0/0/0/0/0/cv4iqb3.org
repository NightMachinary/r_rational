    Look, if dogs have anything to teach us that we would consider good, it's part of our CEV even if they never existed.

  You've completely lost me here.

I'm confused how I can lose you there, of all places. It's pretty much [[http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Coherent_Extrapolated_Volition][the definition of CEV]]. If there is something good we could have learned along the way, it's part of our CEV. Note the "could have": if you actually need to have the things around in order to learn from them, you can't calculate the CEV because there's good advice which doesn't happen to be personified on Earth. If [] have admirable traits which we should want to include in the future, we should include those traits in the future regardless of whether [] is a species which actually exists.

  That is an unlikely outcome.
#+end_quote

It's an example. Are you trying to be difficult?

#+begin_quote
  Hell, you can't find that consistent a goal set even among humans.

CEV. Show a fascist that the best world is one without nations everywhere (assuming this is indeed the case), and I would expect them to acquiesce.

#+begin_quote
  Are you suggesting that we should work towards that kind of uniformity?
#+end_quote

Overeager reductionism. Just because all atoms are part of one computer, doesn't mean that all atoms are identical, in spite of having the property "part of computer". Human preferences not being uniform or otherwise heavily externally optimised appears to be part of the CEV.

But sure, let's run with that, suppose dogs wanted everyone to be morally uniform. Wouldn't that be horrible to make part of the Terran future? Shouldn't we just ignore them and let everyone be free? Wouldn't that dissatisfy the dogs, because those damn humans are wasting their resources on individuality and a tolerance for moral error? Wouldn't we be sad that the dogs were dissatisfied, given our capacity for empathy? Wouldn't this be a strictly worse world than one where the dogs (sapient and modified or just modified or neither) are happy, we are happy, and there never was a conflict of interest between sapient creatures because we didn't blindly upload an alien species or force a living creature to change its morality.
