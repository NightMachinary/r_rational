That is an unlikely outcome. Hell, you can't find that consistent a goal set even among humans. Are you suggesting that we should work towards that kind of uniformity? That's kind of creepy, to be honest.

Also, that kind of reasoning leads to conclusions like "we have to eliminate all alien life forms just in case they value our destruction".

Not to mention killing AI researchers, just in case.
