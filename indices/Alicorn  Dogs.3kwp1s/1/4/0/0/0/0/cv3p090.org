I'd start with uplifting humans.

I'd want to uplift dogs as part of that process, because I suspect we can /benefit/ from bringing dog sensibilities into our social structures. The wild animals most like us, outside of the primates, are probably wolves, and dogs are are already partway between wolves and humans.

The end point of the uplift process is going to be a pan-terrestrial species, some of whom are descended from humans, others from dogs, others from otters and dolphins and bonobos and hyenas and who knows... whose lives and inheritance are mediated through silicon (or some descendant computational substrate) as much as carbon, by data as much as DNA. Throwing out those viewpoints the way the society in this story did is self-destructive.
