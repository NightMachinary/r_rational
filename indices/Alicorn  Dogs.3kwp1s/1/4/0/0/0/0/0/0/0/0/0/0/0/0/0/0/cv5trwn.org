  Replace 'good' with '(identifiably) better', and it works.
#+end_quote

You can replace "good" with "potentially interesting" or any other words, and it still doesn't work. If it's something we "could have learned" on the way, but we took a path that prevented us from learning it, it's not going to happen.

Not implied. We are talking about a story in which that happened. I am objecting to the society in which that happened. You are objecting to my objection. It doesn't matter if you're doing it because you approve of the society or because you think my argument is wrong on any other grounds... I am not attacking you, I am supporting my argument.

  Other than low-level fuss (people liking a dog or not liking any, people knowing they like dogs or not knowing it)
#+end_quote

That's kind of a big thing.

#+begin_quote
  How else would you uplift a dog? Graft chunks of a human brain into it?
#+end_quote

That's one of the more commonly proposed techniques, yes (albeit usually expressed less crudely). There's a lot of common mammalian biology that might make that possible.

#+begin_quote
  I would hardly call it a dog at that point.
#+end_quote

How about a human with biological or cybernetic enhancements. Would you call that human any more?
