  If there is something good we could have learned along the way, it's part of our CEV.

The very link that you pointed me to contradicts that. There's no proof that CEV converges. The path we take is certain to change what it converges into even if it does converge. Taking irreversible actions (like exterminating a species) are definitely going to change it.

Neither of those are implied by "the power to uplift a species".
