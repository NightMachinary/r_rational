I think you're working with axioms that are fundamentally different from mine. For example, I see the Less Wrong terminology and techniques as a potentially useful tool, but they're not axioms for me. You seem to accept them as solid as bedrock. The way you're talking about CEV you might as well be saying "Manifest Destiny" or talking about Clotho, Lachesis, and Atropos.
