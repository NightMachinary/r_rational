Would you have a moral obligation to uplift bacteria if you could? Or insects, spiders, fish, sharks, hyenas, etc.?

Dogs are probably moral aliens. If we uplift them, they will either live as second class citizens in a universe not built for their CEV, or we waste entire galaxies, containing quadrillions of human life-years worth of resources, on stupid, wasteful dog projects.
