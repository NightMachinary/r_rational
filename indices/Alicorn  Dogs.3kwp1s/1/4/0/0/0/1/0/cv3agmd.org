FWIW, I would be more comfortable with baseline dogs, especially if we're assigning massive amounts of resources to each person. They can be engineered not to suffer needlessly, and otherwise optimised, but I don't know if dogs want to be smarter^{1} , or even if they did, if the consequences of satisfying that desire (redistribution of resources to honour their wishes, potential moral incapability, etc.) would make the decision a net positive. Meanwhile, a reasonably happy and non-suffering pet seems like a very good use of resources, especially in meatspace where they cost less than a static house.

Meanwhile, would an uplifted dog be what you want for yourself? Keeping their subservience through the uplifting process makes /me/ uncomfortable, but without it would they want to play fetch, learn tricks, shower you with affection, etc.? It seems to me that a large part of the reason of having dogs rather than more/slightly wealthier humans is lost when uplifting them.

It's ridiculously unlikely a priori, and while I agree that your arguments constitute evidence, I don't think it's enough. House elves, shpexish obsession with territory or hierarchy, or other failure modes may still exist.

  This view of ... flaw in CEV.

True moral disagreement seems to me to be the most fundamental possible disagreement on distribution of resources. Let go of that, and what basis do we have to do anything the way we like?

  Dogs easily ... integrate them.

Probably agreed without uploading (see above), but with uploading I doubt they'll fill their former niche.
