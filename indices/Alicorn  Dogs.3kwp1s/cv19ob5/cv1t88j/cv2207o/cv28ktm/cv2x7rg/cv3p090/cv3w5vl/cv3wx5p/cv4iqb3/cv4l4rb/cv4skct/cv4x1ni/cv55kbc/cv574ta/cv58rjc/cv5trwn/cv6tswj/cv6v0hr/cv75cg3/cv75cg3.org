  This is the bit where I go "you believe in magic".

And that is a dumb attitude. You're not giving any information other than your incredulity and possibly your insecurity about your ignorance.

For the record, it's simple reductionism. People can act like independent moral entities - they don't need to talk to people to come to a judgment - so they contain a complete set of moral processing. Everything else they receive as information from the environment, which is part of 'knowledge'. Humans run on physics, so the moral processing is complete, between knowledge and the brain that processes it.

If you believe you don't know the answer, you will make a decision in ignorance, potentially to refer to a (real) friend for guidance. The problem where you remember your friend's answer is a separate one with a different state of knowledge, with a different resulting choice. The problem where you remember trying to contact your friend, but having them not be available, is another one. You may also want to include dogs in your decision, which results in strategies of trying to probe dogs, and then strategies where you know the dogs' minds, which are therefore occasionally different than if you didn't know the dogs' minds.

  Language is probably not in the frontal cortex.

Good thing I didn't mention language, then.
