And then it turns out dogs prefer the glory of the pack over the happiness of the individual or the species in their CEV, and you have to either commit genocide on them, deny them their truest desires for the entire future of their race, or watch them fight and hurt one another for the entire future of both your races.

Look, if dogs have anything to teach us that we would consider good, it's part of our CEV even if they never existed. We don't need to uplift them to learn from them, they don't even need to have existed for us to learn what we would have learned from them, if we're doing our jobs properly in figuring out the CEV.

So no, their extinction of all animal life on Earth is no more self-destructive than not reading Arabic scholars' works on physics. If you're actually trying to succeed, you can easily surpass their efforts by directing your attention elsewhere.
