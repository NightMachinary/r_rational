  Dogs are probably moral aliens.
#+end_quote

You're joking, right? /Wolves/ might be somewhat alien to us, even though they actually are social mammals, which is already pretty close on a universal scale. /Dogs/ were bred, trained, and bred again to conform to /our/ social expectations of them.

#+begin_quote
  If we uplift them, they will either live as second class citizens in a universe not built for their CEV, or we waste entire galaxies, containing quadrillions of human life-years worth of resources, on stupid, wasteful dog projects.
#+end_quote

This view of even morality itself as a fundamentally alienating and oppositional project is a major flaw in CEV. Dogs easily form part of the social community of humanity and which humanity cares about, so there's basically no cost to integrate them.
