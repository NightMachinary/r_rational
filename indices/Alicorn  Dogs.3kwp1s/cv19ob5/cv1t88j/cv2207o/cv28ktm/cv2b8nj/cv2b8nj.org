I don't think any of the real suffering reducers advocate stubbed toe type utilitarianism. Brian Tomasik is one of the prominent suffering reducers and leaning towards negative utilitarianism and he mainly argues that negative utilitarianism is justified in the case of extreme suffering like getting fried to death in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazen_bull][brazen bull]]. That type of suffering might be so bad that it would be better to not have been born and it would require very large amount of happy experiences to outweigh it.

  There's at least one threshold of suffering (and maybe more) such that if someone suffers more intensely than that threshold, that suffering is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographic_preferences][lexigally]] worse than any amount of suffering less intense than the threshold.
