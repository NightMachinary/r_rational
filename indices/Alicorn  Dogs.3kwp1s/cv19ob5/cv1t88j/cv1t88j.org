I am going to find whoever did that. And I am going to rip them limb from limb, and pulverize them into little pieces. And the whole time, the only fucking thing they are going to hear will be: THIS IS FOR LUCKY YOU EVIL SONS OF BITCHES!

Because Lucky had an anxiety disorder her whole life - she was paranoid and sometimes stupid and she would lash out and bite, and my mother believed in /dominance hierarchies/ and that probably just /made it worse/ - and I would have given a whole hell of a lot to be able to just /talk/ to her and find out how to make her ok.
