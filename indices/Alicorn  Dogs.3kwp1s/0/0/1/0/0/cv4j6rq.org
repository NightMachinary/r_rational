I was off guard only because [[/u/ulyssessword]] seemed to be classifying Dogs as horror, and since Dogs didn't bother me at all, I assumed Muse wouldn't either.

Also, I found Muse by looking at the [[http://alicorn.elcenia.com/stories/][index page]], not the [[http://alicorn.elcenia.com/stories/stories.shtml][stories page]], and so I didn't realize that you yourself had designated it horror. I see now that you did not classify Dogs the same way (which I think is appropriate).

Normally I enjoy horror, and [[#s][]] doesn't really bother me. But Muse hit me on a very personal level, because I feel [[#s][]] on a regular basis.

It was a great story, regardless.
