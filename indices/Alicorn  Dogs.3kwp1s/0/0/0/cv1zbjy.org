This one, Muse, some of Radiance, and maybe Explorers are the ones that I was thinking of. I'm sure that Grownups would qualify for someone else's ideas of what is horrifying.

I should probably get around to reading the rest of the short stories, and maybe the long ones too. I know that there's a selection bias at play, but 7/7 good stories so far should be enough to go off of.
