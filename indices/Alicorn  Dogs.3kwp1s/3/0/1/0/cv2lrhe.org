The "dogs are real dogs" and the "there are no real dogs" twists weren't the twist. There's lots of SFnal backgrounds where coming across real dogs would be surprising (Niven's "Svetz" stories, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, some of Asimov's futures) without it being due to a bunch of idiot negative utility freaks with no imagination.
