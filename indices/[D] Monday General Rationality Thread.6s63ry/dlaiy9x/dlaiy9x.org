Found this on [[/r/webgames]] the other day- it's basically an instructional tool for Game Theory, specifically Prisoner's Dilemma. While those who are already familiar with the concept will find the first ten minutes of this half hour experience to be nothing new, the tool takes it in interesting directions.

First, it introduces specific personalities, who will always behave certain ways given certain stimuli. Then, it introduces repeated games, tournaments with elimination, and even more personalities. Toward the end, there's even a sandbox tool where you can tweak all the the particulars of the dilemma itself, the personalities involved, and the tournament.

If you've got a half hour to kill, I highly recommend it. Even as someone who has taken a uni course in Game Theory, I got something out of it.
