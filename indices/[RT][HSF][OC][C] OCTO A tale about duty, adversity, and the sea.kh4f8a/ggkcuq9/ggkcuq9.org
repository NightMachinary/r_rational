I'm at the halfway point, and I'm really enjoying this.

Some notes so far:

- I like how the alien thinks in an alien way. After encountering way too many rubber-forehead aliens, something truly inhuman is a nice change.
- The foreshadowing has been great; I loved how it was set up almost immediately that this was Earth, although I didn't realize the exact time period until the K-T impact. I'm really looking forward to seeing what the simulation foreshadowing is about.
- The scene from the POV of the cat was amazing, especially the mouseover meow text. I wonder if there's other stuff like that that I've overlooked.
- The text messages bring the narrative to a *dead halt*. Like, seriously, I am reading at a lovely clip, and I hit one of those blocks (I'm currently writing this while waiting for the second block to populate itself), and it's the most frustrating thing ever. There needs to be a FF button on those or something.

Apart from that minor frustration, and the fact that it is now time for me to get some sleep, this has been awesome. Great job!
