Then this needs to be rewritten:

  It was a probabilistic process. The larger the wormhole, the less precise the placement would be.

  Luckily, *for the protector's ends*, that was more than sufficient.

  Smaller wormholes opened up near the satellites, each barely large enough for a few grams of matter to come through.

  The primary thread sent through enough of the exotic matter from the gas giant for their orbiting facilities to begin opening larger wormholes.

  The first one was only a few light-minutes away *in the wrong direction*.

  The next one was *far closer to the mark*. It was near enough to this system's primary star that its corona began to peel away, pulled by the massive gravitational force on the other side of the wormhole.

  Then, another one opened. Then another.

  The solar system began to be honeycombed with openings in space itself leading directly into the black hole where the protector had discovered the awful truth.

This suggests, from an omniscient viewpoint, that "for the protector's ends," having the wormhole further from the star is "in the wrong direction" and that "the mark" being aimed for is the Sun itself.
