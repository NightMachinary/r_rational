Ahh, good catch.

I have a few thoughts on how to patch it, but I have to cop to this being a bug.

Best handwave I currently have is they /were/ aiming for the Sun, but not /just/ the Sun-- other stars too, feeding the black hole and increasing the gravitational fields emanating from the wormhole mouths.

Edit: I added a couple of lines to hopefully hotfix this for now.
