This is a philosophical question pretty near and dear to this sub's heart. Only read next spoiler if you're comfortable with knowing my take on it.

The mental definition of "alive" Danielle was using-- "Can I see my wife again? Can I pet my cat and eat my mom's world famous porkless roast again? Can I still do stuff in the real world? Will I be able to breathe, laugh, run in a stream again?"-- is the one the process was responding to, and the answers to those questions are all "yes." It's not so much a lie as an issue with definitions-- a conceptual gap.
