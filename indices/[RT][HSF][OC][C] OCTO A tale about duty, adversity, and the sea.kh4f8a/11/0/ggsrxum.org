Thank you for reading! If you mean a digital offline copy, that should be straightforward due to the simple HTML and lack of external dependencies. If you mean a hard copy, I'm planning to self-publish sometime next year depending how long The Edit takes me. (In addition to working on the pacing issues people have pointed out, I also need to figure out how I'd like some gimmicks to translate to the page.)

(I ought to add a permissive license to the site, but so you know, you have my permission to copy/share/create derivative works so long as you credit me and link back to the site. üêô‚ù§Ô∏è)
