I will certainly cop to that. OCTO was actually a NaNoWriMo project gone awry-- I didn't stop at the end of November and was quickly approaching the 50 chapter mark releasing them on a daily basis.

I'm planning to self-publish next year (more to have a copy on my own bookshelf than anything else), and I think a good chunk of The Edit will entail condensing the first ten chapters and expanding the last ten.

Thank you so much for reading.
