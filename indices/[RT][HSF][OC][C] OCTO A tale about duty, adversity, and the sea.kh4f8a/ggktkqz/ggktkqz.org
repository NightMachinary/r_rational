I like this a lot- not done reading yet, but It's a shame the president holds the idiot ball in such a hackneyed way. Maybe it's deliberate, and the cartoonish president and higher ups are part of the simulation (assuming it's humans on the outside running a simulation?), but it's just annoying. The humans are fucked, anyway- they don't need to be gimped by a cartoon bureaucracy. It would be more interesting to see them do everything (mostly) right, have competent organizations and leaders, and lose anyway. I'm not so interested in watching viewpoint characters get angry at strawmen, and I feel it weakens the work.

Still, I like it a lot. Binging it right now, might come back with my thoughts when I'm done.

edit: Okay, guess there's more to it.

edit 2: Done. Pretty good, though the ending seemed a little rushed.
