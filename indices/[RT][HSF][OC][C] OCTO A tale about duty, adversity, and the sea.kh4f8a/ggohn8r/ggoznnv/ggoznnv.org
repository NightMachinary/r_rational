Thank you so much for reading and for the detailed feedback! No, really, this is gold and I'll be coming back to it when I give OCTO *The Edit* for print. As you said, many of the questions you had were answered in the text, but there's a lot I could make clearer.

I just want to be sure, did you stick around after the end of the universe in chapter 50?

(Also, I'm beyond delighted with your speculation about the simulation, haha.)
