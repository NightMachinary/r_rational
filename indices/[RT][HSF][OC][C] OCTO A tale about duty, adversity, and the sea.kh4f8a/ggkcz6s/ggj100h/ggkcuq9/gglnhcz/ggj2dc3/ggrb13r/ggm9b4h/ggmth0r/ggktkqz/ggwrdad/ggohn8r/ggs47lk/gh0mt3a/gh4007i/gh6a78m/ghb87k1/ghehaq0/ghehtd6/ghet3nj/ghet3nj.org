I'm glad you enjoyed it and found it readable enough to binge. As far as the America-centricity, that was mostly to do with the fact that [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorProvincialism][I'm American]] and I wrote OCTO in one chapter-a-day push starting in late October.

I'll also note that while the MC encounters /an/ ocean trench at one point in the story, it is not explicitly the /Mariana/ trench, and hundreds of millions of years pass between that point and the events of the second act.
