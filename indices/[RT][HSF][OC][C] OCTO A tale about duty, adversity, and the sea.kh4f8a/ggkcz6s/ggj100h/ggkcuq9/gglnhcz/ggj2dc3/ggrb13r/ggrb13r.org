Just finished. This is probably my favorite complete work I've read from this sub since Cordyceps, and edges up towards Worth the Candle for absolute favorite. I agree with the other commenters that the pacing could stand some work, but the author's already said they're going to rejigger that. I'm looking forward to re-reading it once that's done; like many of the works mentioned below, this one lends itself to coming back for seconds.

Here is a brief list of works this reminds me of:

- 17776: The Future of Football, for the clever use of text gimmicks & broad scope

- Cordyceps: Too Clever By Half, for the use of cognitohazards & mystery elements

- Ra, for the complicated multiversal sci-fi shenanigans

- The Commonwealth Saga by Peter F. Hamilton, for the portrayal of believably nonhuman intellects (specifically, much of Octo's early explorations on Earth reminded me of MorningLightMountain's introduction in Commonwealth Book 1)

All of those are favorable comparisons to works I love. If anyone is on the fence about diving into this, I hope this comment can convince you--I really had an absolute blast reading it, start to finish. ZAB, I hope you write more stuff & post it here.
