  but that seemed intentional and part of the fun.

Definitely intentional. This section was one of the first both set on Earth and not narrated by MC, this time set from a third-person omniscient perspective. Soon after this, I stopped milking this aspect of the xenofiction angle as I introduced other characters and set up the second act's conflict.

I'm sorry about the contrast issues. :\ I've been using Google Chrome's lighthouse mode to try and do the best I can from a readability/accessibility standpoint, but I think nothing short of a full night mode/day mode toggle implementation will make it perfect for everyone... and that would now entail going back and untangling my messy CSS, gah.

I hear you, I'm sorry, and I'll take a look at it later to try and see if I can do anything to improve the experience for everyone. (For what it's worth I use [[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dark-reader/eimadpbcbfnmbkopoojfekhnkhdbieeh][this extension]] for most sites and I think it has a contrast slider that might clobber things a little less?)
