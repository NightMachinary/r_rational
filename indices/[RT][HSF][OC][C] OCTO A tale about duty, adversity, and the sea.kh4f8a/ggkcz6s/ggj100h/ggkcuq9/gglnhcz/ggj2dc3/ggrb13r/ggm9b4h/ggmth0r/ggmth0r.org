I'm on chapter 10. This is very good.

My current predictions:

- Since chapter one: The planet MC has landed on is Earth. This seems all but confirmed by now.

- Since chapter one: The Library is DNA-esque---but since MC makes no such comparisons, they either don't know what DNA is and in for a big surprise when they figure it out, or consider the Library to be black box-ish. In the latter case, the Library can have some negative side effects we are yet to find out.

- Since chapter ten: MC is literally Cthulhu. Dwells at the bottom of the ocean and whispers things into the land creatures' minds. Also, you know, /octo/.

No thoughts about the traitor yet. I have a strong feeling that it turns out that the traitor has indeed uncovered something terrible that would make the MC's entire journey pointless, but I really hope it's not the case. The best subversion would be that the traitor was infected by a virus or gone mad, or something like that. Making the conflict uncomplicated and sides clear would be the biggest twist I could've possibly imagined.

I'll try to comment every ten chapters in replies.
