Nothing to report about chapters 20-30, to be honest.

*Chapter 31*:

Wow, that's one uncomfortable rendition. I've heard many variations of that music, but this one /really/ fits the tone---which means it sounds /horrifying/. Also,

was perfectly timed with the song playing faster for me. I also like to include music in my fiction, and I know how hard it is to line it up. Awesome job.

*Chapter 36:*

#+begin_quote
  "WHAT."
#+end_quote

WHAT.

*Chapter 37:*

Ok, I haven't yet completed the chapter, but galaxy brain prediction time: The entity connecting to Tom is the traitor, who is not present on Earth physically but devised a scheme to exert an influence on it either way.

Ok, now I have completed the chapter, and yeah, now I'm 95% certain it's the traitor who told Tom how to make the Flaming Sword.

*Chapter 38:*

Ooooh, antimemetics. Spicy. I love me some spice.

*Chapter 39:*

....pretty....

Oh wow, of all the ways MC would have started communications with humans, I haven't imagined /that/ one as a possibility. Wow. Also, they lied, right? Daniella /is/ dead. I didn't know MC could lie.

*Chapter 40:*

  Anyone notice how SOME """people""" dont seem thankful at all that Hierophant-Infinite Peters just uhhh SAVED THE WORLD??? COME ON!! #FGOGTGB!!
#+end_quote

Shouldn't it be... you know... "(((people)))" instead?

WAIT HOLY SHIT

WAITWAITWAIT

The president is Tom???? My galaxy-brain take was not /nearly/ galaxy-brain enough. I /should/ have figured it out when he began spurting shit about God. Though to be fair, I thought it was close-to-real-life satire. I somehow got caught into a reverse Poe's Law.

I'm glad Danielle doesn't hold grudges. :')
