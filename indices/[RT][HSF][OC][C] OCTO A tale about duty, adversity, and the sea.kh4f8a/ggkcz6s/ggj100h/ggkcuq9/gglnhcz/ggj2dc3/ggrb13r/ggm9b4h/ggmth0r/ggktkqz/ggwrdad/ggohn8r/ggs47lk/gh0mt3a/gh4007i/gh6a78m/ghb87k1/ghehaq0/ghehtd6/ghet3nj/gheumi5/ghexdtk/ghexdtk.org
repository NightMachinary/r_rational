  6.html: I looked forward to the advanced probes I would build once I'd unlocked them; I'd need specialized forms to explore the deepest trenches and the planet's gaseous atmosphere.

  9.html: It would open up the deepest parts of the ocean to me; the excavator's design and materials would withstand the crushing pressures of the ocean's deepest depths-- and beyond-- and it wouldn't be limited by access to oxygen or exposure to it.

  12.html: Under this world's atmosphere, within its powerful magnetic field, underneath the deepest parts of the ocean and more often than not under a great deal of rock as well, I had not thought it necessary to provide my maintenance drone control system with electromagnetic shielding.
