Okay, I've finished the work.

I still enjoyed it, but I think the first half is a lot better than the second half. The questions you asked are a bit more interesting than how you answer them.

Some notes I took as I was reading:

- The text messages were definitely a more pleasant experience for me when fully pre-populated, but "Text message scrolled all the way to the bottom" presents its own difficulties (do people know to scroll up?)
- Nice cordyceps reference! Coming back to that as it was explained in the next chapter, is that just a reference to the real-world fungus, or is it also a reference to the [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6178036/chapters/14154868][story that has been posted here previously]]?
- I would have recognized Hall of the Mountain King anyway, but good job letting people know what the song is before you played it! There's nothing that's quite as annoying as a pop culture reference you don't get (for instance, that horror movie they were watching; I had a feeling I was supposed to get that, but I can't think of any vampire movies with a catchy song in the middle).
- You might want to consider including more references to RADM Omar's last name in blocks from her perspective; I wasn't entirely certain that "Shyamala" and "Omar" were the same character until Ch.34, despite the improbability of both of them being simultaneously promoted from Commodore to Rear Admiral.
- "I don't want to hurt you," she said. was a PERFECT payoff to that set-up.

Now, thoughts on the work as a whole.

I'm willing to forgive a lot of contrivance in the set-up of a story (as opposed to later), so this great space-bound creature being able to survive re-entry, but unable to adapt quickly enough to fend off a shark attack, although it seems kind of a stretch, is fine. I'm a bit less forgiving of the fact that the alien is able to recognize an asteroid strike from the presence of iridium, but not able to recognize multiple nuclear detonations from the presence of short-lived radioactive isotopes. Yes, that would have clued the alien in earlier on the presence of intelligent life, so I see why you didn't do it, but it seemed like a capability that was set up that didn't re-emerge when it would be useful, /because/ it would have been useful.

I really enjoyed the interactive webpage design; my only problem with it (beyond my previous complains about that one element) is that it wasn't always obvious when there were things being hidden (e.g. the cat's meows, and it wasn't always obvious when changes to the webpage were complete (e.g. the instructions to the President). I was reminded of how the old webcomic, [[https://www.bgreco.net/kidradd.htm][Kid Radd]], when doing long video panels, would put an [[https://www.bgreco.net/kidradd/comic21.htm#p2]["END" tag]] when the videos were done, so that people would know there's nothing left to see and can move on.

The ending bugged me a bit. I mean, I'm all for happy endings, but not only was nearly everybody saved, but then literally everybody was saved, again. It was a bit much. At the very least, it could have brought up the consequences of doubling the Earth's population (not even counting the Librarians). There's also the matter where the structure of the universe breaking down, the ability to use this break-down for time travel, and the ability to arbitrarily change the laws of the universe (e.g. the mass of a fundamental particle) seemed to come out of nowhere, without even any particular foreshadowing (yes, the antagonist stated that they were going to try to accomplish something like, but the timing on it was just ridiculous - remember what I said about contrivances belonging at the beginning of the story - as well as it making no sense that the Traitor would even need to bother singling out the Earth for destruction if the whole universe could be pulled down around their ears). And, like the great, lamented cartoon TV show ReBoot, we never get to find out anything consequential about the User. (No, the crappy live-action The Guardian Code doesn't count).

One thing that really confused me was What was the deal with Godblade? My interpretation of the events was that the moment at which the President swung the blade was the exact moment at which the Traitor contacted the Coward, expecting the Coward to delete itself when it heard the message, but instead, it just severed its connection to Library communications, which also severed its ability to control its minions on the surface. Is that right? If so, it seems like a heck of a coincidence that the Godblade did exactly what it was sold as being able to do, given that wasn't the expected reaction.

All in all, though, I really enjoyed it. The world building was great; as I've said previously, I loved that you made your aliens actually had /alien/ priorities and morals (although I felt that got undermined a bit towards the end, particularly with "Bullshit.", as great of a line as that was). I liked the way that the humans reacted (although the President was a bit much), I liked how utterly batshit the lead-up to the ending was, with the copies of Danielle everywhere.

I'll probably go back and read it again, looking specifically for any interactive elements I've missed.

Thanks for writing and sharing it!
