Thank you for the continued detailed feedback!

The reference was primarily to the fungus, but I absolutely adored /Too Clever For Their Own Good/.

  that horror movie they were watching; I had a feeling I was supposed to get that, but I can't think of any vampire movies with a catchy song in the middle

The movie from Monster Movie Night is entirely my own invention. Maybe there /should/ be a vampire movie with a catchy song in the middle, eh? Eh?

Can't tell you how glad I am to hear it, I was terrified it would come off as corny and ruin her Moment of Awesome.

As you say, I had to get the protagonist into the 21st century. My handwave here is that the first time there was a functioning viral sensor net, and the second time the protagonist hadn't bothered to rebuild said viral sensor net yet. (There was ample time to do it, but my handwave /there/ is that there didn't seem to be a reason to hurry, they had been waiting for evolution to settle down into something easier to build interfaces against, and the Librarians are much more comfortable operating on long timescales than we are for obvious reasons.)

That's a splendid idea. You watched all the way to the end of Chapter 50, right? Ah, from your further statements I see you did not. Yes, I really need to work something out there like an end tag or hiding the 'next' buttons until it's done. I recommend scrolling to the end of chapter 50 and waiting a few seconds beyond the end of the Universe.

You had the right of it; the reaction the Traitor/Protector expected was total self-destruction. I have a throwaway line justifying this during the Traitor/Protector's chapter where they justify the sword as a contingency in case it doesn't work/partially works-- if a few of the "drones" were to survive or start malfunctioning rather than clean themselves up properly, the Traitor/Protector wouldn't be giving up their pawn. It's a weaker point in the story for sure.

Justified as layers of contingencies in case the Traitor/Protector wasn't able to end the universe on a reasonable timeline (or at all), as well as a continuation of their prior modus operandi of sanity checking with every living member of the species before pulling the plug.

  Bullshit.

Hahaha I agonized over this line. It's the harshest language in OCTO (I don't personally mind adult language when I read things, but I held myself to roughly PG-rated language to try to help me differentiate my character's voices from the way I talk in real life, make OCTO a teeny sliver more accessible, and set myself an additional level of challenge.) Ultimately I went with it because I couldn't think of a better wham line, so I'll use up my Artistic License card on this one unless and until I think of something better for it.

Thank you so, so much for reading. I can't tell you how much it means to me that you put this much thought and effort into your feedback.

Regarding time travel, it's actually not physically possible in this setting. Essentially, a one-time exemption was granted by the Users to spin up a fresh timeline so they could see what would happen. The exotic-matter bug was patched in the new timeline, resulting in splosions.
