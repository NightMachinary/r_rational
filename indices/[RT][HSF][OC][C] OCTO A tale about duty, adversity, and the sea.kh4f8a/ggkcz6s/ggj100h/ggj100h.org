[[https://zalbert.net/octo][OCTO]] is science fiction with horror elements. OCTO is complete and is a little over 113,000 words in total.

OCTO is OC.

OCTO is about a lone survivor doing everything possible to save a civilization from the brink of annihilation.

Escalating levels of spoilers follow.

A series of unlikely disasters leaves the protagonist stranded on an ocean floor with only a tiny fragment of their advanced technology functioning.

The protagonist is not human. The protagonist's species is extremely long-lived; their civilization achieves interstellar exploration not through FTL travel but just by waiting out the long journeys. They are a people characterized by extreme curiosity and implacable patience.

The planet the protagonist finds and explores is Earth.

Other characters show up twelve chapters in.

Since it's a big spoiler I didn't tag it in the title of the post, but there are transhumanism and simulation elements later in the story.

I feel this is the biggest spoiler I can give here since it gives away the game:\\
OCTO is my attempt at rational Lovecraftian/Gigerian kaiju fic.

Content warnings:\\
OCTO contains graphic violence. While there is no explicit sexual content in OCTO, there are two or three uncomfortable situations and implications.

I hope you enjoy my story.
