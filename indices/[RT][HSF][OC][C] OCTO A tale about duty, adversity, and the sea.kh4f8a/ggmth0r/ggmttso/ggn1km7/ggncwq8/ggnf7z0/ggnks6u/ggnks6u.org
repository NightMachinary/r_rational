There's going to be a misunderstanding as well, isn't it? :/

I /knew/ they are not going to be nice! Guess it was just my bias, to have someone to root against, but yeah I'm rooting the hell against the traitor.

*Chapters 49-50:*

It feels a bit rushed, but I /really/ like the ending. Thanks to Agatha for saving Danielle so she could save everyone. Nice.

*Epilogue:*

I really wish that they succeed, but I have no idea if that would ever work. Well, I wish them luck either way.

Thanks a lot for writing and sharing this! It was a very pleasant read.
