*Chapter 11:* While MC's society seems slightly /dystopian/, I love it to bits. Seems perfect to me---I, too, would like to endlessly roam the galaxy, always learning new things.

*Chapter 12:* Frankly, I was surprised at the word "millimeters." This is the first time a direct size measurement is used. Before, I occasionally was getting confused trying to figure out how big the things MC was describing actually were, but that seemed intentional and part of the fun. The same goes for "cockroach". Is that an effect of increased computational resources? Library restoration?

*Chapter 15:* The dog is okay. Phew. I was getting super worried.

*Chapter 16:* Spoilers and some other cool stuff don't work for me due to me using a night's mode theme. Everything that came before this chapter worked perfectly fine. The site's native theme is way too high-contrast for my eyes, but I had to switch to it. :c

*Chapter 17:*

  Agatha sighed. "Do they know what it is yet? Russian superweapon? *Great Old One?* Avenging angel?"

Ha!

*Chapter 20:* Fuck. I guess the communications have gone out before the MC could build a decent computational model of humans. That would've stopped the conflict, or at least made it change drastically. I'm vehemently against people dying, but this is going to lead to /a lot more/ people dying.
