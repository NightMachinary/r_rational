my first thought is the fanfic /Animorphs: The Reckoning/ which does a lot of interesting things with alien mental processes while playing around with the structure of the writing. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11090259/6/r-Animorphs-The-Reckoning][This chapter]] (it's chapter 6 but still kinda spoilery) would give you an idea of what I mean and you can probably tell if it's the sort of thing you're looking for.

(Unfortunately it's been a while since it last updated and it's not clear how dead it is.)
