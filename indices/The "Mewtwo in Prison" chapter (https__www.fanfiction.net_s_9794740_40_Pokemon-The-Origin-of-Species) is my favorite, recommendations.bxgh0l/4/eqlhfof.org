Late reply, but Twig's also got an [[https://twigserial.wordpress.com/2016/03/18/enemy-arc-9/][interlude chapter]] with the same vibe. That link leads directly to the chapter, and it's relatively far in so if you start reading you're spoiling yourself and doing so without context.

The serial is hardly rational (I believe consensus is that it's rational-adjacent) but Wildbow's take on a biological AI in the Primordial is fascinating.
