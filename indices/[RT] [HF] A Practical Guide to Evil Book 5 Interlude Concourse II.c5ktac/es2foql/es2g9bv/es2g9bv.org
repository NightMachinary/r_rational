This is one of those times where the format affects the reading of the story. Taken in the context of all of the Interludes that will be written in this section of the book, one full of background rather than plot is nothing but welcome. Forced to be read piecemeal like this, it exacerbates a non issue into a problem. (IMO to at least some extent the same thing happened on a large scale with the Underdark arc, given how much of the payoff from it has come after the arc concluded)

And to be fair it goes the other direction. The constant cycle of cliffhangers every 3 chapters (aka every Friday) works well for the current release schedule, but I could envision it not being to everyone's taste reading the whole book at once
