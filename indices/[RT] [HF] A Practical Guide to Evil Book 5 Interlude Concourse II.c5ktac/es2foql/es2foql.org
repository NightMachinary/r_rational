I mean i would never say that some of the chapters are better off binged, but this one is high on background information and the feel of the land and low on the actual story moving forward. It's interesting that Adjutant is so keenly aware of Cat's needs tho. I do love how flavorful the descriptions of the reveling the little details of the both the banners being added to and Adjutant's personal taste in orcish women, but as a chapter it's mostly setup more than substance. I do love the setup i have to say that i really like how ErraticErrata writes the more Tolkien-esque details, but man i cannot wait for the next chapter, i mean this last what month's of chapters have been really good.
