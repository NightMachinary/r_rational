So in order the survivors of the seven princes left the pocket dimension and also there's an implication that some amount of the sleeping soldiers were given dreams about the basically the major points of the two chapters before the interludes. It seems like it came from the visions.

So i'm not exactly sure when they ended up stealing Black's soul back it makes sense given that the last time i could find a mention of it was chapter 41 where Tyrant stole it along with the crowns from Rogue Sorcerer when he betrays them the first time in the pocket dimension, i'm not sure when it was delivered back to Cat's camp, and i don't think Archer, Tyrant, Rogue Sorcerer, or Masego's unconscious body are mentioned in this chapter so they may still be getting back, they weren't mentioned in the previous interlude either.
