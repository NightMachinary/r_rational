1: Spoilers. Catherine will realize the Winter King's end goal later.

2: I don't have any specific memories, but I thought Diabolist had somehow baited the attack so she could capture a bunch of fae nobles to power her super-secret evil plan.

4: The fact that Arcadia was warping space such that all paths led to the Winter capital pretty much confirms that the King wanted them to go that way, since he and the Summer Queen are the only beings with the authority to do that. But the nobles who decided not to challenge the obvious forgery were essentially out-thinking themselves. The forgery was so poor and so blatant a lie that they were convinced that it had to be a trap, and none of them were willing to take such obvious bait.
