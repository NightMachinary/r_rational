Experimental records show that a plurality of apprentices (40%) told this, drop out, go home, and then fifteen years later, turn up as poorly trained dark-side users.

Another twenty percent, go home and manage to just live out their lives as exceptionally lucky individuals that never consciously use the force.

5 percent go home and manage to stumble into becoming a poorly trained "light" side user - that is, a user that does not go crazy.

10 % take the logical consequence and jump of a cliff.

25% sign up for proper training. This is not considered ideal.
