I'd rewrite it around Anakin and Obi Wan, I'd make it a war buddy story first with Obi Wan and Anakin two isolated Jedi in the Republic's army, raising in ranks until one is General but the other keeps getting his promotions deferred over his reckless, anger-prone behaviour, then introduce a love triangle, keep Anakin believe himself Luke and Leia's dad, and have a double-take reveal in the trilogy prequels where it turns out it was really Obi Wan the dad all along.
