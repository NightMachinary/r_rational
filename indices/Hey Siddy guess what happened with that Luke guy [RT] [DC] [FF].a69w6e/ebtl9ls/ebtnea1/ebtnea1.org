I am not sure if this falls under the bounds of rationality but it seems like there is a very common trope where some horrible secret is revealed and immediately believed despite the lack of significant evidence. I suppose a rational take on this would involve the characters deciding to actually investigate the claims and demand evidence before coming to a conclusion.

I recall a similar fanfic for Code Geass where the scene of Schneizel revealing that Zero / Lelouch possesses a mind-control Geass and turns the Black Knights against him goes differently with the Black Knights demanding proof and ultimately remaining loyal when it cannot be provided.

Does anyone else have similar ideas for other fiction?
