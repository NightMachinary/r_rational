If you were to rewrite the Star Wars Story as a rational fic, from whose perspective would you find it most interesting to do it? If you could start it at any point in the timeline, whose story would be best to tell ( as a rational fic )?

Yoda and Sidious are obvious No-noes for me, but maybe I am wrong? Idk about Ani/Vader, that might change a bit much. Luke or Lea? I've always felt that SW can work very well as the story of Obi-Wan, so maybe that? ^{^} Anyway, big fan, cheers :p
