I don't know why you think that either this or HPMOR are attacks against the source material. All this is doing is pointing out that there is some absurdity in the idea of your greatest nemisis, the man who killed your teacher, coming up to you and claiming to be your father, and you just believing it. That doesn't mean that the scene would have been better if Vader pulled out a birth certificate, it's just using the absurdity to create humor.
