I'm ok with the slow pacing of the story generally, but I think it is a legitimate complaint that we spend so much time on world type points of view. Every single interlude, no matter how cool, frustrates me. The story is already moving slow enough that taking a chapter off - especially when you are current with the story and waiting a week for more - is painful.

As with the majority of fanfiction, I think editing down could benefit the story. It's not a major concern though as the content has been quite enjoyable and this world is deep enough that just listening to the inner monologue of characters thinking about it can be quite entertaining.
