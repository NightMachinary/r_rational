I liked the interludes. I think they are perfect for setting up events later on, and they make me want to see what happens... e.g. are the trio going to have to take on Mewtwo? Red is focusing his research on psychics, will Blue capitalise on being dark and specialise in anti-psychic combat? Will Red's research/expertise figure out a way to stop/help/catch Mewtwo? Will Blue beat Mewtwo in a fight? Can Leaf mobilise popular support for some solution?

I expect Mewtwo is the final boss, with a lot of events and challenges on the way, but I'm already making myself hyped thinking of all these possibilities :)

Same with Giovani and the cave - interested to see how they fit together, and how they play out.
