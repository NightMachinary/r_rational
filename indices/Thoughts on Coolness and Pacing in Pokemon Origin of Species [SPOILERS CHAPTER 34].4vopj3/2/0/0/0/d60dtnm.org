Hmm. As it stands I currently have interludes placed at transitions or just after major events conclude:

The first was the night after their first day of traveling.

The second was after they finish with the dead body at the beedrill field.

The third was at the end of the Viridian fire.

The fourth was as they leave Pewter.

And the fifth was after the dig site attack.

Or do you mean wider arcs than those?
