This wasn't a specific criticism of you, I was thinking about all the fan fiction I've been reading where it bothers me. Although IIRC the one after the beedrill incident bothered me because I wanted to see more on their reactions on that and move past an emotionally disruptive moment, not linger on it.

I'm also not current on your story, so I can't judge the one after pewter city or the dig site.

This is so subjective that it's hard to give specific constructive criticism. I appreciate you listening and I hope you keep improving as an author and writing thought provoking stories.
