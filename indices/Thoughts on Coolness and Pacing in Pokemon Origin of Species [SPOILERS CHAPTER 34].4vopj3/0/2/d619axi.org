For what it's worth, I actually really like some of the slower-paced worldbuilding. Apart from just regular nostalgia, one of the things that I love about Pokemon over its various clones is that it tries to build something of a functioning world; the lore surrounding each Pokemon - at least when it's not talking about Indian elephants - brings up something that really does seem to be a living, breathing world with the Pokemon interacting with other species in the wild and such. Now, since it's at its core a children's game it obviously doesn't go as far as it could, but we still have enough little hinted things to go on, like the likely relationship between Garchomp and Sharpedo. While I love the characters and am quite interested in the early shreds of plot we're starting to see, imo where this fic really shines is in stuff like the short bit about how fortuitous chance meetings became a trope in the Pokemon World's fiction and how that lead to trainers having the habit of exchanging numbers. (I certainly hope to see various trainers they meet showing up multiple times and becoming Heroes of Another Story as the fic progresses.) So, while I definitely get the complaints about the plot being kind of slow, I hope that you don't speed up too much and leave the world in the dust.
