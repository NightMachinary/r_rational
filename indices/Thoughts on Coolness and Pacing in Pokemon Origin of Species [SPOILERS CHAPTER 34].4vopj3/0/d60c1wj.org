Thanks for all the feedback! A word of wisdom I've always tried to follow is that when someone critiques your writing you should, by and large, not try and justify or explain yourself, so I'll only address a few things that I think relate to my struggles with rational writing in general :)

  In line with this trend, I was slightly disappointed to see that Red would have to publicize his clever plan, thus giving it up as a comparative advantage moving forward, and further disappointed to see his plan put on hold. I'm pretty sure I'm mostly being silly wanting him to gain a sort of monopoly on Abra as a result of his plan, but it is a desire that I have, and the sort of thing that a lot of RatFic deliver but that this one doesn't so much, at least with Red.

To be honest, I was disappointed too! I had all sorts of plans for the money he, Blue and Leaf would make with their abra catching scheme, and intended to have it occur this chapter.

And then, sometime in the middle of the month as I was writing, I did what I always try to do with the story, and really thought about it. And as I did, I had a thought that made me sad, but also made me revise my plans.

Because that thought was "It would be blisteringly, unforgivably stupid of them to do something like this on their own."

And that thought was true. It would be an enormous risk to try this alone, and that means they need oversight or help from others, and that means they can't keep the technique to themselves.

There's a struggle in what I'm trying to accomplish with this story that is definitely turning out to be harder than I imagined it would be at first, and that struggle is in incorporating, as you put it, "cool" scenes while still maintaining it as a story about an aspiring rationalist.

I could write the scene out and just have everything go well, or even have something go wrong and have them get through it... but what kind of rationalist would Red be, son of a Ranger that he is, who's already been in enough life threatening situations, and had a whole flashback about weighing risk and precautionary measure, to take such a massive risk here? The potential for reward is nowhere big enough to justify it.

So in what I view as "in the name of rationality," this particular Cool moment and bit of munchkinry will have to wait, and will have to be somewhat restrained. It's not the first time (a similar thing happened earlier, with the idea of flipping clefairy once their value on the market jumped, though that idea was shot down due to a moral qualm that is, in itself, ambiguous and not completely settled in the story just yet) and won't be the last.

Hopefully I can put in enough other coolness to make up for the reduction in the Rationalist Power Fantasy that I definitely share and want to see Red go through :)

  *Red*... I think he needs to raise the level of his play, even if he has to pay a price to do so, and he's paid plenty of prices already.
#+end_quote

The main point I would make here is that Red doesn't /need/ to raise his level of play yet. He's not trying to accomplish something in a drastic timeline, like Blue. He's not facing imminent threats, like the protagonists of Glimwarden or Animorphs. At some point he definitely will be, and at that point his level of play will jump accordingly, but in the meantime, from a story perspective, that may well be a real problem, and I clearly need to do a better job in making his chapters and arc more engaging.

  *Green*... Maybe that person isn't interesting to Daystar, or wouldn't fit into the story he wants to tell, or maybe that would have been great but the opportunity has passed. I don't know. But it still seems like she could be cooler, and that that would be cool.
#+end_quote

That person is definitely interesting to me, and as you've accurately guessed, that's the path her arc will end up taking. I've always loved the chapters in Ender's Game where Peter and Valentine shape the public discourse as Locke and Demosthenes, but the rate and effectiveness at which they did it required an unrealistic (or rather, naive, in a kind sense, since the book was written before the internet as we know it today even existed) perspective of how things work. Building Leaf into the kind of figure she's going to one day be, in a rational story, takes time and attention that, in all fairness, is probably not as engaging as it could be or should be. I'll try to do a better job of making it so, moving forward.

  *Blue* ...is basically a badass.
#+end_quote

Yep. Yep he is. And since he's the least rational of the three, it's easier to put him in immediate high stake situations that let his particular brand of coolness shine.

  *Pacing and Character Development*
#+end_quote

I remember reading HPMOR and marveling at how virtually every other day of the year at Hogwarts had events in them important enough to have at least a scene in, and what a good job EY did in making it all feel important enough to justify that. The pace of Pokemon early on was definitely at a crawl compared to other Pokemon fanfiction, as I tried to include every scene of any relevance whatsoever in exploring the world and showing the characters' approach to solving problems and getting to know each other.

I don't think my own characters and their interactions are as compelling as HPMOR's were yet, but what I've aspired to is the same level of detail in showing everything that I feel is important (or would be later) rather than just summarizing it. Now that the majority of the groundwork for the characters and world's establishment is done, I'm planning more plot focused chapters, and will be using time skips much more often to summarize things we've seen before, like their quick visit to the shopping mall this chapter.

Overall I think these are all fair criticism, and I'm going to strive to incorporate and integrate them into my my writing and the story moving forward. Thanks for writing all this out! I'm glad you're still enjoying the story regardless, and thanks for your continued support :)
