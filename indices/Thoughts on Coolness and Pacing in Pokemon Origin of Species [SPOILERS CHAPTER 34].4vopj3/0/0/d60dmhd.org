:) Thanks for the reply!

  There's a struggle in what I'm trying to accomplish with this story that is definitely turning out to be harder than I imagined it would be at first, and that struggle is in incorporating, as you put it, "cool" scenes while still maintaining it as a story about an aspiring rationalist.

I respect this a lot. All I can hope is that you continue to find clever exploits that actually work. Perhaps it will be easier when the three of them have more resources.

  though that idea was shot down due to a moral qualm that is, in itself, ambiguous and not completely settled in the story just yet
#+end_quote

I was not convinced by this moral qualm :(.

  The main point I would make here is that Red doesn't need to raise his level of play yet. He's not trying to accomplish something in a drastic timeline, like Blue.
#+end_quote

This is a good point, but I guess I'm getting impatient for him to find a goal that will push him to improve.

  That person is definitely interesting to me, and as you've accurately guessed, that's the path her arc will end up taking.
#+end_quote

Very much looking forward to this. (I can't believe I forgot her name was Leaf though...)

  I remember reading HPMOR and marveling at how virtually every other day of the year at Hogwarts had events in them important enough to have at least a scene in, and what a good job EY did in making it all feel important enough to justify that... don't think my own characters and their interactions are as compelling as HPMOR's were yet, but what I've aspired to is the same level of detail in showing everything that I feel is important (or would be later) rather than just summarizing it.
#+end_quote

Yeah, for all of its flaws, HPMOR really is very good. I do like all of the small interactions though. The friendship between Red and Blue is so deep and convincing, and Leaf's integration into the group has been very natural. I mentioned elsewhere that beyond the munchkin-y aspects I enjoyed reading about Red's plan because it was heartwarming to see Blue and Leaf support him -- not because they pitied him but because they believed in him.

  Thanks for writing all this out! I'm glad you're still enjoying the story regardless, and thanks for your continued support
#+end_quote

Definitely still enjoying the story, and your response to this post (as well as your comments elsewhere before I wrote it), leave me optimistic that I will enjoy future chapters even more.
