I think it's kind of interesting that even you consider your main character to not have a major pressing goal. Maybe the "slow" pacing of the story is a result of there being insufficient conflict in the primary storyline?

I don't see it as a major issue, at least not yet, but it does make me think. I think of myself as a rational protagonist in my own world and I'm constantly trying to munchkin real life. Much like Red though, my goals are far reaching and hard to obtain and I often end up just surviving and getting smarter and better very slowly over many years. I dream of a major conflict that could force me to evolve and I guess that is one of the fantasies I often enjoy in fiction that isn't yet being fulfilled here.

(I complain about your story as someone who has enjoyed it a lot so far. I'm only behind on the chapters because it's so addictive that I want to read it in bigger chunks that one chapter at a time.)
