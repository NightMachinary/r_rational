Definitely is, and you're right in examining the ways the abra plan and how Red will try to benefit from it will become more complex :) I didn't mean to imply that I was shelving it, it's just going to happen next chapter instead of this one, since it will end up being a bit more complicated.

Also, one of your previous reviews is still one of my favorites of the story, and it's definitely relevant for this discussion:

  ...if you took a snapshot of this story, the basic concept that it was created around, and expanded it out into a chapter, this is likely what you would get. You have the science, the more realistic interpretation of Pokemon training, and the other dynamics of the Pokemon world, among other things. I'd be willing to bet that those concepts are what inspired this story.

  But on its own, that snapshot can't make a story. We see those elements appear through the story, but it is the plot that makes it a novel, an interesting story. Certainly, some might find a plot-less examination of a rational Pokemon world entertaining, but the Guinness Book of World Records, while entertaining to its readers, is no novel. That is the comparison I would make.

  ...the difference between encyclopedia and novel, provide an insight about the Pokemon anime. It was never meant to be a novel, a story that progresses and changes towards an ultimate conclusion. It took a snapshot of Ash's journey, and expanded it into episode after episode. It retained originality among the many expanded snapshots by continually introducing new Pokemon and new people, or on the odd occasion showing a slightly different snapshot of Ash's journey, that of his battles against gyms, rivals, and in the Conferences.

  Any person approaching the Pokemon anime and expecting it to behave like a novel would soon feel that same distress, since the Pokemon anime is no story. It is a snapshot, the ideal of a Pokemon journey, provided under a different skin every episode. It has its popularity because a good amount of people are attracted to the snapshot, and the skin keeps them from growing bored. I can say that this works for many children because, as I recall from back then, the mere fact that I couldn't recite the lines of every character was enough to have me bouncing in my seat, and this is a sentiment I have found other people shared as a child.

  On the other hand, those that scoff at the anime for being 'too filler-y' see past the skin and, desiring a story to the anime, are distressed to find none. This is something that we often see happen to fans who grew past the point of being a child, and their tastes changed with them. I am currently wondering if such people could overcome their distaste for an encyclopedic anime if they truly knew what they were watching, and thus set up different expectations.
