Regarding Red and the Abra, from a literary standpoint it isn't very possible to show the Abra plan in real time and detail anymore. I remember hearing once, when learning about the law of conservation of detail, that if someone comes up with a plan, hero, villain, or otherwise, if we hear enough of the plan to picture it in our heads then something will be different in execution and if the plan is not explained to the viewer then it will likely succeed. In short, you only get to show the same plan once, and explaining it before it is attempted counts.

With Red, he's already explained his plan with the Abra. I visualized it, so I can attest that it would be boring to see it happen a second time. But there's more than just the plan to deal with here. Red is disappointed that he can't keep the secret of the technique, and you have admitted that you are also put off about how Red won't get large quantities of money from this. But there's more you can do with this. As Red coordinates the event (assuming it happens), he can think about how to maximize his profits on the Abra he can catch before the price crashes. He can look inwards, and consider the roots of his desire for the money and the other emotions floating around there, and he can look outwards and try to talk to the people he gets to help him, and see if there's anything he can do before the price crashes. Both can happen during his experiment, with said experiment in the background because we've already seen it happen in Red's explanation, and both provide more opportunity for character growth. With luck, Red might even find a way to get a good amount of spending money out of the deal anyways, such as selling the first batch of Abra he finds before the price can drop much. I think, at least, that having more items will only enhance the story and that you might not have to postpone the idea much.

With overall pacing, it does come across as a bit slow and relaxed, exactly what you would expect from three kids on a journey, if said journey is not filled with fighting terrorists and/or forces of nature. Blue, the exception, is always pushing onward, but he does not dominate the flow of the story. Relaxed is fine, just as good for a story as tense, but just like a fast-moving plot risks running out of critical events before the story is done justice, a slow-moving plot risks stagnating when the ideas that fit within the one setting run dry.

It might be more accurate, though, to say that the stories of the main characters is relaxed, rather than the story in general is relaxed. If you introduced side characters with stories of their own, ones that frequently but not incessantly intersected the main characters' stories in meaningful but not intrusive ways, the story as a whole could come across as more lively even as the main characters stroll through it. And I know that all sounded like wide strokes notions and it may even be really just grand gesturing about nothing, but one of the ideas I've been considering for a while now is that a world that is deep, vibrant, and alive is best achieved by having a large cast of side characters, each with their own story. I'm not fully confident in that idea, or if it is the fundamental idea I should be looking for, but if it's correct it could be key to keeping a bright and lively tone in a relaxed and calm story.

As always, I hope at least one of the things I just said is useful, and I look forward to seeing how Red will do the best he can with what he has.
