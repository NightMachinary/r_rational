  I'm hungry for more words, more development, and more awesome shit.

I'm happy with the slower build up to awesome shit. Not that it is slow; there is plenty of excitement with all the gym battles, rampaging pokemon, and renegades.

Characters don't just get to go rationalist-supersaiyan whenever they please. They have to work and build over time. They have to earn it. You can't just skip to dessert - eat your vegetables and you will enjoy the ice-cream so much more!

Imo keep doing what you do Daystar :)
