Game of Champions is definitely my favorite pokemon fanfic, and while it has far better worldbuilding and character depth than most others I've tried, it's not really a rationalfic in my mind.

Some chapters are, like the one where Blue gets his Ninetails, but in others like Red's fight with Misty, the author "cheats" for Rule of Cool and false dramatic tension.
