On the subject of pacing, personally, while I would love to have /more/ content, that's more an "impatient reader" complaint than a legitimate one, as otherwise, I thoroughly enjoy how Origin gives us information on pretty much everything that happens.

It, to me, makes me feel like I'm a part of the story, some unspoken character in the background that's there listening in on what happens, rather than watching a movie, with explicit scenes.
