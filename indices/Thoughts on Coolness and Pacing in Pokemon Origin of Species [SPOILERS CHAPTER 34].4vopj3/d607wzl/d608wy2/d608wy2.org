This is part of it, but I think Origin of Species is just generally a very slow-paced story. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing, and I know lots of fanfiction readers prefer stories with high wordcounts. However, it took over 150k words for the story to get past the first gym. Where Mother of Learning will paraphrase or summarize scenes where Zorian is doing something not very interesting, Origin of Species will spend a hundred words on the characters eating a meal or something. I do think all the scenes have a clear purpose and that the way Daystareld expands them with lots of description makes it easier to visualize what's going on and get immersed in the story, but I often get distracted reading this story in a way I don't with faster-paced stories.
