Personally, I actually rather like this pacing. Yeah, occasionally there'll be a chapter that feels like mostly setup and it'll kind of hurt to wait for a month, but overall I feel like the way it's being written makes the world feel more real and personal than if it skipped over the "everyday life on a Pokemon journey" bits.
