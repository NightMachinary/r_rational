P:tOoS definitely has a slower growth curve than, say, /Mother of Learning/. Zorian.34 is significantly more powerful and versatile than Red.34, compared to the challenges he faces.

However, I think a bigger part of this is that there is a finite amount of wordcount/screentime/power per chapter, and in P:tOoS it has to be evenly divided three ways or else one of the members of the party will stagnate in comparison. Zorian, on the other hand, has all the text to himself.
