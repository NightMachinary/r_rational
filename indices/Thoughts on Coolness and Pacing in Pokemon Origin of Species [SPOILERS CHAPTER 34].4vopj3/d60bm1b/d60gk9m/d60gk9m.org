To be completely honest, having reread the story start to finish, it still struck me as extremely slow-moving. Usually on rereads a story feels faster, but even with that consideration it's positively glacial. Consider: Origin of Species is more than twice as long as Brave New World, and it still feels like it's in its first act.

Not to say it isn't a terrific story. I did, after all, read it twice already, so I can't exactly criticize on that front, but maybe a few of the less plot-relevant elements could stand cutting. Assuming they'll go through all eight canonical gyms at about this speed, there's no reason for so many similar scenarios to take place in quick succession. For example, the forest fire and the parasect ramage were, narratively speaking, redundant, with only the Renegade branding really setting the latter apart. It would've worked just as well to have the disasters spread further apart, rather than devoting thousands of words to repetition.
