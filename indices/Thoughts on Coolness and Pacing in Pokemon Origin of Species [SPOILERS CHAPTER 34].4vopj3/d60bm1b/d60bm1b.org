I care more about the quality of the story than the pacing, but I agree that it has been very slow, and I am hungry for more. What I think impatient readers should ask themselves is this: if you only started reading after the story is completed, would your opinion of the pacing change? Perhaps the problem isn't the writing's pacing, but the publishing's?
