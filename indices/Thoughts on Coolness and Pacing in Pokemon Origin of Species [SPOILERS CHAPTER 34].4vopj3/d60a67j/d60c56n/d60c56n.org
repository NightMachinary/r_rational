  Every single interlude, no matter how cool, frustrates me.

Yeah, I think this is going to continue to be the most divisive part of my story for awhile. Many readers have expressed how frustrating they find them, while some of the most popular chapters have been interludes. I hope I can do a better job moving forward of tying them into and propelling Red, Blue, and Leaf's journey.
