I'm also biased because in general I tend to dislike interludes and I feel like they interrupt the story. I get why they exist and I sometimes enjoy them, but man do I wish I could just read a story without interruption sometimes.

I actually frequently skip interludes until I get to a major story arc conclusion and then go back and read all the ones I skipped. So maybe my advice if you are writing to people like me, is to put an interlude after a plot point concludes instead of as a way of stalling wrapping up a storyline.
