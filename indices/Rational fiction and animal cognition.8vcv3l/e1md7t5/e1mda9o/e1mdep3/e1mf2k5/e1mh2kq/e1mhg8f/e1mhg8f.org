I didn't read /all/ of Twilight and am confused as to how fast they actually were, but they were pretty fast and durable (we're talking comfortably mid-to-high-tier superhero levels: one of Edward's first feats is stopping a truck from hitting Bella, bare-handed, starting from a considerable distance. Stronger or faster than, say, Spider-man). I think this part is just following canon.

I don't know exactly about ocean crossing. I remember it was mentioned as a possibility, meaning they easily had the endurance, but not if they ever actually did it, and if so, how long it took. Usually they'd just travel by hiding inside airplanes (or in some cases, walking into them on plain sight using fake IDs).
