Some combination of super-speed, and ludicrously good senses - as described (in both canon and /Luminosity/), Vampire senses in many cases exceed the physical limits on sensing.

Since whales are not quiet - they make a /lot/ of noise, and much of it being outside the range of human hearing is no barrier to a vampire - I never thought that finding the whales would be particularly difficult.

And since Orcas have /much/ more blood than humans, I like to imagine a kind of marine-park-for-blood-donation deal that ends up with everyone better off.
