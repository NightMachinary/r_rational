Oh, good one! Reminds me of some discussions I had with a friend who was arguing that, if you took the principles of veganism to their logical extreme, you'd have to forcefully mod the biosphere, remove the mechanisms of predation and make lions vegetarians too. Or alternatively, if life turned out to be inextricably tied to suffering and inflicting violence on other life, that perhaps the only truly ethical option would be mass extinction.

The way I see it, that kind of arguments only show how completely ridiculous your ethical assumptions were to begin with. Can't have more utility when there's no subjects left to experience the utility any more.
