Do you have a particularly good reason for abstaining from eggs, assuming that you can verify that the birds are treated well (perhaps by raising them yourself?) I keep backyard chickens, and my animals are probably among the happiest, safest, and healthiest forms of life on earth, and I don't see how taking some excess eggs is a bad tradeoff for that.
