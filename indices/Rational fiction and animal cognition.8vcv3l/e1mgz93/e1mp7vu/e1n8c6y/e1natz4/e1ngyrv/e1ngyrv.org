Oh, come on Paleo diet? [[https://www.vox.com/2015/8/20/9179217/paleo-diet-jeb-bush-weight-loss][The idea behind it, is already debunked]] "There is no one 'Paleo diet.' There are millions of Paleo diets. People in East Africa ate different foods than people in West Africa versus the Middle East, and South America, and North America."

I'm also not sure what you are talking about polyunsaturated fats. [[https://healthyforgood.heart.org/eat-smart/articles/polyunsaturated-fats][Since those are which your doctor wants you to replace other fats.]] Of course, too much fat (or calories) is always bad. "For good health, the majority of the fats that you eat should be monounsaturated or polyunsaturated. " link above.

[[https://www.athlegan.com/vegan-protein][biological value of protein]] Sorry, the source is clearly a vegan. But he gives sources for some of his claims. Most important part "Foodstuff with these proportions of amino acids is considered to be a source of complete protein. This includes legumes, seeds, grains, and veggies like chickpeas, black beans, cashews, quinoa, soy, etc."

Honestly, you should try to find sources for your claims. At least read the wiki articles.

" Expert panels in the United States and Europe recommend that pregnant and lactating women consume higher amounts of polyunsaturated fats than the general population to enhance the DHA status of the fetus and newborn.[1]" [Polyunsaturated fat][[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyunsaturated_fat]])

"knowledge of the relative proportions of animal and plant foods in the diets of early humans is circumstantial, incomplete, and debatable and that there are insufficient data to identify the composition of a genetically determined optimal diet. The evidence related to Paleolithic diets is best interpreted as supporting the idea that diets based largely on plant foods promote health and longevity, at least under conditions of food abundance and physical activity."[35] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleolithic_diet][Paleo Diet]]

"Vegans can get enough essential amino acids by eating a variety of plant proteins."[Protein]("[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_(nutrient)"]]) And without the whole counting trouble... Just eat more proteins.

"The BV of a food varies greatly, and depends on a wide variety of factors. In particular the BV value of a food varies depending on its preparation and the recent diet of the organism. This makes reliable determination of BV difficult and of limited use --- fasting prior to testing is universally required in order to ascertain reliable figures." [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_value][Biological value of proteins]]

But yeah, you can probably live on most diets healthy. I eat vegan healthier than as an omnivore. Mainly because you can find many restaurants with a vegan meal option, but most have not a vegan dessert. Or you can buy fruits at the supermarket, but at least in my country, only in big cities are vegan cookies avaible.
