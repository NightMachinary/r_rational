  tried cutting milk and dairy once
#+end_quote

The things in dairy that are most likely to cause inflammatory responses are lactose (a kind of sugar) and casein (a kind of protein). The other sugars in milk products are usually not problems, the fats in dairy products are very good for you, and the other protein in diary products, whey, is the easiest to digest of all protein sources so it's not usually a problem either. If you want to retry the no dairy dietary intervention but found it too troublesome before, try just making sure that you're cutting out the problematic parts. For example, butter is totally safe, some yogurts (like greek) are lactose-free, etc. You'd have to do some research on the casein part, since I don't remember off the top of my head what dairy products don't have it. But milk itself would definitely have to be cut. Anyway, just some thoughts on how you could try this again with hopefully a bit less inconvenience.

  salmon
#+end_quote

Pay close attention here, because not all salmon is created equal. EPA/DHA content varies wildly, so make sure to check the content of whatever you're getting. I remember seeing a 5x difference in n-3 content between 2 different brands of canned salmon before. Unless you're specifically looking for high EPA/DHA salmon, you're probably not getting it and could benefit from a supplement. They're relatively cheap anyway---far cheaper than making a habit of eating Salmon.

  vegetarian
#+end_quote

It's not all that feasible to be both a vegetarian and cut grains and legumes. It's possible, but would be super hard and probably wouldn't be enjoyable IMO. And you have to enjoy a diet to be able to stick with it indefinitely.

  Pizza, Pasta
#+end_quote

Of course they count. Pizza, Pasta, and Bread are the main sources that people eat of grains in the West. If you want to "cheat", white rice is an okay substitute because it's just pure starch with almost nothing else in it. You'd lose some of the benefits of low-carb, but should still be able to tell if cutting out all the hidden nasties in grains is helping you or not.

  reduce
#+end_quote

If you're going to test it, test it all the way first by completely eliminating it, or you're not going to be able to tell if it's working. After you've confirmed it is in fact working, you can then try reintroducing some grains/legumes or certain kinds to see if you lose the benefit and if so, how much of it you lose. Then you'd know where the border is. If the change is worth it, you may want to stick with it. If it helps but isn't worth the trouble, then you drop it. But don't half-ass the testing period or you might as well not do it at all.
