My point isn't against people doing stuff they think is unethical, but against people who find reasons to make things they find unethical acceptable. (Most think killing animals is bad. Except for eating... Except dogs... And horses... Or not horses)

Since I think morals and ethics are subjective, I can't really argue against cannibalism (on ethical grounds). But if you think eating humans is morally wrong I can argue to include animals in the exception.

I mean if you want to choose what to eat on intelligence, some humans are less intelligent then some animals. Hard to test and value objectively. (Would birds value the ability to fly more than the ability to recognize yourself in a mirror?) But eating less intelligent humans still seems wrong. I would argue to not eat stuff with brains, just to be sure. I mean look at some stuff on [[/r/likeus][r/likeus]], hard to say cows can be eaten, when you see one behaving like a dog. And pigs are said to be smarter than dogs.

Well, not all species have a positive effect on the biosphere and most realistic extinctions have not many individuals as direct victims. Just on the flip side wasting resources to keep a species with few individuals alive (pandas for example) when the resources could be used elsewhere, could be very wrong. And some try to bring mammoths back to live...

Eh, if in 1000 years a big rock collides with earth, humans could be a benefit. Even with our destructive behaviour.

Just to say it again, if you already think killing animals is unethical, and still do it because of other reasons, my point was against people making stuff up so it isn't unethical anymore.

Being vegan is not as hard as some might think. (Just look at some of those hippies that are vegan. If they can do it...) And the amount of work is overestimated. And honestly most of the work (making sure you eat healthy) should also be done if you eat meat.

If someone wants to go vegan, just look up 3 (healthy) meal options for breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks. And change one if you don't like it or got bored of it. And try to keep the ingredients at home.

The rest is stuff you can sort out when you browse through the internet. Like what Vitamins you should take (Vit B12 and D)
