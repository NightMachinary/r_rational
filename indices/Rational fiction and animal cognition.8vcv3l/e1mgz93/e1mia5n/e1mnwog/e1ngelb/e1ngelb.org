Japanese people eat fish though! Which is arguably just healthy all-round, what with antioxidants, B12 etc.

My point though wasn't that you can't be healthy on a vegan diet, but that there can be practical issues in procuring and balancing all the nutrients from the most commonly found ingredients (especially in western countries, and depending on where you live). I guess part of this is that for me a "healthy" diet comes pretty natural since I grew up in a Mediterranean area so even as a meat eater I wouldn't dream to just chug down hamburgers and steaks on a daily basis. Veggies have never been weird for me, in fact they've always been a major part of my diet. For others, just having a healthy diet might be as much of an effort as organising a vegan one.

Another problem is that you have to throw out a vast part of your acquired cooking wisdom. For me a lot of things I make depend on eggs or cheese. Well, objectively, even as a vegan, I wouldn't see anything bad with keeping a couple chickens in a pen, feeding them and using only whatever eggs they produce. I couldn't possibly be so strict to assume that chickens have not only a right not to suffer in battery farms, but even not to be /kept/ at all, a condition I doubt they have enough awareness to even fully appreciate.

But yes, I know it's possible. People do it. It just takes a bit of effort and time.
