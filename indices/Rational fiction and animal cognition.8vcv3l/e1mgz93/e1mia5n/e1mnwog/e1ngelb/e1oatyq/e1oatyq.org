Japanese people eat fish, but if you look at the article I linked, the Okinawan traditional diet includes less than half a serving a day. They also eat pork, but rarely.

I guess my point is that if you're vegan, and not living off of oreos, then you're probably gonna be pretty healthy anyway, since most of your diet is going to consist of vegetables and fruits and some fungi (nutritional yeast, mmmm.) If you're vegan, you pretty much already have a healthy diet (Again, unless you just eat oreos and ice cream, but I mean, that goes for any diet.)

About the backyard chickens thing, the problem is mainly in acquisition. If you buy those chickens from a breeder, then you're supporting a business in which male chicks are often ground up at birth, as they have no benefit to the operation beyond the small number of cocks they need to keep for breeding purposes. That's not to mention whatever conditions the hens are under, and if it's anything like normal egg farms, then they're probably calcium deficient, as they're laying way more eggs than they would normally, and they aren't allowed to eat the extras to get back calcium, as they would and do naturally. That can also be a concern for your backyard chickens, the calcium deficiency. Ultimately though, if you can solve the supply issues, then there really is not much wrong with keeping them, as long as you make sure you keep them pets first, egg machines second- add calcium supplements to their feed, for instance, that kinda thing.

Thanks for listening to me, rather than shutdown entirely as a lot of people do when confronted with a dreaded vegan.
