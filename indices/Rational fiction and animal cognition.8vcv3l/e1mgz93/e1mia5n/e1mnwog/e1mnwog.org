  Well, about going vegan, I suspect it'd make significantly harder to stay healthy, though not impossible, as you'd have to spend more time on your diet and balance it more carefully. Some people might be actually unable to survive on it depending on metabolism, I don't know. And there's a social aspect - ultimately it all boils down to quality of life and time, which means, are you willing to sacrifice a fraction of your own life for the sake of the lives of animals?

It's actually considerably more healthy to be vegan for most people. There are some who cannot easily, or possibly at all, survive on a no animal products diet, but they're fairly rare. For most, it's very healthy. The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okinawa_diet][Okinawan diet]] for example contains very little meat, and is associated with one of the longest living groups of humans in the world. Additionally, pretty much every major world health organization has said that veganism is appropriate for all ages and stages of life.

The only thing you really need to worry about with veganism is getting b12, which is easily supplemented, or gotten through fortified foods. (Which is how meat eaters do it, since meat is arguably fortified with b12.) Protein isn't so much a concern as people think [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n20uGGNoVdo_][as illustrated here.]]
