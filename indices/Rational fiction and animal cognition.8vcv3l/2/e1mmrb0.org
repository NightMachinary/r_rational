Pokemon - the origin of species pretty heavily explores the idea of meat eating and general ethics of it all /despite/ severely nerfing pokemon intelligence from the canonical levels down to real world non-human animal levels so I think it counts.

Animorphs (the original, not the fan-fiction popular on [[/r/rational]]) explores this quite a bit. The protagonists are repeatedly faced with discomfort when morphing into cetaceans and primates because they feel a sense of a consciousness which is apart from theirs and aware of being possessed, looking back at them.

Of course the original animorphs isn't commonly considered rational fiction, but it can never be said that the series did not deeply explore the full implications of its premises.
