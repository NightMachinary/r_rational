  the only real reason to treat animals right (besides environmental reasons) is empathy

That's also the only real reason to treat humans right. For all I know, I'm the only sentient mind in the universe, and y'all P-zombies. How can you disprove that?

All I can do is try to /infer/ who is sentient like me, by observing their behaviour. Humans are pretty transparently so. But a lot of animals do also a lot of sentient-like things. They clearly show love and affection, fear, playfulness, a simple theory of mind, mourning and understanding of death. If you encountered an alien, or an intelligent robot, what rules would you apply to decide whether they're fair game to kill or not? Can you say that you apply the same rules to all animals as well, or do you just go along with society's default assumptions in that field?
