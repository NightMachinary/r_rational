That's a very long comment...

I don't typically watch videos on mobile, so no, haven't seen them. I don't think that willingness to kill necessarily implies that mistreatment is meaningless, in the same way that killing in self defence or war does not mean torture is meaningless - but I do accept that animals bred for slaughter will have unpleasant lives, and it would be hypocritical for me to condemn that - and it's usually not arbitrary, but has practical commercial reasons. I'd be happy for us as a species to do much less of it for a variety of reasons, but "we shouldn't kill animals" isn't on the list.

From a /very very pragmatic/ point of view, yes human meat is wasted. But there are so many problems with eating it that it's way down the priority list of possible human problems.
