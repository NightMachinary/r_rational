Is it actually unreasonable to focus exclusively on whatever is killing the most people, until it is sufficiently fixed that it no longer holds that spot and we move on to the next bottleneck? If $X million can prevent 1000 deaths from hunger or 10 deaths from cancer, focusing on hunger seems fine.

I mean, it may be unreasonable in practice to expect that level of cooperation and coordination from the human race. But it doesn't seem like a bad outcome in principle.
