That is my impression too, yes. Though I don't think that kind of reasoning fully works - after all, if we started creating hierarchies of problems and only ever address the most pressing one, we would do that for humans and only care about, say, world hunger, and not war or cancer or whatever. Different people have different affinities too so obviously everyone will have their focus on different problems; there's nothing wrong about giving your all to a relatively minor problem, like, say, volunteering at a stray cat refuge, as long as humanity as a whole divides its resources in an approximately proportionate way.

I think this was /hinted/ in "Significant Digits" as Hermione is mentioned to be vegetarian. But the motivations for that are only left implied, never stated, and she never tries to convince anyone else to make a similar choice. It just seems into character that she might be the type to be empathetic enough to start worrying about the well-being of animals beyond that of humans too.
