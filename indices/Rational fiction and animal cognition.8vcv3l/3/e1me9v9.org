I think you've actually hit on a blind spot in rational fiction and rational ideologies, which tend to be heavily, and sometimes explicitly, partisan to humans and human experience. I think the only reason we can't see animal experience as legitimate and worthy of respect is that we treat one another so badly that we can't even get around to it. In a world where human beings treated one another well treating animals well would start to seem like a no-brainer.
