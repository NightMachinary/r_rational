Well, in this case I think it sticks out because in rational fiction on average there's a big focus on problems of sentience, ethics, and respect of life.

If a Christian author writes a novel where humans see killing other humans as horrible but killing animals as normal, they're not contradicting their own world view. In that world view, the sanctity of human life is a product of humans being made in the image of God, aka having a soul. God himself gave man lordship over all other creatures of Earth. Therefore, it's perfectly normal that killing other humans is a bad thing but killing animals is not.

In rational fiction though usually the world view is strictly materialistic. So that reasoning doesn't hold. Yet a lot of it is also humanistic, putting humans front and centre, and their well-being as the supreme value to pursue, even at the expense of animal lives. While Harry's musings about sentient plants are a bit unhinged, he still could decide to become a vegetarian, just to stay on the safe side. He only considers the option when he thinks parselmouths can give sentience to snakes; but once he thinks that's not a thing, he happily goes back to eating meat. He doesn't stop wondering about whether animals could have sentience /without/ magical interventions; he gives it for granted. In other words, sentience is seen as an on/off switch, something that you either have (humans) or don't (animals) instead of a continuum. This is a view pretty common in rationalist fiction (and in a lot of science fiction in general, especially of the old type, the kind Rational!Harry in fact read during his formative years).
