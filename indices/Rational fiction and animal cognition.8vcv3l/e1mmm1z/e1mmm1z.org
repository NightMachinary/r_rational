  Just curious as this is a trend I noted.

What genres of fiction are you *not* seeing this trend? It's curious to me that you'd call Rational Fiction out specifically for its insensitivity to non-human suffering while you cite examples like HPMOR where there IS such consideration (even if you consider the amount insufficient), and where the latest chapter of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9794740/57/Pokemon-The-Origin-of-Species][The Origin of Species]] is still on the front page and well upvoted.

My instinct is this problem exists across *most* fiction not specific to pursuit of the cause of animal rights, and that Rational Fiction is doing better on average to notice the problem.
