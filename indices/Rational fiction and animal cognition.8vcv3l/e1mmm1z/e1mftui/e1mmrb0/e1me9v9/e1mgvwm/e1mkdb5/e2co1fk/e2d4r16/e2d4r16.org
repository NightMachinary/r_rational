I think the most unreasonable part about that is that it ignores how discovery and problem solving actually work - there's always some need for serendipity and mixing up of different experiences and ideas to find good solving strategies. You can't expect to just toss money and time only at a single problem and then move on to the next one when that's solved. If we did it for world hunger, by the time that was solved and we moved on to, say, climate change, we'd have lost all the know how and experience in the latter's field due to focusing too much on something else for too long, not to say how the two problems actually are tangled together and can't just be separated easily.

Besides that, it's not just that humans aren't that coordinated, you'd literally need a hive mind. If I'm suffering from, say, diabetes, /my/ interest is that someone researches diabetes. Because that's what will improve /my/ life. So even if that's not optimal for humanity as a whole, it's optimal for me, and I will push for it. The balance that comes out is due to this interplay between collective and individual interests.
