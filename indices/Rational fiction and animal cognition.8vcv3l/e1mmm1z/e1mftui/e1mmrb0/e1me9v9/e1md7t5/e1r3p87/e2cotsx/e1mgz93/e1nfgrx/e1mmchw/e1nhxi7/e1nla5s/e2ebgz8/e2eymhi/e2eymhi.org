  This is too broad. I think waste is bad.

Maybe you are not most people. Let's test it: Watch those [[https://youtu.be/uaqRzWft_b4?t=2m29s][sheep]] and [[https://youtu.be/AkWNVu-gT10?t=2m27s][the black goat getting killed]] (just keep in mind, the video is made by the farmers who killed the animals, so it would be very unlikely, that you see a slaughter where something goes wrong. And I guess the price of the meat will be higher than most people are willing to pay.)

Still you get comments like:

  It was quick. Although, if I were there, I would have requested the butcher bring 1 lamb in at a time, then hide the body so the other doesnt see or even have the chance to get nervous. This is part of nature, yet I cried. Its good to have emotions about this.I feel that it was important for me to watch this video. It is humbling. It makes me feel gratitude for the animals I eat.ï»¿

The person eats animals, and still cried over it. And that was an example of organic farmers who put the video online themselves. You also see many people saying organic treats animal better, so it is okay for them to eat meat. Even setting aside if they really only eat organic meat, their whole justification would fall away, if conventional meat would be prohibited. How I see it, you are either okay to kill animals for food (you don't need to be healthy) or you aren't. If you are okay to kill, you should also be okay to mistreat them in some other way (small cages, force feeding, [[https://anonymous.org.il/dabbach][hitting them so they move, breaking their tail so they move into the slaughterhouse]] )

But yeah maybe I should change "most people" to at least over 50% of people I talked with about this topic said to me killing animals is bad.

Anyhow, did you watch the videos before reading this question? Did you think about how much of the animal got wasted?

  I'm not saying you're wrong about people believing this, but it's rather backward.

If I didn't communicate the dismissive subtext, let me be clear: I don't believe this bs about souls. I also meant it more in the direction of: some people don't eat meat because some fantasy being told them not to do. (Christians think it is okay, because their fantasy being wont kill them for it. It promised with rainbows.)

Anyhow, I mentioned "souls and stuff" because some people justify eating meat with animals don't have souls. And some say, you have to be nice to animals because they have souls. But you can be mean to plants and rocks and other stuff, cause they don't have souls.

So basically, don't expect someone in believing in souls to make sense.

But just to counter the point. If you traumatize someone with a soul, that is more impactful than traumatizing an intelligence that doesn't. Even if they don't feel pain, the betrayal of their caretaker, who killed them, should have high consequences.

Anyhow, if you think waste is bad, what do you think about wasting human meat? Is it more important to don't waste meat than to not waste plants, because of the resources invested in "producing" them? What if recycling/using it, so it wouldn't get wasted, would waste more resources, than just throwing it away? (My justification to throw away food. If I eat it, I would get more overweight and would probably waste more resources for drugs.)
