Well, it is always a conflict of interest if you keep animals for eggs or milk or wool.

If the reason doesn't have to be ethical, I would say first the price. Do you know what you pay for each egg?

And another reason is, that I didn't eat eggs before I went vegan. I ate cookies where they used eggs. And I doubt the eggs in the cookies where from backyard chicken. And it would be very hard to verify restaurants using backyard chicken.

Anyhow, if I had backyard chickens, I would give the excess eggs away to people who would buy eggs instead. (Like my grandmother.)

Well, there are also other problems, like what happened to the male chicks (most only buy female ones) or what happens to the old chicken... But let's just say that wouldn't be the case for backyard chicken. (At least yours.)
