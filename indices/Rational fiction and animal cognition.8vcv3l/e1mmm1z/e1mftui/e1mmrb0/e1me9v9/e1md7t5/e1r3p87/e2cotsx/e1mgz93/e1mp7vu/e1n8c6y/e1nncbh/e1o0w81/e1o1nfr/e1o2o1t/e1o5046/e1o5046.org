I had already tried cutting milk and dairy once, though perhaps not for long enough. It was kind of troublesome. For n-3s, I already eat salmon, so maybe I'm fine, though here's the vegetarianism problem - if I wanted to be a full vegetarian (right now I just don't eat meat, but not fish), that would not be an option. With legumes and grains maybe I can make an effort to reduce, at least. Does stuff like pasta or pizza count too because it's made with flour?
