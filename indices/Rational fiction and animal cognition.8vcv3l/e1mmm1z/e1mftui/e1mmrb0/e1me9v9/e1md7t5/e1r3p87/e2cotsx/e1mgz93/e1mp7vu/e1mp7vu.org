  Heck, I can live cheaper and healthier on a vegan diet.

Nitpick warning: /Maybe/ cheaper, but certainly not healthier. At least not /necessarily/ so, since you mentioned cookies as your alternative to vegan meals instead of steaks, omelettes, and yoghurts.

I've studied nutrition science and specialized diets a lot and have personally tested both paleo and vegan diets. From research, I can say with strong confidence that a balanced diet that includes meat, fish, and eggs is superior to a balanced diet that does not. Even achieving the latter is difficult enough to constitute a non-trivial cost in time, effort, and stress that can't be ignored in the decision process.

And from personal experience, I can say that veganism causes people to make very questionable food choices in order to hit their daily caloric energy needs. Most vegans (and a lot of vegetarians) end up with:

- a way higher intake of nutrition-lacking (and sometimes nutrition-leaching) grains than is healthy
- huge amounts of polyunsaturated fats (n-6 primarily) that are the main contributing factors to heart disease, metabolic syndrome, and chronic low-grade systemic inflammation
- and a lacking and/or incomplete amino acid profile

So at a certain point, there is indeed a tradeoff between personal health concerns (not just dietary enjoyment) and ethical concerns related to the meat/egg/milk industries. While I don't think it's right to just ignore it because of taste/enjoyment concerns, I think that most people who eat a "healthy" diet that includes those things rather than a standard vegan diet are at the very least /inadvertently/ making a justifiable decision.

For me personally, I decided that the costs (negative health impact + time + effort + stress) are more significant than the ethical concerns. That said, if I could switch to lab-grown meats for example with the only difference being a 2-3x cost increase, I would do it. But not for a 5x+ cost increase.

As long as people think the issue through and establish their own value balance (or make a justified and informed decision to follow the advice of someone who knows enough to do so), I'd say there isn't much of a problem with ignoring it from that point onward.
