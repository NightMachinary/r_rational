First of all, as a disclaimer, only about half of my comment was really aimed at you specifically; I kinda just started ranting on the general topic once I got started.

Semi-related: If you're taking vitamin D because everyone's deficient (I do too btw) I recommend adding magnesium (any kind other than oxide) for the exact same reason. I take 400mg of before bed every night and it's an actual /noticeable/ difference which is rare for vitamin/mineral supplements.

  As long as you know you are doing something unethical
#+end_quote

Right. Just to clarify my point a bit though, I think it's a spectrum of /how bad/ it is ethically and what the tradeoff is. I'd feel way more guilty eating dolphins or killer whales than I would for cows, and I feel more guilty eating cows than chickens, and chickens > plants. I can accept the ethical issues for the reasons I already stated, but if circumstances were to change (cows found to be as smart as dolphins!?), I would naturally have to change my actions too. I agree that I think some people use sentience as a binary operator, and while sentience is definitely a VERY important threshold, it's not the /only/ one.

  can you give me sources for the negative health impact. Like for incomplete amino acid profile
#+end_quote

No sources right now, but this just stems from the fact that animal protein is always a "complete" protein (all the EAAs in most suitable proportion for digestion and use) whereas plant protein is often "incomplete". The classic example is that rice+beans together provides the complete EAA spectrum if you eat them in an exact proportion. Given that a person just eats "anything that fits the diet" (even if they're counting macronutrients), they likely will be getting insufficient amounts of certain EAAs. Like you may be eating 40g protein in a day, but if (made-up numbers incoming) 1/8 of that would have been a certain EAA if you'd eaten "complete" animal protein, you might only be getting 1/3 the amount of that EAA in actuality. That's what I meant. I don't know actual studies on how this affects vegans in real life, but there are definitely studies out there that analyze the effect of being deficient in certain EAAs. The reason they're "essential" is because your body can't make them from other amino acids.

  are you comparing a unhealthy vegan diet to a healthy omnivore diet?
#+end_quote

Haha, good point. I think I actually was doing that a bit subconsciously, because most people on specialty diets don't really care much what they eat as long as it fits the specialty diet (and for those who do slightly better, as long as it fits the specialty diet + macronutrient ratios). (People on fad diets especially have this problem). The main point I was getting at is that an omnivore diet will naturally avoid some problems that can crop up with special restrictive diets like the EAA issue.

  why do vegans have less heart dieseases when they eat "huge amounts of polyunsaturated fats"
#+end_quote

That's compared to the average person, and the average person is unhealthy. If I had to guess, I'd say /anyone/ on a specialty diet (unless it's a really stupid one) will likely have improved health markers over the average person. So I don't think this fact can be used to prove that "huge amounts of PUFAs" is not a problem. There are lots of studies that show that it /is/ in fact a problem. Now, that's not to say omnivores are immune to this problem---not by any means. It's a huge problem universally in the West.

More about PUFAs

When I was testing vegan diets, I noticed it was difficult to eat enough fat to hit my macronutrient goals without also overdosing on PUFAs. Unfortunately, there are almost no plant sources of saturated fats (which are /not/ bad for you and are your body's preferred source of fat for fuel purposes). The only options are coconut and palm oil. Aside from that, sources of monounsaturated fats without also having lots of PUFAs are limited to macadamia (almost pure mono) and olive oils (still about 10% PUFA). Canola is 20% PUFA which is too much. Vegans (and even paleo, regular vegetarians, and omnivores even) who eat salads with lots of salad dressings, especially those who use things like sesame oil (IIRC, ~40% PUFA) will end up getting too much which leads to heart disease, metabolic syndrome, high LDL/VLDL, etc, etc. It's just /more/ of a problem for vegans because they don't have convenient sources of non-problematic fats like omnivores do.

There are other problems that can crop up in highly-restrictive diets (including but not limited to vegan) but that are smaller problems with omnivorous diets since they're drowned out in the larger variety of food eaten. A big example is Phytic Acid from legumes and nuts which binds certain essential nutrients in your body and carries them out of the body through excretion. This means that just adding up the amount of nutrients your'e supposedly getting from the Nutrition Facts (like iron for example) doesn't actually represent how much your body actually has available to absorb, since a good amount of it can be tied up in Phytates. Omnivores may eat nuts or legumes, but much less often do they constitute a large enough part of their diet for this factor to make a big difference. Whereas paleo and vegans who both tend to go heavier on nuts and/or legumes are more susceptible to this.

I think the bottom line point I was trying to make is that if you're really trying to eat "healthy", it's just overall easier to do with a generic "healthy" omnivorous diet than with specialty diets given an equal amount of time and effort you're willing to spend. From all my research and experience, my personal opinion is that if you are fully committed to micromanaging all of the little details like the ones I've mentioned, a Paleo diet is actually the healthiest. (It's certainly the one I felt the best on.) Of course, a /well-micromanaged/ Vegan diet can be /way/ healthier than a generic "healthy" omnivorous diet, but it does take quite a bit more work to avoid the issues introduced by having to work around the restrictions of the diet itself.

And that's where the "stress" factor came from. Not so much a distinct issue as it is a consequence of having to spend the extra time and effort micromanaging all the little things that you don't have to worry about /as much/ with an omnivorous diet.

(btw, I'm enjoying this discussion. Thanks!)
