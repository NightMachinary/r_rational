  There is no one 'Paleo diet
#+end_quote

Of course not. It's a specially restrictive diet, not a specially inclusive diet. The idea about it is what you /don't/ eat. Almost no primitive cultures ate grains or legumes until about 10,000 years ago for example and we're far less well adapted to eating them than for other foods. I even included butter and yoghurt in my paleo diet when I was on it because even if they weren't common paleolithic foods, they didn't' contain anything that was overtly harmful and they fit both my macro and micronutrient goals.

  I'm also not sure what you are talking about polyunsaturated fats
#+end_quote

Specifically, omega-6 (n-6) fats are not good for you. They oxidize far too easily even once eaten, they create an inflammatory response in your body (whereas n-3 fats create an anti-inflammatory response). You need a certain amount of them as building blocks for certain hormones and signaling molecules, but if you overeat them, they're used in places they shouldn't be which causes the health problems I mentioned in the previous posts. Your link is not a valid source, sorry.

  Expert panels in the United States and Europe recommend that pregnant and lactating women consume higher amounts of polyunsaturated fats than the general population to enhance the DHA status of the fetus and newborn

Yes, exactly. DHA is an omega-3, which is a PUFA, but you'll never get DHA by accident. It doesn't exist in vegetable oils. Only certain fish oils contain it. Your body can make a small amount of it from ALA (the lowest grade of omega-3 found in food, and rarely at that.). When people talk about PUFAs as a health risk, they're talking about omega-6. It's ubiquitous in nut and seed oils and shows up in processed foods. It's one of the main reasons processed foods are considered unhealthy.
