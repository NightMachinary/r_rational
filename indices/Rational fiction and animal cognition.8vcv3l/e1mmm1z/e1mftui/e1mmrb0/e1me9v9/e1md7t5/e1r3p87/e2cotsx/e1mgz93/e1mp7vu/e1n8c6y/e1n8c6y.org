  Maybe cheaper, but certainly not healthier.

Okay my own fault, for using a word like healthy...

Healthy eating is for me getting enough calories, with the right mix of macro nutritions (protein, fat, carbohydrates) and having all your Vitamins and stuff (I take Vit B12 pills, cause cheaper than buying soymilk with it added. And Vit D, cause 90% of the whole population don't get enough. And sometimes I eat a Multivitamin for vegans, cause effervescent tablets(?) are funny to put on your tongue)

Anyhow, I didn't want to claim I eat healthy now. That's why I mentioned the cookies. But I claim /I/ can live healthier on a vegan diet and I did. I still eat healthier than I did before I went vegan.

  For me personally, I decided that the costs (negative health impact + time + effort + stress) are more significant than the ethical concerns.

Wasn't the point here. As long as you know you are doing something unethical, my point (they say animals are not sentient, cause they want to feel ethical okay) doesn't matter to you.

But since you mentioned a strawmen vegan diet, can you give me sources for the negative health impact. Like for incomplete amino acid profile (how do you know the profile of most vegans from personal experience? Or any study?), why do vegans have less heart dieseases when they eat "huge amounts of polyunsaturated fats " [[https://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/HealthyLiving/HealthyEating/Vegetarian-Diets_UCM_306032_Article.jsp?appName=MobileApp][Too lazy to find a study: "Many studies have shown that vegetarians seem to have a lower risk of obesity, coronary heart disease (which causes heart attack), high blood pressure, diabetes mellitus and some forms of cancer."]]

I mean honestly, are you comparing a unhealthy vegan diet to a healthy omnivore diet? I mean there is clearly some bias behind that argument. How about comparing the diet of vegans and omnivores (=nice word for meat eater)? Or the diet you would have as a vegan and you have as an omnivore. Seems more fair.

Also maybe you only see vegans eat, when they are at (non-vegan) restaurants and don't have many choices. The question would be how often they eat there.

And I can tell you from personal experience, that the time and effort were way less than I expected. (And I have no clue what you mean with stress.) The negative health impact is new to me, would be interested in a source.
