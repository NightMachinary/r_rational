I don't really know, but i found an article that says [[https://www.eatthis.com/oreo-filling/]["That being said, using simple methods of deduction, we were able to gleam from the ingredient list that the filling is likely made of sugar, palm and/or canola oil, high fructose corn syrup, soy lecithin, and artificial flavor."]]

Apparently before they switched, it was originally pig lard, so I guess it was /never/ cream.
