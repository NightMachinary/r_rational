Killer whales are top predators - they number in the thousands and reproduce slowly. Even just one vampire nibbling on one every two or three days would be enough to put a significant dent in their population numbers. They're just not meant to be hunted at all, they're not like rabbits or mice whose main strategy is to just Zerg rush the biosphere.

And besides that, I'd still feel bad about killing even one single killer whale because they're way too smart for me to do something like that comfortably. We're talking human child level intelligence, probably. I'd find it really hard to believe they don't have subjective experience like we do.
