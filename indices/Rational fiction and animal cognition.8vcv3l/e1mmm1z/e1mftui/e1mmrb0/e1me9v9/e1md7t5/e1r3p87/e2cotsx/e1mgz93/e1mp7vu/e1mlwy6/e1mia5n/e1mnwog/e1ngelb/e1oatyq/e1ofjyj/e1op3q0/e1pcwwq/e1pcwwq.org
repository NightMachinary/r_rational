Oh, yeah, I don't have doubts about the ice cream (well, I had some vegan ice cream that I didn't like the other day but I think that was because of some weird preparation method, it looked more like sorbet, without any milk-ish substance at all. My gf had one at a different taste and it was delicious). Oreos being vegan surprises me, I thought that cream inside had milk stuff or butter in it! What's it made of?
