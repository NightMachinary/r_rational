  He wasn't concerned about reasoning plants until he heard about a story with an ability he thought was similar to Parseltongue which applied to plants.

What ability? He heard the story about a snake getting information from other snakes. And spreading self-awareness. [[http://www.hpmor.com/chapter/48][Read chapter 48 again]] And then asked about other animals and then plants.

And stories as evidence? RHarry didn't even believe his magic teacher how spells are supposed to be cast. (Giving Hermione false spell incantations.) Or that "...after all, snakes couldn't really be human-level intelligent, someone would have noticed by now."

Anyhow, the "plants have feeling" argument is quite stupid. Even for RHarry in his fantasy world. The ""Parseltongue" was probably just a linguistic user interface for controlling snakes..." is also quite stupid and pure rationalization.

I mean, if I give you the power to understand [[https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/8vbx4q/i_think_the_last_bark_was_sorry/][this]] or [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4Dfa4fOEY][this]] or [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbpXM4CgRwk][this]] would you think you gave them self awareness? Or maybe you just found out they were really always able to speak. (And yeah, except for the first, I'm pretty sure they didn't communicate.) Or if you learn German, would you think German is just a linguistic user interface for controlling Germans...

Btw he discarded it after finding out mandrakes can speak... Not sure if they kill them for the potion in HPMOR.

I still think it was stupid. But yeah the "head injury" was only to make a joke. I mean everyone should know, it wasn't a real head injury.

I don't expect to convince anyone on the internet to go vegan or of anything else. Not even on [[/r/rational][r/rational]]. So I think the perceived hyperbole didn't hurt anyone.
