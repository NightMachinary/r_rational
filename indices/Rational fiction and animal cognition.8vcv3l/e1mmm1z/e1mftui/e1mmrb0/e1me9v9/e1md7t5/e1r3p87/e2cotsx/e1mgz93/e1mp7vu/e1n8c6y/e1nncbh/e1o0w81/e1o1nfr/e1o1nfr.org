  I agree that that's frustrating, but you can't really blame them though. They're trained to look for the cause, not contributing factors. Most doctors aren't even all that well informed about nutrition science, so they couldn't make these suggestions even if they wanted to.

Oh, I know. A single human being, even with the most trivial diseases, would be a rather complex scientific system to study. Obviously, doctors need to maximise /everyone's/ average health; I want to maximise /mine/. Hence our objectives overlap but don't coincide XD.

Where are those found, exactly?

Anyway, the asthma may as well be from living in one of the most polluted areas in the UK + in a shitty mouldy home. Sounds sensible. But I've been wondering if the change in diet might not have contributed, since I didn't really plan it or discuss it with any experts (though it's at least been gradual). I also get the impression that doctors don't want to be /nosy/ - feel like they're interfering in what might be personal/ethical/religious life choices. Personally I'd just want the full information there, so I can make my decisions for myself. Saying "this thing is not healthy" needn't be judgemental, it's just a statement of fact. But maybe some people would give them grief over something as simple as that.
