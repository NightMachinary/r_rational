  I mean, if I give you the power to understand this or this or this would you think you gave them self awareness?

Self-awareness is not so big a hurdle. I doubt you need human-equivalent computational ability to jump that one. I don't think I could argue convincingly that snakes are self-aware right now, but dogs or cats, yeh, I'd be willing to take that on... without at the same time granting them human-equivalent awareness.
