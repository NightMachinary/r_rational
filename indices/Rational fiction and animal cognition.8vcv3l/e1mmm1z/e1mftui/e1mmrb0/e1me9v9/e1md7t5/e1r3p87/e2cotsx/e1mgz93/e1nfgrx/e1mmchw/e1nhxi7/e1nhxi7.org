Well,

  After he'd gotten over the raw shock, Harry's common sense had woken up and hypothesized that "Parseltongue" was probably just a linguistic user interface for controlling snakes...

  ...after all, snakes couldn't really be human-level intelligent, someone would have noticed by now.

Not really what I would call a rational argument. It is clearly a rationalization, so RHarry can still eat meat without feeling guilty. (And by extension the author and readers can.) So the authors emotion trumps the logical thinking.

Most people think killing animals is bad. They also think they are good people. And if you ask them why they meat, they will make some faulty excuses ("They are already dead," "They taste good," and other stuff), while the real reason is, they never thought about it before. They never made a real decision. Well sometimes you find people that did that, but they had to decide to change or stick with the status quo. And intelligent people are just better at making excuses.

Well, there are some rationalizations I read over the years, why you should treat animals right (aka don't eat them) even if they are not sentient biological machines:

- cause if you mistreat animal machines, you could become mean and mistreat humans

- cause you could upset other humans who are stupid and don't believe animals are machines

- cause eating animals is unhealthy (at least in the amount the western society does now on average)

- something religious about souls and stuff

Sorry for the bad english and no sources... I don't think I would have found those arguments again with googling and not in english anyway.
