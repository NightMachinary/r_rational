They are definitely slower in water than on land, but swimming speed is greatly influenced by strength, and they have that in spades. An early test involved Alice - a small female - picking up a six foot thick fallen tree, dancing a jig while holding it over her head, then tossing it in the air and planting it.

And "easily" swimming an ocean doesn't mean it's immediate. But they don't age, don't get tired, and don't need to breathe. So, it's easy.
