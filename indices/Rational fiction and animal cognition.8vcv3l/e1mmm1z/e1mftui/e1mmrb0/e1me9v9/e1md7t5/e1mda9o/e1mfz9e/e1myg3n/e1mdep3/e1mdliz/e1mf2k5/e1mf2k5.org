The vampires are super-strong and fast, to the point where they can swim through the entire Atlantic Ocean without too much effort, plus they have empowered senses, so while it /did/ seem weird to me that she'd find them, it wasn't /completely/ unbelievable, and certainly I'd buy that she could put them down without danger to herself. What I found weird is that not even once she wondered whether they could possibly just go extinct as a result of her feeding habits.
