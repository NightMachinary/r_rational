Something I found interesting about that story is that the plot is set in motion by the protagonists needing convincing animal actors in a film-equivalent, but even in the current year deepfakes exist and are convincing, and it doesn't cost much to set them up. Surely the far future would have even more sophisticated ways of faking video for free. It comes across as a bit of an anachronism, like when spaceships in old scifi have big hulking switches to throw or buttons to press.
