Film is art, and part of the form of art is the substrate you're using to create it with. That's why we have things like CG film, hand drawn animation, puppet stop motion, and live action. In their time period, even though CGI could probably be indistinguishable from real life, they probably want to make an artistic statement by imaging real objects. It kind of fits with the 'documentary about the past' kind of thing.
