  The vampires are super-strong and fast, to the point where they can swim through the entire Atlantic Ocean without too much effort

Wait, what? I'm to believe they can swim (or run on water, or fuck, maybe they just flap their arms and fly?) at thousands of miles an hour? Were they actually stated to be that fast in twilight canon (which I also didn't read)? because that seems like the worst kind of wank.
