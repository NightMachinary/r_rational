Well, about going vegan, I suspect it'd make significantly /harder/ to stay healthy, though not impossible, as you'd have to spend more time on your diet and balance it more carefully. Some people might be actually unable to survive on it depending on metabolism, I don't know. And there's a social aspect - ultimately it all boils down to quality of life and time, which means, are you willing to sacrifice a fraction of your /own/ life for the sake of the lives of animals?

Here's the thing, I know the most coherent option would be that, but I'm still just a vegetarian because ultimately, it's just not realistic for the animal meat industry to disappear in my lifetime. If we compare animal husbandry to human slavery, we're not in the US right before the Civil War, we're in the middle of the Roman Empire running our entire society off it. At this stage, it'd basically save more animal suffering if you just convinced, say, three meat-eaters to eat one half of meat, eggs and dairy less than they do than if you convinced one single person to go full vegan (which would be much harder). It's not exactly ideal but it's a feedback loop - it's easier to transition to vegetarianism than to veganism, and we need society itself (restaurants etc. especially) to start being more supportive of veganism before all the cultural barriers are removed.

Concerning extinction: true only if you consider the individual well being of members of the species. Biodiversity in itself is a a value, and it translates into resilience of the whole biosphere to sudden change. You remove one species, you never know what crazy domino effect that could set up. Humans are the obvious exception as, let's face it, everyone else would be probably better off without us. Well, except for cats, dogs, rats and pigeons, who would meet a drastic reduction in numbers after losing their main source of food, and all the abandoned domestic animals like cows and pigs who are so selected and inbred they're now unfit to living in the wild.

As for this:

  btw eating whales would be ethical better than eating chicken.

Questionable, by this logic you could make an argument for cannibalism as well, since humans too weigh more than chicken. It's not just about how many individuals, but /who/ the individuals are. If we acknowledge value approximately proportional to sentience, keeping humans as our main concern, then killer whales, other dolphins and chimpanzees are right below. It's hard to decide how many chicken are worth one killer whale - birds are smart too after all, but I don't think chicken are especially so. Domestic animals are usually also less clever than their wild cousins, and chickens haven't even been selected for intelligence like some dogs, so they might as well be completely demented.
