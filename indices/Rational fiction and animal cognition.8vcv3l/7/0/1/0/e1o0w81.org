  Ok, this actually interests me personally, what kind of inflammation are we talking about?
#+end_quote

Examples would be: nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), cardiovascular disease, obesity, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), rheumatoid arthritis, and Alzheimer's disease (AD). [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3335257/][source]] And while athsma is not listed there, it is indeed an inflammatory pathology, so while I don't think it would /cure/ you, I think it might indeed help.

The reason for this is that your body "wants" an approximate 4:1 ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (hereafter n-6 and n-3 PUFAs respectively). However, modern western diets have an average of 15-30:1 ratio of n-6:n-3 instead. That means your body uses n-6 as a building block in places it shouldn't. n-6 PUFAs are precursors to many proinflammatory markers, and n-6 PUFAs inhibit the anti-inflammatory effect of n-3s. You need both, and you're supposed to have more n-6 than n-3, but we eat WAY too much n-6 because of use of vegetable/nut/seed oils and processed foods. The relevant dietary intervention is to supplement EPA/DHA (the only /usable/ omega-3s. Humans can't do much with plant-based omega-3s, unlike some other animals) and to drastically cut down on polyunsaturated fats (because any PUFAs you're getting inadvertently from food is almost guaranteed to be n-6, since n-3 is so rare).

Studies have been done showing improved health markers including lowered systemic inflammation and decrease in severity of inflammatory pathologies simply by supplementing EPA and DHA and bringing your n-6:n-3 ratio closer to 4:1. Keep in mind that that there's a lot of evidence on this topic, but we still don't understand the complex interplay here completely. My best-informed guess though (and I consider myself quite well-informed on this topic) is that this is one of the more significant dietary health interventions a person on a standard western diet can make. I avoid random PUFAs like the plague.

  The doctors never really investigate much those things or... anything that's not obviously immediately connected to the issue at hand, really

I agree that that's frustrating, but you can't really blame them though. They're trained to look for /the cause/, not /contributing factors/. Most doctors aren't even all that well informed about nutrition science, so they couldn't make these suggestions even if they wanted to.

Anyway, the n-6 PUFA issue is somewhat separate from the grains/legumes issue, so those are 2 different possible dietary interventions you could try to improve your health. The Omega-6 one is all but guaranteed to improve your health markers on official blood tests but from personal experience may not be as directly noticeable on a day-to-day basis. If you just /barely/ have asthma though, there is a chance it could tip the scales favorably, so I'd still recommend giving it a shot.

Cutting out grains/legumes is a more drastic intervention, mainly because is almost necessarily means that you'll be drastically decreasing your carbohydrate intake and will have to put quite a bit more effort into meal planning, but you should totally try it if you're not satisfied with your current daily health situation. It can be a very noticeable difference in daily subjective health and QoL. The main thing to keep in mind is that cutting grains and legumes requires an adjustment period of about 2 weeks during which you may feel a bit shitty as your body re-adapts to using fat as its primary fuel source rather than carbohydrates. This is sometimes hyperbolically called the "low-carb flu," so you have to be committed to lasting this out if you want to try it.

Humans didn't eat grains or legumes heavily until 10,000 years ago, so we're way less well adapted to them than for other foods. It's actually been hypothesized that a significant portion of modern dental problems are actually a result of us switching to a grain-based diet.

Anyway, if you decide to try cutting grains/legumes, check out "paleo diet" recipes for inspiration. But remember that it's just inspiration---you're not going full paleo just from this one intervention, so continue doing whatever you normally do when it comes to butter, yogurt, and other dairy products as well as anything else a paleo diet may try to limit.

I'm actually against cutting butter/yogurt out of your diet unless you don't react well to them. At the very least, butter and yogurt are tolerable to almost everyone and have great nutrition profiles, so if you /can/ eat them, you should. That said, I've actually heart of people who cut dairy (milk specifically) in order to get rid of asthma. If you have a low-grade milk allergy (aka: If you don't tolerate dairy products well), asthma could indeed be one of the possible side effects, since it's an inflammatory disorder and allergies lead to inflammation. So this is a 3rd possible intervention you could look at, and is one of the easiest ones to test.

Just remember to only make 1 dietary intervention at a time so you can tell what's actually making a difference.

Feel free to ask any more questions if you have them. Cheers!
