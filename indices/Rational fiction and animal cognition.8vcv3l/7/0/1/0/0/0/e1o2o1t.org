    supplement EPA/DHA

  Where are those found, exactly?

Cold-water fatty fish. Salmon and Herring are the best, then trout and cod and tuna to a much lesser extent. The old wives tale of "spoonfuls of cod liver oil" being healthy probably originated from this.

Realistically however, you should just take an EPA/DHA fish-oil supplement and cut out n-6s as much as possible. It's expensive and difficult to get EPA/DHA through your diet, and you also have to worry about bioaccumulated pollutants if you eat too much of certain kinds of fish.

  But I've been wondering if the change in diet might not have contributed
#+end_quote

It's entirely plausible that your diet did indeed contribute to the problem. Or conversely, that dietary interventions could /help/.

So yeah, the main 3 I'd recommend trying, in order of decreasing /easiness to test/ are:

- Cut milk (but not necessarily butter/yogurt. Maybe cut all dairy at first for the test, then if it happens to fix the problem, try re-introducing butter/yogurt)
- fix your n-3:n-6 ratio (You should do this anyway and keep at it even if it doesn't fix your asthma)
- cut grains and legumes (major intervention, but with highest potential to improve subjective health and quality of life)
