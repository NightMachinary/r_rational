Ok, this actually interests me personally, what kind of inflammation are we talking about? Both me and my gf have had health problems recently (more specifically, I've developed asthma, she's got acid reflux & such), so while there's a lot of other potential causes, I'm wondering if it'd be worth investigating whether our diet could be a cause (for example, we /do/ eat lots of grains and legumes). The doctors never really investigate much those things or... anything that's not obviously immediately connected to the issue at hand, really.
