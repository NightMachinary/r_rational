It's called rationalizing.

The authors don't want to stop eating meat and still feel like a decent human being, so they just say animals are not whatever*

/* word with no clear definition or stuff that doesn't matter for the ethics.

RHarry was in the same chapter more horrified that [[https://i.pinimg.com/736x/02/1b/17/021b171c0ba9c1a3a126750019d80a30--veganism-animal-rights.jpg][grass could be sentient]]. Even without evidence that they could be, except that he could talk with snakes. Well, he got a head injury as a baby...

I mean I looked for (ethical) reason to not go vegan, and didn't find any. Even the practical reasons against veganism (money, availability or cultural stuff) weren't really any concern. Heck, I can live cheaper and healthier on a vegan diet. (But I don't cause I'm lazy and like to eat cookies)

btw eating whales would be ethical better than eating chicken. (Cause you kill one individual for a ton of meat versus one individual for a kilo of meat.) A species going extinct is not a tragic thing in itself. Well, in most cases it is tragic, because the individuals starve to death or die in another horrible way, but if all humans choose to stop getting kids, that would be ethical okay with me.

Anyhow, either the authors want to eat meat and still think good of themselves or fears the reader will think it is vegan propaganda. And vegans should not decide over someone else's live... but meat eater can decide over animal lives, cause... Don't be judgy, bad vegan!
