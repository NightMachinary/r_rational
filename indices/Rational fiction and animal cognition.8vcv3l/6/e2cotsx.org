In the early stages of Luminosity, there aren't enough vampires for population depletion to be a real concern, and the very real challenge of not eating humans occupies Bella's attention once she's turned.

If you continue to the end of Radiance, where she's making longer-term plans, Bella actually does consider the impact of vampire diet on the world. She wants to make synthetic blood, breed fractional vampires that can survive on a wider variety of foods, and make use of all the blood currently being thrown away by the existing butchery industry. You can see some of this happening in Flashes.
