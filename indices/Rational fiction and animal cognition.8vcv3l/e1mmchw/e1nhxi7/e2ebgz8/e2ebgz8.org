  Most people think killing animals is bad.
#+end_quote

This is too broad. I think /waste/ is bad. So, killing for sport and failing to use the carcass, bad. The fact that farming animals is ecologically less efficient than farming plants, somewhat bad, although not with any moral urgency.

As a result, I tend to cook vegetarian or with very little meat, and I often eat vegetarian at restaurants, but I don't impose any hard rules on myself.

  something religious about souls and stuff
#+end_quote

I'm not saying you're wrong about people believing this, but it's rather backward. The whole idea of a soul is that it outlives your body, right? So killing an intelligence that has a soul would logically have much /less/ impact than killing an intelligence that doesn't.
