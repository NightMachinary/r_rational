Rational fiction prioritizes intelligence over emotion, and the only real reason to treat animals right (besides environmental reasons) is empathy.

I'm not advocating that we should all become psycopaths, I'm just telling you many author's reasoning.

Edit: It was wrong to put words i to many authors mouths. And yes, I now see that my logic about not killing others also applies to humans. Sorry about that.
