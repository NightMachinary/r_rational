  I'll probably use the mechanic sparingly, but it's nice to have in the toolbox. Thanks.

As a bonus, at low level (four weeks inside, three weeks outside, sort of thing) it also serves as an explanation for any potential schedule slips, if any of your players is the sort to carefully count the days.

  The other issue here is trust. It's rare, but shapeshifters and brain-slugs are real. Every wanderer is an unknown, possibly existential, danger that's hiding as a human. Likewise, civs don't really have to play an iterated prisoner's dilemma with each other.

I can see a cautious civilisation devising a series of simple tests (such as, say, pouring salt into a visitor's ear to see if that kills any brain-control slugs). These tests will presumably only be effective on a proportion of Horrors, and many of these tests will turn out on close examination to be utterly useless, or a consequence of a hazing tradition, or (rarely) a flimsily disguised means of putting the local brain-slugs into any visitors.

Then you also have the rare case of an immortal shapeshifter who really /doesn't/ want to mess with people and actually just wants to live in peace with his neighbours, perhaps feeding gently off their emotions, like some sort of creature that literally lives on happiness...

  This is what was going on when one of the characters mentioned their god's 'lineage'. They can grow to be different enough to be separate entities, though they're still generally thought of as related to each other.

Hmmm. So, if Dr. Evil manages to take a few shards off into nearby bubbles, push them towards a desired alignment of Chaotic Evil a bit while they're weak then bring them back to the main bubble, rinse and repeat... he could, eventually, given time and effort - and a /lot/ of time - try to influence the god /as a whole/ to his preferred alignment?

(Of course, the god in question will likely object to being influenced in such a manner and send off paladins or something to Deal With him)

  There's no way to make a new god out of a fragment that's diverged too much. New gods usually happen when a god is dense in more than one bubble and some of those bubbles drift away and diverge.

Can the fragments not grow, given time and a suitable environment? ('Time' meaning perhaps a few centuries or so)
