  The different worlds have changed over time; and some natural forces may be different (e.g. some worlds may have no gravity). It's unclear whether this is a fundamental change in the laws of nature, or whether it's just that some worlds don't contain the raw mass to have measurable gravity.
#+end_quote

Cool. I've had the "change over time" idea in my setting notes since it's really important, but I wasn't really trying to leave clues to that effect. I love that you managed to just work backwards and figure that out.

#+begin_quote
  There's enough worlds - and they're often separate enough - that almost nothing affects them all. And a random connection is more than likely going to take you to a world that has never heard of your known history. (It's possible that there may some temporal distortion as well - going to a world through Gate A then back through Gate B could perhaps bring you back to the original universe before you left it).
#+end_quote

Yup. I don't have temporal distortions though, mostly because it'd be hell to run a campaign with either closed time loops or split timelines. I just can't handle that and still keep the 'rational' feel of the setting.

  Portals may take effort to hold open, collapsing (and re-connecting to somewhere else) on their own after some time. And there are enough people who have been cut off from what they consider home that there are always going to be wandering groups looking for a way home (or, at least, a way to a place that can become their new home).
#+end_quote

You're spot on about the wandering groups. Though I'm still trying to figure out how often wanderers end up creating new settlements vs joining other settlements.

I want them to be able to join existing settlements relatively often but the wanderers are just more mouths to feed for any group that's low-mid tech level. Food in particular can be really hard to source just because of the limited space.

High tech level groups tend to have food (aquaponics and hydroponics analogs) but they're rare since they either stumble onto /things/ or /things/ stumble onto them.

  Clerics have particular trouble, because the reach of the gods is not universal...
#+end_quote

Yup, this is part of why cleric-analogs tend to carry bits of their gods with them. God-shards also make for really adorable pets.
