  There's one sort of temporal shenanigan that's very straightforward to campaign with, and that's the Year Inside, Hour Outside situation; where you can never go from future to past, but you can step through a portal, spend a year training, and then go back to find only an hour has elapsed.

True. It would also be useful to have that be another great filter that kills higher tech civs. A group living in a fast-time bubble has huge problems sourcing enough stuff to survive from the surrounding slow-time area. I've got a bunch of other things that make it hard for high-tech civs to last (I want a lot of advanced ruins floating around, among other things) but more interesting variety in existential threat would be nice.

Likewise in the other direction, a slow-time area could just "freeze" something interesting for players to stumble upon later.

Hmm, I should avoid letting players get caught in a slow bubble. It'd make for a really bad player experience if they did a side-quest only to find the quest giver, and their entire civilization, is dead.

I'll probably use the mechanic sparingly, but it's nice to have in the toolbox. Thanks.

  That's probably going to depend on how fully inhabited your Realms are. Is a wandering group more likely to come across a settlement that will accept them, or an empty place where they can settle?
#+end_quote

In general they'll mostly find empty, but very forage-able, spots if they move a fixed distance from their start. Other side of that is, if they just sort of travel a random path for a while (say 20-30x the fixed distance), they have a good chance of stumbling onto another civilization. If the wanderers try to look at most of the portals in each bubble they go through and stick to larger bubbles (which have more portals) they'll end up seeing an immense amount of locations where they can look for signs of human life. This might take longer to pay off but if the group can keep moving it's a better strategy.

So, thinking out loud, it's a bunch of tradeoffs:

- *Movement Speed:* If your group can move fast then you want to wander, otherwise settle.
- *Defense Strategy:* If you can stand your ground then settle. If running away is your best defense then wander.
- *Ability to Build:* If you can build a settlement then you probably should, otherwise the choice is made for you.
- *Tech-Level / Skill Specialization:* People from higher tech-level civs will be more specialized, making them more valuable to other civs and less productive in new settlements.
- *Group Size:* Travel logistics is generally harder for a large group, so they'd want to settle, they're also more able to defend and build.

Which makes for a nice varied landscape of choices and, given how portals shift and chop bits off of civilizations, means there's a lot of room for random settlers to just walk in and lots of new tiny civs popping up. Cool.

  And once they have settled, will they accept other wandering settlers? (If they don't, their settlement is unlikely to last more than a few generations...)
#+end_quote

See, early on, when a civ is at a low tech-level and small then trustworthy wanderers are a huge boost to stability. On the other hand larger/higher-tech civs will find wanderers are just more mouths to feed, but those civs are also more likely to have a surplus.

I can see some larger civs developing a tradition of hospitality where they treat wanderers well because they'd want to be treated well. On the other hand I could also see them developing a culture that shuns wanderers as useless.

The other issue here is trust. It's rare, but shapeshifters and brain-slugs are real. Every wanderer is an unknown, possibly existential, danger that's hiding as a human. Likewise, civs don't really have to play an iterated prisoner's dilemma with each other.

At every level it's similar to a few-shot interaction between two agents, at least if they don't make an active choice to stick together. If you send a wanderer away you'll never see them again, their descendants will probably not see your descendants before both civs are lost to time. At the civ level, the bubbles can wander closer together letting them communicate and trade but they'll also eventually drift apart. At some point the distance between two civs will become large enough that maintaining the path between them is not really possible and they lose touch.

Really, it's all about the balance between risk, reward, trust, and accountability. I don't think it'll pan out the same way every time but should there be a bias?

Maybe I can just shrug and use that as an excuse to have a variety of cultures with different takes on hospitality and isolationism?

  If two shards have been apart for ten thousand years, both growing in different ways and experiencing different things in that time, then what happens when they suddenly and unexpectedly meet up again? Do they both share memories and experience a sharp alignment shift towards each other, or do they consider each other to be different gods by then?
#+end_quote

This is what was going on when one of the characters mentioned their god's 'lineage'. They can grow to be different enough to be separate entities, though they're still generally thought of as related to each other.

I have it so that gods have a sort of "density" in each bubble. If they're dense enough in a bubble, that god can exist independently of a cleric without eroding. If not then they need a cleric to protect the tiny fragment they carry. Plus all the "sufficiently similar" god bits in a bubble synchronize and become more alike.

So clerics can go back to one of their god's home bubbles to make sure their shards don't diverge too much and that their god's "primary self" gets any new memories. This also happens when a bunch of clerics for the same god gather in another bubble, all of those shards will synchronize too.

There's no way to make a new god out of a fragment that's diverged too much. New gods usually happen when a god is dense in more than one bubble and some of those bubbles drift away and diverge.
