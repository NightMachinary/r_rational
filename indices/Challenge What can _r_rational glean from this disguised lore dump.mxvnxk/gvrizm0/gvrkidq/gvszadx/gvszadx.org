So. You have... space-warping magics. Gates, bags of holding, and whatnot.

Sometime in the dim and distant past, these were overused, and space itself was /shattered/ into separate bubbles. People continued living (and non-people too, in a variety of ways) but space-warping magic became /harder/. Pre-existing Gates and so forth still worked, though. Well. More or less. A Gate has to connect to /somewhere/, but a connection can be severed; and when it is severed, then that Gate will (eventually, after a short interval) end up connecting to something else.

The different worlds have /changed/ over time; and some natural forces may be different (e.g. some worlds may have no gravity). It's unclear whether this is a fundamental change in the laws of nature, or whether it's just that some worlds don't contain the raw /mass/ to have measurable gravity.

There's enough worlds - and they're often separate enough - that almost nothing affects them /all/. And a random connection is more than likely going to take you to a world that has never heard of your known history. (It's possible that there may some temporal distortion as well - going to a world through Gate A then back through Gate B could perhaps bring you back to the original universe before you left it).

Portals may take /effort/ to hold open, collapsing (and re-connecting to somewhere else) on their own after some time. And there are enough people who have been cut off from what they consider home that there are /always/ going to be wandering groups looking for a way home (or, at least, a way to a place that can become their /new/ home).

Clerics have particular trouble, because the reach of the gods is /not/ universal...
