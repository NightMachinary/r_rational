This was very enjoyable, thanks. I'd be keen to read more.

The only thing I picked up on beyond the obvious is (from cannon) there's an implication that natural law might bleed across the jumps a little; if a severed jump reconnects to /anything/ but most jumps link similar places, that suggests they might even out over time.

Of course, there are alternative explanations. Maybe it's sampling bias: people don't tend to live in bubbles linked to very different places because they're hellholes. Perhaps previous civilisations have put the hard work in to join good bubbles together or the existing networks formed that way because of something the pre-cataclysm civilisation did.

Also: the average bubble is connected to almost 3 bubbles ("20 random jumps and he could be in a million worlds" taken literally implies an average of 2.95)
