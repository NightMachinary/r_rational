  Also: the average bubble is connected to almost 3 bubbles ("20 random jumps and he could be in a million worlds" taken literally implies an average of 2.95)

You have no idea how happy it makes me that someone actually did the math.

In story the protag is half using "million" in a poetic sense (i.e. "so huge it's basically infinite") and as an actual approximation that's optimized to be punchy. (since that's his style of storytelling)

My notes have the average as around 5.5 for an actual number of 14-ish million, if you assume that there's only a single path from where you are to any other bubble.

I want the actual number to be 5 or 6 million but I still need to work out what that means for how many short-ish paths there are between bubbles that are 2-3 jumps away. That ends up being important for how groups manage the area near their home bubble.
