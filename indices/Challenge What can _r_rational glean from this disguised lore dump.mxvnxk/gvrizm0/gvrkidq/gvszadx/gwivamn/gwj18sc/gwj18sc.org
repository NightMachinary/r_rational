  Yup. I don't have temporal distortions though, mostly because it'd be hell to run a campaign with either closed time loops or split timelines. I just can't handle that and still keep the 'rational' feel of the setting.

There's one sort of temporal shenanigan that's very straightforward to campaign with, and that's the [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YearInsideHourOutside][Year Inside, Hour Outside]] situation; where you can never go from future to past, but you can step through a portal, spend a year training, and then go back to find only an hour has elapsed.

  You're spot on about the wandering groups. Though I'm still trying to figure out how often wanderers end up creating new settlements vs joining other settlements.
#+end_quote

That's probably going to depend on how fully inhabited your Realms are. Is a wandering group more likely to come across a settlement that will accept them, or an empty place where they /can/ settle? And once they /have/ settled, will they accept other wandering settlers? (If they don't, their settlement is unlikely to last more than a few generations...)

  Yup, this is part of why cleric-analogs tend to carry bits of their gods with them. God-shards also make for really adorable pets.

If two shards have been apart for ten thousand years, both growing in different ways and experiencing different things in that time, then what happens when they suddenly and unexpectedly meet up again? Do they both share memories and experience a sharp alignment shift towards each other, or do they consider each other to be different gods by then?
