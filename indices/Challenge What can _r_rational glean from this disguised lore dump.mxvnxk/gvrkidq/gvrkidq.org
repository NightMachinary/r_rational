All I've got is that some previous civilization used space-warping tech/magic (pocket dimensions, teleportation gates, bags of holding) which eventually reached an unstable critical point that messed up space really bad, at a minimum of a country sized level. This created discrete bubbles of space, drawing from many worlds, some which were inhabited. Some of these bubbles are naturally inhospitable, or have native monsters. Travel between bubbles is relatively easy, but you move directly to adjacent bubbles?

The volumetrics part of the creation myth section is confusing, and it's not entirely clear how travel between bubbles works.
