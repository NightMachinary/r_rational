I read the first two snippets.

There was originally a single universe that got sundered into interconnected demi-planes called bubbles. Planar travel is possible via portals, and may have a cost low enough individuals can do it regularly. Portals can be manipulated via advanced technology, which is dangerous. Bubbles "want" a particular number of portals, in the way that atoms "want" eight electrons and will spontaneously connect to other bubbles if they have fewer than the proper number of portals. By default, bubbles are connected to other bubbles that are similar in some way. A -> B -> C, A is most similar to B, and less similar to C. If you disconnect a portal, the resulting new portal may connect to a very dissimilar bubble, which may contain bizarre dangers.
