I'm pretty eager to learn more about these Praxis vocations that can be 'installed' (which I think is just jargon for learned because I'm pretty sure I remember reading something about not being able to stitch vocations into someone's pith). If Tasia teaches Ana the multi-threading and time-dilation vocations, Ana could be an absolute monster. Also, am I misremembering, or was there a section that talked about how the more vocations you installed the sooner you would experience pith degeneration (essentially Alzheimer's)?
