Damn, Wes wasn't even in this chapter and it still managed to make me like him less. It was hard enough to root for him when achieving his goals would have meant Ana losing her one remaining friend, it's damn near impossible now that we've seen Tasia's side of things. It doesn't help matters that he just wants to go back to a time when his being a privileged alcoholic fuckup didn't have consequences, whereas Tasia actually has selfless goals she's tirelessly working towards with the resources she now has.

On a completely unrelated note, I'm pretty sure this is the first time we've had viewpoint character demonstrate that their life was different before Piths and projecting were revealed to the world at large, so that's pretty neat. It kinda felt weird that nobody was really acknowledging the fact that everybody should be able to remember what their life was like before the masquerade fell.

Sure, there have been a couple of stray comments like "we used to just wipe everyone's memories, but we can't do that anymore," but they've always had a sense of "society used to be different" rather than "my life was different." The former is an acknowledgements of historical fact, the latter is an expressions of lived experience. I'm glad we're finally seeing someone whose perspective has been so fundamentally shaped by the historic events they've lived through, rather than just being vaguely aware that they happened.
