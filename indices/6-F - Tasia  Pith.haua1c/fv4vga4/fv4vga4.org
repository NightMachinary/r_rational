A question for y'all: Other serials have discords for discussion and stuff, and I've gotten a question or two about that. However, I'm still not sure exactly how many people read this, or if that's something people want.

Would y'all be interested in a discord channel for Pith? If yes, I can set one up.

Thanks for reading!
