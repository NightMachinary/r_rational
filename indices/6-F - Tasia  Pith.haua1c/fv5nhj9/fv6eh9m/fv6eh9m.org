Is she? We know that she's doing worse than Tasia, and aside from mere tribalism and (from her perspective) Tasia being responsible for killing her former teamate and captain, I can see a real concern about having a teamate with unknown motivations having a close relationship with someone known to be under the enemy's thump. It's certainly plausible that Eliya or someone else on the team is in danger of eventual ousting.
