I certainly don't know. Qualia doesn't seem to actually do anything as far as my understanding of it can tell, and I doubt it actually exists. It seems as useless to me as the concept of a soul, created by people who would like to believe we are something more than biological machines but aren't satisfied with just self-awareness. But gene therapy would make a lot more sense than generations of discrimination or rounding people up in concentration camps like some of the responses to the prompt suggested, and it probably wouldn't hurt to have qualia, at least. I suppose people who got the therapy would be able to describe the difference it makes. In real life, of course, very few people seem to actually care about these philosophical issues except when it gives them an advantage to pretend to.
