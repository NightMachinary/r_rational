If it's just one gene it should be pretty easy, at least in a decade or two, to use gene therapy on anyone who didn't have it. Also, isn't self-awareness different from qualia? Self-awareness is just awareness of your own thoughts and existence. I don't think anyone who didn't have self-awareness would be able to operate on the same level as ordinary humans. Even some animals can pass the mirror test and all humans pass the mirror test after infancy.
