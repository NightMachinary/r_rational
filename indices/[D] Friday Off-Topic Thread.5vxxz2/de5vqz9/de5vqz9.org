[[http://www.drmaciver.com/2017/02/coin-tossing-and-adversary-resistant-priors/][Another thing about genies that I wrote recently]], but the genie is significantly less friendly and it's actually about how Bayesian priors should behave in the presence of an adversary.

It may be that this is well known stuff, but I haven't seen it discussed much, so links to related literature would be appreciated.
