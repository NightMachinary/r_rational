  Is it sensible and possible in the general case to separate your emotional connection to a topic from your reaction to it?
#+end_quote

Regarding possibility, yes. This is called [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_detachment][emotional detachment]]. Regarding sensibility, it depends. For first-line emergency responders, doctors, nurses, etc., it's essential to be able to detach from the horror and sadness of a situation and start taking action to resolve or mitigate the problem.

In other circumstances, there's a grey area. It's regarded as a disease if it makes you unhappy/depressed, or impedes your ability to empathize with others, or leads you to harm others. Of course, it does seem sensible to detach if it's for practical and benevolent reasons in situations where you would otherwise be unable to emotionally cope and continue functioning.

  Would eliminating this response be desirable, if it was even possible? In this case it seems benign, though I can see how an aversion to loss could be deleterious, but I think I would have come to the same decision even without the emotional response. It's practically mandated by my ethical philosophy to minimise death, and if that is not possible to minimise losses (information, emotional health, etc.) due to death.

I think you've made your point fairly well there. Yes, generalized emotional detachment/blunting tends to be a bad thing. Our emotions guide us in what we regard as good and bad, largely based on how those things make us and others feel. Death makes most people very unhappy to say the least, and that's what drives us to find ways to keep people alive for as long as possible.

That said, death is not the only problem. Quality of life is a huge issue which does not seem to be getting the attention that it needs. What good is life if you're crippled, bedridden, and suffering endless agonizing pain? In that context, death can be a blessing by comparison.

  I find it hard to reason about how my reasoning would function in the absence of emotional impulses. Many dystopian stories make it out to be a negative thing---tying emotion to ethics implicitly---but that seems a little nonsensical. Something doesn't become good just because it feels good, nor become bad because it feels bad.

I don't think this is actually terribly complicated. There's a combination of social and psychological factors which drive your sense of morality. These can be fairly detailed, but the way they end up directing your morality is pretty simple.

Social factors are chiefly your upbringing and the culture you grow up in. You cover yourself with clothes because doing otherwise would be immodest. Yet, if you had grown up in the Amazon rainforest, running around more or less naked might seem perfectly normal. You don't eat people because that's wrong/weird/evil, but if you had grown up in certain tribes in Papua New Guinea, you would be offended if someone in your family didn't want to eat a relative to honor them in death and carry them on forever. You (probably) call the police when someone steals from you or harasses/threatens/attacks you, but if you had grown up in certain cultures in American ghettos, you might consider calling the police to be wrong/evil. Culture and upbringing can be surprisingly effective at reshaping your sense of good and evil.

Even so, there are certain things that seem to be more universal across cultures, and likely impossible to condition out of human psychology. Mourning the death of loved ones is a good example. Although it would be impossible to ever truly separate upbringing and culture from raw human psychology, these universal cross-cultural behaviors and attitudes hint at the boundaries between nature and nurture in human psychology.

The crucial thing is that the combination of values, beliefs and thought processes that emerge from nature and nurture are what guide emotional reactions to events, and whether we regard them as right/wrong or good/evil. Furthermore, due to the evolutionary biology of the limbic system, those emotions direct how we remember things. Unlike a computer that can recall arbitrary data with equal efficiency, our biology causes us to recall strongly emotional events much more easily than seemingly unimportant events. In turn, this causes us to keep recalling and keep lingering on thoughts about things that provoked strong emotions, rather than trying to, say, optimize our productivity with pure study and work.

The consequence of this is that your biology and the culture you're raised in cause you focus on certain things in ways that might conceivably be extremely different in other cultures or with different biologies. This is a vague way of saying that other cultures and alien brain structures would almost certainly prioritize things differently from you and I, and there's no clear standard of what's universally good/bad. The key thing is that your brain and your upbringing leads you to have certain emotional responses to what you perceive as good/bad, so rational optimization for your own happiness would guide you to maximize the frequency with which you are happy with the events around, and minimize the frequency of events which make you unhappy.

In other words, you can't escape your own biology and upbringing, and even if you tried, your attempt would still be guided by your pre-existing social and biological factors that influence you beyond your control, leading you back to an idealized or incrementally modified variant of the things you already believe and feel. You are unable to deem a new philosophy good/bad outside of the context in which you have been raised and outside of the biological and emotional limitations of your own mind. Thus, to be happy, you have to acknowledge what you can and cannot change, both in your own mind and in the world around you. Then, where you can make changes, make the changes that will make you happy.

You can't intentionally detach yourself from your own emotions, but you can create circumstances which limit your suffering and help you to find happiness both on your own, and in the happiness of others.
