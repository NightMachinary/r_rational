Omniscience and omnipotence are both traits with implicit infinite scope. So you are a mind infinite in size and intelligence and can even run a perfect simulation of yourself, running a simulation of yourself...\\
Your can't dismiss being a simulation (after all you could very well be a simulation run by a version of yourself) however whatever is doing the simulating must also be infinite in power and intelligence and thus must exist in a universe that allows those sorts of infinities.\\
Still given your own universe must be infinite and probably contains infinite nested infinities, you can be pretty certain you /are/ simulated, but it doesn't really matter since all higher/adjacent levels of simulation are of equal size and complexity. Hell things get even more complex since it's hard to even say that some levels are higher than others, given all lower levels also contain all higher levels, simulating all lower levels, ad infinitum.

One thing I should mention is that it's not actually clear whether it's possible for a omniscient omnipotent being to have any consciousness. Given it always knows all it's thoughts beforehand and can't get new information its mind would be a totally static timeless object. Since everything would seem to indicate minds are processes a true omniscient being would actually /have/ to be a p-zombie.
