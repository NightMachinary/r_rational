I think you answered your own question there bud.

I suppose a person could have some kind of limited "omniscience" and still be a brain in a vat, like perfect knowledge of every particle in their environment, or something.

In that case, yeah, it seems like if anything it would be evidence /for/ the simulation hypothesis - for example, you could easily create a person with similar "omniscience" of a part of your domain using your powers..
