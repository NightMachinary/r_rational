I personally think emotions should be advisors, not dictators. When I find myself reacting emotionally in an undesirable manner, I try to go "I'll take that under advisement" and then, I dunno, let go? It's almost, like, pretending to be a nihilist for a few seconds, accepting and even hoping that nothing matters, and then once I'm stone, it's easy to see the demarcation line between emotions and everything else, and I try and keep the connection points in mind as I gently let my own normal thought processes into place.

The method used in HPMOR of imagining where the situation went as bad as possible, I agonized over it for fifty years, then wished I had the chance to do it over, and, poof, wish granted, is highly useful for these sorts of situations, imo.

But anyway, to answer the prompt, I do think that emotions are important to the process, if only for emulating how others feel about the situation. I would be okay with being an emotional robot, but only if I had some way of accurately emulating others around me--it wouldn't do to be a Quirrel constantly beset by Hermiones on all sides.

But even if everyone was emotional robots, I think /something/ would be missing.

I think that emotions are important motivators; it's easy to put long hours in when you're passionate or angry over an important problem, or to escape to your sympathy long after your body has lost patience with something, but they must be augmentors, not originators. Use your mechanical, logical brain to come to a conclusion, then come up a way to ride your emotions /to/ that conclusion.

Sorry for the wall of brain vomit.
