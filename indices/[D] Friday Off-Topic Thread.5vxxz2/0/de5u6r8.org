Is it sensible and possible in the general case to separate your emotional connection to a topic from your reaction to it?

My grandmother recently had a health scare. We still don't know how it's going to end; it could be a pacemaker, a "not fit for surgery", or a "we did what we could". Based on her history and my layman's understanding of the medical facts of her situation, she's probably going to end up in a very similar position to her starting point (which is to say, a remaining lifespan measured in months or years rather than decades).

But the probabilities aren't informing my reaction. It doesn't feel like she's going to be okay, it feels like an ominous premonition of doom. Obviously this feeling is unrelated to the likelihoods of each outcome, which I lack the knowledge to reliably estimate. My gut almost certainly does not have mystical predictive abilities (and even if it did, I would have no way to know until I tested it). I can't trust it any more than I could trust it yesterday, when it thought things were alright.

I intend to ignore my emotional response. I want to preserve my grandmother's memory and make sure she knows how much I love her, and neither of these goals is served by being an anxious wreck. I can make this decision now in part because I have already worked through the involuntary reaction element (at least to the extent that I can detect).

Would eliminating this response be desirable, if it was even possible? In this case it seems benign, though I can see how an aversion to loss could be deleterious, but I think I would have come to the same decision even without the emotional response. It's practically mandated by my ethical philosophy to minimise death, and if that is not possible to minimise losses (information, emotional health, etc.) due to death.

I find it hard to reason about how my reasoning would function in the absence of emotional impulses. Many dystopian stories make it out to be a negative thing---tying emotion to ethics implicitly---but that seems a little nonsensical. Something doesn't become good just because it feels good, nor become bad because it feels bad. Judging people who have fallen short of your moral ideals feels good, but rarely actually prevents the behaviour. If people were actually ruled by their feelings, society would be worse than the worst dystopian story.
