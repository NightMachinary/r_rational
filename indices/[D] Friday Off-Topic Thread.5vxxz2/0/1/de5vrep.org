(General disclaimer: this is advice given from a stranger so please take everything with a grain of salt)

I think it would be hard, in the abstract, to have the /instinctual/ reaction of being able to react in the best way possible (i.e. optimal) to distressing news.

Humans can get upset, and that's sort of how we're built.

However, I definitely think we can work past our emotions. It sounds like your situation is one where you can see that merely being upset won't help things.

In this case, if you've already identified things you can do to help, given what you know, I think your choice to ignore the overwhelming emotional tide here might be good.

In general, though, I think that emotional responses play a strong role in extending the dimensions of human experience (except maybe for some of the negative ones).

There's also some evidence suggesting that in some cases, our feelings do pick up on more info than might be explicitly available to us. [[https://dornsife.usc.edu/assets/sites/780/docs/schwarz_feelings-as-information_7jan10.pdf][See this paper on "feelings as information"]]. Also, feelings shortcut a lot of our explicit thinking, which can make it faster to update on somethings. [[http://mindingourway.com/update-from-the-suckerpunch/][Nate Soares talks about updating from the "suckerpunch" of guilt as a way to quickly implement some changes]].

I hope this points at a few things that might be useful.
