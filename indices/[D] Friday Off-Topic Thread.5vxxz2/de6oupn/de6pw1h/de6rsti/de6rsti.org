That's maybe TOO detailed. I can't read synoptic charts unfortunately. They have a link to daily weather observations, but they're british.

Maybe I should see if I can find anything on the italian-language internet. Unfortunately my level of skill with the language is abysmal, but I suppose that's why god gave us google translate.
