So... I'm wanting to know if/when it rained in Rome, Italy in May-June 1944. I'm guessing it probably didn't due to the time of year, but who knows.

Given it's a big city and it was right about when the allies took Rome, that data has to be somewhere on the internet (it'd be in war records, right?), but I've not been able to find it - historical weather seems to only kick in around 1999.

Does anyone have any ideas of where to look? I can read enough Italian that if there's scans of newspapers available online that'd be enough (assuming they had weather forecasts/rainfall reports).
