I agree; they're supposed to have it "spring 2017". That's an alright timetable for me, but it would mean that those on macs would have to wait, and once it /is/ rolled out, it's likely to be buggy, and I don't have a mac setup to debug on myself. It would definitely be a second class citizen platform in that case.
