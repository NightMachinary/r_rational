The "this" in "this isn't really the place for that sort of thing" is referring to the subreddit as a whole, not this thread. To rephrase:

  It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that [[/r/rational]] isn't normally the place for having conversations about Japanese game shows. So instead we have this one weekly thread where you're allowed to do it and try to forbid it elsewhere.
