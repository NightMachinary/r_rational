Interesting--the only praise I've heard of darkest dungeon had to do with the subtle morality, that you're practically forced to run your operation like a heartless CEO, and perhaps that's one reason why the healing is not permitted out of battle, so you're forced to keep pressing your minions. I've heard the game gets a lot easier if you stop trying to play like a hero.

To praise Dwarf Fortress for its user interface is a disservice to UI everywhere. Things needn't use tons of shaders, but I draw the line at needing third party utilities just to perform basic organizational tasks.

I do agree that gameplay too often sits at the back of the priority bus, but it's also a bit of a catch 22: the number of gamers willing to purchase an ugly yet fun game is limited and already for the most part playing ugly yet fun games. The number of people willing to drop cash for something pretty that didn't outright bore them, on the other hand, is much larger. Perfect artistry with a tiny audience, or mediocrity with exposure? I may not like it, but it's perfectly understandable why that's the status quo.

(also most people suck at making games, yours truly included. Prioritizing and project management /while/ making a game are even harder.)
