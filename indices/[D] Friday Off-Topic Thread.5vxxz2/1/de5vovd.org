Recently, in watching [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQFX9B_9L4-neNiBhZcc54c7aPXkyP7GI][a playthrough]] of /[[http://www.reddit.com/r/darkestdungeon][Darkest Dungeon]]/, I've been thoroughly disgusted by the fact that, in a game widely touted as a triumph in immersing the player in the hopeless experience of "cosmic horror", immersion is /totally broken/ by the inclusion--indeed, the /encouragement/--of /extremely/-gamey tactics. Consider:

- Outside of camping intervals (of which a mission can contain between zero and three), the characters controlled by the player can use healing skills /only/ during battles. This encourages the player toward the artificial prolonging of any battle against an enemy group whose damage-dealing capabilities are exceeded by the PCs' healing power.\\
- In order to prevent this, contrived [[http://np.reddit.com/r/darkestdungeon/comments/43wov9/how_exactly_does_the_stall_penalty_work/czlthz1][stalling penalties]] take effect whenever the enemy group is reduced to a single enemy that can't deal more damage than the PCs can heal (i.e., is neither a boss nor a miniboss). This forces the player to be more creative in his stalling, by stunning enemies to reduce their damage-dealing potential and by not killing the final monster until the very last moment before the penalties will be inflicted.\\
- Even worse, in the final missions of the game, the developers *intentionally* (according to the person who executed the playthrough linked above) included enemy groups each containing two enemies *incapable* of dealing damage to the PCs, thus accomplishing an end run around *their own anti-stalling mechanic* in order to compensate for those missions' extreme difficulty. In addition, the stalling penalties are waived against one enemy with such high defensive statistics that killing it before the stalling penalties kick in usually is extremely difficult. ([[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0UqtvCPsMc&list=PLQFX9B_9L4-kjmz2ic1AsduLdf8dOpRWN][This video]] provides a nice example of how ridiculous the mechanic is. The ninety-minute mission includes literally /twenty-five minutes/, spread across four battles, of stalling against a single high-defense enemy in order to heal all the PCs--and this particular player is using a mod that speeds up battle animations, so the time split would be even /more/ egregious under ordinary circumstances.)

In my opinion, this trio of circumstances irreparably damages any claim to immersive capability that the game can put forward. Why can't characters use healing skills (balanced through some other method) outside battles and camps? (This includes, not just [[http://darkestdungeon.gamepedia.com/Heroes#Vestal][divine]] and [[http://darkestdungeon.gamepedia.com/Heroes#Occultist][occult]] spells that plausibly could require adrenaline to function, but also actions as mundane as [[http://darkestdungeon.gamepedia.com/Heroes#Arbalest][Battlefield Bandage]] and [[http://darkestdungeon.gamepedia.com/Heroes#Plague_Doctor][Battlefield Medicine]].) Why will reinforcements arrive /always/ if the PCs are fighting a single cultist, but /never/ if the the PCs are fighting two? (Wouldn't a /larger/ battle be /more/ likely to attract attention?) Why will reinforcements arrive /always/ if the PCs are fighting a single ordinary enemy, but /never/ if they're fighting a lone boss? (Wouldn't the monsters be much more likely to have set up a system to warn of threats to their leaders than to have instituted a similar system for the protection of unimportant scouts and underlings?) No in-game explanation is provided.

I don't dispute that the game is /fun:/ According to Steam, I've accumulated 130 hours in it, despite having never even /started/ the final missions. However, its [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Buwei6ZWqU][being extolled]] as a shining example of immersion when it definitely seems to me to be nothing of the sort irks me in the extreme. The narrator of the videos linked above has /himself/ stated that he would prefer that, in any stalling-friendly situation, the five or ten minutes of stalling were replaced by pressing a "kill stall-friendly enemy/-ies and fully heal all PCs" button to fast-forward the whole process--and what could be more gamey than that?

I /also/ am annoyed at the trend of wasting money on graphics rather than spending it on something more /useful./ A few days ago, my computer broke, and I attempted to play /[[http://www.darkestdungeon.com][Darkest Dungeon]]/ on [[https://www.walmart.com/ip/21777758][my mother's pathetic laptop]]. I expected that the game would run reasonably well, given its simplicity--but imagine my surprise when it barely even functioned! Even /[[http://store.steampowered.com/app/463980][Solitairica]]/--barely more than a plain-Jane solitaire game, but uses the Unreal Engine!--lags rather badly on it. In a similar vein, I always am infuriated whenever I see a visual novel, because I know that there was wasted on the art money that /could/ have gone to the writing or the gameplay. What's the point of making [[http://store.steampowered.com/app/571880][boring "games" with mediocre writing and art]] when you could make [[http://store.steampowered.com/app/448910][fun games with no writing and placeholder art]], [[https://kdp.amazon.com][entertaining books with no gameplay or art]], or [[https://www.patreon.com][impressive artworks with no gameplay or writing]]?

IIRC (I've played neither game in /several/ years), I preferred /[[http://www.positech.co.uk/kudos2][Kudos 2]]/ to /[[http://www2.ea.com/the-sims-2][The Sims 2]]/. Likewise, to say that the snazzy interface of /[[http://www.citiesskylines.com][Cities: Skylines]]/ or of /[[https://www.gog.com/game/pharaoh_cleopatra][Pharaoh]]/ is any better than the straightforward and well-marked keyboard instructions of /[[http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves][Dwarf Fortress]]/ seems a very large stretch, to me. See also /[[http://store.steampowered.com/app/359230][Lethis: Path of Progress]]/, which, despite its cute graphics, is in terms of gameplay an outright /downgrade/ from /Pharaoh/, to which it is an homage! Ugh...
