Various reasons:

Hotkey inconsistency. Navigating a selection menu? Sometimes you go up and down with + and -; sometimes you go up and down with the arrow keys, using + and - to increment and decrement values. How do you designate the area of a task? If it's a Designation, you move to the corners with the arrow keys and select them with enter. If it's a Construction, you use UMHK to change its size, then place it in the correct spot. And so on.

Naming inconsistencies. Seats are called chairs, except when they're thrones. Burial receptacles are called coffins, except when they're caskets or sarcophagi. Does a throne allow you to zone an office? A new player might not know just from reading them.

Unintuitive navigation requirements. This is the biggest one, I think. Unless you've sunk a fair bit of time into the game (as I admittedly have), it's not obvious that removing a built construction is not under the Construction menu, or even under the Build menu, but grouped under Designate alongside things like smoothing stone and harvesting wild plants. Similarly, a refuse stockpile not collecting outdoors refuse is an entirely opaque problem for a newcomer, because the settings for refuse collection are not accessible from the stockpile, but are instead under Standing Orders - Refuse. Combat breaks out for the first time? You'll need to navigate [[http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/DF2014:Attack][4 different selection screens]] to properly convince a dwarf to go fight; not exactly beginner friendly.

I should note that I do in fact like the game a lot, after all that criticism; but I'm hard-pressed to defend the UI, so I don't.
