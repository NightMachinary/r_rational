Generally as soon as you put limitations on those abilities they are by definition no longer omnipotence/omniscience, but of course in the prior example the simulated gods can't access their host reality directly so I was already going by your suggestion (though of course simulated gods couldn't tell the difference).

Plus my point about how entities with omniscience are static and not actually conscious still applies without needing even perfect knowledge persay. Really any sufficiently complex being with perfect knowledge of it's own past and future mind comes against the same problem of their mind being a static object within their own (non-existent?) frame of reference.
