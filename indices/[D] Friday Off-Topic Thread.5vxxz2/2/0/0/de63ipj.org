Erdos, that's awesome!

As a math-person myself... I can't believe I'm saying this, but the optimal course of action might be to destroy or limit magic before someone accidentally mashes an Apocalypse button...

Which is one of my favorite ways for magic to work [in any setting] in the first place - the universe is/was fundamentally magical in nature, and some sentient entity said "Oh crap, that's bad" and threw together a bunch of arbitrary rules to try and head off the worst of it while minimizing the loss of... potential.
