  I draw the line at needing third party utilities just to perform basic organizational tasks.

I wouldn't call micromanaging the assignment of labors to dwarves a "basic organizational task". I always merely assign every labor (except Mining, Fishing, and Hunting) to every dwarf, and then pull out a few to be dedicated Miners (plus, once the population has risen enough, a dedicated Manager, with no labors enabled). I use Dwarf Therapist to /streamline/ that process, but I certainly wouldn't refuse to play /Dwarf Fortress/ /without/ that utility.
