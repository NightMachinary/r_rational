  Hofstadter concluded the chapter by briefly talking about recursively-enumerable sets where “This kind of ‘tangled recursion' probably lies at the heart of intelligence.” It may be a little soon to question this idea, since Hofstadter has not yet mentioned any possible supporting arguments, but do you agree with the idea that recursions is a fundamental quality of (and possibly the cause of) intelligence? Or would creativity be a better description for how recursion relates to intelligence? Remember if you believe Hofstadter is right, then why are humans so bad at it as compared to computer programs which are clearly not as intelligent? A good example is Gary Kasparov vs. Deep Blue in a chess match.

Well plainly an intelligent creature has to deal with Turing-complete possibility spaces. That doesn't mean that dealing in Turing-complete stuff necessarily makes you intelligent, though.
