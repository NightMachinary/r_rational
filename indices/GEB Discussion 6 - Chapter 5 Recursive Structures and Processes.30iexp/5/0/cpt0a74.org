  In the chapter I was particularly interested in the connection of intelligence and recursion. The book gave the example of a chess machine that calculates the point of view of his opponent, and then recursively how that opponent would imagine the machine itself would act. I think this might be pretty central to the intelligence of humans because humans are incredibly social animals who are constantly thinking how other people might think about themselves. I think it was in HPMOR in which Yudkowsky brought up the idea that social competition might have been the launchpad for the evolution of human intelligence. I haven't read much evolutionary psychology so I don't know how credible that idea really is, but intuitively it sounds sensible, seeing how much I am constantly thinking of how other people think about me.

Actually, Sicilian Reasoning can only continue for a finite number of levels, that number being the number of available moves in the game. After that, it cycles back: Nth-level Sicilian Reasoning leads you to make the same object-level move as 0th-level naive reasoning.
