Curry's notes about God that is unattainable was interesting, and if I were a believer, I think the GOD acronym description would very well fit the image of God I have in mind: God that is always an infinite distance away.

In the chapter I was particularly interested in the connection of intelligence and recursion. The book gave the example of a chess machine that calculates the point of view of his opponent, and then recursively how that opponent would imagine the machine itself would act. I think this might be pretty central to the intelligence of humans because humans are incredibly social animals who are constantly thinking how other people might think about themselves. I think it was in HPMOR in which Yudkowsky brought up the idea that social competition might have been the launchpad for the evolution of human intelligence. I haven't read much evolutionary psychology so I don't know how credible that idea really is, but intuitively it sounds sensible, seeing how much I am constantly thinking of how other people think about me.

Oh, I googled it and it seems Dunbar was the one who was advocate of [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_human_intelligence#Social_brain_hypothesis][the social brain hypothesis.]] He argues that once groups among humans got larger than before (150 is the famous Dunbar number for average size of human groups), complex social dynamics and behaviors like reciprocal altruism, deception and coalition formation started contributing to the evolution of intelligence. Dunbar cites a relationship between neocortex size and group size of various mammals.

(When I googled about this, I also found an interesting study which said that depression might have evolved as an involuntary losing strategy in social competition, "enabling the individual to accept defeat in ritual agonistic encounters and to accommodate to what would otherwise be unacceptably low social rank." I've suffered from depression and this rings a bell for me because I've always thought that low status has mostly been the cause of my depression. Go figure, but anyway, I think status games are really interesting.)

Another use for recursion might be as a source of randomness in creativity. Hofstadster gave the example of a chaotic sequence in which after a while the sequence starts to behave very chaotically. [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/08/06/random-noise-is-our-most-valuable-resource/][Slate Star Codex has argued that random noise is our most valuable resource.]] He gives multiple examples of how events in which what you might call "imperfect recursion", if you can call imperfect recall that, is a cause of inspiration:

  In partner dancing I sort of stumble onto inventing a lot of new moves by fucking up a standard move. But then it's kinda hard to remember the new move since it was based on a mistake. The only times I remember a new move is if I make the same mistake at the same point in the step constantly.

  Neil Gaiman noted, in his commencement address that's all over the Internet, that he once misspelled “Caroline” as “Coraline” and he went “that's interesting,” and saved it for later.

  I remember reading that Neuromancer's great opening line “The sky above the port was the color of television, tuned to a dead channel” was intended just to describe a blue sky, because Gibson's television showed a blue screen on dead channels, but that most people read it and picture black-and-white static, which makes the line a lot cooler and more memorable

  The part where you said you mishear other people, misinterpret it and then have a new idea -- shares similarity with Harold Bloom's ideas about Shakespeare's soliloquies, wherein the character speaks aloud, mishears himself, misinterprets what he misheard and then allows that new interpretation to change him away from his original stance, allowing growth.
