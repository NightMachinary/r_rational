Haha. I got all excited when I thought of trying G(n)=n-G(G(n)-1). ;P

G-flip could be a fun group exercise to try with my more mathy in-person friends. Seems like something requiring some creativity/analysis/stubbornness to solve. Then again, it might be more fun if we knew that it was solvable, or at least that it was provably unsolvable. Some people don't like playing games they can't 'win'.

That said, I've had friends who enjoyed trying to prove the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture][Collatz Conjecture]], even knowing that it had never been done before. So maybe it's only discouraging facing the terrible odds when you expected them to be good odds.
