Chapter 5 leads to a lot of questions. I'll copy them from the wiki to here for discussion:

1) We have provided lots of examples of recursion, self-similar fractals, and so on. Come up with some other contexts in which recursion appears.

2) Use the RTN on p. 134 to come up with some "fancy nouns".

2a) What path do you go down to implement the linguistic structure of the nursery rhyme "The House that Jack Built"? Leave off the "This is", because this isn't a machine for making complete sentences. For reference, it goes, in part:

/[This is] the dog that worried the cat that chased the rat that ate the cheese that lay in the house that Jack built./

2b) What path do you go down to make a phrase where all the verbs pile up at the end, as the German language is known for?

3) On p. 137, Hofstadter describes the sequence known as "G-flip", where you flip diagram G from left to right and re-number the nodes.

3a) Draw a few levels of G-flip. What is the algebraic expression that defines it?

3b) Draw a few levels of H-flip. What is the algebraic expression that defines it?

4) What does the diagram of the "married" functions F and M look like?

5) To what extent are Feynman diagrams a formal system?

6) What type of isomorphism links all the butterflies in Escher's Butterflies on page 148?

7) What is the connection between recursion and isomorphism? What does Hofstadter say the connection is?

8) What is the essence of modularity in programming?

9) Discuss the following quote: “Modularity exists, of course, in hi-fi systems, furniture, living cells, human society --- wherever there is a hierarchical organization.” (p. 150)

10) Did "Hofstadter's Law" (p. 152) actually apply to a computer program becoming the world chess champion?

11) How does human intelligence make use of recursion, according to Hofstadter?

12) How does human intelligence make use of recursion, according to someone relevant /besides/ Hofstadter?
