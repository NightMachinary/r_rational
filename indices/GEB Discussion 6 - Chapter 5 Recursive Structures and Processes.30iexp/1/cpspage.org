Writing the post for this chapter felt weird, because for once there wasn't a large number of ideas being discussed simultaneously all at the same time and I didn't have to pick and choose the most interesting ones. It was all about recursion and the post feels particularly short.

I'm also glad that next week, we are going to be going over only two chapters. I wouldn't have been able to keep up three posts per week much longer. I noticed that last Friday's post is the worst written of the lot.
