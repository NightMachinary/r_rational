Depends very much on the particular not!Superman, how opinionated he is and how much respect he loses for other people.

One possibility I see is that the superman largely avoids politics except to attack nations that perform human rights violations / break UN treaties.This would have an interesting effect on world politics. North Korea and various Arab countries are in for a rude awakening. UN peace-keeping becomes a lot easier. Once all nations are raised to a semi-civilised state then announce that all nations are to voluntarily decommission their heavy-weight military vehicles, missiles and nukes. They are also to cease production of new ones. If they don't comply then N!Superman will be unhappy and forcibly decommission the military equipment.

Would also probably end up creating patches and modifications to prevent abuses in certain western democracies. Maybe have a go at instituting score runoff voting.
