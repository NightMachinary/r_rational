Part 1: General consequences

So, !Superman is essentially an invincible terrorist with god-like powers trying to enforce an arbitrary political ideology. However, he's not omniscient, so he's going to have to get his information from somewhere, presumably mostly from his loyal subordinates.

Without yet getting into the details of any specific ideology, we can easily predict what's going to happen in general. Think of !Superman as a government unto himself. If you can persuade him/his subordinates that something is good or bad, or that something is true or false, you gain power through him. !Superman is about to get mobbed by lobbyists (for lack of a better word) trying to present him with problems to solve. Media narratives are about to change drastically to adjust how !Superman and his subordinates think about the world.

At present, we already have to deal with political think tanks trying to come up with propaganda techniques which will work well on certain voter blocs, or which will put pressure on certain politicians' bases. With !Superman, we now have a place for psychologists to analyze everything he's ever said and done to understand his thought processes and how to direct him in useful ways.

You say !Superman can't be significantly influenced, but that's an impossibility. He has to get his information from somewhere in order to know whether or not his policies are being implemented, enforced, and carried out properly. However, when every single information source is geared towards manufacturing his and his subordinates opinions, he will be manipulated.

Just think about yourself as a journalist in this world. Are you going to write anything that will make !Superman kill a fuck-ton of innocent people? Now imagine yourself as a statistician, a police officer, a politician, etc. The world will rapidly become a place where everyone thanks !Superman for fixing all of the problems everywhere as they grin through gritted teeth.

To draw an analogy, the world would probably become much like China. Sure, there's all kinds of strict policies and the government issues stern punishments at times for basic things like speaking out against it. Unsurprisingly, nearly everyone says how much they like the government and trust the communist party. But then at the same time, nobody gives a fuck about the laws. Corruption and bribery is rampant, and practically everything from traffic laws to building codes merely earns a shrug as it gets ignored. It's an odd hybrid of totalitarianism and anarchy.
