Some people try to bribe NotSuperman in a variety of ways. Good-looking women (and the occasional man) try to influence him. More subtle people try to control what information gets to him. More ruthless people take his aging mother hostage. Corporate types try outright bribery; some of whom try vast supplies of money, while others try to bribe him with their cooperation in one thing in exchange for his cooperation in another (some of these last might even be successful on occasion).

Major governments might be following his orders, but they're also running covert, hidden programs to try to repeat the random accident that gave him his powers.

Loud politicians are bemoaning the fact that he's not following /their/ political ideals, and pointing to the death and devastation that he causes as a sign that his politics are evil. Voters who don't like losing what little power they have will tend to give lots of votes to governments that don't /like/ him and make it clear that they would immediately stop following his policies if doing so didn't result in such swift and sure retaliation.

Many people would try continually more and more convoluted ways to kill him, and it would be clear that most governments would immediately stop following his policies the instant he dies.. Some people would like him; some people (probably a good deal more) would claim that he's concentrating his efforts on helping those people over there first and it's not /fair/ that he's not helping /us/ first. Many people would notice their standard of living improve, but reach the conclusion that is is despite NotSuperman, not because of him (a narrative that their local politicians would push as hard as they could). People knowingly violating his policies would go to significant effort to hide it (and people living in such a place would go to even more effort to hide it, lest they get blown up).
