Have you considered applying the Simulation Hypothesis to the setting? E.g. our world is indeed a simulation, but it's had many different "builds" over the ages, each operating under its own set of laws. The modern era build runs on Physics, the previous one implemented an (internally consistent) Nordic magic system. Whenever reality is shifted to a new build, its denizens retain some ancestral knowledge of the previous builds, which is how we have mythology. What the Nazis did was, in fact, exploit a bug they found in the fabric of the simulation, tricking it into booting parts of a previous, deprecated build.
