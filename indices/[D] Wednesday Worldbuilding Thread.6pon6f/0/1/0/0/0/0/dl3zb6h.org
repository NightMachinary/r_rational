Hm, so if every action leads to Ragnarok and the only self-preserving choice is complete inaction, where would that leave them? A state of permanent stasis? Cause that's not that different from death, and the majority of the Aesir would likely prefer to go out with a bang. Or do you mean that's it's Earth/Midgard in particular that should be kept isolated from magic/godly affairs, and as long as that rule is followed the rest of the realms can do business as usual and Ragnarok won't commence?
