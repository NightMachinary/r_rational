That's pretty good, but it would require addressing the reason why the simulation was run that way in the first place and why it hasn't been fixed yet. The only setting I've seen properly explain why the simulation was created (without invoking cosmic horror) is Young Wizards, even if it doesn't call it a simulation, but that also featured an IT staff to maintain the universe and limit entropy. If I went for a similar explanation there'd be no avoiding the Abrahamic flavor of the mythology, which would contradict the setting's themes.
