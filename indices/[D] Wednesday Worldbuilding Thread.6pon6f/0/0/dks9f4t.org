First point on rationalising myths - Assume that the details are wrong. Stories have been twisted through the centuries, losing and gaining bits in the retelling. Sometimes, the stories are flat-out propaganda by one of the mythological features. This allows you to contradict inconvenient obscure details at will, while sticking with /convenient/ obscure details. (Have your protagonists trip over this early, so that the reader is warned).

Second point - a lot of the details will be missing. Lost or forgotten in the interval, or flat-out misunderstood from the start. So the giants are from another world, getting to Earth only over a rainbow bridge? Perhaps that other world is a low-gravity planet (thus explaining their size), and the Rainbow Bridge is some alien portal generator (and the only reason they haven't been seen around in the past few thousand years is that they managed to lose the coordinates for Earth (Loki managed to get admin rights on their system?)), with the ones still on Earth putting themselves in cryostasis in the hope of surviving until their species manages to find their way back here. Now they're awake again, unable to reenter cryostasis (lack of supplies? Medical reasons?) and very very upset at how long it's been since there's been any contact from their home planet (is their species still even around?)...
