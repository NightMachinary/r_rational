Somebody with the top tier flying brick powerset (telekinesis over their own body with no upper limits on power, as well as total invulnerability to basically everything and no need for any form of sustenance), has taken control over the world by just forcing government to obey him at gunpoint. Not-superman's goals are to solve coordination problems and shift laws everywhere in line with whatever political ideals you the reader possess (he believes the ends justify the means regardless of whether you do though).\\
If governments don't cooperate he'll fly into cities and other strategically valuable places and just blink his eyes at extremely close to the speed of light, causing a explosion of any size he chooses and possibly irradiating the area to some degree from all the gamma rays.

Not-superman has planned this all for quite a while beforehand and implemented a pretty good plan and major governments are following his orders for solving coordination problems, not-superman is completely ruthless (but not self interested) and can't be deterred from his task by anything, nor significantly influenced. He's also not lying about the fact that he just got his powers seemingly completely at random and what his goals are. Not-superman should also be assumed to have access to a number of loyal subordinates in whatever areas of expertise are relevant to this sort of global reform.

Now the question is, what do you expect a world like this to look like?\\
How does the culture react to what may seem like an absurdly obvious evil force having total control? With people having little way to rebel except by attacking their own governments who are only acting because they have no choice. And what do you expect the reaction to be in areas where not-superman's reforms significantly increase their own living standards?
