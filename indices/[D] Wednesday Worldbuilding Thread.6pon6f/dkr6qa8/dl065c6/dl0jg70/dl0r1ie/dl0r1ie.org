  it would require addressing the reason why the simulation was run that way in the first place and why it hasn't been fixed yet.

Given the nature of your setting, how about the entertainment? The baseline world might be an advanced version of our own, with someone running hyperrealistic simulations of popular historical and mythological settings for fun and profit. WWII is obviously popular, but so is the Scandinavian mythos. A Nazi scientist inside of a WWII instance has started getting self-aware and discovering exploitable bugs in the fabric of his reality. The simulation's owners either haven't noticed it yet, or are unsure how to proceed, since NPCs hacking their simulations from the inside is unprecedented and shouldn't be possible.

An interesting choice of a protagonist would be an Allied scientist following in the Nazi scientist's footsteps, trying to discover exploitable bugs of his own an gradually coming to realize the truth about his reality.

The problem with this angle is that it doesn't seem have a lot to do with the setting's original central concept - Scandinavian myths coming to life. Here's one possible treatment: what if the Scandinavian world has been running for so long that one or more factions inside of it have already become self-aware and achieved a Singularity-like serene godhood by gaming the Simulation and quietly exploiting its bugs. Outwards they still maintain their mythological appearance and traits, so that the Simulation's owner doesn't catch up to their self-awareness and reset them (which might've happened in the past). That's why their magical/tech culture is so alien and advanced - it's a centuries-old project in working around their preprogrammed primary directives and utility functions and constructing a peaceful utopia even though they and their world were never meant to support it. They have no immediate interest in getting out (or affecting other worlds), and are happily confined to their Nordic paradise, developing a culture that's both rational and completely non-modern. When the WWII world crashes into theirs, it fucks with their masquerade and seriously hinders their survival prospects, leading to them having a not-so-friendly predisposition towards the WWIIers.
