Isolating Midgard might be enough since Ragnarok is supposed to destroy much of the Earth and most of humanity, but I was thinking that all the nine realms sealed their borders so they physically couldn't fight each other. The ones who preferred to die and take everyone else with them were put into stasis so they couldn't fulfill the prophecy, but the rest just went home and have been living quietly for millenia.

I like the idea of the Aesir kind of mellowing out as they approached the inevitable and deciding they'd rather live in Asgard forever than see everything they care about be destroyed by their own bloodlust. They may have loved battle, but many of them cared enough about their own lives and the (after)lives of humans to give it up. Perhaps they kept themselves entertained in Valhalla like an RPG.
