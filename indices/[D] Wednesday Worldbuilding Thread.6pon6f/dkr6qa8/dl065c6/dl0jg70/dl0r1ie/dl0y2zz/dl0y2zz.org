That's certainly interesting enough to be worth considering. I think I might drop the simulation angle since it's difficult to turn into a plot hook, but this still works as the figures of Norse myth realizing they're bound by cosmic forces outside of their control and trying to game the system. One feature of the mythology is visions of the future that will always come to pass, so the figures condemned to die in Ragnarok decided to delay the inevitable as long as possible by abandoning the Earth. When all actions will inevitably lead to their death, the only sane choice was to stop taking action.

In Norse myth, the gods have significant limitations on their power and rely on forces like a well that sees the future and golden apples to grant them immortality. However, after everyone realized they were destined to die fighting each other they agreed to cut off all ties outside of their worlds and take away magic from the humans so they couldn't screw anything up. That is, until the Nazis managed to stumble upon the right ritual to release the beings who'd been imprisoned for wanting to fight in Ragnarok anyway. Even if the other realms know of Serpentfall, none of them want to interfere and risk fulfilling the prophecies.
