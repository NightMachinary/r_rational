  Aside from how that contradicts a bunch of other myths that also existed at the time, which weren't considered to be competing narratives or alternate interpretations, why did all these beings care about spreading them and then stop caring?

Random I-don't-really-know-that-much-about-Norse-mythology guess? Loki and the Frost Giants /won/. Or, alternatively, both sides managed to simultaneously imprison the other for millenia.

  Serpentfall indicates that these beings' existence and their power is independent of humans believing in them, but even if spreading propaganda among humans was important to their goals then how come the stories don't have significantly different versions that cast characters in different roles?

The characters were /powerful/, but still needed supplies. Of some sort. Food and drink, at the very least. They intimidated Norsemen into being their servants, fetching and carrying and completing such mundane tasks as they were too lazy and/or arrogant to do themselves. The stories, the propaganda, were spread amongst the humans as a precursor to Loki leading a slave revolt - perhaps persuading some Norseman to slip through alarm systems intended to give warning of Frost Giant presence but not calibrated for humans (for the same reason as why it wasn't calibrated for rats) and hit the "Begin Cryostasis" button? (Or trigger some "Imprison In Ice" spell using a magical artifact provided by Loki?)

And, once the Norse legends were all trapped, there were still humans left from multiple sides in the war - the side that had been fed the stories that became the modern Norse myths eventually wiped out all the other sides (along with their legends and stories) quite depressingly thoroughly, thus passing on only their myths. Possibly because theirs was the only side that was actually /prepared/ for Loki's "imprison-everyone-and-let-the-humans-fight-it-out" strategy.

(So why was Loki still imprisoned afterwards? One possibility: He left plans for his own freedom, but all the humans who knew what these plans were and how to implement them got killed in the war...)
