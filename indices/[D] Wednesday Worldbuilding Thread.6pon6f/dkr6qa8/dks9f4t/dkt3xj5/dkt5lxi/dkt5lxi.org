  I don't think Sufficiently Advanced Aliens can apply here. Aside from the question of why they'd make a giant space snake, Serpentfall also brought magic and psychic powers to the world that line up with Norse folklore. There's a reason I compared this setting to Unsong.

...fair enough. I don't actually know much about the setting you're describing.

  These myths also seem a bit odd for propaganda considering how the gods are portrayed as flawed and specifically state how they will die due to their inevitable failures. At the minimum, there'd have to be an explanation of how the stories got started and why they were allowed to fade into obscurity.

Easy. They were started by the Frost Giants, or by Loki on their behalf - the propaganda was designed to make them look weak, not strong, and make the Frost Giant's eventual victory appear inevitable.
