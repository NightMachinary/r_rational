I don't think Sufficiently Advanced Aliens can apply here. Aside from the question of why they'd make a giant space snake, Serpentfall also brought magic and psychic powers to the world that line up with Norse folklore. There's a reason I compared this setting to Unsong.

These myths also seem a bit odd for propaganda considering how the gods are portrayed as flawed and specifically state how they will die due to their inevitable failures. At the minimum, there'd have to be an explanation of how the stories got started and why they were allowed to fade into obscurity.

I liked the idea of the mythology being descended from an older Indo-European religion, but that comes back to the problem of building a cosmology where Serpentfall and the events that come of it make sense. The entire setting hinges on that weird thing happening, but not many big events afterward.
