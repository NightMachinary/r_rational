The Day After Ragnarok is one of the most interesting RPG settings I've found with a ton of interesting story hooks for nearly every flavor of pulp adventure. In 1945, Norse mythology returns to the Earth as the Nazis summon the World-Serpent to kick off the apocalypse. The atomic bomb ends up stopping it, but leaves Europe flattened beneath the continent-sized corpse, the Eastern half of North America devastated by the venom released into the atmosphere, and earthquakes that wake up Loki and the other sleeping frost giants who ally with Stalin.

It's got post-apocalyptic survival in The Poisoned Lands, political intrigue in stable counties, decentralized war against both Nazis and communists, dungeon crawling in the World-Serpent for materials to build sci-fi tech, and supernatural elements to include as both mysteries and well-understood forces. It's ripe for stories of all kinds, but in reading the book and researching Norse mythology I've discovered how difficult it is to rationalize myths assembled out of a handful of ancient stories that have been largely corrupted by Christianity.

I really like this setting, but I want to come up with consistent explanations as to where the myths came from, why they faded into myth, what the events that occurred indicate about the mythology, and what the different possible endgames are. This turned out to be pretty difficult since the folklore is actually pretty vague about a lot of important details. As much as I've criticized Unsong, it at least knew how to take a bunch of crazy ideas and make them it's own within a thematically consistent mythology.

For some reason, I'm actually worried about coming up with explanations that are /accurate/ to both real history and the folklore. I can't even do what Tolkien did and transplant ideas he liked into a new mythology that made more sense. I feel an obligation to adhere to the in-game lore and even explain the parts that contradict the obscure details from Norse myth like the giants not being Fair Folk-esque beings from another planet. So I'm not quite sure what to do.
