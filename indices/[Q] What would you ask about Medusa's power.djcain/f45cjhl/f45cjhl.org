Is the power will-based, or automatic? If a being jumps in front of you, will it instantly turn to stone?

What parts of the being turn to stone? Will there be a bowl of hydrochloric acid just sitting inside the statue?

What constitutes a being? Is there some objective definition that the power works by? How 'alive' does it have to be to be affected? An animal? A plant? Fallen branches that could still grow if replanted? Bacteria? Cells? A corpse?

How much do you have to see for the power to activate? Their eyes? Their skin? Any body part? What about their hair, which is technically dead?

To what extent does your eyes have to receive light? Does it have to be the exact photons that bounced off of them and nothing else? What counts as "bounced"? Does deflecting the photons with gravity count? Or refraction through substances like water or optical fibre? What about when through a lens, like a telescope?

How much light do your eyes have to receive? What if its dark and you can barely see the being? What if you can't see the being at all, but there still an unseeable amount of photons bouncing into your eyes?

Do you have to comprehend the being as a being? What if they're camouflaged, or your mind just doesn't notice them? What if you look at what you think is a rock but what is actually a lizard? What if you see a black dot in the distance that happens to be a bird? What if your vision is blurred and you only see a vague shape in front of you?

What type of stone is created? What purity? What are its properties? Is it especially useful for anything?

Where did the stone come from? Where did the particles that originally made up the being go? Is it transmutation or destruction-then-replacement?

Does it violate the conservation of mass? Is the amount of stone produced dependant on the being's mass or volume?

Does it violate the conservation of energy? Where did all the chemical energy stored in the body go?

How is it actually working? What is biologically different about your eyes? Can it be studied or reproduced?

What are the applications? Can you pass off the transformed beings as statues to be sold? Can it be applied in combat, like throwing light organic darts that can be turned into stone mid-flight, or throwing an organic blanket over an enemy and trapping them in a rock cage? Can you craft things with organic materials like plants then turn it to stone to make stone contraptions or constructions that would be exceedingly difficult or impossible normally?
