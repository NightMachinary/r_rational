Do the people who turn to stone need to be looking at you? Or is it enough for you to look at them? Is there a range limit? I sure hope I'm not killing off countless alien civilizations just by looking at up at the stars in the night sky.

Does your power affect all lifeforms? Can you sterilize a place (turn all bacteria/fungi/viruses into tiny tiny stones) just by looking around?
