Is it selective, e.g. by person or organism? Can it be turned on and off or is it an 'always on' type of stonegaze eyes? Does it have a reverse mode? How long does the transformation last and how quickly does it take effect? Does it work through glass? How opaque does the glass have to be for the stonegaze to stop working, if at all? Does it have to be glass? What types of stone do turned people become? Can that be controlled? So many more questions...
