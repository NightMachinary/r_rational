Can it be turned on and off? Does it work through sunglasses? Does it work through cameras? What about a live feed? Does it work by making eye contact? Does it work on anyone I look at? Does it work if anyone looks at my eyes (even if I dont meet their gaze)? What if i wear a mask and my eyes are in shadow but they make eye contact with the eyeholes? (Test this out by attending a KKK rally. If they turn to stone, good. If not, leave with my questions answered) What happens if I wear coloured contacts? Does it work on things other than humans? Is the power based on pupil or iris? How quickly do they turn to stone? What kind of stone? Do they retain consciousness (I really hope not) Where did this magic come from? Why me?
