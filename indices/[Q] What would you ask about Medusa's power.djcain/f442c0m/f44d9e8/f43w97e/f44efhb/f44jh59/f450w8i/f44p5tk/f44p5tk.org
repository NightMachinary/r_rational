on the experiment side, since i live in a bit rural suburb i'd see if the deer get turned to stone if i looked at them, we see them as pests anyway and a stone statue would be nice.

would experiment if it worked on live TV, with some dude i really disagree with, but this would probably be a late stage experiment since it would attract more attention then i want if it works.

would try different kind of eyeglasses to see if it can stop the effect,
