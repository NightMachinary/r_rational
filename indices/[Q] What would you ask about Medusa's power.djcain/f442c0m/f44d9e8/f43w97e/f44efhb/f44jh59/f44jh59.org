Mirrors? Water reflections?

Eyeglasses? Sunglasses?

How long does it take?

Does it require looking intently at someone, or is simply looking in the general direction sufficient?

Does it require the other party to make eye contact (as is the case for classical Medusa)?

Does it have power limitations? Or can I turn an entire army of 10,000 troops into stone in a heartbeat?

Range limit?

Self immunity? There better be self immunity.

Can I toggle the power on and off when I don't want to turn people to stone?

Can I revert people back from being stone? Is there a time limit?

What happens to their clothes and belongings?

What kind of stone? Do I get to choose?
