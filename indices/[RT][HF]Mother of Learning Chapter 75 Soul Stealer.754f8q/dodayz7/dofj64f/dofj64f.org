Hmm. I do approve of the idea that if RR was not the original Controller - which is probably the case - then we can expect him to be recreated from the template each loop. So yes, Jornak is a plausible candidate.

Of course, we don't have any way to verify it, since if the Gate is indeed recreating RR, then there is nothing any more to identify him. The only signs of his former presence are the barred Gate (but the Guardian can't or won't say anything identifying), and the soulkilled individuals (but their bodies are recreated from the template, so they carry no clues), and ZZ's own memories (but Zach won't let Zorian poke around in his head).
