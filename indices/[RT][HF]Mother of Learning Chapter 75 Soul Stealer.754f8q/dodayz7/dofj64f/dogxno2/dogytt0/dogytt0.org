  If RR is someone who met Zach
#+end_quote

Zach's memories are indeed the best shot at identifying RR, if he'll ever let Zorian into them.

#+begin_quote
  RR likely already was a skilled mage, perhaps even in relevant areas such as soul magic, dimensionalism, possibly necromancy, and might already have soul sight
#+end_quote

Probably, yes. That definitely narrows it down, but still leaves a lot of candidates - especially since RR has ties to the Cult of Dragon.

  Lastly, looking into Jornak's mind might reveal mental tampering. Seeing as Zach's mind was messed with, Veyer's mind and by extension Jornak's mind might have been altered.
#+end_quote

Nope. In the proposed scenario, Jornak's mind will be a clean slate. He's a new, untouched instance of Jornak, who honestly knows nothing about the loop.
