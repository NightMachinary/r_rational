Yeah, the relationship between mind and soul is fuzzy so far. And because the mind is merely just an organ of the body, in reality, the distinction between body and soul is fuzzy.

The way I'm choosing to view it is that the physical body is like RAM---it's a buffer that temporarily holds information. Some of this information, though, is written to the soul, which is more like the harddrive where storage is more permanent.
