Wait, so will soul sight persist through the loops? On one hand, it's technically an enhancement ritual, which don't usually persist. But on the other, it clearly had an effect on his soul, given how he passed out.

(I'm guessing not. Pouring mana into one's soul to get the desired effect doesn't require anything physically, so there's no reason he can't do it again in the next loop.)
