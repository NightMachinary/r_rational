I think the sea of suns could be Zorian's hive mind - like the great web connections. It could also be the Bakora Gate network fully deployed. The massive volcano hints at the Cyoria Dungeon. Carpet of smoke hints of Sudomir and his wraith bombs. Not sure if desolate lands are desolate before or after the smoke carpets it.
