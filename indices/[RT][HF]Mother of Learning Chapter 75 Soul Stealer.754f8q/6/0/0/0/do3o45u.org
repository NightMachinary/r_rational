That's a good point regarding the sea, I didn't consider that. Aranean gathering could be it!

I'm thinking something has to go wrong soon, no? Even today when I saw the chapter title I was like ok, something will go wrong. Could be interesting to see wraith bombs deployed in the time loop rather than in real life. (Sudomir has been consistently neutralized, true. But I'm not sure this is the end of him as a problem outside of the loop- ZnZ will have a TON on their plates).

I'm thinking of the volcano - there was a reference to Zorian early on seeing the Dungeon with mage sight and it was described as spewing just massive quantities of mana. Could there be another Dungeon somewhere which they haven't tapped? Something where yet another primordial is trapped? (I'm reaching...)
