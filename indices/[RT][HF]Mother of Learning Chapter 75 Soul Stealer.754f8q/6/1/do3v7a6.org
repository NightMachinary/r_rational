Skippy: How is it that she's able to reach out to her friends?

K'Z'K/Bug: Haven't you realized it yet, Skippy? These humans can reach out to each other in a variety of ways. It's a subtle part of their design. Most just aren't even aware that they're doing it.

K'Z'K/Bug: It's like the creator took a needle and thread, connecting each mortal soul to every other with gossamer strands, sensitive to the slightest vibrations.

Skip: Wouldn't it have been cooler to take an actual needle and thread and literally sew them all together?\\
K'Z'K/Bug: *That's* what /I/ said!
