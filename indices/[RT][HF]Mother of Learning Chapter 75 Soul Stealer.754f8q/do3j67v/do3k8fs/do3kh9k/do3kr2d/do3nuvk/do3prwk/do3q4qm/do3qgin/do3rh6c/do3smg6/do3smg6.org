I'm pretty sure that the key detection has much better range and accuracy than mind sense. There's also a good chance that it doesn't require mana to use (since as has been pointed out, Zorian can operate his soul marker even in the Control Room where mana shaping is impossible), it's much harder to block or detect, and since it's tuned to specific objects, it's likely very efficient.
