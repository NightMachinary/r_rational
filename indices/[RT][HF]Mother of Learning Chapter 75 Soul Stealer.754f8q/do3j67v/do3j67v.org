I'd like to put forward a theory about another aspect of being Open that was never explicitly stated but was hinted at a lot.

In chapter four, Zorian jerks Zach out of the way of QI's beam without any forewarning.

Whem Xvim threw marbles at Zorian, Zorian always knew if a marble was going to hit his head.

It has been comfirmed that being Open will give the user prophetic dreams, so what if psychic people also get vague impressions of the immediate future?
