Great posts. I agree that most of these abilities are better kept as enhancement potions in a freezer inside your pocket pocket-dimension. Some thoughts:

*Mind Speed* Zorian may be able to increase his thinking speed and mental reaction time via mind magic.

*Mana Sense* Pair this with mana sense and, as you said, not only do you improve your ability to improve your ability with magic (heh), but it'll be much easier for you to see how an opponent is manipulating magic before any spell effects occur. This gives the illusion of improving reaction time and strategic. Further, it acts like an invisibility, magical trap, and ward sensor unless special pains are taken against mana sensing.

*Shifting* Bonds with powerful or aggressive creatures is unlikely to happen for the reason you stated: Shifting is not about merely getting the characteristics of the animal, but your rather melding another animal's personality with yours as well. So, doing this with a dragon would result in an individual who was probably more dragon like than human. Likewise, a gray hunter meld may result in a psychopathic, territorial, and homicidal individual.

*Underwater Shifter* The deep ocean is a scary and violent place to be stuck with merely shaping exercises, and civilization takes place on land, so I feel that wouldn't be a great option.

*Multiple Animals* Also, I think shifting multiple animals would take too much of a toll on Zorian's mind.
