Yeah we're thinking on a lot of the same lines. The biggest draw of a shifter bond like this over enhancement is that he doesn't need to say goodbye to ~10% of his already anemic mana capacity to have quick and easy access enhanced durability, strength, reflexes, and special senses. It's apparently both efficient and easy for a shifter to draw on abilities from their other form, but at the same time will also draw more on their instincts, which means constant durability or reflexes also means constant increased danger to his sanity. And of course, as you say, he's got his golems (and wards, and shields, and potions...) if he /knows/ he's in a situation where tanking hits or ignoring poison is necessary; the value of enhanced durability is all about being constant and unconditional.

But rather than overkill, I think some kind of special physical sense is the perfect complement to his mind sense: he's golden against anything with a mind, so now he needs something to help against the mindblanked, mindless undead, traps, etc. (Heck, that eyebeast caught him by surprise, and it presumably has a mind. But more skill and paranoia are the better response there.)

We've also been discounting the venom, but with his mind magic Zorian has no problem disabling creatures anyways.

And yeah, I grouped flight under "mobility" in my write-up. /I/ would seriously consider permanent flight, but Zorian doesn't seem interested.
