It's true that tremor sense would be really incredible. Between mind, mana, and tremor sense, he should be nigh impossible to sneak up on.

Yes, that grey hunter bond /is/ really enticing. I just . . . can't get over the sanity aspect of it. I say he should politely ask Sudomir (read: imperiu---I mean compel) to go through Sudomir's shifting research, talk to several shifting tribes, talk to Silverlake, talk to everyone . . . but I feel pretty certain that everyone is going to say, "Are you freaking crazy? Because you'll definitely be crazy after the soul binding!" Zorian doesn't strike me as the type to gamble with his mental capacity . . . especially because the mental integrity of his simulacra depends on a mentally stable Zorian template. I just don't see this happening, but I still think Zorian should do the research into it.

Speaking of Sudomir, his warding and formula abilities are utterly top notch. Zorian really ought to compel him to give instruction.
