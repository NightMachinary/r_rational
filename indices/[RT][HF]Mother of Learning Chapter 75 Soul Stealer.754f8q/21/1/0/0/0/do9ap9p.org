  Being maintained with a supply of mana is the same thing as channelling it.

I don't recall anything that specifically supports that. I hypothesize that spell formulae carved into nice durable metal could shape raw mana and the end result be a perfectly healthy artificial brain. Certainly I agree, we've been told repeatedly that living things (and artificial brains, fully as delicate as the pink head custard kind) can only safely /shape/ personal mana, but this isn't a situation we've heard about. The artificial brain isn't handling the ambient mana, it's merely the end result of that handling. I wouldn't be shocked to learn that this isn't possible, but I don't think it's an automatic consequence of the rules we've been told so far.
