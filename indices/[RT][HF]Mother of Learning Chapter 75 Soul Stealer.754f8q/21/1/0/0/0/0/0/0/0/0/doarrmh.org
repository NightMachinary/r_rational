To quote the same passage:

#+begin_quote
  At first glance, it may seem that they would be able to use ambient mana a lot more freely as a result. To an extent, this is true -- they certainly won't be incapacitated by sickness in the aftermath of such use. However, in order to retain their sapience, such undead need to possess a sort of magical brain to think with... and that brain is every bit as vulnerable to insanity as biological ones.

We're not talking about Zorian's simulacrum assimilating mana like a lich for use in casting spells. Rather, we're talking about using the golem body like a blasting rod, but instead of blasting, the golem has formula to assist in paying for a piece of the simulacrum mana cost used maintain some of the simulacrum's spell boundary at a reduced cost to the caster. There is plenty of precedent for this, from the simple magic missile rods used in school to the complex Soul Well under Iasku Manor.
