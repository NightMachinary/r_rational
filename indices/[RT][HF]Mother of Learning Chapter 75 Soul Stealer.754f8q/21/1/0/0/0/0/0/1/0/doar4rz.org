I think we're talking past each other here.

  It might be possible to build spell-like effects into the golem body and safely trigger those from a simulacrum brain. But they can only be very simple, crude effects like a blasting rod.

Sudomir seemingly used formulae to put extremely complex passive effects on his dragon golem, giving it flight as well as other capabilities.

Furthermore, the diviner who was in Daimen's group used an object to aid the casting of certain spells. We saw Zorian use a similar object during the Grey Hunter fight.

Similarly, a golem might be able to have similar capabilities that make the simulacrum maintenance cost go to or approach zero. This is what we're referring to. And indeed Zorian might have already done this.

And then on a separate note, rather than channeling this part of the spell directly through Zorian, if he could allow the golem to bear the brunt of the channeling, then Zorian could partially offload the burden of powering the spell by having a reinforced golem body directly draw a safe amount of ambient mana. Again, be might already be doing this.
