The author already responded to this, but I'll add $0.02: /Maybe/ it would be theoretically possible to build a spell formula brain sturdy enough to withstand ambient mana usage. But to make its components that tough, they would need to be macroscopic. To make a human brain equivalent, you'd be looking at hundreds or thousands of times the size of a regular human brain, all made of very expensive materials, and it could take even an expert many months, even years maybe, to construct the thing.

To keep the brain to a practical size, the components of the spell must necessarily be so small that they are both delicate and unsuited to a spell formula.

ETA Also, on the subject of the dragon, it wouldn't have to be a dragon soul. Sudomir had access to thousands of human souls, and evidently had time on his hands. And mana from souls is not corrosive, just harder to use (which, with a carefully-constructed spell formula, is acceptable).
