Zorian has already used spell formulas and a physical body to severely cut the cost of his simulacra. Could he further reduce the cost using formula that pulls mana from the environment? Well, maybe that's precisely why his new simulacra use golem bodies; their bodies are durable enough to draw a small amount of mana from the environment to help maintain the spell. Perhaps, Zorian is unable to offset the entire cost of the simulacrum in this manner without frying the golem body or maybe some amount of his /personal mana/ is a necessary ingredient. After all, a simulacrum needs to be closely linked during creation to the caster and their image, mana, soul, etc.
