"Magic brains" need to be maintained by the personal mana of the entity doing the thinking. Zorian is using golem bodies to get rid of upkeep costs for an ectoplasmic body, but the minds of simulacrums can only be maintained by his personal mana. Not even mana of other people will do, much less ambient one.
