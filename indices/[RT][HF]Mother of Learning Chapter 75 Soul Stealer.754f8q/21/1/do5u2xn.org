Impressive write-up.

I don't think completely offloading his simulacrum upkeep is feasible, though. Raw mana (eg from crystals) would be toxic to their delicate magical brains. Powering their bodies from ambient mana, by putting them in golems tough enough to withstand the corrosive effects, is a clever idea, but probably the limit.

The most appealing bloodline, I expect, would be whatever Zach has. But we don't yet know if it's something that you could duplicate with an enhancement ritual.
