Hmmm... im pretty sure xvim will be interested in learning how to create a dimension room. That man have some insanely good dimension shaping skills and use it for combat. Wont be a surprise if its part of his aspirations for getting good in the field. I hope its a tradition for the teachers to have a certain aspiration for their craft/fields. For example Ilsa dreamt of conjuring objects out of nothing.
