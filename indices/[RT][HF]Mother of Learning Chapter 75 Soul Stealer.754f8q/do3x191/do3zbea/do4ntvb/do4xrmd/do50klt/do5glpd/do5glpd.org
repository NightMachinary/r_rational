From a safety perspective in programming, it's usually better to create copies of stuff and then mess with those copies rather than messing with the original copy and then trying to undo all the damage/alterations. This is because the changes could potentially be non-deterministic, kind of like how it's easy to carefully pull apart Legos and then reassemble them again, but it's difficult to burn wood, collect the smoke and ash, and then reassemble the wood.

But magic of course can make anything work. Lol
