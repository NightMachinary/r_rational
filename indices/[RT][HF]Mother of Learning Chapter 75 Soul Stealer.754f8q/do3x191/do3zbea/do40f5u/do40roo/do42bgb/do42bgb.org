  So there won't be any code that says "don't recreate the Controller's soul any more".

  Zorian's soul is presumably not being duplicated simply because the Gate logic says [. . .]
#+end_quote

Why not? That seems quite possible:

1. If one month has passed, gather any souls into the Gate.

   - The Gate gathers multiple souls because the controller can temporarily mark individuals.

2. Destroy the loop.
3. If there are marked souls remaining with a controller marker, check if there is enough energy to recreate the loop.
4. If there isn't enough energy, then shut down the gate.
5. If there is enough energy, then recreate a new loop.

Maybe the creators of the Gate didn't anticipate there being three controller-marked souls, so they simply did not put in a "Validate there is only one controller-marked soul" clause.

Or maybe the creators anticipated that shenanigans may occur. Maybe they realized that a significantly skilled soul mage might be able to, theoretically at least, make their soul resemble the controller's soul and the Gate would not be able to tell the difference.

Maybe the creators couldn't figure out how to make the Gate identify one soul from another hollistically, but it was relatively trivial to put a marker on the controller's soul and key the Gate to that marker. It's analagous to how it's much easier to make a computer read a barcode than it is to teach a computer to identify an item by shape, color, texture, etc. waved in an arbitrary orientation in front of the computer's camera.

Unable to solve the problem, they decided that they'd ensure the Gate would, if it still had the energy, absolutely not collapse if a controller was still inside.
