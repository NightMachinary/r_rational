Here's something to chew on, though: If exiting the loop meant that V's body was left soul-less, does that mean that he's the original looper?

If he were not, then his soul would be part of the original template, so once he was gone, why wouldn't the Gate recreate his soul each time?

Or was he indeed a bystander of some kind, who was ejected from the loop by RR?
