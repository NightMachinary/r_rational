  somebody Zach knew /through/ Veyers

That...is an excellent point, and offers a motive for someone to soulkill Veyers. If Veyers tried to use the cult to help him out, then in the iteration where Zach tried to convince Veyers about the loop, a high-ranking cultist in contact with Veyers could theoretically find out. And after messing with Zach's mind, it would be reasonable for him to then kick Veyers out of the loop to hide the connection.
