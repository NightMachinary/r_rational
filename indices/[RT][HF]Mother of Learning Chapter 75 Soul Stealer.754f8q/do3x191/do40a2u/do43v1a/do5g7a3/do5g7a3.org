  I'd even gamble against RR having a marker, since he's an accomplished mage with soul perception, I think if he'd had one, he would've found both Zach and Zorian that way.

It's uncertain how easily RR can track other loopers. During and maybe before Soulkill, we discover that RR was uncertain about how many people had joined the loop . . . if memory serves me.
