I've been assuming that RR could not easily track other loopers. He knew additional beings had been brought into the loop because he noticed the effect they had on the invasion. So I assume if he'd had a marker, he would've cast a divination spell on it immediately, then found and destroyed Zorian. Instead he had to find out about the aranea by mind-pillaging Zach, and assumed that Zorian was just one more of an unknown potential horde brought in by the Matriarch. (Your memory serves you correctly, I even went in and reread that section of Soulkill.)
