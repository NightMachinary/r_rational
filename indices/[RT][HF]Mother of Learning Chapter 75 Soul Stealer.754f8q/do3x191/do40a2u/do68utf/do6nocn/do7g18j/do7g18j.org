While thats good point, I dont think I agree. I remember, that RR tried to kill Zach quite a few times and he never succeeded. And that was years ago for them. RR does not know about Zorians new shield and any spells he developed or got from experts, golems, rifles, dimensionalism or soul sight. He knows only about Zorians mind mage capabilities and Zachs brute force. I think any confrontation beween them would go quite badly for him.
