  how much stronger can RR realistically be?
#+end_quote

He could be a master soul mage, completing the mind (Zorian)/body (Zach)/spirit set. He uses physical enhancements of some kind. He has been in the loop for a long time. He is well connected in an organisation known for its access to restricted spellbooks. He could be very strong indeed.
