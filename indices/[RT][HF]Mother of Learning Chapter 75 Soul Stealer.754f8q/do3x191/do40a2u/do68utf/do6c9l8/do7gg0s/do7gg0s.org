Hmm, to some extent I agree. I think killing RR early would be convinient for Z&Z, but I dont think it should be priority.

While I dont remember first 20 or so chapters that well, I think the invasion never deviated that much from original plan. Or did it? They have to do it on that specific date or not at all. They have to use gate. Those two constants should provide Z&Z with enough framework to work around. Also they have seen quite a few different ways it could go inside loops, so they would be prepared.

Also there is fact that RR does not know about a lot of things that happened after he left (golems, rifles, dimensionalism, soul sight etc).
