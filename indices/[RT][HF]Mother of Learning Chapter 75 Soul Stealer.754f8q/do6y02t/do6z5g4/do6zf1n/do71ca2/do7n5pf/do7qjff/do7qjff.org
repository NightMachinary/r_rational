  could there be legal liches?

This was discussed on the worldbuilding blog. You can theoretically become a lich without doing anything immoral, but to most people, it's as suspicious as carrying lockpicks, bolt-cutters, a ski mask and an axe at midnight.

And in most places, necromancy is categorically illegal, so no, there aren't legal liches.
