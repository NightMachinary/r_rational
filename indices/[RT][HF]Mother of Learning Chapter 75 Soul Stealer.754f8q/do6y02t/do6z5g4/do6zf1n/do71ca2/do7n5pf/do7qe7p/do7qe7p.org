Necromancy usually involves so much cruel and questionable behavior, and to be a lich requires such extreme expertise with Necromancy and with magic in general, that I don't think society would take kindly toward /any/ lich it came across. Is it a prejudice? Yes. Welcome to humanity.

Also, why would he give up his real body if he didn't have to? He's 15 years old and still has so much of his life ahead of him. Further, he /also/ gets to experience what life is like in an artificial body whenever he integrates a golem simulacrum's memories. He currently gets a lot of the perks of both styles of life. Eventually when he's in his eighties or something I can see him becoming a lich if he doesn't have another means to attain immorality, however why would a fifteen year old take that route?
