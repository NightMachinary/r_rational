I dont know if this theory has been introduced, but it struck me that Zorian (zorian!loop) might want, instead of stealing the body of the zorian outside the loop (zorian!out), become a lich. It should be easier to accomplish I think, at least in the situation where he would need to snag the body zorian!out, since he wont have to take over a body.

How much do we know about the ritual about becoming a lich in the MoLverse?
