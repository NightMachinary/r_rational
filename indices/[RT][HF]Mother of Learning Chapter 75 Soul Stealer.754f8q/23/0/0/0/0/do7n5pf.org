Why would he want to keep his soul in his original body? He might do like he is now doing with his simulacrum, build a custom body, and then inhabit it. If he can make the custom body convincingly human enough( and not an enchanted skeleton) he might be able to pass most detections.

(Do there exists things like lich wards? Or for the opposite direction, anti analytic wards?)

Thinking about it, this might be what QI is doing, enchanting and warding his bones like it is a golem and then inhabitting the body.

Another stray thought: necromancy is evil, but there are people who have natural soul sight, can they become a lich without any other necromancy magic? So could there be legal liches?
