Other that what [[/u/melmonella]] said, you can maybe have perks of both sides if he becomes a lich and then steals zorian!out's body. I should think about this a bit more, but what if zorians does the following:

Become a lich, steals zorian!out body, becomes an immortal via the route silverlake took, make a potion of ethernal youth. This should net you: A real body, Zorians real body in some sense, protection against death, aging, a back up plan if his body gets destroyed, at which point being a lich is better than nothing I guess.

Another random thought, can you make multiple phylactries a la horcrux in harry potter? Then doing the quirrelmort route would make this an even closer route to immortality.
