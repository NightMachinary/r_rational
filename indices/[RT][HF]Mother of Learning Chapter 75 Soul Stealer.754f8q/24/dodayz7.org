I was trying to post here before but my new account wasnt allowed to, so I ended up creating a new theory and will try to put it all into this one post:

My theory is that the lawyer Jornak is actually RR. Since Veyers shows the same symptoms as the spiders, it is highly possible that he was removed from the loop (template) by Jornak after Jornak managed to enter the loop. The main reason why I don't believe Veyers is the culprit, is because he is too young. A boy with basically no knowledge about magic, including no knowledge about soul magic, is supposed to have entered the loop using his brain alone? Think about how "knowledgable" Zorian was in his first iteration. He also has only one month left to find a way to enter the loop from the moment zach tells him. Veyers is also some kind of an outcast and with no help from anybody besides Jornak and maybe Zach he is supposed to be able to enter the loop? Even then Jornak would have tried to enter the loop as well. How could two kids be able to stop a grown up mage? Zach and Zorian are trying to find ways to enter and exit the loop and they are failing so far and they can be considered arch mages. But we believe that Veyers is capable of solving that without any real shaping exercises or other resources? Jornak on the other side could be perfectly capable. He might even know about the Sovereign-Gate through those books he has in his home. For all we know he might be a powerful mage, he even has basic mind magic skills. He has far more resources and the motive. He said it himself, that he was mistreated by the state. So the question would be why is he back to his normal self when he is supposed to be RR? Zorian was a part of the loop like Jornak until he got a marker. From that point onwards his soul was no longer recreated from the template. But Zorian also knows, that if something happens to his marker, he will lose everything and his soul will be recreated. So if Jornak leaves the loop, the Guardian will only find two souls with a marker and recreate everything else. The "new" Jornak does not know the loop exists and only finds a "dead" Veyers in his home and panics.

I also had a nice idea how to "abuse" Jornak or at least find out if he is the culprit ;P ZZ could tell him about the Sovereign Gate and persuade him to help them. Zach does also have a motive to go against the State Leaders and he would believe them about the Sovereign Gate if he is RR. The main idea is that Jornak as RR found a way to enter the loop and maybe could do the same again. It is a little bit like playing with fire but this time ZZ are far too powerful to lose against him. They dont have to let him actually enter the loop. It would be enough if he is capable to find a way for people to enter. That would definitely prove he is RR.

I am pretty sure he did some experiments with Veyers. But in the end the ability to remove people from the loop-template is supposed to be used that way. Get rid of useless people and maximize your own possibilities. One more important reason to test the ability on Veyers, is that it will never be public. Remember how everybody was talking about people (the mercenaries killed by RR) found dead in their homes at the start of the month? RR definitely does not want Zach to notice somebody else is inside the loop. Dead people will definitely change something and Zach would eventually notice.
