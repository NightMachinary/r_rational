This is a great theory. You're right that it is unlikely Veyers by himself got in the loop; he simply doesn't have the magical ability.

Although I really like your theory, I'm going to play devil's advocate for Veyers as RR:

We don't know much about the loop as neither does Zach. If he /is/ the original looper, maybe he knew of a way to include people in the loop more permanently. Maybe he hung out with Veyers and they somehow became friends.

Counterpoint and possible nail in the coffin for the Veyers as RR theory: We've now learned that Veyers likely begins and possibly spends the loop at Jornak's house. If that's true, then Veyers would not have had contact with Zach and thus no opportunity to enter the loop normally. But Jornak wouldn't have that opportunity either. The plot thickens . . .

To switch topics slightly, under Zorian's compulsion, Jornak says:

#+begin_quote
  "I didn't kill him! I didn't kill anyone! I already said I just found him dead one day! It's the truth!"
#+end_quote

If Jornak were RR and he left the loop, I might expect this is pre-loop Jornak was unaware of the whole situation. However, Jornak!RR could have also obliviated himself of certain information before leaving the loop.

Notice that very soon into the interrogation with Jornak, Alanic has Zorian stop aggressively using mind magic on Jornak. This makes most subsequent information somewhat suspect. What is really needing is a thorough interrogation of his thoughts like what was done on Sudomir, with special care to look for any signs of memory tampering . . .
