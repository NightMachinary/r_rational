If Jornak's soul actually left the loop, then the new Jornak is recreated by the template. Just like if Zorian were to leave the loop-world now, a new Zorian would be created in the same way he was before (knowing nothing, no shaping exercises, no soul sight, etc.). So the current Jornak does not need to lie, he really does not know anything. Even if Zorian would search his mind, there would be nothing of value.

In the end I am pretty sure that if Veyers is RR then Jornak was playing an important role, because he is the only adult those two kids (Zach and Veyers) can talk to. There is simply no way two unexperienced kids can hack a divine system like the sovereign gate.
