  Of course, we don't have any way to verify it, since if the Gate is indeed recreating RR, then there is nothing any more to identify him.

You may be correct, but not necessarily, and in my opinion, it's unlikely that there would be no hint that an individual is not RR. If RR is someone who met Zach and learned of the loop, then that person would have a very limited amount of time to figure out how to get into the loop. At best, that person would need to convince Zach to give them a temporary loop marker using one of the keys.

Also, it's likely that to be able to create an entry point into the loop, RR likely already was a skilled mage, perhaps even in relevant areas such as soul magic, dimensionalism, possibly necromancy, and might already have soul sight.

Remember that it RR begins the loop with access to the difficult-to-get red robe. Maybe he steals it, but given the nature and reputation of those robes, I don't find that likely. Rather, this indicates that RR is some kind of prominent member of the cult, thus deserving the robe. Inspecting Jornak's mind thoroughly might reveal this level of involvement.

Also, entering the time loop may have been the result of planning that occurred prior to loop activation. Here's a hypothetical situation: RR is the lawyer and is involved in the cult in a deep way. However, he also becomes a lawyer for Zach's caretaker. With access to certain documents, perhaps he stumbles upon plans to activate the loop. Working with the cult, he figures out a way to piggyback Zach into the loop. Rooting around in Jornak's mind might reveal any such plots.

Lastly, looking into Jornak's mind might reveal mental tampering. Seeing as Zach's mind was messed with, Veyer's mind and by extension Jornak's mind might have been altered.
