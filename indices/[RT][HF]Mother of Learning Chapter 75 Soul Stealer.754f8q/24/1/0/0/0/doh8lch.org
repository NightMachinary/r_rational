I should have been more clear: When I said Jornak's mind may show signs of tampering, I'm of course referring to pre-loop tampering. I don't know how much Zorian would be able to discern, but if he can determine the tampering occurred within the past few months, then it would indicate that perhaps the lawyer and Veyers may have ties to RR or one of RR's associates and further that RR likely joined the loop via a pre-loop effort by some group, likely the cult. I say this because mind tampering would indicate Jornak was involved in some capacity but also project information was kept under extremely tight wraps. Further, if the mind alterations were not done expertly, Zorian may be able to recover something useful.

Most importantly, this is the best lead they have. A full memory investigation of this individual above any other they know of right now may yield something useful (other than Zach).
