ZnZ definitely have a lot to do outside the loop, though Sudomir is a major player in the invasion so it's unlikely he will be ignored unless something changes.\\
There is definitely something tough soon, especially since the crown and dagger are incredibly difficult to retrieve, though neither seem to have any relation to the dreams.

Interesting thought about the mage sight - surprised that it hasn't been mentioned since honestly - though it is reaching in regards to the dreams, but there has to be unfounded high class mana wells around, especially if the theory of primordials causing them is true. Makes me wonder if something causes low class mana wells too...
