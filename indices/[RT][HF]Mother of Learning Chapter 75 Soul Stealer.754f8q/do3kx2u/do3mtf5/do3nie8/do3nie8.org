The fact it's a sea of suns makes me wary of it referring to hydra-mind or whatever fancy mind magic he ends up creating, the simulacrum minds seem to take up a fair amount of mana and I don't think he can create a sea of minds alone.\\
Maybe it could be a mass aranean gathering?

If you're right with bakora gates that could mean there is some sort of UI, and a sea of suns makes a lot of gates, I wonder if there are a bunch way underground.

If the smoke is the aftermath of Sudomirs bombs, that begs the question of why ZnZ haven't stopped him. A primordial is definitely another possibility, are there any other apocalyptic events that could happen? There was a ritual implied to have created the Xlotic desert IIRC.

The volcano is really hard to tie to anything else we know of other than fire elementals, how could it relate to Cyorias dungeon? By metaphor of the monsters rising up and out of it? Now I'm wondering if the others are metaphors.
