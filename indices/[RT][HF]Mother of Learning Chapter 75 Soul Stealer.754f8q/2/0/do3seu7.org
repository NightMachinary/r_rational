My guesses regarding the dreams described:

#+begin_quote
  A sea of suns connected by glowing threads
#+end_quote

Could describe the time loop. My rough understanding is that it's a "series" of pocket dimensions, instantiated one after another. The glowing threads are the looper's souls transferring or the transfer of whatever power is being used to sustain the loop.

I can also see this representing (primarily) the non-looping reality/realities and how they're connected to other realms such as the Primordial prisons and celestial realm.

I think this is going to involve one of the primordials. Edit: It doesn't seem like lava or volcanoes is their domain. The Primordial below Cyora seems to be noted for shapeshifting abilities specifically. Still looking for more and any information on others.

This could also be an issue that they encounter when they go across the ocean searching for more keys. If the place is buried by volcanic eruption when they arrive, they may have a harder time finding a gate.

Edit: +When they counter-assaulted the invasion with Alanic and Xvim, was there any indication of lava in the hole?+ Doesn't seem like it, but [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/60/Mother-of-Learning]["bright red light"]] as the ritual +activates+ is interrupted and the loop ends could be lava. It's also completely different from the description he gave when scrying on the ritual completing in [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/52/Mother-of-Learning][chapter 52]] (like a crack in reality as it breaks).

#+begin_quote
  a carpet of smoke crawling across desolate lands
#+end_quote

This could just be the natural result of a volcanic eruption, which would explain why the lands are desolate. If not, it could be the aftermath of direct action by the primordial, or another party, to choke the life out of Eldemar. Possibly QI against Eldemar, maybe aided by RR?

Could the second and third parts be outside the loop? If they involve a primordial, they probably have to be. Can prophetic dreams see into a future where Zorian has broken out of the loop?

Edit: I'm wondering if the primordial might have gained (or expended) power from any time during the loop where the cult succeeds or partially succeeds. It would certainly be a surprise for Z&Z if the primordial breaks free by itself the moment they get out of the loop! Not that I think that's likely.
