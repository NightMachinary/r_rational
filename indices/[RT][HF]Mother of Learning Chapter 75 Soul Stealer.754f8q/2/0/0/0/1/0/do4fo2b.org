That wouldn't account for his dreams mentioned in the current chapter. He's right near the end of the month already. I posit that Zorian can prophesy his own personal future (tied to his soul*) as it extends into any further loop iterations and, probably, back into the world beyond the loop.

It would also be weird to see into the loop beforehand in that case.

*Lore says souls are a tool of the gods to record a person's history, or something like that. May have been a work building post, but I think it appeared in-story.

Edit: Ah, I can see one way that seeing into all loop iterations from outside the loop works. If the real world's reality touches all loop iterations or has a bridge (the gate) to them, but loops are not connected to each other.

E2: That would mean he can see out of the loop and none of the current chapter dreams can take place until they leave.

I was picturing the loops in series, like stepping stones where they move from one to the next. Although the loops don't seem to work like this, it works in terms of Zorian's soul 'travelling' from one to the next, and him being able to prophesy the future of his soul's timeline.
