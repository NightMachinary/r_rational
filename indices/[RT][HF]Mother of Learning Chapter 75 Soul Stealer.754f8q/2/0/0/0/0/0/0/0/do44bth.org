  I still feel like the seer should have some extended connection or motivation to the visions they see.

Well, the general idea with prophecy is that he will in the future, not that he does right now.

Even if it's a form of probabilistic prophecy, nothing we've seen so far indicates any probability blind spots or nudging of probability towards certain outcomes. That suggests we're /probably/ seeing the timeline with the highest probability of occurring. Which is a timeline in which Zorian encounters Silverlake and all these other things he had dreams about.

If anything is likely to affect the probability of timelines, I'd guess that it would belong to the realms currently unreachable because of the time loop. That would suggest any prophetic dreams Zorian has would be purer inside the loop than out. Nothing in the story suggests any of this though; we don't have much information on how prophecies work in-universe.
