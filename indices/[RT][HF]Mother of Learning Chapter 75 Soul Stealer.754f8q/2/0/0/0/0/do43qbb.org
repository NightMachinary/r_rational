  Did he dream it during one iteration and encounter Xvim's marble pyramid in another?

You're right. I don't feel he should be able to prophecize about things from future loops. Meeting Silverlake was only within the realm of possibilities once Zorian went through all those initial loops.

You make a strong point: Perhaps, being a marked soul connects him to the broader loops of the Gate. But even so, I fail to see the reason for him to prophecize about Silverlake when she had so little to do with him and his future at that early point. Although, one could argue that having a mangled soul and a high level of discipline dramatically increases the likelihood that he would eventually search out soul mages, and since Kael was already on his way to the academy and has close ties with Silverlake. Also, there may be another link to Silverlake through his mother's witch lineage.

Also, it may not be that the prophecy is predicting events from future restarts, but rather it's showing him events he could reasonably encounter that are important to his current situation.
