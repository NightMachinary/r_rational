  Could the second and third parts be outside the loop? [. . .] Can prophetic dreams see into a future where Zorian has broken out of the loop?
#+end_quote

That may be unlikely. Remember that prophesizing for people within the loop, as attempted by the aranea and the church at least, was impossible to do for any period beyond the end of the loop.

Zorian may somehow be an exception, but that rubs me the wrong way. I think it's more likely that these are images of events from within the loop.
