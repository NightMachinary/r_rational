Quibble: Saying that the difficulty is proportional to the size just means that the difficulty of creating the dimension changes with the size of the dimension to be created; it doesn't indicate what that relationship is, whether it's linearly proportional, exponentially, or any other mathematical function.

  Plus aquiring a spell is somewhat a political challenge : Daimen never managed to get the Gate spell for /political/ reasons.

I thought it was simply that he never found someone that knew that spell. It's been mentioned a few times, but apparently teleportation isn't a commonly known spell among mages. I think it can't be that rare (5-20% of mages) because of the number of people we see use it, but it's not trivial to cast. Someone who knows the gate spell is even rarer, because dimensionalism is supposed to be really difficult. Zorian said something about people knowing that spell are "as rare as hens' teeth."

  Individuals capable of making a pocket dimension do seem rare, individuals willing to share these kinds of secrets for "nothing" in return (Assuming you want to learn from many tutors, you can't afford apprentiship) are even more rare.

Actually, I think the way Z&Z went about getting the knowledge of pocket dimension creation is more or less the normal way. By the time someone has the necessary ability in dimensionalism, along with all the other required skills like mana perception, they would be too old for an apprenticeship. They would be full mages, and would trade for such a valuable skill with something else of equal value.

And they're hardly trading "nothing in return". Grey Hunter eggs are probably the third most difficult thing to get seen so far in the story, exceeded only by the imperial dagger and crown. Silverlake had essentially no avenue to acquiring them, and they seem to be necessary for her potion of youth.
