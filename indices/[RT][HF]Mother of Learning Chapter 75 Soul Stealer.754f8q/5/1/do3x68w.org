I'm guessing it's the ratio between the internal size and anchor size. The actual size of the contained space apparently puts it right up at the top of the scale for pocket dimensions, but its anchor is pocketable. Just as a guess I think Silverlake's cabin-front anchor is probably around the size of the footprint of the cabin.
