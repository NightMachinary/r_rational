Yeah, it's pure speculation but I have this notion that a "typical" (in as much as you can say something so rare has a typical form) portable pocket dimension is something like backpack worth of space anchored to a pocket, or maybe a storage room anchored to a backpack, and a typical pocket dimension with enough space for a home is anchored to a moderately sized plot of land. We'll probably learn more in three weeks.
