That's a really interesting theory.

People who can tell the future within the time loop feel as if they have been "cut off from the divine planes"; they are unable to communicate with angels or demons or and unable glimpse into the future. So, maybe 400 years ago or whenever the gods stopped communicating . . . maybe /that/ was the start of a time loop that isolated the world from the gods, but did not isolate the world from the minor divine planes. But currently, they're in a smaller loop that /does/ isolate them from the minor divine planes.

However, if they are in a bigger, 400-year (or however long) loop, Zorian and Zach and most people who have no idea and pretty much no way to prove it one way or the other.
