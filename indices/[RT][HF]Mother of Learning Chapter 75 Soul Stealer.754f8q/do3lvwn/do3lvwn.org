Zorian has soul sight! I wonder how that will affect his proficiency with his marker. Speaking of the soul marker, how does it work mechanically? Zorian was able to trigger the end of the loop & even connect with the orb while in the Control Room. Yet, it was said that they could not access their mana in there (only sense their reserves). I always thought Zorian was using his mana to control his soul marker, so I'm a little confused. Regardless, this was a great update!
