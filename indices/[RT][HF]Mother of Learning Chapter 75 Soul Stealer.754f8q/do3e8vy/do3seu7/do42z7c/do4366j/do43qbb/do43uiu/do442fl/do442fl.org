That's a good point about the Iron Beaks. If he's making mental suggestions to them, his dreaming brain could rationalize the Iron Beaks as talking birds.

While it's true that prophecies don't have to involve known or anticipated events, I still feel like the seer should have some extended connection or motivation to the visions they see. But that's just me coming from the mindset of prophecies as probabilistic glimpses into the seer's possible timelines. I admit that's not really how most people view prophecies afaik.
