I was forgetting about that, yeah.

BUT! When did he have the previous set of dreams in relation to when those things (perhaps) came to pass? Did he dream it during one iteration and encounter Xvim's marble pyramid in another? Edit: [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/5/Mother-of-Learning][Chapter 5, at the start of the second loop.]] So he was definitely having those dreams during the first loop /at the latest/ and possibly before entering the time loop.

We know he's dreaming towards the end of the loop /this time/. Does that mean he can dream about his personal future beyond the current loop and into the next? If so, it's hard to believe he /isn't/ exempt from prophesy beyond the loop entirely. Something like his personal future being involved, whereas that's not being the case for unmarked souls in the loop.

Edit: This all assumes that the dreams he mentions are actually prophetic. I mean, it is actually hard to match up some of these dreams to events he's experienced.
