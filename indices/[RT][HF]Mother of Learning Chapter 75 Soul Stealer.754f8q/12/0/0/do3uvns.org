Other people's souls are not going to give her access to the time loop. If she believes the time loop is real, it only follows that she should believe that it means her "death" at the end of the month. An attack on them wouldnt be "risky" because from the perspective of each reset's Silverlake, she is choosing between such an attack and certain death at the end of the loop. People like Xvim and Alanic have worked under the knowledge that they die at the end of each month because they have a moral code stopping them from attempting to avoid their fate. Silverlake is bound by nothing of the sort.
