Am I the only one who thinks it is an absurdly bad idea to convince Silverlake that the time loop is real? Sure, it might save some time, but she is an incredibly capable character with no good reason not to incapacitate Z+Z and try to mess with their souls to enter the time loop herself. Let's not forget that Silverlake 1) Does not give a single fuck about society or anyone else, and 2) intends to acquire immortality and youth for herself. Treating someone like this as though they are an NPC should backfire horribly.
