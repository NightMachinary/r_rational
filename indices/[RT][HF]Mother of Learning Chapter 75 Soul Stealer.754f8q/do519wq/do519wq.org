I think that Zorian's decision to give himself the ability to usurp the body of another by physically thrusting out its soul when he so desperately wants to stay alive is a bad idea when you combine that ability with his habit of keeping multiple simulacrums, which sometimes set things up without him, and sometimes hide information from him, and which could decide to gang up on him and thrust out his own soul.
