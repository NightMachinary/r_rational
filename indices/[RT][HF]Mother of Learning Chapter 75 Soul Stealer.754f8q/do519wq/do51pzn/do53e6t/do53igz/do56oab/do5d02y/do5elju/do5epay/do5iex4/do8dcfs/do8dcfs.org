I would assume soul-merging to be another function of the Marker. When the Marker detects two souls in one body, it probably duplicates itself in the 2nd soul (like it mostly did with Zorian after QI's attempted merge attack). From there, with the identical scaffolding throughout the two souls, it merges them into one cohesive whole. There would still be just one soul core, but certain aspects would be strengthened, like mana capacity. It's probably a lot less dangerous with the souls being identical at the start of the loop. Zorian will probably not be in the best shape once they get back to the real world if it happens to him, with his 10-20+ years older loop copy of his soul merged with his original soul.

A few other thoughts about this: Would Zorian have his mana capacity doubled or just added to by his initial strength, with the possibility of further growth? Would the empath abilities be doubled in range and strength as well?
