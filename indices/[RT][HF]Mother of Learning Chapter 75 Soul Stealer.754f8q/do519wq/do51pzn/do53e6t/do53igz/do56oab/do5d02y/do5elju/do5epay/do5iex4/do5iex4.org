I was just addressing the battery issue, not the twin soul thing. I'd regard as unlikely purely because Zach's been examined by Alanic. If that weren't the case, I do think it would be a pretty elegant explanation for why Zach specifically has almost exactly twice the mana his shaping ability implies he should (I forget the chapter, something like the shaping ability typical of a magnitude 25 mana capacity, but with an actual mana capacity of magnitude 50). Especially if whatever-it-was happened right at the start of the gate operating, it'd be two identical souls merging, I find it easy to imagine that the result would be nearly seamless, as all of the "record keeping" sections of the soul would have identical information. On the other hand, elegant or no, we can't say there's much actual in world or word-of-god evidence about it. Though he was fielding questions about dragon-shifters at the time, he's said on his world-building blog that the mana-capacity results of a soul meld are unpredictable.
