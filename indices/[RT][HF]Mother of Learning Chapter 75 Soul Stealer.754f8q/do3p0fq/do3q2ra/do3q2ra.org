  with no good reason not to incapacitate Z+Z and try to mess with their souls to enter the time loop herself.

I don't anticipate her doing this, for the same reason that I don't anticipate Zorian invading Xvim's mind for extra training: it's much more efficient to cooperate with a willing subject.

And Silverlake wouldn't benefit by tampering with ZZ's souls. Messing with Zach would likely trip the reset, and messing with Zorian might wreck his marker and drop him out of the loop, but neither benefits her.

If she really wants in, she might want to /study/ their markers and use them as a basis to experiment on /other/ souls, and I would anticipate them being OK with that. If she has actual expertise on soul magic, they might gain valuable information from her experiments, giving clues about how RR gained a marker (or, if he was first, how Zach gained one). She wouldn't want to damage the two existing markers.

She's too smart to make a risky attack with uncertain benefits on people willing to be allies.
