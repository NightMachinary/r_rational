  Other people's souls are not going to give her access to the time loop.

They might. If she can find a way to recreate the marker by experimenting on, say, mouse souls, then she might have a chance at giving herself one. In theory. In practice it's a long shot, certainly.

  If she believes the time loop is real, it only follows that she should believe that it means her "death" at the end of the month. An attack on them wouldnt be "risky" because from the perspective of each reset's Silverlake, she is choosing between such an attack and certain death at the end of the loop.

That's one perspective on the loop, but a more pragmatic perspective would be: if all iterations of yourself in the loop are indistinguishable, then giving your next iteration a 75% chance of survival is better than giving your current iteration a 25% chance. And she has demonstrated her pragmatism by eg adopting Ikosian magical traditions when they were useful, despite the social consequences.

  People like Xvim and Alanic have worked under the knowledge that they die at the end of each month because they have a moral code stopping them from attempting to avoid their fate. Silverlake is bound by nothing of the sort.

But even if she believes the loop exists, her best chance of entering it is willing cooperation with ZZ. If she wants to eg help take down QI and get the crown in case it allows them to bestow temporary markers, they'll gladly work with her. If she knows mind magic well enough that she could place a compulsion on Zorian to go to her at the start of the loop and restore her memories, then she probably also knows enough that she can simply hand over a memory packet that he'll willingly return to her.

I can't think of anything she might want to do that would be better achieved by attacking them than by negotiating with them.
