Although I think Z&Z may have more diverse combat options, I think that this instead stems from their unique advantage over Silverlake.

Silverlake cannot simply try again as many times as she likes should she fail.

She /does/ have immortality though and doesn't /need/ to go after this particular Grey Hunter and can take time planning or learning skills to help. Probably also has other items which are a priority.
