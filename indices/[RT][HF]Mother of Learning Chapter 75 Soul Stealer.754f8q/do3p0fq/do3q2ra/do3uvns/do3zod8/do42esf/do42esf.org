I agree with this. However, they probably eat food she makes. If she wanted to poison them, she probably could.

Silverlake is someone who has survived for centuries. She did that probably by avoiding risky fights. She looks at both of these two mages who, as far as she knows, might have spent "eleven life times" as it were in this time loop. They could, in many respects, be more powerful than her.

Working with a witch of unknown integrity, they may as a precaution be utilizing advanced anti-poison wards or treatments, much like how mages would use Mind Blank around a mind mage. She simply doesn't know and these two kids don't seem aggressive. Just the fact that Zorian is taking an extremely difficult and obscure route to soul sight says quite a lot about his character.
