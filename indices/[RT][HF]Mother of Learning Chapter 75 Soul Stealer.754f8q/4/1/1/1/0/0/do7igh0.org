No, the only time we observed him fighting Zach, he definitely wasn't aiming to kill. And the other times that Zach reported - well, why bother attacking a Controller unless you wanted to subdue him? Killing him just resets the loop. And there are much more efficient assassination methods than attacking him in the bathroom.

In the real world, however, RR can be as lethal as he likes.
