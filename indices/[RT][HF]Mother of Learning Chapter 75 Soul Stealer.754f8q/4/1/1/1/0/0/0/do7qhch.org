You are right, but how much stronger can RR realistically be? I don't think he could match for neither of them. Z&Z have at this point quite a lot of battlefield experience against various dangerous foes. They also have a lot of inventions and tricks in their sleeve, that RR has no idea about.

In my mind combat between RR and Zorian would be: RR comes in expecting combat with mind mage and gets promptly headshoted by golem with rifle.
