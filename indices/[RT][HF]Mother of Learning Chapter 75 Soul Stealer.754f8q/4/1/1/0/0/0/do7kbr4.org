Consider the situation where ZZ can manage to kill RR in the first fifteen minutes of the loop. What does it do for them?

Well, for the most part, this means that the invasion will progress similarly to how ZZ have seen it progress for the past several /years/ with no RR present. The major difference would only be that now the Cyroian aranea would be alive again, probably making fighting the invasion even easier.

This means that any plans and practice within the loop that ZZ might do now will be somewhat similar to what will happen outside of the loop. They'll most likely have an easier time dealing with the invasion.

Compare this with not killing RR. RR is /extremely/ familiar with what the invasion looks like when hardly anyone loopers were changing things---in fact, RR had several dozen loops where Zach would piss off completely and go do his own thing. As soon as Zach and Zorian start running interference, RR will likely be able to tell, and at /that/ point, RR is going to have to start improvising, which means the entire situation will become more unpredictable and thus the potential for unexpected disaster rises.
