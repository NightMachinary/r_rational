I agree that in a direct fight, they can likely beat RR very easily. However, once they exit the loop, RR may immediately teleport to discuss plans with QI . . . or possibly teleport to the Cyorian aranea colony and destroy all the spiders, though he'll probably assume they won't pose a significant problem.

The main point is that if they can't neutralize RR immediately at the beginning of the loop, then RR will not be easy to find and may change drastically how things will go down, which means ZZ won't be able to predict how the first month in the real world will go.
