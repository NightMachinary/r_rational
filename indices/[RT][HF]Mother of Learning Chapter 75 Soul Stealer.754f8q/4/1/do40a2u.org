Not necessarily.

We don't know whether Zorian can track RR by soul marker, since he only learned how to do that after RR had already left. We don't know whether Veyers is RR, and if he's not, then we have no idea who it is. We don't know how paranoid RR is, and how carefully he'll cover his tracks after exiting. We don't know whether the ability to summon demons would convince the Ibasans to continue with the invasion even if their gate is stolen. And ZZ will have to be much more careful of their own safety once they're out.
