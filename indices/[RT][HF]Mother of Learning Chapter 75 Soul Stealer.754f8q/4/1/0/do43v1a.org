Oh definitely, I'm reaching for some of that, but between things like knowing who most or all of the super secret leadership of the Cult of the Dragon is, the exact details of how the Ibasans are reaching the place, and the web of support they've found, it looking a lot less like the desperate fight against an insurmountable challenge that it did near the beginning.

I can't see the Ibasans continuing with the invasion if they lose the gate under Cyoria (or the one into Sudomir's manor), demon support or no. For one thing, Cyoria would have angel support. Their whole plan hinges on surprise, without the gate they wouldn't be able to even bring in the entire invasion force. The much bigger potential spanner in the works is pretty much RR taking out ZZ before they can implement any of their plans against the primordial unsealing and the invasion. Hell, he could even kill them but if they get a notebook with details to Alanic first, and RR doesn't know that, it's show over. The actual literal army comes down on Sudomir's or on the gate compound, and there is at the least too much scrutiny on the head members of the Cult of the Dragon for them to unleash the primordial on their own.

Tracking down RR is definitely still the rough part, I just don't think there's much that one mage (who is described as roughly on par with Zach in 26: Soulkill) can do against them. I do think he's gonna be pretty paranoid though. He may've hoped that the gate would shut down without them able to leave, but who knows. I'd gamble against RR having a marker, since he's an accomplished mage with soul perception, I think if he'd had one, he would've found out about Zorian that way.
