Yeah, I ended up thinking about that a bit after I wrote this. For some reason I think I'd gotten a wire crossed and thought of the true Controller as physically in the Sovereign Gate, when the deal is that it's their soul that's the only one not made by the Gate, which makes my ideas in the first paragraph a bit confused.

That's a pretty interesting notion, very worth chewing on. It's a toughy to puzzle out with current information because we're already looking at a failure state. There's only supposed to ever be one person who leaves, and that's supposed to end the loop. But the Gatekeeper knows that the "Controller" exited, so we know that whatever method was used interacted with the loop's control systems. So I wouldn't be too surprised to learn that the results look like one of the control system's functions (a soul not being re-created at the beginning of an iteration: because that's the Controller's soul and they left).

On the other hand, it does seem a bit odd. I think ultimately this makes me put more weight in Veyers being ejected just to prevent Zach from tracking down the actual Red Robe.
