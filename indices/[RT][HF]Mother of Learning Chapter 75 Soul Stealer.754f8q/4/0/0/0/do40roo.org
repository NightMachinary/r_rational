Thing is, I doubt that the Gate has any special logic for dealing with anything after the Controller leaves - because the loop is supposed to end. So there won't be any code that says "don't recreate the Controller's soul any more". Zorian's soul is presumably not being duplicated simply because the Gate logic says, "destroy all matter; collect all (permanent/temporary) marked souls into the Gate; recreate matter; anchor souls from Gate into their bodies; create and anchor other souls from template."
