Huh. Sure does adjust my belief that Veyers was a red herring way the hell downward. The immediate system 1 prediction was the Boranova heir really is the third looper, and that they had discovered a method to exit the Gate as a soul alone (presumably to soul parasite their original body), which would also be yet more evidence that Zach is the original. That said, it also sounds like a great bait-and-switch to have somebody Zach knew /through/ Veyers suborn the time loop. In this theory, the third looper edits Zach mind and excises Veyers from the loop just to prevent Zach from tracking him down. At the very least it's fantastic that they found the appropriate link between the Cult of the Dragon and Veyers.

I am surprised the lawyer didn't mention the entire company of mercenaries that were ALSO found dead of mysterious causes, sometimes in heavily warded homes, with no sign of a struggle. Maybe he didn't hear about it until after he'd panicked and put V in the chill chest.

It's funny, I had generally imagined they'd spend a lot of time at the end of Arc 3 preparing for what they'd do once they got out. But it's starting to sound like they almost accidentally have that on lockdown. The answer might be a very simple, "Catch up to third looper early, curb stomp montage presumably set to X Gonna Give it To Ya; kidnap and tastefully edit Sudomir before dropping him and evidence off with Alanic; gather small army and boot the invaders back through their portal, possibly in a montage set to X Gonna Give it To Ya (Bass Boosted). Proceed to destroy evil, aid allies, provide payback, and coordinate better life."

After their conversation about Zorian's soul perception, I am definitely leaning more towards a prediction of Zorian rejoining the world outside the gate as a sort of golem-lich (something like: piggy back as some kind of soul-package on Zach, Zach constructs golem with special soul anchoring mechanism, creates a simulacrum based on Zorian's soul that attaches the magical brain and physical appearance of Zorian to it, lets his soul detach from his own).
