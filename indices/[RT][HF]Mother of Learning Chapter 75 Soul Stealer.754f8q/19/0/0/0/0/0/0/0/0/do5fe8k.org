I can't think of a good reason for how or why zach managed to meet a copy of himself and then integrate their souls together, but it would be a really elegant way to explain his wildly aberrant mana capacity. if the two soul cores are from the same person, it might just count as one (somewhat monstrous) soul as far as most effects are concerned, to include its interactions with his body and brain. like an egg with two yokes. it may have been something done to him, considering he obviously has some sort of interaction with a powerful necromancer in his past that he doesn't remember.

and even if this isn't why zach has metric tons of mana, it's still a potential route for zorian to avoid having to kill his outside world self. he is already well on his way to becoming a soul mage capable of doing something so wildly complex, and with soul sight he is equipped to continue down that path.
