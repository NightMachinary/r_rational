This is a relevant [[https://www.ted.com/talks/robin_hanson_what_would_happen_if_we_upload_our_brains_to_computers/up-next][TEDTalk on uploading ourselves to computers]] where the speaker essentially discuses exactly this problem of simulacra (he calls them emulations). Imagine you got really drunk and had a really fun time and experienced a bunch of stuff and met a bunch of people, but then you blacked out and forgot most of it? The next day, you'd maybe have a bunch of texts from people you don't really remember and you have a little bit of new information from what you can recall of the night, but most of what made you "end of the night"!you, the memories and experiences, would vanish. And yet we don't mourn that situation as the loss of a person; it's just an offshoot of you.

I actually find the death of a simulacrum to be more troubling than the replacement of Real!Zorian by Loop!Zorian.

Say a simulacrum was created in the morning. By the end of the day, you have this: Zorian + (simulacrum's new experiences) and Zorian + (Zorian's new experiences). When the simulacrum dies, some of the simulacrum's experiences are integrated with Zorian, so finally you have Zorian + (Zorian's new experiences) + (some of the simulacrum's new experiences). Notice that a bunch of what made the simulacrum a person is lost.

Using a similar logic for Real!Zorian, Loop!Zorian = Real!Zorian + (Loop!Zorian's new experiences). So, if Loop!Zorian totally replaces Real!Zorian, basically nothing of Real!Zorian is actually lost as far as memories and knowledge are concerned.

Thus, it's arguable that the death of a simulacrum is more troubling than the replacement of Real!Zorian with Loop!Zorian because when a simulacrum dies, information is totally obliterated, whereas if Real!Zorian dies, all his memories continue to live on in Loop!Zorian.

However, being a simulacrum, there are likely small imperfections in the magical brain, so perhaps the it's better to refrain from a total overwrite of Zorian by a simulacrum.
