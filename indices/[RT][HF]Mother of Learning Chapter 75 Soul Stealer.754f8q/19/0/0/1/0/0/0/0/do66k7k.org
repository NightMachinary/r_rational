The simulacrum takes the soul of the caster as the basis for making the copy. Since the simulacrum have no soul of their own, them casting the spell would simply result in another copy of the original... not themselves.

So I suppose simulacrums can technically cast the spell, but they would still be forking the original and not the simulacrum that cast the spell. Also, since their thoughts had subtly diverged from the original at that point, there would be minute incompatibilities between their image of base Zorian and his real identity, which would amplify the normally minor differences between the simulacrum and the original and possibly result in some kind of critical failure. So even though it's possible for simulacrums to create more of themselves, it's best to leave that task to the original.
