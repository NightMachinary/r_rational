I've never really commented on this story here, so possibly you all have gone over this, but how deep into time loops do you think they all are?

I mean, 400 years ago the Gods were suddenly cut off, which seems to indicate that the world was thrust into a pocket universe of some kind.

What if, just to keep things going, someone who could create time loops did so every 29th day?

28 days pass, the next day a time loop is created.

28 new days pass in that time loop, then the next day a new loop is created.

28 new days pass in that time loop, then the next day a new loop is created.

28 new days pass in that time loop, then the next day a new loop is created.

28 new days pass in that time loop, then the next day a new loop is created.

...

I could be wrong about that 400 years bit, but if I'm remembering right then they could be in the 5,215th nested time loop.
