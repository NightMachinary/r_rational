It seems to me that provoking the flower might be a relatively safe way to practice rudimentary soul defense. They already know they can weather its attacks, and if they want to make an enhancement potion each loop anyways, where else can they practice soul defense. Particularly for Zach, who was hit by the soul attack, but didn't get reset.
