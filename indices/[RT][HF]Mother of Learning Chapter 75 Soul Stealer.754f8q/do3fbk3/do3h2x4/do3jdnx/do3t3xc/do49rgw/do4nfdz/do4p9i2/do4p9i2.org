  Exponential growth is exhibited when the *growth rate* of the value of a mathematical function is proportional to the function's current value, resulting in its growth with time being an exponential function

(Emphasis modified.)

That's not a counterpoint, quite the opposite. Exponential growth is /exactly/ when the growth rate (the derivative) has a linear relationship to the current value.
