My understanding is : The orb special because it contains a full palace in which you can teleport. Nothing said the difficulty was proportionnal to the size of the pocket, maybe its proportionnal to the size squared or whatever.

Plus aquiring a spell is somewhat a political challenge : Daimen never managed to get the Gate spell for /political/ reasons.

Individuals able of making a pocket dimension do seem rare, individuals willing to share these kinds of secrets for "nothing" in return (Assuming you want to learn from many tutors, you can't afford apprentiship) are even more rare.

Finally, people with Z&Z's fitness to learn the skill even more so, regardless of their young age.
