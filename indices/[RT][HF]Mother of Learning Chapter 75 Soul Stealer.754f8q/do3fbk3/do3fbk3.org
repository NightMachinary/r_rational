I'm wondering about the whole pocket dimension thing. So the Orb is super special because it can be deployed or moved around very easily. Yet Z&Z make tiny portable dimensions within their first month. So why is the Orb so special? Is it just the size? Does making a pocket dimension mobile make it harder to make, or smaller?

Two other questions about pocket dimensions, although not specifically related to this chapter:

what does the border of the pocket dimension look like from the inside? Is it just an empty void? Or is there some view of the outside?

What lights them? Silverlake has a small garden, and the Orb had plant life inside, so presumably there is some light source. In the case of the Orb, whatever light source had to have operated continuously since it was last sealed, when most other magical devices had broken down.
