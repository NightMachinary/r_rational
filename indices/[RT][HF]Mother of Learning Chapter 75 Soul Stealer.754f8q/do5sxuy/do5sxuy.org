Lately I've been wondering a lot what enhancement ritual Zorian will end up using shiny new blood-magic skills for (or from the similar angle, what I'd pursue if I were in an identical situation). It's a puzzler, because lots of permanent enhancements would be /extremely convenient/, but Zorian's becoming a high caliber archmage: every iota of mana he has could be used for a dizzying array of effects. Something needs to be very special to be worth permanently tying up any of his mana.

Here are the enhancements and enhancement adjacent options I can remember or speculate exist:

*Mana* (probably not possible): the obvious wishing for more wishes option. If we had Zach's mana pool it'd easily be like, "Okay, so staple half a dragon's worth of enhancements up one side of my soul, a gray hunter's up the other, but make sure you leave some room for a salamander+troll+hydra regeneration complex. After that we'll go look at some obscure creatures I've fought over the past thirty years of adventuring and play it by ear." But there've been a lot of questions on the wordpress blog about different options, like shifter soulmelds or necromancy, and nobody103 has mostly shut it down (that level of soul manipulation is the domain of gods and primordials). Though I'm sure +Flowey+ the soulseizer will spark new rounds of speculation. My personal impression is that almost anything Zorian could do with /HORRIFYINGLY UNETHICAL AND VILE SOUL FUCKERY/ he could do with more mundane mana batteries. (Which actually makes me wonder if he couldn't offload some of the simulacrum upkeep cost to a spell formula on his proxy golems.)

*Mana Regen* (probably infeasible): almost as good would be the ability to generate or assimilate mana at the kind of speeds trolls regenerate flesh. In comments on wordpress, nobody103 implies that this is at least more feasible than adding capacity, but a creature or bloodline that actually does it is unknown.

*A Familiar*: Zorian seems unlikely to take a familiar while in the gate, because he fears messing up his delicately, one-in-a-million damaged brand, but it's entirely possible outside of the gate. It could even help with mana, since with enough practice, using a willing familiar's mana is only a little slower and harder than using your own. Plus, if he learns more transformation magic, a willing and living creature makes an ideal template for temporary enhancements.

*Shifting* whether mundane or magical: A lot of people are really interested in this one, though, as above, it's unlikely inside the loop. You can see why he'd want the ritual though. It doesn't even tie up any mana just to be a shifter---though it does to use their abilities. There's even the potential that a supernatural shifter would have more mana. Even mundane animal shifting has a lot to offer: superior senses, swimming or flying, strength or stamina, etc, and if he knows the ritual he can become a multi-shifter (meet my son the eagle-bear-shark). On the supernatural side, there are even more possible advantages, but you never know how big a barrier being unable to have sane kids would be to a given individual (not a dealbreaker for me). And whatever opinions Zorian/I have of his/my will, the risk of overestimating it is extreme. And there's still the fact that enhancement/transformation can give you individual advantages temporarily. The main advantage of shifter magic over transformation is the instinctual use of the other form---where Zorian is already ahead of the game on with his Openness. Sure, absolutely, the ability to call on a grey hunter's or a dragon's strength, resistances, senses, etc, at any time with no preparation is very appealing, but it wouldn't be a priority for me.\\
Some people have brought up the tantalizing idea of a shifter like soul meld with a spirit being. While you would theoretically get a lot of the spirit's (often impressive) innate magic, nobody103 gave the impression that the apt metaphor would be, "What if I tied a tender baby (my soul) to a pissed off alligator (a spirit)?" To quote, it is, "Insanely dangerous." To come out of a soul fusion sane, your soul needs to be the dominant one, and that kind of wrestling is occurring on the battlefiend where the spirit was born. You also don't get an alternate form, and there are few examples to show you how to do it. This isn't going to keep me from thinking about my DeviantArt-OC-tier Mary Sue that soulfused an angel or powerful fey or something.

*Alteration*: given the time loop, it's almost surprising that Zorian hasn't experimented with bio-alteration magic (why not at least magi-lasik, for instance?). I guess since nobody else has had the protection of the loop, Zorian would basically be inventing a new branch of magic out of whole-cloth, and complex organic compounds are currently just out of consideration at their science/magic level. He'd be losing parts of restarts for any tests that went wrong enough, and there's no telling what continuing to grow after he stops resetting would do to changes. So I guess it makes sense, no matter how sweet and transhumanist it'd be to lace his skin and bones with carbon fiber or whatever.

*Psychic Power*: Zorian already won the bloodline power lottery in getting this. Even if I lacked his absurd educational opportunities, if I were dropped into MoL-verse, I'd be scrambling to grab it. It's not just the intuitive mind magic and passive empathy, but the overall enhanced ability to interpret information. (It's common and potent enough that I've found myself wondering if a primordial's not involved.)

*Ghost Eyes*: another for completeness' sake. I wonder if it'd be possible to use blood magic to make spirit perception an inheritable ability, and whether or not this "natural" version would work any better than the apparently slightly hack-y approach that potions or ritual murder give. I feel like giving my kids intuitive mind and soul powers is a ticket to getting the fam run out of town on a rail though.

*Elemental Powers* (eg, Boranova or Grier): one of the things I really appreciate about this world is that there's no actual like, fundamental magical property to elements, they're just "a thing an elemental happens to embody". So there's no real earth magic, but there is a blob of Earth Elemental Essence that explains to a soul how to do all kinds of nifty high quality and efficient unstructured magic that involves earth and stone. I'm sure these are convenient and I'd play them up if I were already born with them, there's not a lot of reason for Zorian to pursue this kind of active ability.

*Reid Family Bloodline*: in a wordpress comment nobody103 said that this makes them really resistant to toxins and allows them to analyze things they ingest. Honestly, between the defense and information gathering, it seems solidly worth considering trying to steal this, but being mistaken as part of The Family could be persistently annoying.

*Physical enhancements*: I imagine there's a whole spectrum of these for strength, durability, regeneration, etc. Honestly though, unless he can find a ritual that's especially efficient (eg, peak human physical ability for 1% of your mana), I don't see him going this way. It might be emotionally satisfying to be double burly, but magic's more effective. And so long as he's not caught completely by surprise, his magic is a better defense than tanking some hit (for instance, I'm expecting him to very shortly develop a high speed "swap places with my golem-simulacrum" spell). And if he survives something he can heal later. Far better would be something that helps him not be surprised in the first place.
