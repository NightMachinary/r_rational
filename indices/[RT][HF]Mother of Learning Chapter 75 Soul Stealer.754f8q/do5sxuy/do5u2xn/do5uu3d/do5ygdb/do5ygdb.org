To be frank, Zorian has most of the advantages one could want:

*Mind Magic* One of the most versatile fields, this makes him a controller type, which is subtle and leverages the power of his opponents' forces against them. More importantly, in time he will improve his ability to think, focus, remember, and self-motivate. These are priceless advantages.

*Spell Formula* This allows him to create items and effects that are incredible force multipliers. Enchanted guns, bombs, utility devices, golems to tank, and now golems to house his simulacrum.

*Simulacra* Of course, basically now he has a small team of himself, increasing his productivity by factor of seven currently as he has six simulacra working on projects. This may also lead to lichdom.

*Soul Sense* Zorian already achieved the major advantage of being able to create simulacra, but hopefully soul sense will give additional benefits we don't know of yet.

*Wealth* The often forgotten superpower, wealth has allowed him to spare no expense in his training or the materials he uses and hire teams of experts to help him with his work, which is possibly even more effective than having simulacra. How sick was that custom shield spell he used against the Grey Hunter? ;)

*Big enhancements still needed*

- Mana sense
- Immortality
- Eternal youth
