Thanks. That's a great point (you're full of those), but I wonder, it's not channeling the mana, just being maintained by it.

I actually considered mentioning Zach (again) under the mana section, but cut it because everything was already so wordy. It's definitely the ideal, but I think it probably falls under the, "Only the gods and primordials," clause. My current top prediction is that it was a boon to Zach from the same Agent of The Maker that also made him the Controller.
