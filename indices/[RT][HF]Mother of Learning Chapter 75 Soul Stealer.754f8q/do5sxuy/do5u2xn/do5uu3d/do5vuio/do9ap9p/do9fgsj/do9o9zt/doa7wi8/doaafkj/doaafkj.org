This is where you hit trouble. I'll quote from the last paragraph - which is specifically about undead, but we know that a simulacrum operates on many of the same principles as a lich:

#+begin_quote
  Higher order undead, such as liches and vampires, do not have living bodies but are capable of spellcasting nonetheless. At first glance, it may seem that they would be able to use ambient mana a lot more freely as a result. To an extent, this is true -- they certainly won't be incapacitated by sickness in the aftermath of such use. However, in order to retain their sapience, such undead need to possess a sort of magical brain to think with... and that brain is every bit as vulnerable to insanity as biological ones.

On the subject of blasting rods:

#+begin_quote
  missing is the notion that this fire retains the toxic and corrosive properties of the raw mana.
#+end_quote

Not missing at all. See the comment that I referred to, and the reply. Raw mana is indeed hazardous, and will destroy the blasting rod if overused.
