Yes, and the golem was able to power a multitude of powerful spells. One might wonder if a dragon soul was bound to the golem to lend power to the various passive effects, but it's also possible the golem drew power from ambient mana as well, the point being that a lot of mana was utilized by this inanimate object to power various effects that didn't seem like they would be simple spells. Likewise, could a golem similarly draw mana to aid in maintaining a spell boundary? I mean, that's kind of the entire point of spell formulas and wards, right? Then let's just say that the spell boundary in question is some aspect of the simulacrum spell and we're in business. Again, I think this is a part of how Zorian already reduced the simulacrum cost in addition to not needing to create the ectoplasmic body.
