I don't know where to go from here. We both agree, 100% that channeling ambient mana is destructive. Where we seem to part ways is that I don't see anything indicative of there being no distinction between shaping ambient mana into an effect, and being an effect made from that mana. For example, it is not because of the animation spell affecting a golem that their durable stone matters, it's because the spell formulae that anchor and maintain that animation spell (not to mention their many wards) are also carved into them.

Just to be completely clear about the brain, I'm only talking about maintenance costs. I'm not talking about the simulacra being able to cast spells using anything other than the attuned mana from their shared soul.
