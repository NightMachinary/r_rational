Let's make sure we're all on the same page here. Even if a spell formula is maintaining a persistent spell, no item (not one made by mortals anyways) can cast a spell on its own, so something like a golem requires casting a complex series of animation spells as it's created, using the spell formulas instead of spell elements (invocations) to constrain the spell boundary. But once the formulas have been primed with that spell, they can continue running by drawing on ambient mana (or a mana battery). Ambient mana is toxic and corrosive, but wood, stone and metal are durable enough that it's mostly irrelevant.

The simulacrum spell seems to work in three parts: shared soul, ectoplasmic body, artificial brain. We don't have exact details of how he makes the golem frame simulacra work, but it sounds like he spends less energy because he supports physically less ectoplasm, and doesn't need to provide mana to make the bodies move. My suggestion is that if he can make a spell formula, presumably inscribed on something in the golem, that persistently maintains the brain part using mana from a battery.

The core of the disagreement here seems to be whether the effect created by a spell formula drawing ambient mana still retains some of the toxic properties of the mana it was made of, which I don't see. It's not quite the same thing, but the entire point of blasting rods is that they channel ambient mana into a, "Barely constrained torrent of energy, usually fire," missing is the notion that this fire retains the toxic and corrosive properties of the raw mana. Being inside a privacy ward run off ambient mana doesn't make people sick, or more relevantly, passing through a ward that scans some element of their mind and body. The distinction I see, made several times in world building posts and comments, is with words like "use" "shape" and "channel".
