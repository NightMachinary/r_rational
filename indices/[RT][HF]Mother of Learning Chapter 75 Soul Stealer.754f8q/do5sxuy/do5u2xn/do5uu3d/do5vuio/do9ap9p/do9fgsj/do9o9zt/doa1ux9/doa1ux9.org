It isn't the body that's at risk, but the brain. He can make golem bodies tough, but any mind that tries to use raw mana without first taking time to assimilate it will gradually - or not so gradually - break down.

It might be possible to build spell-like effects into the golem body and safely trigger those from a simulacrum brain. But they can only be very simple, crude effects like a blasting rod. Anything more advanced requires that the mind of the caster become directly involved in shaping the mana, and then you have problems.
