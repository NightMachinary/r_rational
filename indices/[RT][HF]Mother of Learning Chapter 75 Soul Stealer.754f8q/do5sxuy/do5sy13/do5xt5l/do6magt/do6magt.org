I definitely agree that a lot of people underestimate the dangers of a shifter bond, especially to a magical creature or to a sapient creature. Like even a winter wolf or ironbeak would be too much for the average person; a dragon is on a whole other level. People point to Sudomir's insane experiment, but while there's a lot bad to say about him, weak will and personality are not among them. I do think it's within the given Zorian's drive, he'd have a chance to, as Kael said, "---Master a grey hunter's soul and not let its urges rule [him]." But it's not something undertaken lightly, I sure wouldn't relish having to constantly be on guard lest my dragon half's personality overwhelm me.

For an underwater shifter I was thinking more about quick travel through rivers or being able to navigate flooded ruins or caves.

In [[https://motheroflearninguniverse.wordpress.com/2016/07/02/sapient-species-of-the-world/#comments][this worldbuilding article]] there were a lot of questions about shifters, and the author's responses to ones about fusing with multiple mundane animals made it sound less of a terrible idea than bonding a single sapient or magical creature.
