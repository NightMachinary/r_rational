Huh, I missed this way back when. I actually agree completely, an ironbeak is basically similar to a raven but cooler and more deadly, with its super accuracy.

I have no clue about the affect it might have, as I understand it in the ideal situation, the mage is the spiritually dominant one in the soulbond relationship, and acquires few if any traits from it, since it's not the soul fusion of something like a shifter bond. Having an ideal candidate for borrowing mana and an ideal template for transformation magic would be useful though.
