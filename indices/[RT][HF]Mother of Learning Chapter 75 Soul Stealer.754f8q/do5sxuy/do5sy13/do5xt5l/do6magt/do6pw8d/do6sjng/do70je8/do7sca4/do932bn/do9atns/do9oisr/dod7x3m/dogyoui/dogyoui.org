To be clear, when I said that the bird would "convey intelligence", I meant it in the sense of information due to scouting. Through mind magic, it'd be like having live and detailed satellite imagery of his location.

To be honest, he wouldn't even need a familiar to do this. All he would need is a few birds that he trains and/or uses permanent compulsions on for this purpose. He's already done this in the past actually with pigeons, but I'm surprised he doesn't use it more frequently.
