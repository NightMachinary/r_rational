You make a good point that if someone could make bonding with a Grey Hunter work, Zorian with his advanced mental abilities could. However, I do feel it would make him (even more) antisocial and possibly aggressive over the long period. Sudomir kept it together . . . kind of. I mean, his sensibilities were questionable to begin with being a necromancer and all, so who's to say?

I've been dismissing the grey hunter bond out of hand because it's so dangerous, but lemme think about it more carefully. What are the advantages?

- Extreme durability to physical and magical attacks.
- Extreme reflexes, strength, and agility.
- Mana sense
- Tremor sense.

Critique:

*Durability* Zorian has golems and simulacra. They can be made more durable (perhaps from Grey Hunter carapace?), could potentially be made modularly (detachable armors, etc. to switch up resisitances), and have the benefit of not actually being Zorian on the front lines (except in the case of simulacra if the enemy can use offensive soul magic).

*Reflexes, Strength, and Agility* Reflexes and agility would certainly be useful to Zorian in a fight, although since Zorian is rarely a sole actor (golems, simulacra) or surprised (mind magic), it's a bit less important. Should he risk his mental stability for these? Well, let's say I'd definitely look into a reflex enhancement ritual because faster reaction times means faster spells.

*Mana and Tremor sense* We both know how awesome these is. I would definitely take this as an enhancement ritual, but these two abilities, especially the mana sense, really make bonding with the grey hunter enticing. Tremor sense is a bit overkill because of Zorian's mind sense, but being able to navigate terrain easily and get information about aircurrents is pretty cool.

*Transformation to Spider* This is where the decision becomes clear for me that this shifter bond is a bad idea. Zorian is so utterly effective in mage form that I feel turning into a spider wouldn't be of great benefit. Arguably, he could be a little more aggressive with his mana use, then upon running out, just turn into a spider and break shit, but then we're talking about melee combat when really he should have just teleported back to safety long before it got to that point.

--------------

All in all, I'm itching to see where Zorian goes with the blood magic enhancements because it would obviate the need to deal with the Grey Hunter's psyche.

I just took a look at the chapter you mentioned (chapter 62) and . . . I'd also like to see them draw on their life force to power spells at some point toward the end of a restart. Maybe Zorian uses it to dramatically boost his mind magic abilities and just wreck an entire base of Ilbasans by squinting aggresively at them.

Oh, and he mentions an enhancement ritual to just passively have flight. That'd be pretty fun. If I were Zach, I would pack on a bunch of those.
