*Enhanced or Additional Senses* mundane or magical: This is probably my first bet for the actual story, and I think one of the big reasons I'd personally become a shifter. Zorian seemed excited by the eagle sight and grey hunter tremorsense. More information about his surroundings is always going to be useful to avoid unpleasant surprises, and though divination can cover a lot of the info, a permanent sense can catch things even when he doesn't think to look out for them or be extra cautious. A better-than-humanly-possible mana-sense is a noticeable stand-out option, given how the better you are at sensing your own mana, the better you are at magic, period. There are also other or combined senses; consider that rabbit in the most recent chapter: two separate, enviably powerful archmages could not find a way to hide from them (plus a jewel embedded in your forehead that gives you magic powers is /always/ cool).

*Enhanced Mental Speed or Reflexes*: Another one of my top spread guesses, especially if he can nick a version with all the kinks worked out (eg, you don't feel like people are talking like the sloths from Zootopia). Imagine being able to see that disintigration beam or high-power stun wave coming and cast a defensive spell before it even gets there. This is one that that gets MORE useful the more things he can do with the rest of his mana, but it also sounds a little rare, expensive, or infeasible.

*Nonsomnolence*: I asked nobody103 where it's possible to permanently do without sleep in his verse. It's one of my favorite oft-overlooked powers: 50% more active time (even simulacrums still need sleep), never at risk of ambush during sleep, and immunity to the whole spectrum of deleterious effects of sleep deprivation. But his response was that he decided it's possible, but has unpredictable side effects on ones mental state, taking it out of consideration for Zorian. I still wonder if it'd be possible to find a lesser version, like classic D&D elves' trancing (only need 4 hours of sleep a night and retain marginally awareness of surroundings).

*Supernatural Accuracy*: assuming that the ironbeak's power is general enough that it'd be applicable (and not just with dropping things from the air), stealing this seems like stellar synergy with Zorian's low mana. If it works with telekinetically hurled items, this helps Zorian catch up on one of Zach's more useful abilities: you can't dispel a super dense rock. And if it extends as far as guns? That'd make it an automatic choice. Imagine just sniping the grey hunter.

*Concealment*: Just rounding out the kinds of magical abilities we've seen monsters use, being able to go full tunnel octopus or chameleon drake has utility, but more the "let's make some potions" than "let's sacrifice 10% of my mana forever" utility.

*Mobility*: Zorian's on record that teleportation is the ultimate tool for getting around. Flight, enhanced running speed, phasing, none of that for him. Personally, I feel like the ability to maneuver around foes and traps at high speeds in three dimensions makes a good supernatural flight worth practising, but again, probably not worth permanently tying up mana.

*Unaging*: Another I'm including for completeness sake. Zorian probably won't work on this during the loop, but after? I sure know I'd prefer, you know, not dying. In a reply on wordpress nobody103 implies this is probably a unique alchemical potion (or series of potions) for each alchemist that does it. You can't just buy the recipe and make a batch for yourself and each of your friends. But surely between his own ability, ability to acquire ingredients, Kael helping, and maybe buying Silverlake's research notes off her, Zorian will have a leg up.
