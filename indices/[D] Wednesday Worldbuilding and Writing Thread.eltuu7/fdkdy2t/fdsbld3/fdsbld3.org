Towards the end of the Golden Age of Bionicle (~2003), the lead writer had to describe 42 different powers, at 6 different stages of power, in order to provide lore for the 252 collectibles ("kraata") Lego was releasing in bonus packs that year.

You could crib some notes from this. If one of the powers at stage 6 breaks the plot, just pick one of the lower power-levels. Or maybe the lower power-levels are more interesting to find creative uses for.
