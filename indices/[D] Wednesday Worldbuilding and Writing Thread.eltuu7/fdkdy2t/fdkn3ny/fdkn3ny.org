#+begin_quote
  Morph into land octopus
#+end_quote

A simple form-changing spell that alters the caster's body into that of an octopus... That is much more suited for tree-swinging than sea-dwelling. Also comes with rudimentary camouflage and squeezing abilities, but the number of inhuman abilities and inputs means that someone who hasn't practiced with this form can find it difficult to perform basic actions.

#+begin_quote
  Skin into leather
#+end_quote

Can only be cast on skin that is currently part of a living creature. Usually kills the creature. Needs prolonged contact (maybe a minute long? This can be changed to taste). Results in some interesting fashions/torture methodologies as well as a unique form of artisan leather. I'm not sure if this would break the economy of the world, but if it would, the transformation can be made temporary.

#+begin_quote
  Churn water
#+end_quote

Designates an area that propagates in size from the mage's hands which churns water within. The larger the volume of water, the greater the churning. Would possibly see some usage in naval actions? Also perfect for spilling drinks if you happen to be the sort of person who spills drinks for fun. Probably has some niche cooking uses as well.

#+begin_quote
  Expunge chitin
#+end_quote

So long as the spell is maintained, gaps in the palms of the caster's hands open and expel chitin shards. Rate and force of expulsion can be altered as needed for story purposes.

#+begin_quote
  Magnify complex motion
#+end_quote

Part of casting this spell involves moving all limbs a minimum distance. Once the spell is complete, ghostly after-images will perform those motions on a grander scale. The greater the complexity of the motions on a limb-by-limb average, the more powerful and large the after-images will be. What the spell lacks in reliability (due to the difficulty casters have in performing the same motion time and time again) it makes up for in scale. Casters need at least four limbs to perform the spell.

#+begin_quote
  Simple Tuning Shield
#+end_quote

A temporary shield spell that can defend against material attacks. However, the shield can only tune itself to one element or molecule at a time, which to a lower tech level will appear as a defence against specific materials only. The shield tunes itself automatically to the most numerous solid or liquid that passes through it during the first few seconds of its creation, and thereafter tunes itself to any material that passes through in a quantity that exceeds that.

#+begin_quote
  Create unfortunate golem
#+end_quote

This spell takes a rabbit-sized portion of material and for a short period allows it to move as if there was animal intellect behind it. Unfortunately, it is very expensive to create a body that can actually move effectively. There's no telekinetic force or anything that moves the material, you see, it must have been capable of moving on its own, should there have been something driving it. So, save for the richest folks, the golem is quite unfortunate (for the hour or so for which it exists). There is a limit on the number of unfortunate golems one can maintain.

#+begin_quote
  Animate helpful bone
#+end_quote

A complex spell that is simple in expression. The most damaged bone in a person's body temporarily gains animal intellect and minor telekinetic force to move itself. It will then attempt to mend itself as best possible before the spell expires. The spell has the potential to be useful, but casters should beware that the intellect, although somewhat benevolent in its task, can be somewhat... Error-prone... in execution.

#+begin_quote
  Gift flammable property
#+end_quote

A spell which makes a material about as combustible as charcoal for a few hours. Tinder is still needed to light it initially. The mass of material that can be made flammable is limited.

#+begin_quote
  Toe into finger
#+end_quote

A simple spell that can transform a living toe into a digit as dexterous as a finger. Can be cast multiple times to affect multiple toes. Has a decently long period where it can be maintained, but unconsciousness cancels the spell. The transformation is seamless and harmless, but damage to the digit is maintained both before and after transformation.

#+begin_quote
  Gust Bolt
#+end_quote

The spell creates a force construct that can travel through air. While it can be guided after casting, this requires a low chant to be performed and visual on the construct's location. When the chant is ended, the construct disappears. If the construct impacts a sufficiently massive solid or liquid, it explodes outwards in force. The level of power of this explosion can be tuned as needed for story purposes. The bolt is invisible save for a wavering in the air.

Hope that at least some of these are useful for you!
