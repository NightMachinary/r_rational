Hmm, so basically spells which are more or less useless from the plot's perspective, but presumably have a niche use /somewhere/. That means things with direct combat usage are probably out unless they have a severe drawback or have been eliminated from common military use for some other reason. Logistics spells are similarly restrained, since a teleport would obviously have military uses. I assume this also eliminates scrying etc for the use of intelligence gathering.

Possible candidates:

- animal beacon which attracts nearby individuals of X species to it over a matter of hours
- plant growth +
- plant wither
- shape tree trunk growth
- alter wood post shape
- alter which fruits a plant produces
- cause flowers to bloom
- increase/decrease animal/human fertility/virility
- douse for X nearby mineral or metal
- transmute metals
- summon moderate wind
- freeze water
- still water
- douse for items hidden in water
- clear smoke
- solidify gravel into fused stone
- reduce bleeding
- pain reduction
- caffeine effect
- dry out wood
- transcribe spoken words
- identify blood relation between individuals
- water to wine
- douse for nearest population center
- spin fiber into thread
- enchant item to absorb residual heat
- enchant item to release stored heat
- weather forecasting
- light adhesion (think scotch tape)
- light grease
- water to ink
- purify water
- invisible ink
- repair spell
- homing message send
- grapple hook grip
- seal/unseal pocket seam

A lot of these could be munchkinned for combat, no doubt, but many of them could also expect to be of use behind the scenes and not during combat.
