Creating spells that are /guaranteed/ not to break the plot are, of course, impossible unless you know the plot, but I do think you can come up with spells you think are /unlikely/ to break any given plot. For example, if you added readily-available invisibility to /most/ plots, you'd expect that it would break things more often than not, or at least require a fair amount of rewriting scenes.

Something like "clean the clothes you're wearing" or "gain the ability to jump five times as high for an hour" might break /some/ plots, but probably a lot less than invisibility, while still being of notable utility/flavor and having some impact on what the world looks like.

That said, typical combat spells are good, thanks for those.
