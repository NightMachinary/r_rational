Is it intentional that you don't have any spells for gathering knowledge? Obviously future sight is fairly difficult to include without being it being used all the time, but a spell to enhance each of the senses/identify some specific aspect of an object (maybe to do with chemical properties, to better apply a spell to alter them?)/or allow you to scry some specifically marked individual/location seems like it could be included without necessarily ruining a storyline.
