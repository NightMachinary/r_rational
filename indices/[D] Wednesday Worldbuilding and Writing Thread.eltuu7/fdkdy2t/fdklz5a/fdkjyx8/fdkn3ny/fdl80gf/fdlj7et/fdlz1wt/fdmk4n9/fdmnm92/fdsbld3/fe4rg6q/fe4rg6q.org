Possibilities:

- cure nausea
- cause nausea (target would have to be still for a while)
- small warming effect (without smoke, for stealth maybe)
- target gets +luck/-luck for 2 hours
- remove bugs/rats from area
- enhanced memory acquisition (improves formation of memories while active, but retrieval of already-formed memories is worse)
- command animal (if animal leaves range, the effect fails.)
- recolor an item
- clean an item w/o wear and tear
- waterproof an item
- make an item tougher
- cut leather/cloth/wood (could be used creatively...)
- magnify volume of spoken words (not necessarily of caster) like a megaphone
- remove dust (on surface, not in air)
- enhance sleep
- measure length/mass of item (line of sight)
- telekinetically move an object in line of sight with same effort it would take to move it with caster's muscles
- make small item invisible
- increase charisma of target
- redirect other's magic, but must be touching the caster
- dispel (only caster can dispel their own magic)
- increase nutrient absorption
- make target slightly happier/more satisfied
- bind spell to object so touching the object activates the spell
- makes floating lights that can be moved and adjusted by caster (make massage in sky, show off)
- sands an item
- makes target more tired/sleepy, has to be touching them
- improve dexterity for multiple targets, very exhausting
- muffle sound (quietus)
- make area in 2m vicinity of caster seem incredibly uninteresting, can be resisted
