Things that probably won't break the plot - a list of useful but not magical items from dnd [[https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Adventuring%20Gear#content][here]]. But that's probably too many out of the 163, and more balance between categories might be good.

In one of the last books in the Inheritance Trilogy, I think there's a spell for a light without a source that is used against the Ra'zac. (With no other illumination*) There are no shadows in the area of effect. It was used in a cave, and the boundary was a radius or 'some sense of room' that wasn't clearly demarcated. Cool spell, similar to the flashlight without having to carry it, but it makes things look weird because we're not used to seeing things like that.

*Unclear how it would function if there was. If it just brings the light to a certain level, and can be adjusted or applied more than once, then with some work, it could possibly be munchkined into unit for light (or energy if drain is experienced from using spells).

Puts out a fire. (Might want limits on size or energy - starting a fire is one thing, but putting out an inferno might be a bit much.)

Making the caster's/target's body (a little) warmer or colder. (Risk: used in combat at critical moments to make people drop things, so people fight using gloves to prevent this, etc.)

Spells with (small) effects similar to drugs.

Detecting food or water. Finding north/magnetic north/east/where the sun will rise/set.

Healing a small injury (like a scratch) - works even on delicate tissues, like if your eye got irritated.

Slight increase in strength or energy. (a la Mistborn)

The ability to make different colored lights could be used to communicate (if large enough, etc.).

The ability to fly could make a difference in a story, especially if it wasn't dangerous. The ability to have a nice dream about flying, not so much. (A spell for lucid dreaming? A good sleep? A dreamless sleep?)

A spell for shared dreams likewise (usually) has consequences. If dreams aren't portents or omens, the ability to repeat dreams, or continue them where they left off, less so. (There's a series in which the protagonist lives two lives - switching between them when they go to sleep. The really weird part is that it seems like both lives are real and at different points in time - or the main character was going crazy, I never finished the series.)

Increased or decreased speed. Feather fall. Getting people's attention (perhaps proportional to user's power/expenditure. (Used for drama or getting people to shut up. (Mistborn or 13th child (Mage draws in magical energy for a spell, and doesn't do anything with it. People notice, they start speaking and let it out slowly.))

Teleportation can affect plot a lot unless it's expensive, doesn't work at a critical time (it can be warded against), or somehow is already used almost everywhere useful. (Young Wizards.) Locating or retreiving a (minor) lost item/communing with distant entities, not so much. Powerful spells can also be just 'tricky to use', or dangerous enough no one uses them.

A spell that kills the target (if it can bleed it can be killed), but only one at a time, or which can be warded against. (Could change the balance between magic users and non-magic users - if magic users* fit certain profiles/have certain things in common, then relying on them not using certain spells make sense - consider nukes (some people conceivably wouldn't (usually) use them, even if they could).)

*Or types of magic users. (Alchemy/chemistry for making explosives/potions that explode might fit better depending on the time period, and absorb/constitute the people interested in making things explode.)
