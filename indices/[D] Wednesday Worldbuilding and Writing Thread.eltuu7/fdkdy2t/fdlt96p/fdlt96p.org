I'm making a roleplaying game where the entire society is composed of dumb trolls that can regenerate any damage that isn't caused by burns. They regenerate from the largest remaining body part.

They live within a closed society managed by an unfeeling overseer AI, that mandates jobs and provides food and tech in return (forced work included). The AI has plenty of flaws, but the trolls don't have enough mental capacity for one single person to take advantage of it. The AI runs medical experiments, but is pretty good at hiding it.

Parts of the place are protected by the AI (no drawing blood, no taking stuff) and other parts are gang war zones that the AI doesn't manage (often doesn't even see).

The trolls have sci fi tech implants (created by the AI), but they think of them as fantasy magic items.

The trolls can learn skills quickly, but they have a limit on how many things they can remember. In learning something new, they flush previous knowledge. In game terms, they have a certain amount of memory, in categories: skills, relationships, blackmail, language, deductions about the AI, tech interfacing, etc.

I've come up with a few scholarly groups within this society, but I have to cover my bases because players together will be more creative than me on my own. What scholarly group would you found in this society?
