I feel like there'd totally be an order of monks that dedicate themselves to learning the bare minimum requirements to abuse parts of the AI's code. As in; they know that a certain set of actions is needed, and literally no other knowledge. They are essentially organic RAM sticks; each one carrying a specific command, and the knowledge of where and how to use it, but not /why/.

Over the many, many years, they have established an order where the youngest hold the commands, but have no ability to know if they should be using them, and the elder monks act as directors. They give commands to the minimum-trained-acolytes, using precise orders to get them to the place they need to be to do...what it is they do.
