Since the AI is producing all of the electronics, I will assume that none of the electronics can be trusted if we're making plans to subvert the AI. However, I assume the trolls are literate (or reasonably capable of learning a phonetic alphabet) and have plentiful access to paper, or possibly trollskin parchment since they could regenerate an infinite supply of that (possibly sourcing it from troll criminals)? Further, I assume they have plentiful access to ink of some sort, perhaps something like lampblack derived from troll fat (again sourced from criminals)? As long as these are true, they can essentially bypass their individual and even collective memory limits without resorting to tech provided by the AI. Using this approach may be challenging, but feasible.

Basically, treat each troll like a CPU, and treat a group of trolls in a small office like multi-core CPU. A troll's short term memory might hold the current and next task, plus 2-3 items of information. That's your L1 cache. It will have a short list on its desk which provides instructions for a basic operation loop, that's your L2 cache. Next to that, it has a tabbed folder with any frequently-referenced information or instruction sheets. That's your L3 cache. It will also have a few filing cabinets with less-frequently used information or instructions kept in numerous tabbed folders for easy access, that's your RAM. Finally, for each small office, there's a central archive room with shelves full of infrequently-used data and instruction sheets, that's your hard drive.

With this setup, you could take a difficult problem and basically use something akin to an object-oriented or functional programming approach to decompose the problem into successively smaller and easier chunks until you're left with pieces that can be easily managed by the trolls.

Due to the nature of their memory, the trolls will obviously benefit from intense specialization, so an organization like this would do best to grow rapidly. As it does so, it would be best to begin setting up large-scale centralized specialty archives, e.g. a personnel archive, a tech interfacing archive, an AI deductions archive, etc. These will make it easier to organize the data and begin processing it into actionable exploits and strategies.

This kind of setup will probably require the trolls to arrange some kind of campus to keep all of these offices and archives together within a secured area in the gang war zone that the AI doesn't see. As long as this group is larger than most other gangs in the area, decently equipped, and has a well-fortified perimeter, they should be able to work relatively easily.

One of the priorities for this group might be starting to analyze the AI's tech to see how it works, how to use it, and try to interface with it, modify it, repair it, scrap it for parts, or reverse-engineer it. They'd probably start off by sending out groups of investigators to ask other trolls what they know about the devices, including any trolls who might be involved in the production process, and essentially compile the current state of knowledge regarding the devices. To go further, they would need to get or make tools to take the devices apart, and get some of the devices to work with, possibly by working for the AI, or possibly by collecting broken devices. They would then need to take meticulous notes during disassembly to allow them to rebuild or modify the things that they take apart. They would gradually end up accumulating large piles of carefully inventoried scrap parts and materials that they could potentially reconfigure for novel purposes, and potentially use their custom devices to interface with the AI and subvert it.
