Back in 2013 I started writing a fantasy novel, and I've recently dusted it off. The central magic system is very simple, with the magically gifted saying specific spells which cause static effects. There's no element of creativity in being a spellcaster except how you use those effects, very little interaction between spells, etc. Most of being a caster is memorizing the hundred-some known spells and figuring out which ones you're going to use at any given moment, sharpening your diction and response times, and employing various tricks that specifically counter other spells or aid your spells.

In some sense, each of these spells is its own magic system unto itself, with some of the overarching structure being dictated by the rules of the large system (e.g. spells must be spoken without interruption between syllables, above a certain decibel level, etc.).

I recently went through what's been written so far, about 60K words, and a plucked out all of the references to spells, adding them to a spreadsheet to ensure that there aren't any gaping holes where spell X should have been used in situation Y. This is all well and good so far, but there are remarked to be 163 known spells, and my spreadsheet only has 50 of them. A complete list of all known spells and their effects isn't necessary, I know ... but I still want to do it.

So, anyone got any spells that aren't likely to break an existing plot, especially one that includes some small amount of military action? Currently the bounds are:

- Creates food and water (~4 variants)
- Changes form to be an animal (~6 variants)
- Creates materials (rope and chairs)
- Creates temporary shields of a few varieties
- Energy-related attacks
- Projects force for attacks, motive power, or labor
- Speeds up natural healing by a factor of 3
- Makes a flashlight
- Lights a fire

So anything else will need to be within those bounds, as exceeding any of them would likely require a new spell to be included in the actual text itself.

(I lost a lot of enthusiasm for the project when /Unsong/ came out, as it had a bit of the same ideas, but when I read back when I'd written six or seven years ago I though it was pretty good, or could become so with editing and alteration.)
