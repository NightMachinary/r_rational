  spells must be spoken without interruption between syllables,

Is it possible to work spells into non-spell phrases? For example, if a spell's verbal component is 'tisrea', then it is possible to cast the spell sneakily be saying "Tha*t is rea*lly..."?

Similarly, is it possible to produce a spell effect unintentionally, by stumbling across a certain phrasing (and how likely is this to be dangerous to the caster?)

#+begin_quote
  above a certain decibel level
#+end_quote

Is this level the same for all spells? Are there spells that produce a bubble of silence around you (but not including you, so you can still cast sneakily inside the bubble at the cost of being deaf to anything outside the bubble) or that make your voice appear to be coming from elsewhere?

[[https://phoible.org/][Phoible]] claims to describe over three thousand phonemes, out of which the English language uses [[https://phoible.org/languages/stan1293][between 39 and 45]] (depending, as far as I can tell, on dialect). This leaves a few thousand phonemes not represented at all in English. If we assume that spells are language-independent, then does this imply that speakers of other languages will have a different list of known spells? Would speakers in more phoneme-rich languages have a greater known spell list?
