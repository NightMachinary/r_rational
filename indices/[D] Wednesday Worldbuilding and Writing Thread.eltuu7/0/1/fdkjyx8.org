I can't guarantee that my spells won't break your plot since I don't know what it is. I could offer a bunch of spells that are almost useless as a way to ensure that they won't impact your plot, but that sounds boring. It also seems pointless if you don't intend to ever include any of these spells in your plot, so I'm going to suggest things that might be useful and seem likely to exist in a setting with magic. For energy-related attacks, there's the obvious ones to consider:

- Fireball: A pea-sized ember of glowing orange light bolts from your hands and slowly arcs through the air before exploding upon contact with the first thing it touches, scattering shrapnel and setting objects on fire with a boom. Range is limited by the arc, and it obviously can't be used in close-quarters combat.

- Lightning bolt: What appears to be an otherwise mundane lightning bolt shoots out of your hands and travels in a remarkably straight line until it hits the first object in its path, potentially setting it on fire. The light of the bolt can be almost blinding at night, and the thunder clap can easily cause ringing in the ears which persists for a few minutes. A powerful attack, but often not the first choice due to the light and noise that it creates.

- Gust of wind: Immediately after what seems like a flash of faint blue light, an enormous blast of air erupts in a cone in front of you. Small projectiles in the air (e.g. arrows and bolts) will be knocked away if they are within about 60 ft, including the one emitted by fireball. People within 10-15 ft. may be thrown backward by the blast. In dusty or sandy environments, a cloud may be kicked up by the spell, providing temporary concealment. (Note that if using this to deflect a fireball, the blue light will give your position away and make you an easy target for a lightning bolt.)

- Freezing jet: A continuous blast of extremely cold air shoots from your hands in a 20 ft. long jet of gas turned opaque and white by condensed water. People in the jet may quickly become frostbitten and their eyes might ice over causing temporary blindness if they don't look away. The jet can be used to embrittle metal doors or fences, to extinguish fires, and to make ice for refrigerating food or staying cool in summer.

Am I on the right track?
