This is really cool! Yes, languages come easily to trolls.

It reminds me of an episode of Community where the group has to beat a video game. The nerd character realizes that the system of telling your children what to do is turing-complete, and constructs a megazord out of children.

The trolls could do most of this within an area the AI watches, it wouldn't really take notice. It's not proactive in preventing crime, only reactive.

I'm curious of how they would come up with a system like that, if they don't trust tech enough to even write stuff down digitally.

They don't have to produce everything themselves, though. They have books and paper, and most other basics of productivity, provided by the AI.
