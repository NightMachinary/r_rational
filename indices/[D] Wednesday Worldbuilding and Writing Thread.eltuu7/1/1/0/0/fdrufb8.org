  I'm curious of how they would come up with a system like that, if they don't trust tech enough to even write stuff down digitally.

The system itself is actually pretty straightforward and has been widely used, historically. The use of offices which make written records and carry out administrative work by partitioning and delegating large projects into manageable individual portions has existed for well over 2,000 years. I don't expect that they'd think of things in terms of L1 cache, L2 cache, RAM, etc. That's an easy analogy for educated modern humans, but for the trolls, it's simply a practical matter of making well-organized written records of things to be able to archive and share useful information.

The only thing really unusual here is that these guys are basically shunning the AI's technology in favor of trusty old pen 'n' paper. This could stem from a variety of motivations, but the most likely motivation would be concern that the AI's tech implants might harm them somehow, either physically or spiritually, making them more machine than troll. Troll Luddites, perhaps.

Any examples of implants gone bad would easily fuel this sentiment. An impression of AI-induced harm might then lead to generalized wariness about the AI, and a sense that its 'gifts' cannot be trusted. This would spur on their antiquated approach to studying the AI's technologies and seeking a deeper understanding of them with the aim of being able to subvert the technology and ultimately the AI itself.
