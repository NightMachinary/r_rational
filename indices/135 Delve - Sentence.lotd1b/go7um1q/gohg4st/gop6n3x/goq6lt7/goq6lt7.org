Mostly "nerd" references.

1. Lots of Tolkien references. Lord of the Rings, the Hobbit, that sort of thing.
2. Marvel/DC comic references. You know, super hero stuff
3. Star Trek references. Maybe Star Wars too, I can't remember.
4. Lots of general America pop culture references. I'm not sure how specific they are since they're so common place. Music.
5. Meme "culture" in general. Slang or phrases that get repeated a lot by young people. Although the slang he uses is kind of outdated. Young people nowadays use a completely different set of slang. I haven't seen or heard anyone use "owned" in over a decade.

Personally, I think #5 is especially egregious. Keep in mind that Rain is speaking a different language entirely. It's utterly bizarre Rain would force idioms and slang from one language into another. Yes, in my experience with other languages, sometimes it works perfectly and feels great when it does. Most of the time, it doesn't make any sense whatsoever and is obnoxious to force it. If anything, Rain should be using the local idioms/slang more. Too his credit, he does use some, but only to a very limited degree so far. Hopefully, his merchant friend can get him more books so he can blend in better. The children's story book seemed especially helpful.
