I really wouldn't call it an act, Rain genuinely does care for others.

That being said, it's clear that power is exponential in this universe, so it makes sense to fewer people have higher levels then multiple people with lower levels.

Not that Rain shouldn't help others, but I do agree that it's long overdue for Rain to get some upgrades.
