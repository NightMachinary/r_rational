Tolkien has a certain meandering style, but Hobbit or no, translating things is difficult because languages approach things in wildly different ways. There's endless nuance to the different word choices, so the process of translation requires a huge amount of creative effort because you essentially have to rewrite the entire text without actually rewriting it.

Like, take the word "meander" there. Even though it's my native language, I have no idea what Finnish word I'd use for that. "Kuljeskella" is more like... moseying around with lazy connotations. "Vaellella" is closer, but that's a more weighty and introspective sort of "journeying." "Haahuilla" has similar vibes of aimless wandering, but it's more clueless than aimless. And so on.
