I suppose it makes sense. The languages I know all have germanic/latin roots, so there's usually a similar-rooted word at hand- wandern in German has similar connotations (and sounds like it has the same origin) as meander.

(I just looked it up, meander comes from French. Oh well, wandern still gets the point across).

I get what you mean, though. The words of a language form a basis for describing/partitioning reality, and when the bases of two different languages don't commute, your only choice to be accurate might be to use 10 words where the original language used 1- which you can't really do, so you have to trade off verbosity and elegance versus accuracy. Interesting problem!
