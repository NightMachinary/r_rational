  In-universe it makes sense since it's Rain's way of dealing with homesickness, but... Yeah, it's grating.

I can buy some of them, like in some recent chapter he made a "special eyes" reference. It seems plausible to me because someone else brought it up so he'd probably laugh at the unknowing reference.

As it is currently though, Rain just feels like one of those military LARPers who nonstop uses military acronyms in their daily life despite knowing full well that no one they're speaking to understands them. Knock it off, you're just intentionally being an asshole.
