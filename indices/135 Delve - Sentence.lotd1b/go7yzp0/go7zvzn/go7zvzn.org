Hasn't happened as of the latest chapter. They're in the depths, though, so it seems obvious that this arc will conclude with him killing a blue.

On a different note, the latest (patreon) chapter had way too many annoying references. They've always been there, but there were maybe 5 in one chapter alone... and then there's a bit where Rain asks Ameliah if they're that annoying, and she says no to protect his feelings. Writer, it's obvious you know what people think of the memes. Why are you still cramming them in? Do you hate money?

I really want to make an editor's cut of this story that goes through and eradicates 90% of the cringe and bloat. It'd probably cut the runtime in half.
