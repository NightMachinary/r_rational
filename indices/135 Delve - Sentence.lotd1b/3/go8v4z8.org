I'm very surprised with Rain's decision, even though I know he's grieving right now. Amelia is the one who started the fight! It seems wrong to me for them to start the fight, see that they have all those accolades, and then condemn the mage to death for it.

That being said...given all the evidence, it seems pretty likely that the mage was in fact a mass murderer. Still, his personality from the previous chapters makes me feel like he wouldn't be that kind of man.

I think that Rain made the right decision, but I very much feel uncomfortable about it. He really should have waited until he was in a better state of mind.

All of that being said, I happy that Rain has finally grown up a little. This chapter, to me, signals that the author has taken the criticism to heart and will try to pivot the story in a better direction.
