Well, I guess this'll make the haters happy, but now I'm getting worried. I liked optimistic, idealistic Rain. I thought he was on to something with power through community and party synergy and whatnot. I don't want him to go all murderhobo dictator.

Sure, he can go raise his cap, but I don't want him to give up on Ascension and democracy and his ideals. Hopefully when Ameliah and Dozer get better he'll calm back down.
