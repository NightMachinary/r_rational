If Brovose drops a respec (or Anton and Hegar did and Tallheart stonewalled Mariah) and he hogs it, I'd be really annoyed, though. Who knows what Mariahs level cap is? Possibly higher than his own.

But yeah, exponential growth makes for some odd min-maxing that might conflict theoretically conflict with the ideals of the Rain-King. But not as much as Tallheart thinks. And completely hogging them, keeping what's available a secret? Would mean the end of Ascension. And this world is heavily underestimating synergy. Accolades can be freely dropped and exchanged. I think Rain should hold most of them and force Ascension members to push themselves harder. Tarny was straight up planning to replicate his build! Could easily make Tarny let him pick the same metamagic, but picking his auras, so that they have full coverage together. Val is probably as tryhard as it gets. But he too must overcome a weakness of character. He must be forced to learn calculus and think mathematically! Otherwise he's not worthy of the accolades and will never be ready to face his daddy issues. Get gud, Val!

So I don't quite see that there's a resource conflict, after all? Except you can't easily hogtie a higher level blue, to maximize level yield. Too dangerous.
