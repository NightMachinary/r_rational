Did not see that coming. Was a very surprised, only Anton seemed psychopathic enough.

I would have expected Brovose to claim that they once killed a team of plate hunters. Given that that would be an alternate plausible explanation, he really missed a beat there. So definitely the right move to kill him.

Rain was really lucky that he made the choice so easy.

Mechanics-wise, can you prove that you dropped all your accolades? Brovose could not have simply dropped a couple and said that those were all he owned?
