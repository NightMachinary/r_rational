You guys got me all hyped up but much of the conflict in the first few episodes is driven by everyone lying to each other for no gain. Elf chick lies about her actions to spare herself a minor punishment leading to almost getting all her people killed. King lies to princes to keep them from getting scared causing them to almost get themselves killed. Prince lies about nonsense for no reason. Advisor lies about major serious stuff which is the entire reason that this conflict is happening in the first place when it all could have been avoided.

I really dislike pointless plots founded on stupid useless lies.

Also it irked me when knight dude didn't believe in magic for some reason despite seeing magic all around him all the time and therefore lets the elves escape.
