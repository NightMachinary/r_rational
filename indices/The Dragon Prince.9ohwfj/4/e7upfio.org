For my part, while i did enjoy it, I definitely did not think it was better than atla. I would put it on par with Naruto - fun to watch on a lazy Sunday, but a little over simplistic in its message.

I would come back to and re-watch atla, very rare for me me. But idk if I would re-watch this. (so far. It does have potential)
