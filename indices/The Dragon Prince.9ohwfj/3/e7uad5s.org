I've watched it all. It's good.

Frame rate can get /very/ low at times, which is a bit of a drawback, but still not a deal breaker when the writing and voice acting is this good. Also, they know how to use the budget they've been given because those times when the frame rates dip are /never/ during a fight scene.

One other drawback is a single character we meet near the end of the first season. Without spoiling, this character is supposed to be a young child, despite the fact that she isn't written as one. You'll know it when you see it. For a show that otherwise writes it's young characters very well, this felt a bit jarring.

But anyway, those are minor gripes. The show is good. Go watch it.
