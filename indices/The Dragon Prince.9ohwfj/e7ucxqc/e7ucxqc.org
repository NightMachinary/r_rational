I love the show, though occasionally I feel like the tone jumps from wildly clever to almost ridiculously ... not.

Case in point, spoilers ahead:

The mage is talking to his daughter and says basically, if you knew what I was about to do, you'd try to stop me. To which her response is, knowing that, shouldn't I just do that anyway?

which is great. And unfortunately the dramatics of characters is almost never commented on in such a direct and logical way.

BUT...

The same character is talking with her brother in the season finale and basically asks, hey, did dad tell you anything weird? And he's like no, to which she ostentatiously exclaims, me neither. In the most obvious, I'm lying scene ever. And she's not called on it. It is almost like watching a d and d game where the rolls are wildly unlikely, in either direction.
