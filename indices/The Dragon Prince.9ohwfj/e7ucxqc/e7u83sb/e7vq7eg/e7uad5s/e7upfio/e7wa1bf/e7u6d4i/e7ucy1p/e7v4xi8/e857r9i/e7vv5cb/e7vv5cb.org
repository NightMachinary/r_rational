I watched the whole thing, but the frame rate issue really bothered me. On top of that, many dialogue scenes were a static image with only the speaking character's mouth moving. This may be the pattern in other media but I found it distracting here.

Since the plot is largely driven by the protagonists' refusal to tell the adults the details of the adventure, I'm not sure if this qualifies as Rational. On the other hand, I do like the setting a lot.

Avatar was better. But if you look just at the first ten episodes of both shows, the difference is less stark.
