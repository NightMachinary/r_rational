Copying my review from Spacebattles:

I've watched the whole season, and while the series has a lot of potential and I really want it to do great, what I've seen so far really doesn't inspire confidence; I'm 90% sure it's going to go the way of /The Legend of Korra/. On one side it's got great visuals (except for the framerate thing), great sound design and voice acting, and witty dialogues; on the other side, an incoherent, badly paced story.\\
The story has a lot of holes if you just take what it says at face value:

- Why do the special force commandos take an unbloodied rookie with them on a mission to avenge the Dragon King and Prince? You'd think they'd send her on a few lower-stakes missions first to make sure she's not going to panic in the first real fight she gets in.
- If it's safe to send the princes away on vacation (even though there's decent odds they'll be targets too), why doesn't the King go with them until the elves are captured? If nothing else, he's got a horse and the elves don't, he could just outrun them.
- Why does the captain of the royal guard, when given a magic item that can find the assassins after his king, abandon his mission at the first sign that the item doesn't work? He could have tried the moth again, searched the clearing for traces of a camp, or searched the surroundings. As it is, he doesn't look especially anxious that his critical mission failed and that he's going to have to fight full-power moonshadow elves that night.
- Why isn't Claudia stationed with her brother to defend the king? She even has magic that can outmatch the elves.
- Why do the Princes run away from the castle, and later from their aunt Amaya? Even if they want to give the egg back to the dragons, there's no reason for them to run away. Ezran is the heir, and could simply order the egg to be sent under escort, which would be faster (horses!) and safer (no "throwing the egg in frozen ice" shenanigans).
- What the hell is Viren's long-term plan? He knows that the Kingdom's institutions (symbolized by Amaya and the priest woman) are ready to throw him out at the first sign of treachery, and are already openly going against him. How the hell does he plan to stay in power once they learn he got the princes murdered? Assuming that his children actually execute his plan, which seems pretty unlikely? It's possible he's just deluded and ignoring how unstable his plans are, but that seems really unsatisfying.
- Who fed Elli's wolf while it was growing up? Did it hunt its own game, but still stay with Elli for some reason? How the hell did nobody notice it had a strong limp for all these years?

But honestly, you can ignore these questions or make up vaguely plausible answers for them. What makes this story extremely unsatisfying for me, and what I think is a major reason that people thought the season felt unfinished, is that the writers have no sense of importance and scale.

How big is Katolis? The website says it's "the largest human kingdom", which should make it at least as big as France, yet everyone is moving from one side to the other like they're /Game of Thrones/ pirate fleets. The winter lodge is apparently a morning's walk away from the royal castle, since they've reached it by the time Ezran gets thirsty. The exact distances they travel remain unclear, but there's nothing to give the sense that they're on an epic, urgent journey. They're content to sleep on the bare ground, and don't worry about finding tents and bedrolls before they die of exposure. They don't need to forage for food or go into villages, and their only supplies are a magic cubes and a bagful of stale bread. The gang, which includes a 10-yo child, gets through a mountain range (one high enough it's covered in ankle-deep snow) in an afternoon, on empty stomachs, while still in their summer clothes. When they do reach a village, nobody gets suspicious at the two kids wearing super-expensive clothes stained with dirt and grass.

The show is riddled with problems like that. Another big one, is the state of the war between the humans, and the elves and the dragons. I have a ton of questions there too:

- What are the events that led to the current conflict? The King mentions "wrongs on both sides", we know the elves mass-deported the humans 1000 years ago, we know the humans (probably) murdered the Dragon King and stole his egg a few years ago (a decade tops), and that's it. What happened in between? What made the King think that attacking the Dragon King was a good idea?
- Why do these two kingdoms hate each other so much if they're completely separated? It can't be just the mass-deportation, it happened 1000 years ago; it would like if the French were still mad at the English today for something that happened during the Hundred Years' War. As an aside, the story could have been a lot more visceral and interesting if it had taken place, say, 100 years after the deportation, while humans were still getting adjusted and there was a prevalent "let's get our lands back" sentiment.
- What's the balance of power between the human kingdoms and the magic kingdoms? Do elves bandits regularly perform raids across the border? Do humans? Did either kingdom try to invade the other at some point?
- For that matter, how do the humans defend the border again elf invasions? The elves have good enough special forces to kill the king in his seat of power, with advance warning, you'd think they'd make short work of any commander trying to defend the border; and that's without getting into the "fuck you, the ground is lava now" scale of fun the dragons bring to the table. Amaya acts like her being at the border is important because an attack could be imminent, but we've seen nothing to indicate that she could do anything to stop these kinds of threats.
- How close are the magic kingdoms to invading the human kingdoms? The characters tell us that bringing back the egg is essential to preventing/stopping the war, but until we see some hint of that war, their worries seem pretty abstract and far away. Are the elves gathering their armies? Or are they content to murder the king and call it even? Do they have enough forces to invade the human kingdoms? If so, do they intend occupy it, or genocide everyone, or what?

Not answering these questions means that the war with the elves, which should be the story's main drive, instead feel vague and unconcerning.

I don't think the story should have an entire chapter discussing the logistics and political structure of the Dragon Kingdom in the first season, mind you. But it would be nice if every so often, the show dropped some worldbuilding that's not "humans are racist" every so often. Something like "Elf raids along the border have been increasing lately. The people are asking us to send more troops there to defend them." or "Our spies are picking up more thousands more elves every week. There's no doubt anymore: they're preparing an invasion. We're going to need to start conscripting people if we want to stand a chance".

Anyway, that's my take on /The Dragon Prince/. A lot of potential, seriously botched execution.
