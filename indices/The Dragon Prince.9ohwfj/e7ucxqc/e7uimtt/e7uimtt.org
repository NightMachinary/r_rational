  BUT...

  The same character is talking with her brother in the season finale and basically asks, hey, did dad tell you anything weird? And he's like no, to which she ostentatiously exclaims, me neither. In the most obvious, I'm lying scene ever. And she's not called on it. It is almost like watching a d and d game where the rolls are wildly unlikely, in either direction.

To be fair, the brother isn't presented as an intellectual giant, the sister is presented as socially awkward, and the brother has motivation to not talk about the subject. I can easily imagine that the brother is avoiding dwelling on the morality of their dad's request to such an extent that he ignores or doesn't notice his sister's obvious lie. It probably could have been handled better though.
