I enjoyed the series - binged it a few weekends ago, but it did have a few issues in my opinion. The animation was by far the most jarring point; individual shots look AMAZING, but the janky animation style was something that I never grew accustomed to even by the end of the series. The fighting scenes in general were really well-done, but outside of those the animation flow could take a sharp nosedive at times.

Then some of the narrative slacks off a bit, or seemed trimmed for time. Despite the Moonshadow assassins being hyped as unbeatable during a full moon, all of them were killed (except Runaan, at least at first). That lends the impression that they actually are able to be beaten, which means not hiding or protecting the king better was a pisspoor risk. Heck, they knew the assassins were coming... why not hurry away before the moon came up? Evade them for a day or two and their power fades, no? And clearly they aren't supernaturally good trackers, because all five commit to attacking the king in the castle... but Ezran was also a target (a mandatory target, at that!), and was able to get away unnoticed. Besides that, Lujanne does her Gandalf impersonation in the final moments of the show, which seems like a poorly explained deus ex machina. If her giant bird isn't used to help the kids, I'm calling BS. And we better get an explanation for why an elf has been living in human lands; saying "she's close to the moon" doesn't explain anything! On that note, Illusion magic makes NO sense, and makes Ellis's backstory utterly ridiculous. If you'll recall, Ellis rescued her wolf and brought him home, but he lost a leg from a trap. Ellis's parents tell her that they can't afford another mouth to feed, and her response is to run away with her pup. She gets to the top of the mountain, meets Lujanne, and the wolf seems to regrow its leg, after which she returns home and lives happily. But... the problem wasn't that the wolf was crippled. It was that there wasn't enough food to go around. Regrowing a leg literally does nothing to help that situation! And lest we argue that now the wolf can hunt for itself... no, it can't, because it doesn't actually have its leg back, it just thinks it does (and so does everyone else). But all the tricks and agility it displays makes it seem like the leg really IS back... in which case, it isn't an illusion! Argh, that was such a poorly explained or planned plotline!

There are multiple characters who are introduced and seem like they might be important, but then aren't followed up on. Corvus would be the most obvious one. The guy is the best tracker Amaya has at her disposal, capable of even tracking down the legendary Moonshadow Elves, but one tumble down a hill and he never shows up again? Short of breaking something, that should have been only a 10 minute delay at most. Then the guy with the sunforged dagger seems like he would be around a bit, but he's used as only a plot device to discuss how Rayla's armband is uncuttable. I know ATLA used a lot of throwaway characters too, but here it felt like they could have had a bigger part, but budget ran low and they were cut.

Complaints aside, I did actually really enjoy the series and will definitely watch the next season when it's out. The character interactions and humor are really well done, and there are plenty of hooks to keep viewers speculating about what's happening and going to happen. But I sure hope they smooth out the animation and tighten up the plot decisions!
