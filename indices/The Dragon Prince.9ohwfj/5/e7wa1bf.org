I thought the show was intensely...Okay. I don't think it was doing anything especially innovative. Noble king, evil wizard advisor, magical elves, etc. Like, whatever. I can see the show getting better in the future, but so far it seems very basic. I was pretty disappointed that they went the basic ass route with the evil wizard advisor I liked Amaya and the wizard's two kids tho
