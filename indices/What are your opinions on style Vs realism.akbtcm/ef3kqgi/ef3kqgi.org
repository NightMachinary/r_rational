I'm a fan of realism. For a simple example, consider the semi-autobiographical Grave of the Fireflies. The problems encountered in the movie/story (depending on which you have seen) are portrayed realistically, and you can learn about how to anticipate, recognize and manage real-life problems based on the story. It's a tragedy, but it's still grounded in enough realism to help provide a better understanding of the world.
