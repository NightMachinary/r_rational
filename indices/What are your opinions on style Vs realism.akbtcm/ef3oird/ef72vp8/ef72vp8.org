The problem with Temeraire is that the world /immediately/ begins to diverge, from the second the story starts. As inevitably it would have to, because you have frigate-sized monsters with their own culture and intelligence suddenly asking "Wait why am I fighting for this empire that treats me like a literal animal?" Given that dragons have been around forever in this world, it makes zero sense that their world would have developed exactly like ours. It was pretty clear she came up with "Dragons and Napoleonic wars" and then worked forward from there without ever considering the circumstances that set it up.

Which is of course your point- grant the author that (gigantic) conceit, and everything develops logically. But that grant was so mind-bogglingly huge that it completely undermined the story for me. There can't be any verisimilitude if the world clearly could not have operated on the principals that guide the story!
