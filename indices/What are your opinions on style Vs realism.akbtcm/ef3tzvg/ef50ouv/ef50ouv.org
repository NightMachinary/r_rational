Dammit it's not letting me hide the spoiler. I forget how to do that and it's not letting me see it in the sidebar. Maybe if i try a different browser than firefox?

UNSONG technically is consistent with its premises, even though it's not realistic. Basically the premise of the story is "What if hebrew scripture had been correct? What would that mean? What evidence would have been needed to demonstrate this? What would the world have looked like if judeochristian dogma was true?" UNSONG is Scott's answer to that question. It takes place in a world that runs on narrative, aka "placebomancy", sort of like in PGTE. Except that in UNSONG everything is made of narrative parts all the way down, to the point where everything obeys nominative determinism even if it's not always clear how right away. instead of a few individuals having NAMES which mean something about their roles, EVERYONE and EVERYTHING in the world has names which mean something about them and this is not a coincidence because nothing is ever a coincidence. and the archangel Uriel casts a spell that temporarily exchanges everything in the world for their tegmark mathematical construct equivalents over the course of thousands of years, until someone tries to send a rocket into space and they hit a crystal sphere/wall around the earth and find out that outer space doesn't exist and that was just projected by Uriel's spell, and uriel's spell breaks, causing everyone to return back to the real narrative version of the world.
