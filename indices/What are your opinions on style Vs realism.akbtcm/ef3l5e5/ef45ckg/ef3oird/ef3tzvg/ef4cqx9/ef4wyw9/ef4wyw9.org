Style will always win out. However, the challenge is how much realism an author can fit in before it starts running up against the limitations of the medium, or before adding more realism severely diminishes the enjoyability of reading the story.

(Of course, a good author, with a strong grasp of the medium and its limitations, will often be able to fit in more of both than a more comparatively unskilled author. Hopefully, though, with time and experience, the latter may eventually become the former.)
