Can you expand on what you mean by style and realism?

I think that style triumphs all if you're using it the way I mean. If the style of your story is an exploratory piece of incoherent descriptions or something then of course having a random but realistic car crash seems worthless.

Surely realism is a style too after all? Unless you're simulating your world and even then it's your choice to write it as simulated.

The rational community likes UNSONG a lot which isn't very realistic but is very stylisticly consistent.

I think it's important to be consistent in style, unless you're making a metacommentary about style then your metastyle should be consistent at least.
