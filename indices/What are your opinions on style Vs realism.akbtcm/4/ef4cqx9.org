Now that I think about it, I'm really not sure which I prefer. I enjoy works with thorough and internally consistent worldbuilding, like Unsounded. On the other hand, there are totally bizarre works like Swiss Army Man and IT HURTS that also resonate with me. I guess the key factor for me is emotional resonance, and as long as that's there I just shift gears into "appreciating the realism" or "appreciating the style" depending on what I'm reading/watching.
