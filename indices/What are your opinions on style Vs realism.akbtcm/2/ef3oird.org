I care a great deal about verisimilitude more than realism per se. An example of stylized worldbuilding that nonetheless is verisimilitudinous is Naomi Novik's Temeraire series: the facts that dragons have mystical powers; that they evolved sapience in parallel with humans; that the political landscape of the world at the start of the series is exactly the Napoleonic Wars despite the ancient point of divergence being sufficient to play complete havoc with history... none of these are explained. But when you grant the author this conceit and allow her to tell her unrealistic story, the Temeraire series handles social, political, military, and economic issues with an admirable eye for the believable and consistent: verisimilitude over realism.
