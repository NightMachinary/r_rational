Sure; different people will have different tolerances for granting the author their conceit. In general I am willing to allow almost any premise, no matter how nonsensical, as long as things then /unfold/ in ways that don't strain my suspension of disbelief.

Put another way: I have no problem with Star Wars being a scifi universe with FTL so advanced that crossing the galaxy is the work of, like, a week tops, but all their attempts at AI have guttered out at "person-level," all their aliens being essentially human in psychology, psychic powers, etc. All of that is part of the premise, and I'm willing to let them have the premise they like to tell the story. What I /do/ have a problem with is the scene in The Last Jedi where jumping to hyperspace was an astonishingly-effective kamikaze anti-capital-ship tactic, because it was a sudden introduction of a new element that /did not fit/ with what came before. Is it /more/ ridiculous than any of the other things I mentioned? Not at all, not in a vacuum. But it broke verisimilitude: the world of Star Wars does not look like how a world where hyperdrive allows for ludicrously powerful kinetic strikes should look. Mid-story developments get held to a higher standard in my book.
