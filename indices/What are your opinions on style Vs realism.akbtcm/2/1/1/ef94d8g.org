To me it felt a lot like some BROB decided to drop dragons into the world, then smooth over any evidence and memories that made them not seem like they've always been around.

Personally, the series could have been far better if it had displaced a dragon island or nine to earth. It would have made the whole conceit make a lot more sense, rather than making it feel like they had been ignored by human civilization up to that point.
