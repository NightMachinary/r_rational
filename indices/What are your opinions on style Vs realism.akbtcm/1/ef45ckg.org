Realism is a complicated concept, and its arguably only tangential to what [[/r/rational]] readers care about. Often, we care more about /consistency/ - the property of a work that takes its premise seriously and follows it to a logical conclusion - and if /every/ logical conclusion is narratively or stylistically unsatisfying, goes back and works with a slightly different premise.

Personally, I greatly enjoy stylized works, but I do prefer it if they put in the effort to make that style a reasonable expression of the story, not something that forces the story where it wouldn't otherwise have gone.
