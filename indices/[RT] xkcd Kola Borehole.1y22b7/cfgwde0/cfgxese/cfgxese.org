The [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSalvationWar?from=Main.TheSalvationWar][Salvation War]] series comes to mind. I don't know that I would call it 'rational fiction', per se, but it featured a refreshingly pragmatic human response to an 'end times' scenario (including [[#s][]]), written by a military analyst to boot.
