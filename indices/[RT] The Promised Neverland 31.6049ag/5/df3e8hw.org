So that's mama's plan , making them give up. It makes sense ,by killing Norman first she ensures Ray will stop trying since he wanted to escape whith both Norman and Emma and now he will be depressed.Now Emma is the biggest threat so she broke her leg to ensure she isn't a problem , and will try to recruit her as mama .
