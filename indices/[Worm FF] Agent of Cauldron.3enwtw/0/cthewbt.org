This is really excellently written.

The protagonist's sheer level of incompetence at using her power is physically painful while reading, though. Her segments are like reading Worm with Panacea as the protagonist. This is clearly /deliberate/, given the heavy use of other perspectives and the fact that the other characters mention it; but it is very annoying.

It's interesting; this is clearly /rational/ fiction, but it's /almost/ rational/ist/ fiction, as well (going by the sidebar definitions.) The only difference is that the *main character* isn't the rationalist, the - Antagonist? Mentor character? - is.

It's kind of reminiscent of HPMOR!Quirrel, really, but without that sense of commanderie with the rationalist hero.
