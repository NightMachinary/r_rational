It's understandable that it is. Interludes aside, it's a Taylor-centric story through and through. And when people write fanfiction, they tend to what's simplest. Replicating the parent style. It's easier to utilize a fully fleshed out character, than to try and flesh out your own. Worm is huge and rich with other, deep characters, but no one gets the focus that Taylor does, meaning it's easiest to just use her.

Plus, everybody loves Taylor. She's the perfect protagonist. Not because she's the strongest or the smartest or the most heroic. But because you kinda have to bond with her when you watch her life story play out before you for over a million words. She's the ultimate success story. Misfit, nerdy, plain but not ugly girl who's relentlessly bullied. Her self esteem's shot as a result. She gets bug powers which, on the surface, are fairly lame when you have people throwing buildings and seeing the future, but she uses her wits and grit to optimize them as best she can. She does what she has to and never feels good about it. But doesn't let that stop her from doing what she thinks is right. All while facing more and more impossible situations. (Really, with the way Wildbow had things going, it's a miracle her dad didn't die along the way. I know more than a few of us were expecting that age old trope to rear its ugly head) [[#s][]] Taylor was never perfect. She had her flaws. But they were all delivered in ways that made us say "Wow, I get where this is coming from." She wasn't always right, wasn't always successful, but she made it work. And, what I found most impressive about what Wildbow did with Taylor was that her success was owed to her human side more than her powers. Yes, her powers were there, but they weren't the focus. Her ingenuity, creativity, ability to plan and be pragmatic. These were what saved her. Her power wasn't the driving force behind her success. It was just a tool, same as a knife, a gun or a piece of rope. And that's part of what made Worm so unique.

TL;DR: Mimicking the parent style is pretty common, and Worm is primarily Taylor POV. So it's the easiest way to write it. Also we love Taylor because she's awesome in a human way.
