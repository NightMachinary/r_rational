The difference between the two actions is who it is supposed to shame. Both are intentional wastes of water, but with different intents. The removal of the water towel custom was not because it was being wasteful of water, but because it was designed to be disrespectful of beggars. Note that the custom wasn't just removed, but was replaced. The replacement custom was to give water freely to the beggars, rather than giving them the discarded hand-washing water.

The Duke's toast, on the other hand, has a different meaning. Here the Duke is surrounded by potential enemies. Every one of them had previously worked for the Harkonnens, and could be a spy for them. On Arrakis, where water is life, the Duke is making a statement about the strength of his position. By pouring water out onto the floor, the Duke is stating that he has strength to spare. [[#s][By forcing everybody else to pour out water as well,]]

This is the key difference being made between the Atreides and the Harkonnens. Both are aristocrats, and both have the obedience of the common people. However, the Harkonnens do so by befriending the powerful and demeaning the common people, but the Atreides do so by respecting the common people even if it isolates them from the powerful.
