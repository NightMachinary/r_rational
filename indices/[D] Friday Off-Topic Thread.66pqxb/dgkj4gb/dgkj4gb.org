I've been reading Dune by Frank Herbert. I've finished Book One so far. I'm confused about this one thing: (The book is 50 years old but I'm spoilering just in case)

[[#s][The dinner with guests in the new Atreides mansion]]

Also Harkonnen looks so much like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korhonen][Korhonen]], a Finnish surname, and I can't stop thinking that the Harkonnens are Finnish.
