  I liked everything about this film, except for the core of the emotional investment that everything is built around and I don't know why. For some reason, I just didn't like the romance.

I mean, that's a pretty good reason to find it frustrating rather than fulfilling, to me.

I just watched it today (your comment was the motivation to finally stop putting it off) and I agree that it's a very solid movie, but it's not quite all it's hyped up to be, and the romance is the major reason.

I liked the protagonists, but I didn't feel their relationship the way I do in many other romances, because so little of their relationship is actually shown on screen. It wasn't quite hollow, but it was... "distant."

Which is still better than most similar situations. There are tons of movies where the male and female protagonist end up in love and I'm just left thinking "...Why? You've known them for like, 3 hours, and sure, you went through some scary situations together, but you had maybe one conversation in total and demonstrated 0 romantic affinity or chemistry."

That's not quite the case here, but it's still in the same realm of criticism. They interacted a lot, but it was off-screen and through notes and each other's lives, which meant that while intellectually I could grasp what the relationship meant to them, emotionally it wasn't as fulfilling as it was supposed to be. I loved the scene where they get to finally meet, and a few more like it would probably have sold me on theirs being a star-crossed love.

I just checked the run time and was surprised to see it was 2 hours. It felt shorter, and I think another 30-45 minutes of focus on developing their relationship would have moved the movie from a solid B to an A for me, and justify the immense praise it's gotten.

I'm still glad I watched it though, and agree that it was a very refreshing twist on the Body Swap story. Maybe I'll check out the novel some day and see if I enjoy it more.
