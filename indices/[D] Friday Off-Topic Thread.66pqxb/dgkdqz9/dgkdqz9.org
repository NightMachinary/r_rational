Weekly update on the [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/11QAh61C8gsL-5KbdIy5zx3IN6bv_E9UkHjwMLVQ7LHg/edit?usp=sharing][hopefully rational]] roguelike [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbyTOAlhRHk][immersive sim]] Pokemon Renegade, as well as the associated engine and tools.

--------------

Not a whole lot to report on this week.  I've actually been reading a book called [[https://www.manning.com/books/bdd-in-action][BDD in Action]] which I think will be helpful not only for this project, but for what I do at work, so this has sort of taken over my coding time until I digest it.

--------------

I found an [[http://imgur.com/a/omrvd][album of in-between pokemon evolutions]], which ultimately came from [[http://inprogresspokemon.tumblr.com/][this tumblr]].  This concept is something that the project will utilize, so it was quite nice to see so many transitions actually work visually.  

--------------

Oh, and I also came across [[http://pikafan2000.deviantart.com/art/National-Pokedex-Version-Delta-391835188][this DeviantArt post]] which is a project to come up with 32x32 and 96x96 pixel art versions of all existing pokemon.  The 32x32 set is very much the sort of thing I'm looking to use in-game, so I think I'll reach out to them when the time is right and see if they'd be okay with me using their assets.
