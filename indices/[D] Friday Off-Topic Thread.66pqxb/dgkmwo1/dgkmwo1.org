I finally got around to seeing the English dub of [[https://myanimelist.net/anime/32281/Kimi_no_Na_wa][Your Name]] this week and I completely understand why this movie is the highest grossing anime film of all time and is currently the highest rated on MyAnimeList. From a technical perspective, the movie is basically flawless. The animation, acting, writing, direction, editing, cinematography, and the music are all fantastic. It's definitely not rational, there's a plot hole or two and the appeal lies in the emotional journey it takes you on, but that's fine.

The plot is just the right balance of familiar and unique to garner mass appeal without feeling dumbed down, the characters are simple but easy to relate to and care about, and the comedy is surprisingly funny. The third act goes on a bit too long and the stakes of the climax aren't directly related to the romance arc, which is the crux of the story, but even those feel like intentional choices rather than problems. It's not a particularly groundbreaking film and there were some scenes I thought could've been better, but it's a perfectly solid product that does exactly what it sets out to do and does it extremely well.

So I'm having a minor crisis over the fact that I don't like the story and can't explain why. It's an impeccably well-told story with the most interesting take I've ever seen on a [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakyFridayFlip][Freak Friday Flip]], a trope I normally find extremely boring and predictable, but for some reason I left the theater feeling hollow and unsatisfied. I liked everything about this film, except for the core of the emotional investment that everything is built around and I don't know why. For some reason, I just didn't like the romance.

I can accept not liking popular or even good movies, but I've always had a justification for it. I understand why I found The Girl Who Leapt Through Time boring, Wolf Children disappointing, The Wind Rises emotionally hollow, and Spirited Away just...weird. For Your Name though, I can nitpick some plot points that I didn't like but I can't figure out why those would've ruined the experience for me when I enjoyed the rest of the movie. I can see why some would think it's a masterpiece and others would think it's overrated, but I don't know why I find it frustrating instead of fulfilling.
