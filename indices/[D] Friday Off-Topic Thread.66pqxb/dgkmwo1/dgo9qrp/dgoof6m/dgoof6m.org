SPOILER WARNING FOR A MOVIE YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY CHECK OUT

I very much agree with you, though I'm a lot less certain about why. The director himself has said he thinks his creation is overrated since he was forced to cut content from the movie, which was presumably why some plot threads like Mitsuha's family weren't followed up on and we just cut away from her father finding out about Taki. There's apparently some supplemental material that explains things like the father's motivation and how it relates to his wife's death.

The couple only having one real conversation in the whole film did bother me, but I can't say for sure that's why I didn't like the romance. I was much more irritated at them losing their memories of each other. I assume it was meant to be gut-wrenching so you'd be happy when they got back together anyway, especially for those who watched Five Centimeters Per Second by the same director, but the fact that I didn't feel that satisfaction indicates something kept me from getting invested in the arc in the first place.
