I lurk on 4chan sometimes, mostly on /a/, /tg/, /w/, /wg/, /fit/ and /fa/, but I visit other boards too. It's a love-hate relationship, though. While I've read there some really insightful and interesting discussions, I'm also really disgruntled by general negativity, vulgarity and that spiteful attitude when you know that whatever your opinion is, you will be called names in a second anyway. Really, If I want to read a brutal criticism of something, I just google it with "4chan" added and it works 90% of the time.

I know that I sound like a prude saying that, but I can't help it - I really like politeness and 4chan can be really nasty.
