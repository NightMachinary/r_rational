I think if your goal is to be accepted into a program or for a fellowship or w/e, you should be as explicit as possible in addressing the desires of your reviewers, spinning your story to whatever extent you're comfortable with while not saying anything untrue. If your broader impacts are specifically supposed to address science engagement among underrepresented minorities, look for appropriate connections or expand your current outreach plan. Like, skimming the article, I'd hazard to say that the author is somewhat lacking in imagination if they can't answer:

#+begin_quote
  A number of them followed up by asking if I had witnessed anyone living in extreme poverty. No, I hadn't.
#+end_quote

Of course they have, insofar as they're aware of their existence. They can witness things digitally, textually, etc.

#+begin_quote
  Had I or anyone I know ever contracted malaria or a neglected tropical disease? No.
#+end_quote

I can give them this one, but if you flex the meaning of /know/ to /vaguely acquainted with/, I'm pretty sure AMF and other places send me stories of victims of neglected disease on the reg, and I've also read books which describe their experiences. To some extent I "know" then, if not on an intimate, face-to-face basis.

#+begin_quote
  Did I feel I had a responsibility to the developing world as a beneficiary of colonialism? Not particularly.
#+end_quote

This one's pretty trivial -- as a recipient of "developed world privilege" in part due to colonialism, the author is more inclined to help those less fortunate. The plane's going down but they already have their oxygen mask on and can help their neighbor.

#+begin_quote
  How did my privilege and my identity as a White Westerner contribute to my decision to focus on extreme poverty? It didn't.
#+end_quote

Again, white westerners are are traditionally rich. If the author were a rural developing world-er, I imagine they'd not nearly be as focused on extreme poverty outside of their local community.

#+begin_quote
  But the thing I don't understand is why do you care?
#+end_quote

i.e. what formative experiences led you to develop the compassion you (claim to) express now? Even if you're not sure, identify something plausible! Did your parents instill in you a deep commitment to helping those in need? Presumably they didn't hurt -- if you were raised by Ayn Rand and Genghis Khan I doubt you'd care so much about the developing world, beyond how you could exploit it. Hell, they even mention Catholic school and its commitment to impartial, universal caring! Talk about that! (I went to a Jesuit HS myself, and they wasted little time in encouraging our interaction with poor people, so presumably the author could discuss having met them before).

I think programs /do/ very much care about kindness, compassion, etc. in their applicants, but they're hypervigilant about easy-to-fake signals. Building a narrative for why you care lends credence to the claim that you do, legitimately or not. Contrast saying you care about all peoples everywhere with something like [[https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/04/04/opinion/check-this-box-if-youre-a-good-person.html][this]] (and nevermind the magnitude of effect, it's hard enough to establish its existence in the space of a thousand words). So too is it with claiming to be bananas about /reason/ or /rationality/ -- any old schmuck can say that, so as a signal its vacuous and unreliable. Instead, you need to demonstrate what exceptional accomplishments you've made that require exceptional rational reasoning abilities. Merely weak evidence won't do! Everybody has it! (this isn't too bad in the OP link -- I think there the author just encountered some super political reviewers)

(I'm also not sure I buy the paragraphs on the unimportance of evidence -- my impressions of e.g. academia and the health sector, etc. is that everybody's crazy about "evidence-based" whatevers these days)

(And I reckon I don't agree with the author metaethically, either, which probably colors my reading a fair bit)

(and people in my impression are motivated by emotions [citation needed], at least to some extent, so if the author can't describe any emotional connection they feel to the recipients of their goodwill I'd suggest they're something of an outlier)
