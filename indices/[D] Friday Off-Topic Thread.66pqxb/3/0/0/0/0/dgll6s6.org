  You should be able to use the max-width css property to make shrinking the browser window unnecessary.

I personally find shrinking the window to be much quicker than editing the code. Also, doing it manually is necessary because looking at how the line wrapping ends up is important.

For example, look at [[http://i.imgur.com/s4RJvKk.png][my most recent screenshot]]. If I had made it any narrower, the last line would have been wrapped to two uneven lines rather than just one line, and the list of forward-links at the top would have been wrapped to four uneven lines rather than three perfectly-even ones. (Really, I probably should have made it a little wider, to avoid the ugly two-line wrapping of the OP's sentence.)
