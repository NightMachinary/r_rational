I think the author was running into the broader and less political issue of the favored format/content for personal statements being a personal narrative with strong emotional content and broad potential in outreach. This problem applies to college applications, graduate program applications, and scholarship/fellowship applications. The fact that the author was applying to elite liberal institutions probably biased the target personal narrative to something more political and social justice oriented but the overall issue of favoring emotional personal narratives is a constant across the political spectrum.

My recommendation, for this issue, from my own limited experience, is to apply to lots of places and make the personal statement true to yourself even if it is slightly off target of the ideal personal narrative. This will get it turned down by most places, but it makes your application stand out more, and the few places that appreciate it will be more likely to be the places where you will fit the best. Getting into my graduate program, I think my personal statement had a good role in convincing the professor who is now my mentor that I would be a good fit for his lab, and the ways in which it was unconventional or too broad in goals or not emotionally driven enough were also the ways that made it good for convincing that particular professor. On the other hand, applying for the NSF GRFP, one of the particular categories that the response indicated I should have done better at was tying my personal statement into outreach and mentoring. So with that in mind, maybe the generic idealized emotional personal narrative is good when dealing with a larger faceless committee, while a more unique personal statement is good when it is individuals reading it... anyone have any other thoughts?
