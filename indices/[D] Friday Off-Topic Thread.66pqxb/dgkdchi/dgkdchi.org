Do you browse 4chan? Do you participate in it?

I tend to browse...\\
- Often: /d/, /s/, /tv/, /v/\\
- Sometimes: /co/, /e/, /g/, /gif/, /his/, /pol/\\
- Rarely: /aco/, /b/, /biz/, /fa/, /h/, /lit/, /o/, /trash/, /vg/gsg/, /vp/

I don't participate particularly often (unless I have some pornographic images that are relevant to a dying thread whose continued life I desire). It's an very entertaining site, though, and an /excellent/ [[http://np.reddit.com/user/ToaKraka/submitted/?sort=top][karma]] farm.

Possibly my favorite portion of my high-school chemistry class was the segment on [[http://lectureonline.cl.msu.edu/%7Emmp/labs/error/e2.htm][propagation of +uncertainty+ error]] (but my teacher called it =uncertainty= and used only the simplified equations shown on the linked page).

Unfortunately, I never had a chance to use it again...

  In my applications essays and mock interviews, I expressed my opinion that learning to think about altruism more rationally and less emotionally would help change the attitude of apathy and neglect with which developed nations regard those in the developing world.

  This opinion was summarily dismissed by my applications advisors. Many of them were skeptical of the notion that reason and rationality could be valid thinking tools at all. Their model of human psychology, it seemed, was one of a blank slate on which culture was free to paint any picture it desired. There was no room in this model for individuals to respond to rational argument and empirical evidence in ways that would compel them to dissent from the edicts of their culture.

  I was repeatedly told, for instance, how quixotic it was to expect that I could convince even a single person of the importance of extreme poverty through reason and evidence. Worse yet, I was scolded for â€˜presuming' that there was any rational basis for preferring to work on extreme poverty over other issues.[...]

  It took some time for my advisors to finally convince me to stop talking about reason, rationality, and evidence in my personal statements and interviews. The last straw came when *one of my scholarship advisors told me that my views on reason and emotion were, in fact, sexist. Because 'rationality' was associated with masculinity and emotion with femininity, she explained, my preference for rationality over emotion was indicative of my unconscious bias against women.*
