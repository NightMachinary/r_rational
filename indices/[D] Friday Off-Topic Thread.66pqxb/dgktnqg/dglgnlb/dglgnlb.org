I /really really don't understand/ how much money loss and fan disapproval it's going to take for whoever's in charge of DC's movie division to finally just get fired so they can hand the reigns over to the people who are in charge of the animated movies.

I get that they're two different mediums. But FFS, you can't tell me the same people who write the animated movies wouldn't help at least somewhat if involved in the process of making live action films, even if it's just writing the original script.
