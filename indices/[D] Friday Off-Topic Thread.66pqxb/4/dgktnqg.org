DC animated movies are the best. I'm really not excited about Guardians of the Galaxy 2, Spiderman Homecoming or Justice League; because I'll know they'll be bland and follow formulas and stuff.

On the other hand, I loved Gods and Monsters, Teen Titans: The Judas Contract, and I'm super excited about the upcoming Harley Queen movie.
