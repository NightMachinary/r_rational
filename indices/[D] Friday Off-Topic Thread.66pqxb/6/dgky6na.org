I've been watching Peterson's [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL22J3VaeABQApSdW8X71Ihe34eKN6XhCi][Personality and its Transformations]]. Only seen the introduction so far, so can't really comment on the content, but I'm really enjoying the somewhat rambling format of the lectures. Check it out if the topic is something you find interesting!
