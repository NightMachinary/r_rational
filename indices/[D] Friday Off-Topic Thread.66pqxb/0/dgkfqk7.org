Update from my depression post last week:

Meds get! I've gotten an antidepressant that will probably take a long time to kick in, but that I know works on me because I've used it before, and a sedative which is also an antidepressant and an antianxiety drug. That one is already helping me get the sleep I need to become more functional, and I think (?, these things are weird) I can feel it when the antianxiety function wears off each day, so that one is definitely helping in other ways as well.

To people who are reading Mortality, the Worm/Death Note fic I started several weeks ago and then didn't update on last weekend, I hope to be able to get posting again either this week or next week. Depression makes it a little difficult to summon the will to string words together.
