  So I've been trying to think of the properties of a system which is both wondrous and maintains that wonder when the reader learns its true nature (or whose wonder is enhanced when the true nature is learned). Stars are a good example from the real world; if you look up at them and can actually pay attention to them, they're stirring in some way. But when you learn that they're fusion reactors so far away that we're just now seeing light that was generated thousands of years ago, that wonder is enhanced. I don't really know how to do that in an invented magic system. I hang out in [[/r/magicbuilding]] quite a bit, and see a lot of people create these things that are ... sensible, I suppose, and certainly with distinct rules, but not that inspire wonder strictly in what they are, even if they're capable of wondrous effects.

I've posted about the magical system in my world to [[/r/magicbuilding]] just recently actually, and its designed from the bottom up to make sense down to the most granular level. Check it out, see if you can figure out my 'trick' :P
