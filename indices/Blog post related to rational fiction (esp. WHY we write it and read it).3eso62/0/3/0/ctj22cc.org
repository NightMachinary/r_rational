A counter opinion for that: the Entities in Worm were wondrous, as you say. Creatures larger than a planet that warped reality as their form of communication and were literally made of the best that a million civilizations had to offer? That right there, my friend, is some wonder-inspiring stuff.

The shards, on the other hand, completely ruined it for me. They were a literal embodiment of the Conflict Ball and often the Idiot Ball, and the largest narrative cheat I can remember reading, ever. They were literally the only reason the story happened, and they forced everyone to behave in strange, suboptimal, and unbelievable ways.
