The shards from worm are an almost perfect example of what you mean, I think. As a dot in the sky is to a massive fusion reactor lighter years away, the ability to shoot fire is to a moon-sized hyperdimensional organism re-directing physics such that you can shoot fire.

The lesson seems to be, if you want wonder then make it big and impressive and vaguely terrifying. "Oh I'm not shooting darkness, these are nascent universes! it's just the scale that's off you see." "What's that? Levitation spell? Pish posh, I'm stealing reverse gravity from an alternate dimension! They won't miss it... I think."
