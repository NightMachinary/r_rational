Do you need scale? Can you not get a sense of wonder from breaking open a geode or watching a bird hatching from its egg? Can't you get wonder from watching the perfect sinusoidal curve of an ocean wave, or seeing the Fibonacci pattern in the head of a piece of asparagus?

Do you need mystery? I went to an orchestra concert last Thursday and spoke to the composer afterward (it was the premier of the piece). He said that as he listened, the world melted away, and he forgot that it was something he composed. I think there's a strong argument to be made that mystery might be beneficial to the experience of wonder, but I don't think that it's a requirement.

I'm not really sure what my definition of wonder is, but while I think both scale and mystery can help, I don't think that they're a requirement. If you've seen the video in the article of the little girl seeing a train ... even though people get on trains every day, even though they might know (is only in general terms) how the train works, I don't think that being inured to the wonder is a permanent thing - in the same way that ignoring the stars every night of your life makes them less wondrous. (Partly, I think wonder can be provoked by just clearing out the mental cache.)

I don't know that this is helpful as far as writing fiction which provokes wonder even in its explanations though.
