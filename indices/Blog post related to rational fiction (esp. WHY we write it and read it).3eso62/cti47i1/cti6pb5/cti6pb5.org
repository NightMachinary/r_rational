A lot of stuff that becomes wondrous the more you know about it is boring when you don't know about it, but has super complicated, deep and surprising stuff that underlies it. Stars are a perfect example of that, like you said. With no knowledge about them, you just see some points of light when you look up, which is kind of boring. But when we learn about them, we find out all the surprising and complex things. You get the surface level surprises like how they are farther and bigger and hotter than anything else we know of. Then you get deeper surprises by the interconnection of its systems with other stuff. Like how the stars are so massive they pull around entire worlds with the same effect that worlds pull us down with. And then there's the near endless deep and complicated things you can learn about them like how they are so massive that they crush their own atoms so hard they fuse together, releasing a bunch of energy and photons that we see. And how that creates an entirely new state of matter called plasma that has complex patterns of flowing almost like weather. And how the stars can be formed from pressure ways of supernova explosions travelling through interstellar gas. And so much more!

A lot of magic in fiction is basically the opposite of that. The effects themselves are flashy, but there isn't much actual meat to it. And the thing is, in order for magic to have substance the story has to spend a ton of time with the characters discovering/revealing information about magic. For example, we take for granted our knowledge about the stars, but if I wrote a story that mentioned stars to someone who lived in a cave a thousand years ago and never heard about these things, that knowledge isn't there in the audience's mind. The amount of explanation I'd have to give in order for them to appreciate stars like an average person can would be... astronomical. I'd have to explain the kind of scale that these objects work at, which is unlike anything they'd ever dealt with. I'd have to explain about what atoms are and how they fuse, what photons are, how gravity really works, what an explosion is, etc. I'd have to relate all of these concepts in terms that they could actually relate with. All of that to explain why sometimes when the characters look up, they see little lights. It would pretty much have to be the centre of the entire story.

Not only would the story have to devote all that time to the magic system, you'd have to make the thing both self-coherent and surprising/mind blowing to discover. I think that might be extremely hard to do the more deep you go into it, especially with how it interacts with the rest of the world. Its super simple to say "X happens when you Y" (e.g. a firebolt appears when I say "abbra cadabra!") but in this case you'd have to go "When you Y, this causes X and Z, because of the O principal and its interactions with Set A of effects that come from the properties of M, N, L, the half life of any substance in contact, and how much oxygen is nearby, it triggers blah blah..." and then make sure you know all the possible outputs this system generates and the implications of that (or at least what the readers might come up with if you just want to avoid fridge logic). If you go deep enough into the rabbit hole, it could be akin to creating a whole new branch of physics. That's what the truly wondrous stuff in the real world can be like.

Anyway, that's just my speculation, I'm not particularly sure how accurate it really is.
