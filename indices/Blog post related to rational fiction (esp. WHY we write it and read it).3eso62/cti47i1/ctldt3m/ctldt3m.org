These are the sorts of things that make stars wonderous to many. They are visually fascinating and exciting and powerful.

I imagine if you really wanted it wouldn't be that hard to do the same with Harry Potter. Take the scene where Dumbledore gets into the secret cave of Voldemort.

You could have some sort of image on one page where Harry asks Dumbledore what he's doing, an image of the cave.

Then on the next page you could have it from Dumbledore's perspective with sworls of magic in fractal patterns lunging towards them, feeling at their hearts. Give a sense that beneath the senses there's a hidden world of information and knowledge that grants its users great power.

That's the sort of thing I try to do in my worldbuilding. I make the magic beautiful. Finding out why it's beautiful grants you enhanced power.
