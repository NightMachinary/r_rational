One question I've been asking myself lately is how to make something wondrous that's also beautiful when picked apart?

I was disappointed by the fact that so much of the Harry Potter books revolved around learning magic but so little magic was actually learned. Potions is an excellent example; /Half-Blood Prince/ is /about/ potions, but we never learn anything other than it's a matter of memorization. The way of Ravenclaw is shown as useful, in the form of Hermione, but our primary character blows off so much of it. Of course, there wasn't actually anything to the magic of Harry Potter; there were no rules beyond those that created whimsy or drama.

So I've been trying to think of the properties of a system which is both wondrous and maintains that wonder when the reader learns its true nature (or whose wonder is enhanced when the true nature is learned). Stars are a good example from the real world; if you look up at them and can actually pay attention to them, they're stirring in some way. But when you learn that they're fusion reactors so far away that we're just now seeing light that was generated thousands of years ago, that wonder is enhanced.

I don't really know how to do that in an invented magic system. I hang out in [[/r/magicbuilding]] quite a bit, and see a lot of people create these things that are ... sensible, I suppose, and certainly with distinct rules, but not that inspire wonder strictly in what they /are/, even if they're capable of wondrous effects.
