If you're using an iOS device, the Overcast app is essential for listening. My favorite podcast is The Mixed Six for its humorous intellectualism. I recommend My Brother, My Brother, and Me for straight up comedy and Welcome to Night Vale for horror comedy. If you just want to fill time, I've kept myself entertained for long stretches with RPG actual play podcasts like One Shot, The Adventure Zone, and Role Playing Public Radio (God's Teeth is their best horror campaign, Know Evil is fantastic sci-fi after a slow start, and both of their Red Markets campaigns are amazing post-apocalyptic adventures).
