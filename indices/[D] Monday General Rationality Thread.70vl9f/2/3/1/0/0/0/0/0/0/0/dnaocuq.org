  When the rule is extreme, like "thou shalt not kill", that is relatively easy for people to agree on and defend. But when a rule is moderate, like "thou shalt not perform said action if said action has moral value below 0.45124", that becomes extremely hard to defend. Why 0.45124?

How about "thou shalt, to the best of thy knowledge, do the action which giveth the greatest moral value"? So if you have a choice between an action with a value of 12 and one with a value of 8, you do the 12 one. Even if you can't put exact figures to it, it seems it would be usually possible to intuit which course of action has more moral value than the next.

  Especially in this case, what is the objective moral value of the negative utility of death?

For life insurance to work at /all/, insurance adjusters must be able to put a finite monetary value on a human life. I'm not sure what that value is, but it would make a starting point.

Alternatively, since all you really need to know is whether a given course of action has a greater moral value than another one or not, you might even be able to get away with not directly assigning an explicit value at all; as long as you can estimate an ordering between different courses of action.
