Well, it depends on the specific definition of "utility". So for example, many forms of utilitarianism advocate that the negative utility of a death, outweighs all positive utility from non-death related issues. Hence killing someone for the amusement for an arbitrarily large crowd of people is a no go.

This simplifies calculations a lot, since now you just have to weigh deaths against deaths, without considering any specific utility functions like people's desires and preferences.

So now, imagine the following hypothetical scenario: suppose there is an agent who has two attributes:

- Ultimate Killer: Instantly kills anyone anywhere whenever he wants to. Unlimited uses. Undetectable.
- Human Omniscience: Not true omniscience, but anything that is known by a human, the agent knows it too. So humans can't deceive the agent, nor would the agent accidentally kill the wrong person.

(You can think of the agent as some ascended human, space alien, AGI, or supernatural being.)

Although this is a very restrictive set of attributes, there are several things the agent can do to maximize utility. For example, he could kill off all serial killers, since their lives are less numerous than the lives of their victims. But it wouldn't stop there, because humanity has a problem: overpopulation.

There is only a limited amount of food, and humanity isn't very good at limiting their growth rate. And whenever there is a food shortage, the agent has an opportunity to maximize utility, since he can effectively choose who gets to eat and who just dies. At which point the question becomes, who should die? If someone eats X food, and two other people combined eat X food, you could sacrifice the first person to save the latter two if you only have X food. In other words, the agent should choose to sacrifice the people who need to eat more food, keeping the people who need less food to survive.

Who needs more food? Well, energy in = energy out, so whoever is using more energy needs more food. Tall people. Heavy people. Muscular people. People who use their brains a lot, because brains also use lots of energy. The agent kills them so that more people can be fed from the same amount of food.

Fun fact: Did you know a person without arms and legs needs less food? Less body mass to feed after all. Same for people who are paralyzed (since they don't use their muscles), or born with various defects like missing body parts or barely functional brains.

The agent doesn't even need to wait for a famine, there's a limited supply of all kinds of resources, and people die from starvation/poverty all the time, even in first world countries. Start early, culling the people whose genes promote high maintenance bodies to save more lives in the future. With the agent happily removing all the "bad" genes from the gene pool, you end up with a dystopia where humanity is reduced to small creatures with minimal body mass, minimal muscle strength, minimal brain activity, etc. After all, a large population of barely human lumps of flesh has more total utility than a small population of normal human beings.

Now, there are of course, other ways in which the agent could maximize utility. For example, he could cull the stupid in favor of letting the smartest people survive, hoping that the brightest minds would advance science the most and somehow increase food production with new scientific tools. But there are usually ways to adjust the hypothetical to prevent that. In this case, the hypothetical could be set in a time period where agricultural science has hit its absolute limit, with no more methods to increase food production.
