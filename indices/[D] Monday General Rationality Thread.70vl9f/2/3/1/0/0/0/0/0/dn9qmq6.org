Okay, you've presented an excellent argument for the statement that the negative utility of a single death should /not/ be considered infinite.

So then, the obvious question may be, is it ethical to kill one person for the amusement of a sufficiently large number of people, where 'sufficiently large' may be larger than have ever existed through history?

There, I'll say 'no', for the simple reason that - even if such an action has net positive utility - it does not have /maximal/ net positive utility. Because killing someone does have significant (non-infinite) negative utility, and the same arbitrarily large number of people can be entertained by (at the very least) a significantly less morally objectionable method. Such as juggling, or telling funny stories.

--------------

As a further point in favour of the idea that death should have finite negative utility, I point you to the legal code of any country that maintains the death penalty for certain crimes. Enforcing such laws enforces the idea that the negative of killing a person convicted of such a crime must be less than the negative of not enforcing the deterrent.
