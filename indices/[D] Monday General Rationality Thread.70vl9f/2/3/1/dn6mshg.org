  there are no objectively valid laws or moral truths that need to be followed just because, as axioms.

Also if there is any objective morality, I'm unaware of it. Every system of morality I've encountered, I tested by assigning it to a hypothetical being of incredible but not unlimited power. It typically ends in all humans dead, brainwashed, or confined to little boxes as barely human lumps of paralyzed and crippled flesh.

That doesn't mean morality is irrelevant though, that's a lot like saying economy is irrelevant. The problem is, if sufficiently many people believe in some imaginary system (like the value of paper money or the moral value of actions), that system has to be taken into account when you interact with them.
