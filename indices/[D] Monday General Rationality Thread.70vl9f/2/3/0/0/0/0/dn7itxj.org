  I'd say the justice system is operating through punishments and maybe vengeance, but not revenge. They provide punishment, both positive and negative, as a repellent against such crimes in society, they isolate the criminals from the rest of society, and they try to rehabilitate the criminals (often rather poorly, but whatever) before releasing them back into the society. They do not do revenge unless somewhere in the chain of command abuse of authority has taken place.

Revenge: 1) harm done to someone as a punishment for harm that they have done to someone else

Does this not fit justice systems which hang serial killers (death to someone that has given death to someone else)? Or fine vandals (financial harm to someone who has caused financial harm to someone else)? Or imprison kidnappers (captivity for someone who has held someone else captive)?

From my perspective, our justice systems are essentially outsourced and regulated revenge, because taking revenge personally is too difficult and tends to result in horrible misunderstandings/collateral damage. So instead, the participants outsource their revenge to the government, who then takes a carefully regulated amount of revenge upon the guilty parties. (Regulated because of various constraints like minimizing collateral damage while also satisfying the public so they don't go all vigilante and get their own revenge.)

  What I meant was that the way these concepts are used in the morality system becomes unusable in the one I've described. So, for some of them, they would at least have to be reworked \ rethought.

Oh, that I agree with.
