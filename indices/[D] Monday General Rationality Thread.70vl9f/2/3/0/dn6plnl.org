#+begin_quote
  revenge
#+end_quote

You could try preventing further negative actions against your person by taking revenge upon those who have already committed such actions, but in the bigger picture this would likely not be the most efficient way of doing things.

The future assailants may not even learn about your act of revenge, or they may not care about it, or something else.

And even if the situation's happening in an environment where all your actions will become known to all relevant agents, then maybe your intimidation will work but still not be the best solution to the problem. E.g. 1) there might've been some other, more efficient ways of ensuring that nobody tries to wrong you in the same manner again or 2) the intimidation itself can have other negative results (e.g. an even further escalation).

Ultimately, when you strip the sense of gratification that you'd receive from the act of revenge itself, as a solution the revenge will often turn out to be a subpar solution. So, in this case what I meant was: take revenge if you're valuing the sense of gratification it will provide highly enough, but don't take it pretending that it'll be the best solution to your problem because likely it won't. Something like that.

  blame
#+end_quote

If what you're facing is a systematic problem, no matter how much you blame (or even punish) the agents who are just following the rules of that system, the problem will continue to persist until the system itself has been sufficiently changed. So, for example, you could even change the system to have heavy incarceration for all kinds of minor crimes, and it would even change things to a certain degree. It just wouldn't be the more efficient solution --- compared, for example, to altogether eliminating the need for all those minor crimes, and so on.

#+begin_quote
  morality, as a concept, being irrelevant
#+end_quote

By “disregarding morality” I meant disregarding it as one's system of guiding principles, not ignoring it completely. One would still account for it, of course, when making the predictions of likely rewards and punishments.
