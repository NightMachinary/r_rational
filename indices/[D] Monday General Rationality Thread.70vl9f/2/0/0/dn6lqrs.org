It seems to be very close to what I had in mind, yes. With maybe the difference from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consequentialism#Philosophies][the types mentioned here]] that it doesn't try to define what the consequentialism should prioritise (e.g. in contrast to /state consequentialism/): that would depend on the practitioner's values and judgements. I guess in that manner you could even classify it as ethical egoism, with the egoist agent potentially having a vast array of things included in the domain of their self-interest (e.g. the above-mentioned utopian society as a value to strive towards).

And also, if you defined consequentialism in the Hollywood supervillainy type of “ends-justify-the-means” manner, it wouldn't be what I had in mind because the means themselves are also part of the consequences. But at least some of the articles on Consequentialism seemed to be addressing this, so this paragraph is mostly for clarification.

So, mostly, yes, it's a consequentialist person that I had in mind that wouldn't demonstrate hyporcritical, self-contradicting, or inconsistent principles (e.g. see the revenge example) halfway through the story.

/p.s. I think I'll wait for the Friday off-topic thread to ask for book recommendations with main characters like this./
