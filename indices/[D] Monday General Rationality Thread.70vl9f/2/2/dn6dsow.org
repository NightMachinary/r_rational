  The idea is that when one has to make a decision or a moral judgement, they disregard the morality

  because stealing would harm others (empathy), harm the society in general (game theory, society-without-theft being seen as a value, etc)

Maybe I'm slightly oversimplifying here, but isn't that the basis of non-religious morality? If empathy, avoiding harm to others/society, etc., can be considered as motivators, then it seems you've only removes the label of "morality" from those motivators, rather than "replacing morality"...
