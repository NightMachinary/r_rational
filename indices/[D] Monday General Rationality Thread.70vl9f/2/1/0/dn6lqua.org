If you had [[http://www.philosophybasics.com/branch_moral_anti-realism.html][moral anti-realism]] in mind, then (I think) yes on the first sentence.

  The way you're describing it, this sounds basically equivalent to what people with no particular code of morality but also no particular malice do anyway.

Well, no. I think there are several differences from what you've described. It's one thing to just not have a well-defined morality code and another to both explicitly reject morality and also have a developed system of principles that works in its place. Additionally, depending on the person's values and worldview, they could still be utilising this system both if they valued malevolence or if they valued altruism.

It's just a general personality template that can be tweaked this way and that to get the desired character. I guess with a proper brainwashing\transformation you could even turn a previously altruistic consequentialist into a malevolent one.
