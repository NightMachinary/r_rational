Audiobooks:

- Yuval Noah Harari's /Sapiens/ and /Homo Deus/: An excellent pair of books on the history of humanity and its potential future.
- Parag Khana's /Connectography/: Viewing the interactions of states based on borders is is obsolete; instead, look at their economic and social connections.
- Peter Frankopan's /The Silk Roads/: To go a step further, viewing state interactions through the lens of borders has always been limiting. History is more fun when you introduce economics.
- James SA Corey's /The Expanse/: Space opera meets detective novel on the edge of armageddon.

Podcasts:

- Revolutions: A historian covers several of the world's major revolutions in roughly chronological order, starting with the English Revolution in the 1600s and most recently taking on the Revolutions of 1848. Witty and intriguing throughout.
- The Methods of Rationality Podcast: You probably already know about this one; it started as a fan reading of HPMOR and has since turned into a bi-weekly podcast recording rationalist fiction. Their most recent large project was a rendition of Alexander Wales' /The Metropolitan Man/. Currently on hiatus, but there's a lot of content to delve into.

Lectures:

- The /Democracy at Work/ YouTube Channel: Not likely to be as popular here, but still interesting; Richard Wolff explains the economic theory of socialism and the failures of capitalism. The [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wkO3qsZY_U&list=PLPJpiw1WYdTNMCC0ypXHZ-kW7yCz4T0Zg][Online Lecture Series]] playlist is quite extensive.
