  [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment#Retribution][Supporters of the death penalty argued that]] death penalty is morally justified when applied in murder especially with aggravating elements such as for murder of police officers, child murder, torture murder, multiple homicide and mass killing such as terrorism, massacre and genocide. This argument is strongly defended by New York Law School's Professor Robert Blecker, who says that the punishment must be painful in proportion to the crime. [..] Some abolitionists argue that retribution is simply revenge and cannot be condoned. [..] It is also argued that the punishing of a killing with another death is a relatively unique punishment for a violent act, because in general violent crimes are not punished by subjecting the perpetrator to a similar act (e.g. rapists are not punished by corporal punishment).

Firstly, I admit that revenge seems to have also found its place in the justice system along with deterring punishment, isolation, and rehabilitation.

On the subject in general though, I think maybe what we're arguing about is a conflict of paradigms? In one paradigm, retributional harm is viewed as something done for harm's own sake, something to even the score, so to speak. In the other, it's viewed as a deterrent, a means to dissuade others from committing the same crime. In one, capital punishment is seen as an act of revenge, while in the other it's seen as a way to prevent the criminals that are deemed incapable of rehabilitation from any future acts of crime. Same with financial harm: seen as revenge v.s. seen as deterrent and penalty aimed at covering the caused financial damage. Same with imprisonment: seen as revenge v.s. seen as isolating the criminals until either they're judged fit to be released back into society (parole) or the determined incarceration period that was functioning as a deterrent has expired.

On a somewhat different note, the principles adopted by governments may not be very suitable to be used by individuals. For instance, some of the nuances [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/70vl9f/d_monday_general_rationality_thread/dn6plnl/][mentioned here]] may be irrelevant on the scale of a governing body but very important on the scale of an individual.
