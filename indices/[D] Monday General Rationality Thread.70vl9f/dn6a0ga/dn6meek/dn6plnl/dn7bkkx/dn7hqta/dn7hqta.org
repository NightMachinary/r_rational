I wasn't saying that the option of revenge should be outright discarded, but that:

- 1) the decision making shouldn't be biased in favour of the emotionally tempting option of revenge,
- 2) revenge shouldn't be [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationalization_(psychology)][rationalized]] as something relevant to morality (e.g. “it's my righteous retaliation to enact revenge upon the offender”, etc) because that would compromise one's judgement with self-deception (e.g. compare to: I admit that I want my revenge and value it highly enough to bump that solution up on the list, even though there are objectively more efficient ways of solving the issue)
- 3) eventually, the objectively better\best solution should be chosen, which will most likely not be the solution of revenge. And if, once you've made sure your emotions aren't influencing you to make a biased judgement, analysing all the available options still shows that path of revenge will be the most effective, then that's just what it is and you proceed with revenge because it's the best option you have --- not because you see the act of revenge as some sort of moral obligation or because you are deceiving yourself because of being influenced by your emotions, etc.

  our justice system is essentially regulated vengeance

Perhaps our misunderstanding is coming from different definitions of the same word, here are some of dictionaries' definitions for these three words:

#+begin_quote
  revenge: 1) harm done to someone as a punishment for harm that they have done to someone else 2) the action of hurting or harming someone in return for an injury or wrong suffered at their hands 3) to avenge (oneself or another) usually by retaliating in kind or degree

#+begin_quote
  vengeance: 1) punishment inflicted in retaliation for an injury or offense 2) infliction of injury, harm, humiliation, or the like, on a person by another who has been harmed by that person; violent revenge: 3) the act of harming or killing someone because they have done something bad to you

#+begin_quote
  punish: 1) a: to impose a penalty on for a fault, offense, or violation b: to inflict a penalty for the commission of (an offense) in retribution or retaliation 2) to subject to pain, loss, confinement, death, etc., as a penalty for some offense, transgression, or fault 3) The infliction or imposition of a penalty as retribution for an offence.
#+end_quote

So depending on the definition I'd say the justice system is operating through punishments and maybe vengeance, but not revenge. They provide punishment, both positive and negative, as a repellent against such crimes in society, they isolate the criminals from the rest of society, and they try to rehabilitate the criminals (often rather poorly, but whatever) before releasing them back into the society. They do not do revenge unless somewhere in the chain of command abuse of authority has taken place.

#+begin_quote
  Blame is a suboptimal solution in many cases, but cannot be disregarded.
#+end_quote

I've never said in any of these cases (i.e. regarding morality, regarding revenge, regarding blame) that they should be outright disregarded.

edit:

#+begin_quote
  Also note that some terms that would be heavily relied upon in a morality system become obsolete, meaningless, or blurry enough to be unusable in this one. Among such terms possibly are: right\wrong, fault, blame, crime, sin, revenge, right, privilege, etc.
#+end_quote

Perhaps this paragraph was the one phrased too badly. What I meant was that the way these concepts are used in the morality system becomes unusable in the one I've described. So, for some of them, they would at least have to be reworked \ rethought.
