  You could try preventing further negative actions against your person by taking revenge upon those who have already committed such actions, but in the bigger picture this would likely not be the most efficient way of doing things.

  The future assailants may not even learn about your act of revenge, or they may not care about it, or something else.

  And even if the situation's happening in an environment where all your actions will become known to all relevant agents, then maybe your intimidation will work but still not be the best solution to the problem. E.g. 1) there might've been some other, more efficient ways of ensuring that nobody tries to wrong you in the same manner again or 2) the intimidation itself can have other negative results (e.g. an even further escalation).

Certainly, revenge tends to be suboptimal in most situations, but you cannot simply discard the option. If vengeance truly solved nothing, then all countries' laws and courts are meaningless. After all, our justice system is essentially regulated vengeance. It is a revenge system that is carefully regulated to both deter would-be offenders and cripple (fine/imprison/hang) offenders so it is harder for them to offend again.

  If what you're facing is a systematic problem, no matter how much you blame (or even punish) the agents who are just following the rules of that system, the problem will continue to persist until the system itself has been sufficiently changed. So, for example, you could even change the system to have heavy incarceration for all kinds of minor crimes, and it would even change things to a certain degree. It just wouldn't be the more efficient solution --- compared, for example, to altogether eliminating the need for all those minor crimes, and so on.

Same reasoning applies here. Blame is a suboptimal solution in many cases, but cannot be disregarded. Plus, even if there are more efficient solutions, those solutions tend to cost time/money/resources, which, rather than fund-raising from scratch, is usually faster to simply fine from the people who are blamed when that's an option.
