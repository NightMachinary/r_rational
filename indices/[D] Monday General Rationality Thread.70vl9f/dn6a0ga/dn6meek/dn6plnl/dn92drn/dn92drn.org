  The future assailants may not even learn about your act of revenge, or they may not care about it, or something else.

For vengeance to prevent future assailants, then, it needs to fulfil certain conditions:

- It should be public, and obvious

- It should be clearly and obviously connected to the act that one wishes to disincentivise

- It should include sufficient cost for the target that anyone wishing to accomplish a similar task will gain an extremely negative net result if a similar vengeance is visited upon them. (Assuming future offenders take a moment to think about things, this should ensure that they care).

- It should not be preventable by a future offender who takes basic precautions against it, except where these basic precautions consist of not doing the thing that is being disincentivised.
