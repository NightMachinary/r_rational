  Also if there is any objective morality, I'm unaware of it. Every system of morality I've encountered, I tested by assigning it to a hypothetical being of incredible but not unlimited power. It typically ends in all humans dead, brainwashed, or confined to little boxes as barely human lumps of paralyzed and crippled flesh.

That means your morality is plainly wrong, which also means we're judging it by some objective standard, which of course means there's an objective morality. The question is how the heck you're getting your knowledge of the objective morality such that the overhypothesis (the system for judging systems) and the object-level hypotheses (the supposed "systems of morality") disagree on such an extreme level.
