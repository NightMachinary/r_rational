  Okay, you've presented an excellent argument for the statement that the negative utility of a single death should not be considered infinite.

The question then is, how much negative utility is a death worth? If it's too large, then the previous hypothetical still applies. If it's too small, then the agent should simply kill all humans immediately since they will experience more suffering (negative utility) in their lives than in death.

Now the moral axiom is on shaky ground. When the rule is extreme, like "thou shalt not kill", that is relatively easy for people to agree on and defend. But when a rule is moderate, like "thou shalt not perform said action if said action has moral value below 0.45124", that becomes extremely hard to defend. Why 0.45124? Why not 0.45125 or 0.45123? If that form of morality is *objective*, there has to be a specific value, with some very precise reason as to why the value should morally not be infinitesimally smaller or larger.

Especially in this case, what is the objective moral value of the negative utility of death? If you went around asking people what that value was, and require them to be extremely specific, you would get wildly different answers, with no clear explanation for why it should be exactly that number unless they claim it's something extreme like infinity. Now, I concede that it is possible that there is a specific objective moral value for death, like -412938.4123 utility points or something, but I am certainly not aware of it.
