This sounds almost exactly like how I live my life lol. Every sentence I read I ended with "so... reality then?"

The one part I disagree with is that you claim "blame" becomes irrelevant. On the contrary, "blame" becomes extremely relevant because without morality, revenge becomes more important as a means of controlling other people's actions (the number 3 motive in your post), and "blame" is the targeting mechanism for vengeance.

So it is not irrelevant whether or not the worsening ecology is the fault of such corporations, the blame needs to be assigned, lest its vengeance fall upon yourself.
