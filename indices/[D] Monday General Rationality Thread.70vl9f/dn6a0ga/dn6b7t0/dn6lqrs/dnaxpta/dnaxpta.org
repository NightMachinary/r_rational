My personal philosophy has always, as far as I can remember, been something I'd never seen anywhere, that I'd call "pure consequentialism" (but "basically consequentialism" is a cool name too).

My intuition on the subject is: "I do things that make things better, and I don't do things that make things worse; I define 'better' and 'worse' through empirical observation and evidence gathering". In other words, first I figure out what makes people happier or healthier or less miserable, and then I make rules around that, not the other way around.

I think consequentialism works best as a pure rejection of arbitrary rules, not as any particular set of rules. I'm consequentialist because forbidding gay relationships because "it's impure" is bullshit, and because I want government policy to be based on whether or not it's going to work; I'm not consequentialist because I believe in any specific happiness aggregation function.

Basically, I think the essence of consequentialism is to believe not in the letter of moral rules, but in their spirit.
