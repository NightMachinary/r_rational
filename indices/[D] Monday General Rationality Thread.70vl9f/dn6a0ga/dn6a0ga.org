tl;dr: Thoughts on a worldview subsystem that replaces morality and ethics, invitation for discussion.

--------------

The idea is that when one has to make a decision or a moral judgement, they disregard the morality and decide what to do based on the predictions of likely rewards and punishments for their person, their goals, their values, etc. In this system, there are no objectively valid laws or moral truths that need to be followed just because, as axioms. There are only various fractions (e.g. governments, subcultures, etc) and phenomena (e.g. forces of nature, one's own human psychology, etc) that need to be accounted for because they will punish or reward the decision maker based on the latter's decisions.

So, for instance:

- one doesn't steal 1) because of the likely punishments from the fractions “government\law enforcement”, “previous owner”, “public”, etc; 2) because stealing will gradually lead to developing a bad personality --- with “bad” being defined as ineffective and unsustainable in long-term; 3) (optional, would depend on one's goals and values) because stealing would harm others (empathy), harm the society in general (game theory, society-without-theft being seen as a value, etc); 4) etc;
- one doesn't flash all the money they have on their person while outside because of the likely punishment from the fractions “thieves\pickpockets\etc”;
- one doesn't walk home alone while wearing a revealing dress because of the likely punishment from the fraction “rapists”.

Also note that some terms that would be heavily relied upon in a morality system become obsolete, meaningless, or blurry enough to be unusable in this one. Among such terms possibly are: right\wrong, fault, blame, crime, sin, revenge, right, privilege, etc.

- So, for instance, when the possible decision of walking home alone at night is being discussed, it should be irrelevant whether or not the person has a /right/ to walk home or not. What should be considered instead is the possible consequences. They base their decision on whether or not they are willing to take the risk of potentially being assaulted. They can also take further actions (e.g. through political activism, which would essentially be siccing the fraction “law enforcement” on the fractions “thieves” and “rapists”) to lower the risks involved with walking home.
- When being wronged by someone, it should be meaningless to regard possible /revenge/ as something related to morality. Instead, one can 1) think how to prevent such punishments happening against their person in the future (in which case the demonstration of revenge itself could possibly be one of the solutions, as a future repellent) 2) (based on values) try to get their revenge anyway but only seeing it as the final reward itself, 3) (based on values) try preventing them from acting in the similar manner against others in the future.
- When a corporation is lobbying to deny climate change or is dumping toxic waste into the environment, it's irrelevant whether or not the worsening ecology is the /fault/ of such corporations. Instead, what should be considered is how to change the country's\world's economical\political systems in such a way that it will no longer be profitable for corporations to harm the ecosystem. Similar examples with privacy laws, internet laws, politicians, etc.

I'm still tinkering with this idea, so inputs, criticism, and discussion are welcome.
