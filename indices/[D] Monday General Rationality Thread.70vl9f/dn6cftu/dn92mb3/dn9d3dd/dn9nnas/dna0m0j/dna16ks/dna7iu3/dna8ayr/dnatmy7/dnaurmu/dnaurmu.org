No. I am not trying to argue anything about Trump's policies in any way at all.

I am arguing that the choice between Donald Trump and whoever ran against him is still a /binary/ choice - American voters still felt like they only had two choices and it was the same two parties as it always is. I am not, in any way, saying that either of those candidates has anything to do with the stated aims and policies of their sponsoring parties.

In fact, I would not be in the least surprised if both candidates were to prioritise pushing through exactly the same policies in certain areas - while making a big noise over some completely unrelated policies. And as long as you have only two candidates, you as the voters have no choice about the things that those two candidates agree on.
