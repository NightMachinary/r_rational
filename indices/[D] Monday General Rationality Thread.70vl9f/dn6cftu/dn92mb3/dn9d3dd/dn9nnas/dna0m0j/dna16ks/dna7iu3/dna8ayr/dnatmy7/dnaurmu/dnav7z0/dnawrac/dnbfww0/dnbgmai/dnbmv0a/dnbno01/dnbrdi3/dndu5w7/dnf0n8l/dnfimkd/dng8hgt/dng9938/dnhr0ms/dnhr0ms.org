  [M]oney has /significant/ control over the American election (not total control, but significant control) and that the influence of the voters on the results has been carefully minimized, in large part by a series of political tricks, and in such a way as to magnify the influence of money on the results.

Yeah... the evidence just doesn't support that. If it were all (or mostly) about money, Jeb Bush would have won the 2016 Republican nomination, and Hillary Clinton would have won the general election.

Which isn't to say that politics doesn't have a lot to do with who gets chosen. As I've been trying to say, it's complicated. Politics is, in effect, a massive policy debate that's been going on for hundreds of years interspersed at regular intervals with elections centered around a few charismatic individuals, and occasionally worldwide events that scramble the whole discussion.

I suppose what I'm saying is: don't be so cynical. We're not living in 1984, and there isn't some secret cabal that's really running the show. It's really just very messy, which is the sort of thing you get when a great many intelligent actors are all invested in achieving differing outcomes.
