  It's not as bad as it sounds.

So, I raise the point "corporate clients have disproportionate influence on the American voting process" and your response is, paraphrased, "it's not that bad, they don't quite have /total/ control"?

Well, while I'll admit that "total control" is worse than "significant influence", it's really not that much worse. "Significant influence" is pretty bad already.
