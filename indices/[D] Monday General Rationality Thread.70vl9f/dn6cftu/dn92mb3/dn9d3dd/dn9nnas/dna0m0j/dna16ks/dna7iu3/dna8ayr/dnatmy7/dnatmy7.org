... are you trying to argue that Donald Trump is a conservative? Disregarding the fact that he ran for office with an (R) next to his name, what makes you think he's a Republican? Note that a president need not (and should not) retain party affiliation once in office, save for the necessity of getting re-elected. Which is why it's very common to see presidents work with members of the opposition party to achieve policy objectives.
