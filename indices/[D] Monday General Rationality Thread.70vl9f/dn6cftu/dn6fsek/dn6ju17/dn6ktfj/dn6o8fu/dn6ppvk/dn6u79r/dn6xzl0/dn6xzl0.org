I cannot vouch for the accuracy of these specific websites as I found them through a quick google search, but it's consistent with what I've heard from acclaimedly independent journalists and people who actually live in Europe.

Statistics on Sweden's rape rates vs. other countries [[https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/5195/sweden-rape]]

Collection of quotes/interviews of Swedish citizens about refugees [[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3477510/Migrant-attacks-conspiracy-hide-truth-Europe-s-liberal-country-Sweden-stopped-citizens-discussing-refugee-influx.html]]

Migrant rape crisis in Germany [[https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/9934/germany-rape-january]]

Islamic grooming gangs in England [[http://www.pmclauth.com/sentenced/Grooming-Gang-Statistics/Gangs-Jailed]]

These governments don't want people to think their immigration policies are causing these problems, so they're trying to skew what information gets out. They are so terrified of being Islamophobic that they're not even admitting that there is a problem, as opposed to trying to fix it.
