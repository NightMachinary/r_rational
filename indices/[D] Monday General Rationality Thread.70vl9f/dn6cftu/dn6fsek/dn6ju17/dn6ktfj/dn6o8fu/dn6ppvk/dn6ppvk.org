I don't think naturalization is a deal-breaker, it's just highly distasteful. If there's an opportunity to implement effective border control and a merit-based immigration system AND deport all of the illegals currently here, that's the best case scenario. But if the only way to convince everyone to agree to the border control and merit system is to also allow the illegals to stay, then I, and I think most Trump supporters, would reluctantly accept that deal.

The fact that a nonzero amount of Trump supporters are completely unwilling to compromise does not logically imply that all, or even most are.

I'm not sure why you bring up Europe, given that they have immigrants forming literal rape gangs, but it's certainly a good argument in favor of increased border control.

I think there are plenty of moderates, we just tend not to join protests or yell loudly, especially on Reddit where everywhere is highly biased to the left except a few subs which are highly biased to the right.
