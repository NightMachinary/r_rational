Is there a third option to backing Trump's opponents in an attempt to get him impeached? I'm not leaving the country for a better place and I would prefer to live in a country which he is not the President of. The only people who frighten me more than he does are his supporters who promote racism, fascism, and anti-intellectualism whether they are aware of it or not. He will not be removed from office by the republicans, so I want the democrats to gain power. I fail to see any logical fallacy.
