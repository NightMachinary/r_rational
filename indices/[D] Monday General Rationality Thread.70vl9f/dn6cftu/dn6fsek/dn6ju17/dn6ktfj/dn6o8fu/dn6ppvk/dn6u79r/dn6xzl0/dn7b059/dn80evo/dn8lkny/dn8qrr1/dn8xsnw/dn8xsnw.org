Accusing a Reddit post that was assembled with the intention of providing ammunition to liberals arguing with ignorant racists of cherry picking data is one thing, insisting that there is an equivalency between the beliefs of people who see Muslims as /the Other/ and people who think Muslims should be treated equally is another.

I cannot "see both sides" of an issue when one side has been proven to be factually incorrect enough times, without making an effort to correct themselves, to be considered racist. Islamophilia is bad, I consider such people to be a form of exoticism racist, but a list of counter-examples to stereotypes islamophobes spread is not as harmful as those stereotypes.
