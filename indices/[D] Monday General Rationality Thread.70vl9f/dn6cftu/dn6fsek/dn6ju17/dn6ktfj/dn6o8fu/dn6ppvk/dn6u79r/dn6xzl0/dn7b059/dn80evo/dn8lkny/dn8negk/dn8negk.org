Has this harmful political agenda been going on consistently for at least 25 years? Because even though the Terrorism only started around 2001 and the refugee crisis is newer, the general practices of Muslims oppressing women and such was how it was portrayed growing up. I never heard anyone dispute this until the past few years when suddenly Muslims are the new minority of importance. From my perspective, the new narrative is that Islam is a religion of peace, and I require strong evidence to convince my that's true, and if it's true why wasn't this evidence available 25 years ago?

The reddit post seems cherry-picked, they display specific regions that have large Muslim populations and low crime rates with no transparent methodology for how they chose those. Likely it was specifically for those two features. I don't see how Western Muslims who've grown up in a western society behaving with western values is a good predictor of new refugees who want to implement Sharia Law:

Sharia law is sexist, homophobic, and not compatible with western society. Maybe the best common ground is to make the distinction between progressive Muslims who are willing to adapt to Western society and culture and obey the laws of the land they reside in, and radical Muslims who commit terror attacks, follow Sharia Law, oppress women and homosexuals, or approve of and desire to implement those things. Because most of the people arguing for Islam are thinking about the former, and most of the people arguing against it are thinking about the latter. We should let in good!Muslims and treat them like ordinary people, we should shun bad!Muslims and let them live in their own countries where they can live in their own culture and won't be offended by things like bacon or dogs or a woman's legs that they'll inevitably encounter if they live in ours.
