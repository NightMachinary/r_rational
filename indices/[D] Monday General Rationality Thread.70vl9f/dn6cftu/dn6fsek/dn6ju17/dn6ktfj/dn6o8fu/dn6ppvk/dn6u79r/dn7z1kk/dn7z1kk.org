Just because the overall trend is that refugees don't commit more crimes, doesn't mean there are no isolated groups of refugees who /do/. In the case of Rotherdam, UK /specifically/, it even came out that the police were actively /refusing/ to look into what they /knew/ was a sexual violence problem in their area, because it would make them look racist.

Yes, that actually happened. Seriously. I know that covering that up actually gives political ammo for the far-right to claim that /overall/ refugee crime numbers are vastly higher than they really are. Unfortunately, uh, Bayes' Rule or fucking something, so we really do now have to assign some higher probability to, "Actual crime rates are higher than reported crime rates because the police are too PC." At least in the UK.

Because they've been fucking /caught at it/.
