I am so glad this came out. Sure, some because of the vindication (I'll refrain from going up to anyone and saying "I told you so") but mostly because I get to further update in the direction of "trust your instincts and skepticism of things others seem to accept without question," which has served me very well recently and I think I've finally developed since I started paying attention to it.

I don't know how anyone actually convinced themselves that police worry too much about being seen as racist or insensitive to the point of allowing children to get raped, and I feel like the idea that PC-culture-run-mad has progressed to that level requires pretty heavy reinforcement from biased media.
