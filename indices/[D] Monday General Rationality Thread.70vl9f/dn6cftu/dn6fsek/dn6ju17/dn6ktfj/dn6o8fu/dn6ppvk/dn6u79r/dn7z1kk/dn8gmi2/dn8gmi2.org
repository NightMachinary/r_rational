  it even came out that the police were actively refusing to look into what they knew was a sexual violence problem in their area, because it would make them look racist

That was the excuse they gave, but evidence that's come up since the Rotherham scandal blew up suggests that it was a lie the police and council used to cover their own incompetence and disgusting attitudes towards the victims (e.g. calling 12-year old girls "slags" for being molested).

See the book Broken and Betrayed by Jayne Senior, a would-be whistleblower who was ignored by the Rotherham authorities (summary [[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/what-to-read/rotherham-whistleblower-explains-why-sex-abuse-ring-was-covered/][here]]). I'd also recommend watching The Betrayed Girls, the BBC documentary on Rotherham and similar scandals, and looking into the testimony of non-police investigators as well as that of victims of the gangs.
