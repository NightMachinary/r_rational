I'm willing to buy that the Gatestone institute is right-biased to some degree, but probably nowhere near as much as the left-biased accusers would have you believe. I'm fairly certain Politifact is in fact, left-biased given how they rate mostly true statements as "false" based on a couple technicalities.

  There's no hard evidence in favor of either side, so I'm going to believe one side.

I suppose this is somewhat rational, given that with 0 new evidence you would not update your beliefs, but this only works if you're willing to accept evidence in favor of either side equally.

  Until that time comes, I will continue to assume that people who make claims similar to this are some form of racist or xenophobic and view any tolerance of such unjustified beliefs as poisonous to civilized society.

This is not rational. I don't find the idea that 50% of the U.S. population being rampant bigots consistent with the reality I observe. The majority of people are relatively friendly and are a priory neutral on the issue of new people they meet, oppose racism, oppose sexism, etc. People disliking Islam is not equivalent to a bias against Islam, instead it comes from a shift that the evidence provides. Islamic countries are more likely to be awful and oppressive places, check. Islam creates more terrorists than other cultures or religions, check. Islam promotes the oppression of women, check. These facts are common knowledge.

Given these observations, it is rational to shift your opinion of Islam negatively compared to your prior you would have of some random religion you know nothing about. Many people conclude that Muslims are more likely to be dangerous than non-Muslims, in the same way they would conclude that sharks are more likely to be dangerous than chipmunks. It's not "Islamophobia", it's observing reality and acknowledging that it exists. This doesn't mean you should discriminate against Muslims, especially ones who have adopted Western culture and values and aren't bigots. But to leap from "not all Muslims" to "there is no correlation" is blatantly ignoring what Islam actually teaches. I will reiterate: the vast majority of ill-will towards Islam is deserved and based on observation, not prejudice.

Additionally, when a claim is made that Muslims are raping women, it is rational to give this claim a higher likelihood of being true than a claim of other religions or groups such as race doing the same, because Muslims treat women as less valuable than men. It is consistent with the other observations. It doesn't make it automatically true, but anyone who dismisses it outright without some good evidence against it is clearly biased.
