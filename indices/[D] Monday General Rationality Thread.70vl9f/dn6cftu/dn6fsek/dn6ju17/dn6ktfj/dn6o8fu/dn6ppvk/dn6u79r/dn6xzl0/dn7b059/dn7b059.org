The claims your sources make and conclusions they draw are directly contradicted by this reputable fact checker: - [[http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/may/11/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-germany-now-riddled-crime-thanks/]] - [[http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/feb/20/what-statistics-say-about-immigration-and-sweden/]]

The Gatestone Institute has come under heavy criticism for bias in their reporting. Wikipedia references them publicizing debunked fake news like the "no go zones" story, association with public figures who explicitly "hate Islam", and a Google search showed a Breitbart (a site who's owners have spoken with pride about its association with white nationalism) article citing the Institute as a source. The Daily Mail, meanwhile, has been proven multiple times to spread fake news without fact checking first.

The articles you link unambiguously criticize multiculturalism and feminism, and dismiss the explanation of the statistical increase being due to a change in the legal definition of rape without any evidence. Peter M. Cloughin admits to being banned from Facebook and Twitter, has published books that explicitly deride Islam as a concept, and the advertisement for his book on the left of the page includes a quote of praise by white nationalist Richard Spencer.

I have enough reason to believe that the sources you cited have an islamophobic agenda that they are promoting. The claims they make are not trustworthy, so I see no evidence to indicate that governments are altering or ignoring crime statistics to promote a harmful agenda. However, I do believe that these sources are doing harm by promoting unjustified prejudice against Muslims, so they should not be treated as legitimate sources of empirical data or unbiased analysis.

You have done nothing to convince me that my current beliefs about this issue are incorrect and I will not change them until I have been presented with hard evidence that contradicts them. Until that time comes, I will continue to assume that people who make claims similar to this are some form of racist or xenophobic and view any tolerance of such unjustified beliefs as poisonous to civilized society. I will aim to ensure that Muslims, immigrant or otherwise, are treated the same as everybody else.
