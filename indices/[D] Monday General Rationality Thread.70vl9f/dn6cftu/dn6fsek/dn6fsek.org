Pander to the Bernie supporters on economics, moderate on social issues. Bernie polled best not with registered Democrats, but with /independents/, who liked him best out of basically everyone. Their job is /not/ to get dedicated Democratic voters out, nor to get self-identified "centrists" to come out (those assholes came out in 2016 and it didn't fucking help), but to increase turnout among low-income people in general, especially independents and consistent nonvoters.

Why? Because honestly, that's the largest population who're actually up for grabs, and there's enough of them to swing things. If everything's been polled and predicted to hell and back, go find a variable the enemy hasn't accounted for.
