The "strategy" for the Democratic Party is going to vary by congressional district. It will be set by candidates, not the party. People tend to misjudge what House of Representative races are like. It's not a top down party strat, it's bottom up from these small districts. Congressional districts tend to have about 700,000 people in them. Most of them don't have issues that cleave along Sanders vs Centrist lines. They are highly heterogenous. What might work in say, a more urban Colorado district wouldn't apply in, say...

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri%27s_4th_congressional_district][Missouri's 4th.]] Missouri's 4th congressional district had been held by the Democratic party since 1955. We held that seat for half of a century. Ike Skelton served as the congressman for that district for 17 terms, from 1977 to 2011. This guy voted with the Democrats on most issues, but on gun control, abortion, and DADT, he was conservative. He had a lot of support from the rural areas of his congressional district and was well liked by everyone.

  The district's population was 91 percent white (see Race and ethnicity in the United States Census); 85 percent were high school graduates and 17 percent had received a bachelor's degree or higher. Its median income was $42,317. In the 2008 presidential election the district gave 61 percent of its vote to Republican nominee John McCain and 38 percent to Democratic nominee Barack Obama. In 2010 the district had a Cook Partisan Voting Index of R+14.

  ...Skelton was re-elected in 2008 with 66 percent of the vote.

This was a blue dog Democrat, the kind the Dems need a lot of to hold a majority in the House. But then, in 2010, The Tea Party came for him, and he was defeated. Now the seat is held by Vicky Hartzler, who is a birther, a climate skeptic, and against welfare programs like food stamps. Her constituents are okay with this somehow. She's popular and will be hard to unseat by any Democrat, unless things seriously go south and the district agitates for change.

It's tough to see where we go from here in Missouri's 4th. And there are a lot of districts like this. Not saying it's impossible, but it's gonna be hard. The local/state Democratic parties have their work cut out for them, both for winning state legislature and contesting house seats that the Republicans now have held for nearly a decade. However, the situation in California's 10th (which is generally a toss-up in most polls but Republicans have held for 4-6 years) is completely different.

Every race deals with a different constituency and a different set of candidates and issues. The California 10th cares a lot about water and certain social issues that just aren't important in Missouri's 4th. Race issues are completely different. Both are dealing with different levels of gov't money from the feds and from their own states, and have different levels of poverty, types of industry, etc. Both benefit differently from Obamacare, and have different exposure to illegal immigration, etc.

The idea that there should be a singular national policy that is more Bernie-like or more centrist is not entirely wrong, but is also basically wrong. There will be some national-level party guidance in the midterms, but congressional races are a lot more local than people think. There will be many Democrats running on many platforms, and not all of them will be taking their marching orders from Sanders or from the party.
