good link.

i understand your point better than it might seem. and here is something you might have missed regarding why being abrasive is an amazing tool.

first, it saves resources. all that sweet dancing around takes time reading and writing. and this is what companies pay for to their employees in customer service. not for resolving issues but for imitation of sincere respect.

second, it's water fast. "wikipedia is not a source and you're ignorant not to know that" has no double edge while "I don't think your source is valid, do you have another?" opens doors to "why not? why are you biased against wikipedia? because it doesn't support your point? why do you reject my source? ok, i have another source - link to any random website. what? you don't like that too?" if a person proudly provides a link to wikipedia as a source, without a single attempt even to read his own "source", his participation in the discussion has no value.

third, are you aware about the concept of speed dating? men and women have 5 minutes to estimate whether they want to continue communication. so doesn't matter what they are talking about, in reality, they check all those tiny details - clothes, way of smiling, laughing, etc. the same with communities. one-two effective interactions with core members of the community predict its general quality very well. and this interaction felt like a clubbish set. that's why i have removed all my messages from here.

four, abrasive language is a perfect screen tool. it's internet, we don't know each other, whatever conflicts or insults we have here, that means nothing in real life. so if a person takes abrasive language /personally/, s/he is not particularly smart. if a person can't acknowledge "two times two equals four, stupid!" because of the word "stupid", this person more likely takes in "two times two equals five", wrapped in appealing courtesies.

five, abrasive language helps in screening middle class from labor. historically, sweet manners were the main tool of elites to control and discipline its own members. "a gentleman must be respectful to other gentleman, because they're equal". so its one hand rubs another mentality which originates from the clique and vertical type of their network. low classes, in contrast, don't need that because their network is horisontal. so by default, everyone treats each other neutrally, and the ability to "bite the bullet"/"put the money where your mouth is" is highly valued. their approach is "either pay to me for being polite with you or prove you're worthy of my respect".

sorry for nerdistry.
