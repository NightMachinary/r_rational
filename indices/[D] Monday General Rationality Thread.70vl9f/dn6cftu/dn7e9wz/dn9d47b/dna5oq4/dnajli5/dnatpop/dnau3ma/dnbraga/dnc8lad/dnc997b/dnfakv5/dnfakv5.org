[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_of_Wikipedia][But... but Wikipedia said that we could trust Wikipedia!]]

Seriously though, I'm pretty sure Wikipedia /is/ as valid a source as you can find. It can be wrong, but it's claims are backed by citations; claims and articles with not enough citations are marked as such. Even that process can be bent, and wrong info can end on Wikipedia, but that's true of any major news source.

(also, your comment is pretty rude; saying "you disappoint me" is condescending)
