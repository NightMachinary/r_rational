  RCP is still right leaning, but yeah, not nearly as much as FOX.
#+end_quote

A comparison to FOX isn't fair. It's more of an aggregator like Drudge, except they link The Daily Beast and The Nation as well as National Review and The Federalist, instead of linking Breitbart and InfoWars like Drudge does. As such, it's goes fairly straight down the middle. (Yes, they also produce some content, but that's not the focus.) I tend to spend a fair amount of time laughing at the ridiculous dishonesty of pundits on both left and right.

  Did you just beg the question of whether the Muslim bans would keep terrorists out?
#+end_quote

Are you deliberately misunderstanding? Call it what it is: a travel ban. Yes, it specifies certain muslim majority countries. I use the term "on it's surface" to mean that the pretext is to keep out terrorists. That is to say, among the first-order effects of the travel ban is a small reduction in the probability of a terrorist attack. (A very small reduction indeed.) Not until you start digging for second and third-order effects do you start finding effects that go the other way (and again, there's no hard data here).

  I don't envy rational Republicans with a conscience who have to look at what [Trump]'s doing to the face of conservativism.
#+end_quote

I argue elsewhere in this thread that Trump is more of an independent candidate than Republican. It's a tragedy for the Republican party that he was their nominee. The biggest partisan action he's taken was to nominate Gorsuch to the court, and I think that more more a matter of the political necessity of keeping one of his main campaign promises than anything else. (Remember that a lot of Republicans held their nose and voted for him solely because of the supreme court vacancy.) Other than that (and some fights over cabinet positions), Trump has been doing his level best to anger and frustrate everybody.

I think I'll step over everything else, because it seems we've reached the heart of the matter:

  The USA is not the world police and should not want to be.
#+end_quote

It seems to me this is where left and right diverge on foreign policy. Conservatives claim that the US has moral superiority, and a responsibility to judge when foreign powers act in bad ways. i.e., the US is, and should be, the world's policeman. Yes, I know about the UN, and various coalitions of nations. I know it's complicated. It was much easier to justify during the soviet era, where there was a mindset of an "us against them" zero sum battle for the future of the world going on.

The fact is that most nations get along well enough. They have open and honest elections, don't imprison or kill their political dissidents, and don't launch missiles across their borders and into other countries. Even monarchy's and dictatorships are fine as long as they don't do the last two. But why do we tolerate the existence of a country like North Korea? From a rationalist perspective, this seems insane. Can one can read /Three Worlds Collide/ and not imagine North Korea as the baby killers? Is it really rational and moral to do nothing and let them continue on as they have?
