  so it's my job to find and verify proofs of any of your statement.
#+end_quote

I made an assertion. You denied the assertion without providing evidence. I then provided a source to back up my claim. You said the source was bad without providing a counter source.

You failed to support your argument and I supported mine. It's that simple. No "thank you" required.

  this discussion gave me a profound insight into quality of your argumentation. if at least a third of your other points is based on the same approach of establishing and dealing with facts, now i start to slightly understand Trump supporters.

From what I've seen of Trump supporters and how bad they are at supporting their arguments and dealing with facts they dislike, I'm guessing you understand them better than you think.

  just for your information. most of my colleagues have been working and dealing with security issues in MENA region. two of my friends once were kidnapped (one in Syria, second in Yemen). i used to live in MENA. i have been following Arabic press for the last 7 years.

Cool story. You're a random person on the internet and I have no reason to believe anything you say as accurate, instead of just what you believe or mistakenly remember or misunderstood.

  the statement about ISIS, starting in 1999, is bullshit.

Prove it.
