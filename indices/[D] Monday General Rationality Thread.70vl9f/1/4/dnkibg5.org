The reason the Democratic Party turnout in 2016 was so low was because they weren't different enough from the Republicans and the status quo.

Obviously, that may seem odd - why would anyone vote Republican just because the Democrats aren't different enough from them? It should be like guessing how many jelly beans are in a jar. If the Republicans guess 2,850 and it seems a little too far, then the Democrats can guess 2,849 and they'll be sure to win, right?

Except, elections aren't like that. Election day is not a national holiday. Some people have to choose between voting and paying their bills. For everyone who would otherwise have the day off, they still need to have enough motivation to go to the polls rather than do whatever it is they do to relax and have fun. If the Democrats hug themselves right up next to the Republicans, most people to the right still vote Republican, some moderates vote Democratic, and a ton of people to the left say "Fuck it" and don't make the effort to go and vote.

In 2008, 69 million people voted for Obama, and 60 million people voted for McCain. In 2016, 66 million people voted for Hillary, and 63 million people voted for Trump. Notice how the Democratic votes went down by 3 million while the Republican votes went up by the same amount between those two elections.

In both elections, Democrats got the votes of 90% of their registered voters, and Republicans got 89% of theirs. However, independents went 52-44 in favor of Obama in 2008, and then 48-42 in favor of Trump in 2016. Independents are obviously the ones shaking things up here, but what we do know about them?

When looking at political leaning instead of party affiliation, we see another story. Liberals voted 89-10 in favor of Obama in 2008, then 84-10 in favor of Clinton in 2016. Conservatives voted 78-20 in favor of McCain in 2008, then 81-15 in favor of Trump in 2012. Moderates voted 60-39 in favor of Obama in 2008, then 52-41 in favor of Clinton in 2016. Clinton lost 4% of her support with liberals, 8% with moderates and 5% with conservatives in comparison to Obama. Meanwhile, Trump succeeded by gaining 3% increased support from Conservatives and a 2% increase in support from moderates.

A few important points to note: while Hillary lost 8% of moderates, only 3% of them voted for Trump. Similarly, while Hillary lost 5% of conservative votes, Trump only gained 3% of them. Hillary even lost 4% of liberal votes, even though Trump gained 0% with them. All of those missing votes represent people who still voted, they just voted 3rd party rather than going for Hillary or Trump. That represents a significant bloc of voters across the political spectrum who were happy with what Obama offered but disappointed with Hillary. To recruit those voters, you'd need a message closer to Obama's. Not more of the same (e.g. bland continuation of the Clinton dynasty), but significant changes for the better.
