How does immigration fit into that strategy? It's easily the most divisive issue with the starkest contrast between either side's values. Most liberals I know see it as a economic issue and point to studies that say letting more immigrants in is better for everyone in America, but all the conservatives I've spoken to see it as a social issue and many are openly nativist. I'm not sure if you can pander to both at the same time.
