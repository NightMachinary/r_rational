That's a good idea that I'd be happy to see put into practice, but naturalization remains a deal breaker. Conservative voters absolutely oppose allowing undocumented immigrants to remain in this country regardless of the cost it would take to remove them.

Trump voters held rallies where they burned their MAGA hats after he announced he would sign a Dream Act into law. Studies have shown the rising popularity of fascist organizations in Europe correlates directly with the number of immigrants and refugees allowed into the country.

How do you pander to a voting bloc that specifically identifies as nativist and responds to suggestions that voting for such polices is against their self interest by voting for someone else? If there is a way to attract moderates on this issue, I'd like to hear it because I'm not even sure moderates exist.
