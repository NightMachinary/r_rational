#+begin_quote
  i did not put a label. i said that i perceive that such a way.
#+end_quote

You did not qualify all your statements as perceptions or feelings, you asserted many of them as straightforward judgements. Here you are telling someone else what they believe and how they think:

#+begin_quote
  binarity in your mindset is even more pervasive. you don't only divide people on democrats vs republicans or anti-islamists vs pro-islamists or good vs evil. you also divide all events and interactions in your life under the lens of Trump.
#+end_quote

If you're going to say it, at least own it. What you're doing now is what bullies do when they're called out on their behavior, which is ironic since you seem to be insisting that you're being bullied.

#+begin_quote
  and do you really believe that with continuing this sort of discussion you will change the way how i perceive that?
#+end_quote

My initial post was to point out how you came off in case you weren't aware of it. For you to then say this:

#+begin_quote
  no. obviously, you do not expect it.
#+end_quote

Is you again asserting what you believe I expect or don't expect. You do it again here:

#+begin_quote
  therefore, you want me, out of curtesy, to pretend that i don't feel that in such a way.
#+end_quote

Dude, I don't care what you pretend or don't pretend. I offered you an out in case you weren't aware of how antagonistic you were sounding and to clarify what you actually wanted to communicate. Believe it or not, some people actually say things that come off worse than they intended and appreciate that kind of gesture.

If you actually wanted to be insulting, by all means own it. Preferably not with the above qualification though, which you contradict in your other strong denouncements anyway.

#+begin_quote
  in the same time, you do not want to acknowledge my frustration.
#+end_quote

Your expression of your frustration was hypocritical. You don't get a free pass to insult others just because you're frustrated, and then expect everyone to bow down and ignore everything else you do.

#+begin_quote
  therefore, that looks like an attempt to discipline the witch.
#+end_quote

You were rude and antagonistic. I called you out and explained why. If you want to glorify that into a witch hunt, that's on you. I'm not interested in melodrama.

#+begin_quote
  more than that, your excessive reaction confirms my reservations.
#+end_quote

"Excessive reaction" here meaning "anyone who says things about me I don't like," apparently.

#+begin_quote
  it looks like the kind of you have a strong spirit of group solidarity. therefore, you must be even more dangerous than i had estimated.
#+end_quote

Yeah, I'm super dangerous, let me tell you: sometimes I tell people they're being shitty and they feel bad about themselves. I'm a regular WMD.

If you're up for actual conversation about your behavior, feel free to privately message me. I don't mean to make you feel like you're being persecuted or anything, but I'm not going to ignore people acting rudely either, and my perception of you at this moment is that you feel attacked without being willing to acknowledge that you attacked first. If you legitimately don't see how, we can talk it over.
