I did no such thing? I just pointed out that you were essentially shitting on his position and offering nothing of substance back. If you "just want to talk about Islam" then don't criticize people for a "false dilemma" without being willing to back up your accusation.

That's the point I was making: you started talking about Islam, he drew the argument toward the original point that Islam was brought up in, politics, and if you wanted to stay away from any political or real world outcomes from your discussion on Islam, that was your time to say "Well that's outside my area of expertise, I was just clarifying this one point on Islam."

If you don't want to talk about Trump, fine, don't do it. But your very labels here, "Trump obsessed people" and "feral fanatics" are insulting. You are placing these labels on others due to opinions they have that you then say you have no interest in engaging in. That's not respectful dialogue, regardless of what your personal experiences have been. You can't complain about being "dragged into Trump talks" when you place a judgement about someone's view on Trump, even at a meta level.
