The difference between the sides are that racists seek to optimize suppression of the Other by their own tribe, whereas liberals seeks to optimize integration of both tribes. Just because both can be equivalent in intelligence does not mean neither has a moral high ground.

Liberals can be racist too, I'm certainly an example, but at least they try to help people who've been victimized by unfair prejudice. Even if their methods don't always work, they're values align with mine while the other side's value actively oppose them.

I'd rather try to fight evil and fail than allow evil to act unopposed by me. Liberals can theoretically be educated on the mistakes they've made and change their behavior, people who don't care if they're racist do not want to change. Not taking a side in this conflict would do nothing to optimize my values.
