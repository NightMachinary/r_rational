I believe that the information you have been presented with has been misrepresented to you in order to promote a harmful political agenda. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/EnoughTrumpSpam/comments/4u4ld6/debunking_myths_about_islam/][This post compiles hard data from many independent sources in an effort to correct common misconceptions about Islam and the people who practice it]] and I hope you will take the opportunity to put your beliefs to the test of falsifiability rather than dismiss alternative hypotheses out of hand. I believed many of the things on this list before I read it and thought critically about how I arrived at those beliefs in the first place.
