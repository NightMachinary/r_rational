You ignored his questions. Saying that someone has a "binary mindset" is not actually proposing reasonable alternatives or actionable ideas. People can rarely be summed up into binaries, but plans of action can often be.

[[/u/trekie140]] wasn't asking for a psychoanalysis or your opinions about "the kind of people like" him. He described what he saw as a problem (bigotry expressed and acted upon by the US President and many of their followers) and asked what realistic alternative he has to supporting or wanting that president's impeachment.

Your answer was to say he was wrong in mindset, assert that you would feel threatened by him in person, and then compare him to fanatics that supported Hitler. Looking from the outside, I find your comment rather antagonistic and unproductive. If that wasn't your intention, maybe you should re-examine what you said and why.
