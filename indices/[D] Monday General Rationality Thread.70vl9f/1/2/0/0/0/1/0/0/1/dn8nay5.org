  The failure to address the abuse was attributed to a combination of factors revolving around race, class and gender---contemptuous and sexist attitudes toward the mostly working-class victims; fear that the perpetrators' ethnicity would trigger allegations of racism and damage community relations; the Labour council's reluctance to challenge a Labour-voting ethnic minority; lack of a child-centred focus; a desire to protect the town's reputation; and lack of training and resources.

  The government appointed Louise Casey to conduct an inspection of Rotherham Council. Published in January 2015, the Casey report concluded that the council had a bullying, sexist culture of covering up information and silencing whistleblowers, and was "not fit for purpose".

  The Pakistani community in Rotherham, and elsewhere in Britain, has not followed the usual immigrant narrative arc of intermarriage and integration. The custom of first-cousin marriages to spouses from back home in Pakistan meant that the patriarchal village mentality was continually refreshed.

  Britain's Pakistani community often seems frozen in time; it has progressed little and remains strikingly impoverished. The unemployment rate for the least educated young Muslims is close to 40 percent, and more than two-thirds of Pakistani households are below the poverty line.

  My early years in Luton were lived inside a Pakistani bubble. Everyone my family knew was Pakistani, and most of my fellow students at school were Pakistani. I can't recall a white person ever visiting our home.

  Rotherham has the third-most-segregated Muslim population in England: The majority of the Pakistani community, 82 percent, lives in just three of the town's council electoral wards. Voter turnout can be as low as 30 percent, so seats can be won or lost by a handful of votes --- a situation that easily leads to patronage and clientelism.

  If working-class British Pakistanis had been better represented in the groups that failed them --- the political class, the police, the media and the child protection agencies --- it is arguable that there would have been a less squeamish attitude toward the shibboleths of multiculturalism. British Pakistanis may be held back by racism and poverty, but by cleaving so firmly to outmoded prejudices and fearing so much of the mainstream culture that swirls around them, they segregate themselves.

It sounds like a situation analogous to how American city planners specifically planned where impoverished ghettos of minorities would live and designed public transportation infrastructure with racial discrimination in mind. The criminals are still at fault for their crimes and the police should be held responsible for their failures, but prejudices engrained into mainstream culture and public institutions is what allowed such a horrible tragedy to occur in the first place.

I think this situation is an example of how white liberals can /horrifically/ fail at combating prejudice and discrimination, but more due to ignorance about the minorities they seek to represent and the problems that plague them. I don't blame political correctness for the damage done here, I blame the /failed implementation of it/. I still think public institutions need to be proactive in their defense of minority and immigrant communities from irrational ideas and people, without falling victim to irrationality themselves.
