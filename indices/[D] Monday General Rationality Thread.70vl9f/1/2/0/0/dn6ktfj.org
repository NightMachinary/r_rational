Naturalize people who are already in the country, then enforce the borders, then implement a points-based system that allows legible public scrutiny of exactly how many people can come in, how, and why. Conservatives are already openly asking for a points-based system, and when liberals hear that it's "like Canada" and won't discriminate by nationality, they'll get on board too.

Liberals might claim that being from a Third World country makes it harder to get enough points, but just yell back at them that surely they don't think Third Worlders are /inferior/.
