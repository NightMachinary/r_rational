  Their job is not to get dedicated Democratic voters out, nor to get self-identified "centrists" to come out (those assholes came out in 2016 and it didn't fucking help)

[[https://ropercenter.cornell.edu/polls/us-elections/how-groups-voted/groups-voted-2016/][Did they though?]] 'Independents" by percentage beat the last few elections by a couple points. But "Moderates" (which is apparently supposed to be between liberal and conservative) had a slightly lower turnout in 2016. It looks like a wash to me.
