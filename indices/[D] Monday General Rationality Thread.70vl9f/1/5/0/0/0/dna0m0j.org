Exactly what other options do I have for impeaching a President who genuinely frightens me, an emotional response that I consider completely appropriate since I believe he is an authoritarian narcissist, than by backing the opposing party? I am convinced that any scenario in which Trump has this power is more likely to have horrific consequences than any scenario in which he does not have this power. I will take less bad over this bad. I wish I had better options, but I don't and taking no action will ensure an unfavorable outcome.
