  Hmmm. So, a large, corporate client can exert significant influence on the race with a large, early donation. I don't think this is a great thing.

It's not as bad as it sounds. While the ability to bring in cash is important, it's not a deciding factor. Mostly because voters aren't as stupid as we sometimes pretend they are. If campaign spending was that significant, Jeb Bush would currently be president. However, despite his early massive fundraising, he couldn't get his campaign off the ground (probably because his name was toxic to voters who would not have a third Bush in the White House).

The biggest effect of early cash outlays is to bring a candidate before the public eye in order to be judged by the public. It's like how advertising doesn't make you buy things, but presents you with the option so you can decide if you want to.

To summarize, there are detrimental effects of big money in politics, but it's not as bad as it sounds.

  And this is a terrible thing. Your electoral system is set up in such a way that deliberately increasing the odds of a poor choice winning will look like a good idea to voters at a certain stage of the process?

It's a very bad thing, but not usually a problem. Most voters understand that voting for the weakest candidates in this manner causes everyone to lose. Most people are content to stick with a party affiliation and vote for candidates they actually like or agree with. It just /feels/ better to vote for someone you like than to vote for someone you can't stand for strategic reasons, even if it's hard to explain the logic at the time. This phenomenon mostly becomes a problem when voters start feeling partisan urges that bring on irrational behavior. Let's just say that 2016 was a strange year.
