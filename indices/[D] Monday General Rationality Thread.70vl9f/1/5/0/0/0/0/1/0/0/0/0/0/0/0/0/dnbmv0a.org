#+begin_quote
  You probably have to be a registered member of a party to vote in the respective primary
#+end_quote

Generally, but not always. In some states, registered independents can vote in either (or both) primaries.

#+begin_quote
  Apparently this is deliberately made difficult
#+end_quote

Very easy, actually.

#+begin_quote
  I'm going to guess that it's neither easy nor usual to be a registered member of both parties
#+end_quote

Not generally, no. One party, max. Which isn't to say voting in both primaries is impossible...

#+begin_quote
  I'm going to go a step further and guess that party registration closes well before the list of potential candidates is made known
#+end_quote

Not at all. Registration often needs to happen about a month before the primary, which is well after candidates start their campaigns. In many cases, same-day registration is possible.

#+begin_quote
  These rule are inconsistent, confusing, and allow the party itself a far greater influence over the result than any individual voter
#+end_quote

The rules /are/ inconsistent and confusing. The Democrats use a system of super-delegates that explicitly gives the party office holders more control than individual voters, while the Republican party does not.

There are two other significant entwining factors that impact a candidates chances of winning: donations and polling. The more money they raise, the bigger a campaign they can run, and the more name recognition they'll receive, causing them to poll better. Similarly, polling well encourages supporters to donate to a successful candidate, increasing their odds of winning, while polling poorly discourages people from supporting a lost cause. All of which happens in the context of a broader political debate (and official televised debates).

An anecdote: I've spoken with many people (face-to-face) who bragged about registering as Republicans just so they could vote for Trump in the primaries. Not because they wanted him to win, but because they thought Clinton had the best chance against him.
