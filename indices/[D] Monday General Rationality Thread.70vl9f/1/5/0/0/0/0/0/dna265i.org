It is an option I consider extremely impractical. Even if I had the time or resources to set up such an organization, the history of third-parties in American politics is one that gives me no confidence in their ability to effect change on the scale I desire. The cost is too high and the likelihood of success is too low, so I consider partnering with the democrats to be a better choice. There are risks I would prefer to avoid, but their values match my own even when they fail to optimize them.
