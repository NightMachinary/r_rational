  "corporate clients have disproportionate influence on the American voting process"

  big spenders exert influence on elections
#+end_quote

If these two are not equivalent, could you point out the inequivalence? I'm not seeing it.

#+begin_quote
  "it's not that bad, they don't quite have total control"

  they don't have anything resembling control, because elections are not decided by money
#+end_quote

Well, I'd say that influence /is/ "something resembling control" - in that the limit at infinity of influence is control (and is effectively control at high-but-finite levels of influence). Apart from that point, though... again, I'm not sure we're saying anything different. If we are, could you please point out what it is?
