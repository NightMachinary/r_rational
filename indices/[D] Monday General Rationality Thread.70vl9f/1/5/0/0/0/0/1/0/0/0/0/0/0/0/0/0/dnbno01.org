  Very easy, actually.

Huh. Well, that's good.

  Not at all. Registration often needs to happen about a month before the primary, which is well after candidates start their campaigns. In many cases, same-day registration is possible.

This is good, too. That's a little better than I expected.

  There are two other significant entwining factors that impact a candidates chances of winning: donations and polling. The more money they raise, the bigger a campaign they can run, and the more name recognition they'll receive, causing them to poll better. Similarly, polling well encourages supporters to donate to a successful candidate, increasing their odds of winning, while polling poorly discourages people from supporting a lost cause. All of which happens in the context of a broader political debate (and official televised debates).

Hmmm. So, a large, corporate client can exert significant influence on the race with a large, early donation. I don't think this is a great thing.

  An anecdote: I've spoken with many people (face-to-face) who bragged about registering as Republicans just so they could vote for Trump in the primaries. Not because they wanted him to win, but because they thought Clinton had the best chance against him.

And this is a /terrible/ thing. Your electoral system is set up in such a way that deliberately increasing the odds of a poor choice winning will look like a good idea to voters at a certain stage of the process?
