  How about I just point out that any number when compared to infinity is essentially zero: money influences elections, but provides essentially no control whatsoever.

Ah, I think I've found our point of disagreement. You're saying that money has little to no control over the American election (and, presumably, that the election result is thus controlled mainly by the voters?)

My claim, on the other hand, is that money has /significant/ control over the American election (not total control, but significant control) and that the influence of the voters on the results has been carefully minimized, in large part by a series of political tricks, and in such a way as to magnify the influence of money on the results.
