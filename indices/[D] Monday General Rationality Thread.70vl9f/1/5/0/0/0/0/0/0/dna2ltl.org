You describe a set of excellent reasons why a third party won't help, which are unfortunately true for close on any American. This implies that it is probable that a third party will not happen until it becomes worth it /despite/ the points you raise.

This implies, long-term, that as long as the Republican and Democratic parties can continue to field candidates who are abhorrent to their opponent's base, the two parties will continue to stay in power, switching every election or two, regardless of actual skill in running the country.

This is a /very very bad thing/.
