Alright, so, from a very brief skim over the page and reading yor comment, I get the impression that:

- You probably have to be a registered member of a party to vote in the respective primary
- Apparently this is deliberately made difficult
- I'm going to guess that it's neither easy nor usual to be a registered member of both parties
- I'm going to go a step further and guess that party registration closes well before the list of potential candidates is made known
- These rule are inconsistent, confusing, and allow the party itself a far greater influence over the result than any individual voter

So, in other words, the only way that your average voter can make an informed non-binary choice for President, across all candidates and all parties, is if he is either a registered member of both parties or can see the future?
