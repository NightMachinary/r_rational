We might not be. But over-generalizations maybe clouding that matter. The fact is that campaign finance is complex. There are many rules and laws governing how money can be spent during elections.

How about I just point out that any number when compared to infinity is essentially zero: money influences elections, but provides essentially no control whatsoever.
