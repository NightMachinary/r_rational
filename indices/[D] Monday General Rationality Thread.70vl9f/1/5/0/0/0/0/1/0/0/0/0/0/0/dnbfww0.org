... [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_primary][it's complex.]] Very. The basic premise is that registered members of each party vote in primary elections to select that party's candidate. But it gets much more complex, especially when you consider what it takes to become a registered member of a party (same day registrations, anyone?). The rules for registered independent voters are also complicated. And none of these rules are consistent: not across parties, nor across state lines. Oh, and Iowa always votes first for some reason.
