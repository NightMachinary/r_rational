Heh. They're not secret.

The way I see it is, in order to get enough money to even run, candidates need corporate sponsors. And corporate sponsors only give money to candidates who promise them something nice in exchange. (Tax breaks or something). So that, by the time the voters have any say, the corporate clients have already won; /all/ the candidates have promised them their tax breaks or whatever.

I don't think the corporations care much beyond tax breaks and moneymaking opportunities.
