  This entirely ignores the mechanics of the political system

It probably does; I'm not American, I have only the vaguest idea of how American politics work. Does everyone get to vote in these 'Primaries' for all parties?

#+begin_quote
  Complaining that /Democrat voters/, who would never have voted for any of the Republican candidates in any case, didn't have a choice is nonsense. /American voters/ had choices, and they chose the (mostly) independent Trump.

...alright. In order to properly address this point, I am going to need more information.

How exactly do these primaries work?
