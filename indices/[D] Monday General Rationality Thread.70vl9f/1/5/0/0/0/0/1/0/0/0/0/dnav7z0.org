This entirely ignores the mechanics of the political system. There were far more than two choices. Or do you not remember the primaries at all? While the Democrats never offered up a real choice besides Clinton, the Republican field was packed, which is part of the reason Trump was able to dominate it. From tea-party favorites Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, to gadfly Ben Carson and establishment preference Jeb Bush, or even Carly Fiorina, there were a great many options for voters to choose from. This was not a binary choice in the slightest.

Complaining that /Democrat voters/, who would never have voted for any of the Republican candidates in any case, didn't have a choice is nonsense. /American voters/ had choices, and they chose the (mostly) independent Trump.
