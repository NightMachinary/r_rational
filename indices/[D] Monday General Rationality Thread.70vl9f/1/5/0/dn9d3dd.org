I want the Democrats to gain more leverage against Donald Trump because I am convinced that every day he wields the power he has he puts my country at more risk. I believe there are sufficient grounds to remove him from office, but the GOP will make no effort to obstruct the efforts of an authoritarian leader who panders to fascists and racists.
