As someone who is not in the US, i.e. taking an outsider view, I want neither the Democrats nor the Republicans to win. Seriously, I'm half convinced that the two parties are mostly just yelling at each other and providing interesting theatre for their voters while they quietly ensure that they and their families will remain wealthy for generations at a time.

Neither party is facing any serious threat of doing any worse than coming second. No other party is facing any serious chance of approaching their position. What incentive is there for any of them to put any actual effort into making the country better for the people in it?
