  I want the Democratic Party to take control

Try again. That's a means, not an end. Unless you're one of the party bosses, it's utterly ludicrous to state the ends of your desire to be one party or the other in control. You're much better off stating your preferred policy or political outcomes, and work backwards from there.

Consider how /Republicans/ feel right now: they have one of theirs in the Oval Office, and majorities in both chambers. Still, they can't repeal Obamacare, build a wall, or lower taxes. Cronyism and nepotism still reign in DC, the revolving door is alive and well, and the people writing the laws are still those with the most the gain. None of the stated policy objectives of the American right are coming to be. The strategy of "Let's put our people in power" doesn't actually achieve desirable outcomes unless done so with particular goals in mind.
