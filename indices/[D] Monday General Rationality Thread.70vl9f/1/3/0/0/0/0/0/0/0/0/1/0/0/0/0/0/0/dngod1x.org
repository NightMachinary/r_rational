  if this community is ok about naming others immoral evil ignorant whoever and gives priority to staying pleasant with each other only, it is a valuable lesson for me to learn.

No, the community as a whole is not. At least, I personally am not; I don't especially approve of trekie140 attitude about political issues, and have said so in the past. I certainly don't approve his general "otherification" of certain categories of people which he designates as "racist".

And yeah, I get that this attitude pissed you off, and that you are not okay with seeing a group of people be insulted, and that you think this is a "The gloves come off" situation.

The thing is, being abrasive never works. This isn't specific to this community, it's true everywhere: the metaphorical hand grenade /is/ usually better received when [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/02/23/in-favor-of-niceness-community-and-civilization/][delivered with respect and politeness]], /especially/ when you feel the other person doesn't deserve that politeness.

Like, even saying things like "I don't think your source is valid, do you have another?" leads to better productive discussion than "wikipedia is never a good source I'm so disappointed in you".

You don't have talk to people (or to me) if it's unpleasant and you don't think you're learning something, and you don't have to engage a community you don't like, but deleting your messages seems a bit... brash? Personally, I think it's better to have an archive of everything.
