Let's step through these, then.

Fast and Furious

- The executive acted in a way that hid information, and prevented congress from finding out what happened. Claiming executive privilege was exactly the wrong thing to do. Obstruction eroded public faith in the president, and made Americans feel less safe.

Libya

- It was exactly Obama's refusal to take the lead that led to the half-assed international response that we got. In the aftermath, this same attitude led to the Muslim Brotherhood taking power, leading to a more dangerous world. I know it's not fair to second guess a president from years later, but a certain amount of criticism is justified.

Benghazi

- Obama owns this mess. He may not have been personally making decisions that led to what happened, but it was his administration that screwed up, and he who denied all blame. He, and his administration, engaged in a deliberate campaign to deceive the public. The fact that he did not personally tell a provable falsehood does not excuse his deceptions. The fact that american citizens died demonstrates that the world had become less safe for Americans.

ISIS

- +Obama personally founded the Islamic State in Syria and the Levant+ wait, what? That's our standard now? Of course Obama wasn't responsible for ISIS. However, by leaving a power vacuum in Iraq, the expansion of the Islamic State was inevitable. And again, the administration's response to the rise of ISIS did nothing to help. This is another of those situations that is easy to second guess in hindsight; however, there were plenty of warnings in advance that abandoning our allies in Iraq would have disastrous consequences.

Iran

- Yes, the nuclear agreement. I understand that congress made the agreement possible, due to their feeling that something needed to be done, even if they couldn't reach a consensus as to what. But why, WHY let Iran continue developing a nuclear program? For what reason does this oil-rich nation need nuclear power?! This nation that is sitting a stones throw away from Israel, which they have vowed to wipe off the map? Of course they're abiding by the nuclear agreement! By following it, they'll have nuclear weapons in only a few years! (And money! We gave them money to fund their program, too!)

Iran

- Let me reiterate this one, because reasons. Chuck Schumer famously studied the agreement in detail, and concluded that he must vote against it. He then proceeded to convince the rest of the senate Democrats to vote in favor of it. What the hell?

As for Trump, I think we'll see his first test shortly, with North Korea. No matter what he does, I'm sure he'll attract criticism, much of it fair. However, I don't think ISIS propaganda is a fair criticism. We could discuss this point further, as it gets quite complicated. DACA: why do we have non-citizen soldiers? Again, there are points on either side and we could debate. As for classified information: screw Trump. Yeah, he deserves the criticism. However, while holding him accountable for his past actions, is it possible that a future change in behavior could restore our allies faith? That is, could the damage to US security be reversed? Or is Trump necessarily toxic?
