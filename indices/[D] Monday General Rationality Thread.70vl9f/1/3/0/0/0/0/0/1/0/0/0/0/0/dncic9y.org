  Let me be up front about the political opinion sources I consume: I do not watch FOX News any more than any other news channel. My primary source of political opinion has always been RCP.
#+end_quote

Fair enough. I will point out that RCP is still right leaning, but yeah, not nearly as much as FOX.

#+begin_quote
  That said, the narrative of Obama as leader with a passive foreign policy has the sound of truth. It certainly matches the rest of his presidency. The quiet voice and small stick policy, if you will.
#+end_quote

Oh, for sure: I was just saying that the implication that this makes America less safe is a conservative narrative, not something that should be taken for granted, which many people do.

#+begin_quote
  It's well documented... You cannot change the facts of this matter by wishful thinking.
#+end_quote

It is well documented by conservative news sites and media: there is no evidence, zero, that there was a deliberate attempt to mislead people or conceal the truth. If you have some feel free to link to it: I watched the same debate and speech you did, and it seemed perfectly clear to me what was said and what was meant.

#+begin_quote
  But the lies aside, we were discussing national security: protection for the Benghazi embassy was the responsibility of Secretary Clinton, and of the Obama administration. That they did not provide adequate security is self-evident. Questions of wrongdoing do not factor in: they did the wrong thing regardless.
#+end_quote

This is tautological, unless you are expecting a perfect record of security, which is realistically impossible. How much money should they have spent? How many men should they have posted? What was their margin of error? And how many other bases had the exact same security level and threat assessment but didn't get attacked? I'm not being pedantic, btw, I'm pointing out that for you to say "They got attacked, therefor they didn't do enough" is ignoring how allocation of resources works in any organization. It's impossible to defend against every attack. Shit happens. Again, /multiple Republican investigations/ revealed no wrong doing or laxness in duty. This was tragedy used as political theater, plain and simple.

#+begin_quote
  As you say, while the decision to end the war was Bush's, the details were up to Obama, and he should have renegotiated in the face of changing circumstances.
#+end_quote

Changing circumstances being what, exactly? Was there any increased instability in the region between Bush signing the agreement and Obama executing it? I'm legitimately asking, I looked and found nothing.

#+begin_quote
  I know there were political realities in Iraq that I am not qualified to understand, but he should have done something difficult instead of what was easy. Did he make sure that the new government had the tools and allies it needed to face an existential threat? Self-evidently, no.
#+end_quote

This is just another way of saying "Something bad happened so he didn't do enough." Politics fueled [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/js/the_bottom_line/][bottom line thinking]], in other words. Judgments of actions made before an outcome indicate some predictive power: judgments of actions based on an outcome have little, if any.

#+begin_quote
  Hence the use of sanctions rather than bombs.
#+end_quote

I don't think you fully appreciate the phrase "shove it." If other countries tried to sanction the US for developing nuclear power, the US would absolutely swing back at them economically. Iran can't do that, so it's okay to suppress their country's development because we're afraid they'll turn it into a bomb? Okay then make sure they don't make a bomb out of it... which is what we're doing.

#+begin_quote
  Are you joking? I can't tell. I think you are joking. Sometimes I really hate the impersonality of the internet.
#+end_quote

Only a little. The real answer is "why is it our business?" The USA is not the world police and should not want to be. Stopping nuclear proliferation, sure, maybe that's a justified reason to act, but stopping nuclear power development because of it is petty tyranny. Besides, you asked why Iran would want nuclear since they're oil rich... do you actually know if there's an answer to that question? How much time have you devoted to looking?

#+begin_quote
  Nuclear tech is nuclear tech. The same centrifuges can be used to enrich reactor grade material and weapons grade material.
#+end_quote

First off, I'm pretty sure part of the agreement includes redesigning reactors that CANNOT create weapon grade material. I think it was plutonium specifically and not uranium, but for uranium enrichment it takes a LONG time to reach weapon grade material, and there are signs ahead of time.

Second, even if that's not true, what, so we get to decide which countries join the nuclear age because they MIGHT use the centrifuges in a way that develops nukes? If the US is going to crown itself hegemon then we should hold a parade first so everyone knows exactly what we're doing and why... I get that our original topic of discussion was US security and not ethically consistent behavior though, so I'll drop that point and focus on the effectiveness of the deal.

#+begin_quote
  By surveillance technology only. Remote cameras and the like. Inspectors have no direct access to the facilities (if they demand access, Iran can delay up to 24 days; 14 days without escalation). What a joke!
#+end_quote

You say this like you're an expert on nuclear refinement programs, intelligence analysis, nuclear facility design, etc, etc. I'm not saying I am, or that you should trust anything a president and congress says is adequate, but I'm fairly confident that if this issue had not been as politicized, you would not be as incensed about it. It takes politics for people to get so confident in their own ability to assess something they know nothing about. (Apologies if you are actually a UN nuclear watchdog or similar in your day job)

#+begin_quote
  Yes, their money, originally. I know this. Let me introduce you to a concept called asset forfeiture. This is when you catch someone doing something bad with their money (like dealing drugs), so you take away the money. In Iran's case, funding terrorism.
#+end_quote

That's... not what happened. At all. Did you read the link? The previous government sent us the money for military hardware before he was ousted. The assets were frozen during the hostage crises. Asset forfeiture has nothing to do with what happened, nor does funding terrorism, and saying things like this is why I keep implying that you get your news from FOX. Maybe RCP is closer to it than I thought...

#+begin_quote
  These two articles seem to outline the situation fairly well... he comes out looking like the worst kind of dishonest politician.
#+end_quote

Right, that's what I saw: he voted against it but did not try to convince others to vote for it, which is what you originally said. You're basically saying he should have railed against his party rather than just vote his conscience. That doesn't strike me as a dishonest politician: quite the opposite could be said, actually. In fact, flipping it around in another direction, maybe he IS a dishonest politician in the other direction, and didn't actually think it was a bad outcome but said he did and voted against it without whipping against it because he wanted to be on the record as against it for political reasons (meaning to get more support from his voting base). I don't see how one judgement is more fair than another if one starts from a neutral position on the nuclear deal itself.

#+begin_quote
  If it seems like I'm beating the Iran drum here, I am... I don't think it's outrageous to say there is room for legitimate debate on this point.
#+end_quote

Sure, I don't mind the debate. I do mind the doom and gloom hyperbole from Republicans on the issue, particularly when the details they bring up which I /can/ verify are so often wrong or misleading or incomplete.

#+begin_quote
  Furthermore, HR 1191 is problematic for two reasons: 1) it unconstitutionally ceded the senate's treaty power, and 2) Obama didn't follow the terms of the law with regards to the JCPOA (he was required to give all relevant information and documents to congress but did not).
#+end_quote

1) There's plenty of debate on this too, and plenty of constitutional scholars who say it does not amount to a formal treaty, not the least of which of course being Obama himself. Again, not saying to trust his ethics or anything, but as a constitutional scholar he's someone who is highly aware of the grey zones and how much wriggle room there is: if he actually, definitively overstepped his bounds there is no reason to believe that Republicans would not have challenged it in court. They have not because it's not at all cut and dried.

2) Citation on this?

#+begin_quote
  A strong case could be made for treason by Obama for entering the US into the JCPOA and releasing funds to Iran, a terrorist state. This was an impeachable offense, and I consider it a tragedy that he will never face justice for it.
#+end_quote

Only strong in Republican echo chambers. Outside of it, reality, as they say, has a liberal bias :)

#+begin_quote
  This is rather silly. Whatever a person says or does, it can be spun into propaganda by their opponents.
#+end_quote

Sure, but true accusations make for better propaganda. One works for anyone with an internet connection.

#+begin_quote
  Here's an action that on it's surface protects the nation (by keeping terrorists out, presumably), and you've placed yourself in the unenviable position of claiming it harms the nation.
#+end_quote

Excuse you, "on its surface protects the nation?" Did you just beg the question of whether the Muslim bans would keep terrorists out? No sir, "presumably" my foot. That is a whooole separate argument that we can have if you want to, but since ZERO terrorists acting on US soil have come from any of the countries listed in the Muslim ban, this is a claim that needs a hell of a lot more evidence than I've seen any Republican provide to defend it (which is paltry little even if it wasn't such a high claim).

#+begin_quote
  He really is awful, isn't he? At least we have agreement on something.
#+end_quote

Indeed. I don't envy rational Republicans with a conscience who have to look at what he's doing to the face of conservativism.
