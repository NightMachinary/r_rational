  when you're unpleasant to someone, they become more defensive, more aggressive, and less rational; less likely to communicate clearly, less willing to consider your ideas, etc.

great, that you understand how this spiral of misunderstanding works. this is my first post here: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/70vl9f/d_monday_general_rationality_thread/dn8qrr1/]]. am i agressive? am i unpleasant? not neutral? i said that both parties are right, and warned about danger of zero-win approach.

*trekie140* replied with insults into someone i don't know. and no, even if he doesn't call /me/ an ignorant racist, it's still a highly toxic approach, which hinders discussion. and this is what i pointed here: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/70vl9f/d_monday_general_rationality_thread/dn9551x/]]

calling opponents, who even not present here to defend themselves, ignorant or racists or evil or having no moral ground is not ok. it is a disturbing and threatening sign of witchhunting and dehumanization. if the approach /others but us are immoral ignorant racists/ is not how binary mindset looks like in real life, i don't know whether such phenomenon exists at all.

if this community is ok about naming others immoral evil ignorant whoever and gives priority to staying pleasant with each other only, it is a valuable lesson for me to learn.

  You're not in a courtroom. You asked for a source, Daystar gave one, even though you didn't give any source for your own claim. He wasn't trying to prove beyond reasonable doubt that his thesis was true, he was exposing his opinion; maybe he wasn't exposing his opinion in the most neutral/objective/humble way, but again, neither were you.

"catching him in the act" doesn't imply i'm going to call the police or raise a shaming campaign. it's like seeing someone to put a hand into your purse. better to make a mental note that it might happen and keep a safe distance.

about not giving any source: what source should it be? the source about ISIS not created in 1999? or the source when ISIS was created? how can my source help if a person refuses to read even his own source? look. we didn't talk about the conflict of sources: his source says one date and mine says another. the problem is he provided no source. he didn't check what he sent. you didn't check what he sent. because if you have done that, you'd see that wikipedia provide no reference about this date.

and yes, i'm disappointed. we do not speak about what is facts at the moment, how to find better sources, how to optimize fact checking, what is the most common gaps in this kind of procedures. we do not speak about truth and how to find it. we waste time on talking how to sound nice and pleasant in the circumstances, already far from nice and pleasant: "Delivering a difficult message is like throwing a hand grenade. Coated with sugar, thrown hard or soft, a hand grenade is still going to do damage."

UPDATED: we got a conflict when the issue is not about something big like personal beliefs or faith or moral principles which can hardly be safely addressed. we have a situation when the request of fact checking and not calling others ignorant evil bastards led to discussion about manners. in real life, such incident implies an uninvited guest's interference into a private party. good that it's happened before emotional attachment to the community. i understood my mistake, and will not come back here, my messages and posts will be removed within the coming week.
