I will grant that a list of bullet points without any explanation barely qualifies as reasons. I do not mean, with these points, to say that Obama was responsible. He did not create any of these situations. Saying that no evidence of wrongdoing could be found misses the point entirely. It was the handling of each of these that was bad. Obama regularly showed poor judgement (according to those on the right) in how he approached and handled foreign powers, especially those that are antagonistic toward American interests. A president that bows to foreign dictators (as seen from very early days of his presidency) is someone who it would seem is putting the country at risk.

It is not outrageous to say that the world became more dangerous under Obama's time in office, though we could debate the particulars of the claim forever. The fact that it is possible to debate proves the point.

Now I ask in turn: how is Donald Trump's wielding of power putting the nation at risk? (Please do not take this question as rhetorical denial: I have no love of Trump, nor desire to defend the man. I just want to know that these criticisms are well-founded rather than knee-jerk reactions to a political loss.)
