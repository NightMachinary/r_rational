First off, I'd like to point out that the fact that we're having this conversation kind of undercuts your point. You didn't have this conversation with DaystarEld / others, and I don't think you'd have had this conversation with me if I'd started with calling you an idiot.

  second, it's water fast. "wikipedia is not a source and you're ignorant not to know that" has no double edge while "I don't think your source is valid, do you have another?" opens doors to "why not? why are you biased against wikipedia? because it doesn't support your point? why do you reject my source? ok, i have another source - link to any random website. what? you don't like that too?"
#+end_quote

Yeah, but those are all good questions. Just saying "you're ignorant" doesn't cut them out. If you have standards you'd like to apply for source-quoting, the reasonable thing to do is to explain what standards you want, and why you want them; which opens the door to the other person going "Hum, maybe you're right, maybe I should research it more", or "No, actually, this is a valid source, and here's why". Saying "you're ignorant" cuts both these options off.

Also, to repeat my earlier point, you're not always right. You're not Doctor House or Rick Sanchez. Sometimes you're wrong about stuff, and you don't realize it. Or you 50% right, or you're 80% right and the other people see the 20%. Real life is complicated, and you can't boil it down to "If you can't see the truth, you're not worth talking to".

  and this is what companies pay for to their employees in customer service. not for resolving issues but for imitation of sincere respect.

  five, abrasive language helps in screening middle class from labor.

  sweet manners were the main tool of elites to control and discipline its own members.

Seriously though, fuck that noise. You don't need to pretend to respect people if you actually respect people. Maybe you don't think respecting people is important because it's only a middle-to-upper-class thing, or maybe you think you can talk shit to people you don't know and it's not a lack of respect. Maybe you think people being annoyed that you talk shit to them or to people around them means they're snobbish and overly sensitive. Personally, I think you're just [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GIFT][doing the internet thing]] of "Well, there's no consequence for me, so I can just be an asshole to everyone and it's their problem if they take it personally".

  third, are you aware about the concept of speed dating?

Honestly, I think in that metaphor, you would be the guy who meets a girl, talks 20 seconds with her, then goes "Oh, you put make up / high heels? How shallow of you. So you're just doing what society expects of you to look good? I'm kind of disappointed in you. Oh, you're offended? Well, guess I don't need to talk to you any further, if you won't take criticism."

  that's why i have removed all my messages from here.
#+end_quote

Please don't. It's childish, it's useless. If you believe in "put the money where you mouth is", you shouldn't post messages just long enough to piss people off, then remove them so there's no archive and no "trace" you did something. You don't need to remove something unless you're ashamed of it.
