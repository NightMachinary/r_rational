The fact that you're accusing me of being the sectarian when you're refusing to provide any evidence for your argument is silly. You're insisting that God exists, and that I should trust your word for it, and I'm asking for proof, which you are refusing to provide.

If you don't know the difference between a verifiable claim like "ISIS didn't start in 1999" and an unverifiable claim like "God doesn't exist," we're just going to talk past each other. You can keep twisting my words all you want: I know what I said and I've pointed out the difference. Moving forward, your inability or unwillingness to acknowledge that is your problem.
