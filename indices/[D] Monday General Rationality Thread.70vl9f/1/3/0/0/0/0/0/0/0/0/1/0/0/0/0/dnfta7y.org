  are there any other system of knowledge sharing? do rules of internet discussion imply that a hyperlink must be an ultimate proof, regardless where it goes? and what sense to have this discussion in rationality thread if the sides refuse the right of the opponent to ask for fact checking?

I'm going to tell you the same thing I told DaystarEld: the thing about an online discussion is, it's like a real discussion, everyone makes up the rules. There's no winner, no loser, no "catching him in the act", no "opponent". Like, if you're in that mindset, the conversation is already too toxic and you should move on.

  however, this person makes no bones about correcting others. and if this person demands others to pass fact check procedures on his statement (confirming he didn't do that by himself in the beginning), that's an extreme example of disrespect to any opponent.

You're not in a courtroom. You asked for a source, Daystar gave one, even though you didn't give any source for your own claim. He wasn't trying to prove beyond reasonable doubt that his thesis was true, he was exposing his opinion; maybe he wasn't exposing his opinion in the most neutral/objective/humble way, but again, neither were you.

#+begin_quote
  honestly, i don't see how politeness/niceness/cheerfulness could have helped here, if one person has granted himself a privilege not to check statements, he sells here as proven facts.

Look, I've been there.

You understand something, other people don't, so you correct them, and then they just keep saying the same things you just corrected. I've been on that side of the fence. And in hindsight, I'll say it: I'm ashamed of past!me, because past!me was a fucking asshole.

When you say stuff like "Updated: Ops, I've just found that I'm the second person who found a false dilemma in your reasoning"; if you're right, you sound like a complete jerk; if you're wrong, you /are/ a complete jerk. And sometimes you're wrong. Sometimes you think someone is making a fallacious argument, but the truth is you don't understand what they said.

You don't insult people who disagree with you because sometimes you're really sure you're right and you're wrong anyway, and sometimes the people you insult are right.

Aside from that, when you're unpleasant to someone, they become more defensive, more aggressive, and less rational; less likely to communicate clearly, less willing to consider your ideas, etc. I know that from personal experience: people are more honest to honest discussion when you don't attack them; that includes passive-aggressive stuff, and clever remarks like "how look, binary opposition, I expected better from this subreddit".

tl;dr This attitude is super unpleasant and nonconstructive; cut it out.
