  The executive acted in a way that hid information, and prevented congress from finding out what happened. Claiming executive privilege was exactly the wrong thing to do. Obstruction eroded public faith in the president, and made Americans feel less safe.
#+end_quote

It was political theater. "Made (some) Americans feel less safe" is not what I'm interested in: I care about what /actually/ makes America less safe.

#+begin_quote
  It was exactly Obama's refusal to take the lead that led to the half-assed international response that we got. In the aftermath, this same attitude led to the Muslim Brotherhood taking power, leading to a more dangerous world. I know it's not fair to second guess a president from years later, but a certain amount of criticism is justified.
#+end_quote

This comes off as armchair generaling. Show me actual military commanders and strategists and geopolitical experts who believe this and I'll read their arguments: the idea that Obama "refused to take lead" is political talk that smacks of Republican propaganda, ready to demonize him no matter what he chose or how much or little he did.

#+begin_quote
  Obama owns this mess. He may not have been personally making decisions that led to what happened, but it was his administration that screwed up, and he who denied all blame. He, and his administration, engaged in a deliberate campaign to deceive the public.
#+end_quote

No, they didn't. There's no evidence of this whatsoever. That narrative was just the same old FOX News spin.

#+begin_quote
  The fact that american citizens died demonstrates that the world had become less safe for Americans.
#+end_quote

This is not just attempting to cherry pick, but even by its own metric is factually incorrect. More American citizens died to terrorists during Bush's term, even excluding 9/11, so the world was more safe for Americans under Obama.

#+begin_quote
  Of course Obama wasn't responsible for ISIS. However, by leaving a power vacuum in Iraq, the expansion of the Islamic State was inevitable. And again, the administration's response to the rise of ISIS did nothing to help. This is another of those situations that is easy to second guess in hindsight; however, there were plenty of warnings in advance that abandoning our allies in Iraq would have disastrous consequences.
#+end_quote

Maybe Bush shouldn't have signed that agreement then. If you want to blame Obama for not reneging on it or trying to negotiate a new timeline for troop withdrawal, you can also do the work of coming up with an answer to what he should have done instead. "Keep troops there for longer?" How much longer? "Until it's safe?" By whose measure? You can't agree that it's easy to second guess in hindsight and then proceed to unironically do so :P

#+begin_quote
  Yes, the nuclear agreement. I understand that congress made the agreement possible, due to their feeling that something needed to be done, even if they couldn't reach a consensus as to what. But why, WHY let Iran continue developing a nuclear program?
#+end_quote

Because they're a sovereign country and if any other country tried to dictate our use of nuclear power we would rightfully tell them to shove it?

#+begin_quote
  For what reason does this oil-rich nation need nuclear power?!
#+end_quote

Maybe they care about the environment :P

#+begin_quote
  This nation that is sitting a stones throw away from Israel, which they have vowed to wipe off the map?
#+end_quote

You know that nuclear power plants and nuclear bombs are two different things right?

#+begin_quote
  Of course they're abiding by the nuclear agreement! By following it, they'll have nuclear weapons in only a few years!
#+end_quote

...you do know what the agreement is, right? Or how it's being monitored to prevent nuclear weapon development?

#+begin_quote
  (And money! We gave them money to fund their program, too!)
#+end_quote

I hear conservative propaganda again :P Yes, money! Their money, which we froze after they paid it to the US for goods they never received, and far less of it than they were asking for. Also, all of this was decided by a completely separate negotiation and agreed upon by an arbitration court, apparently. [[http://fortune.com/2016/08/05/money-america-iran/][There's more you are apparently unaware of, feel free to brush up on the details here.]]

#+begin_quote
  Let me reiterate this one, because reasons. Chuck Schumer famously studied the agreement in detail, and concluded that he must vote against it. He then proceeded to convince the rest of the senate Democrats to vote in favor of it. What the hell?
#+end_quote

I can't find any sources on this one. Where do you read that he convinced other Dems to vote for it?

#+begin_quote
  However, I don't think ISIS propaganda is a fair criticism. We could discuss this point further, as it gets quite complicated.
#+end_quote

It's unarguable that ISIS has used it for their recruitment campaigns and propaganda. Whether it /works/ is up for debate, I don't know if there's any obtainable figures on recruitment numbers before and after, so I'm the least confident in this criticism of all of them, but I still think it's fair criticism.

#+begin_quote
  DACA: why do we have non-citizen soldiers? Again, there are points on either side and we could debate.
#+end_quote

Because they've lived in this country their whole lives, consider themselves Americans, speak the language, and want to become citizens? I mean if your suggestion is we should just give them citizenship as soon as they sign up I'm sure they'd be all for that.

#+begin_quote
  As for classified information: screw Trump. Yeah, he deserves the criticism. However, while holding him accountable for his past actions, is it possible that a future change in behavior could restore our allies faith? That is, could the damage to US security be reversed? Or is Trump necessarily toxic?
#+end_quote

I think it could probably be changed if his behavior changes, but at this point I think expecting that is excessively optimistic. He has had many attempted "pivots" toward being more presidential that have proven to be short lived and insincere. I don't expect anyone who takes their job seriously would trust him with intelligence if they don't have to.
