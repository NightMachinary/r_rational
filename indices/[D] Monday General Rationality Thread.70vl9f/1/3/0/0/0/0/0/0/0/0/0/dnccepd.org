...you know there are links there, right? Like yeah, sometimes the links are wrong or misrepresented, but your comment simply said "it's not true" and provided no source whatsoever. I think wikipedia is a fine starting place for such a low effort denial.

You can feel free to debunk the links on wikipedia, if you want. If not I don't really care how disappointed you are, as a prior I hold wikipedia as more reliable than a random person on the internet until proven otherwise, and I'm not going to waste time hunting down something more concrete if you can't even bother to provide any sources yourself.
