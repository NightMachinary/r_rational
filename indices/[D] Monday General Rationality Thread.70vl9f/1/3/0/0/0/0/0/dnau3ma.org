Well first off I thought you meant before he was elected, but if you're talking about things during his presidency, "Good reason" implied to me "legitimate reason," not just things that right wing news sources echoed as reasons. Feel free to ignore the rest of this if you just mean "things the average Republican thinks is bad and Obama's fault," but if not:

#+begin_quote
  Fast and Furious
#+end_quote

Started in 2006.

#+begin_quote
  Libya
#+end_quote

The UN chartered, NATO led coalition to enforce a no-fly zone that was called for by, among others, the Arab League, to stop Gaddafi from slaughtering civilians? I don't think any US president would have acted differently.

#+begin_quote
  Benghazi
#+end_quote

Tragedy that multiple Republican investigations found no wrongdoing in that was drummed up for the 2012 election (and of course 2016).

#+begin_quote
  ISIS
#+end_quote

Was in existence since 1999... I assume you mean their expansion into Iraq, which the US left by an agreement the Bush administration reached with Iraq's government?

#+begin_quote
  Iran
#+end_quote

I don't know what this means. The nuclear deal that by all measures has been effective and that even Trump acknowledged that Iran has been abiding by?
