  It was the handling of each of these that was bad.

Most were handled fine: not perfect, perhaps, but certainly not to the point that made America less safe. The vast majority of the people who say otherwise have a vested interest in saying otherwise, were criticizing him before he even did anything, or turn a blind eye to the exact same behavior being done by a different president.

Obama was not a perfect president, he made a lot of decisions I disagree with. But the majority of Republican perspective of him has been shaped by an unending stream of baseless accusations, exaggerations, or outright falsehoods.

  It is not outrageous to say that the world became more dangerous under Obama's time in office, though we could debate the particulars of the claim forever. The fact that it is possible to debate proves the point.

Everything is /possible/ to debate: that doesn't mean any two sides of any debate are equally true, or even that neither can be outrageous :P Rational beliefs are not based on what is /possible/ but what is /probable./

  Now I ask in turn: how is Donald Trump's wielding of power putting the nation at risk?

I can't speak for the person who you originally were responding to, but from my perspective at least, the attempted Muslim bans feed ISIS propaganda, the end of DACA would kick out tens of thousands of US soldiers who are enrolled on a path to citizenship through their military service, and his leaking of classified information and apparent inability to keep security matters secret has made foreign intelligence agencies stop trusting the US and want to stop sharing information altogether, because they are worried it will end up told to the president and he'll tweet about it or just randomly mention it in a news conference.
