Let me be up front about the political opinion sources I consume: I do not watch FOX News any more than any other news channel (a segment here and there, but not very often), as you seem to keep implying. And that attack is so 2010. (To be fully honest, at one job the television always seemed to be tuned to Fox. It was rather annoying. Glenn Beck always seemed to be on during my shift.) My primary source of political opinion has always been [[https://www.realclearpolitics.com][RCP]].

  I care about what actually makes America less safe.
#+end_quote

That's fair.

#+begin_quote
  This comes off as armchair generaling.
#+end_quote

It is. I don't have immediate access to the kind of sources you seem to demand, and I'd rather not become a proxy for others that are more informed on these matters. Please understand that I'm arguing purely from what I recall from having lived through the times in question. That said, the narrative of Obama as leader with a passive foreign policy has the sound of truth. It certainly matches the rest of his presidency. The quiet voice and small stick policy, if you will.

    Obama owns this mess
  #+end_quote

  No, they didn't. There's no evidence of this whatsoever.
#+end_quote

It's well documented. The administration straight up blamed a filmmaker. I was paying attention, and I saw the excuses unfold in real time! I recall seeing Mitt Romney debate the point with Obama, and Candy Crowley shooting him down. She'd been fed the transcript of Obama's speech made the day after, and lied to protect Obama. I recall watching news channels pore over that same speech the next day looking for what Candy saw. And it turned out that Obama did mention terrorism in the speech, in an entirely incidental manner. You cannot change the facts of this matter by wishful thinking.

But the lies aside, we were discussing national security: protection for the Benghazi embassy was the responsibility of Secretary Clinton, and of the Obama administration. That they did not provide adequate security is self-evident. Questions of wrongdoing do not factor in: they did the wrong thing regardless.

  Maybe Bush shouldn't have signed that agreement then.
#+end_quote

As you say, while the decision to end the war was Bush's, the details were up to Obama, and /he should have renegotiated in the face of changing circumstances/. I know there were political realities in Iraq that I am not qualified to understand, but he should have done something difficult instead of what was easy. Did he make sure that the new government had the tools and allies it needed to face an existential threat? Self-evidently, no. I cannot argue that he wielded power in such a way as to harm US interests as that he failed to use the power he had to protect US interests. It's a small distinction, but the former is treason while the latter is merely neglect.

  Because they're a sovereign country and if any other country tried to dictate our use of nuclear power we would rightfully tell them to shove it?
#+end_quote

Hence the use of sanctions rather than bombs.

#+begin_quote
  Maybe they care about the environment :P
#+end_quote

Are you joking? I can't tell. I think you are joking. Sometimes I really hate the impersonality of the internet.

#+begin_quote
  You know that nuclear power plants and nuclear bombs are two different things right?
#+end_quote

Nuclear tech is nuclear tech. The same centrifuges can be used to enrich reactor grade material and weapons grade material.

#+begin_quote
  how it's being monitored to prevent nuclear weapon development?
#+end_quote

By surveillance technology only. Remote cameras and the like. Inspectors have no direct access to the facilities (if they demand access, Iran can delay up to 24 days; 14 days without escalation). What a joke!

#+begin_quote
  Their money, which we froze
#+end_quote

Yes, their money, originally. I know this. Let me introduce you to a concept called asset forfeiture. This is when you catch someone doing something bad with their money (like dealing drugs), so you take away the money. In Iran's case, funding terrorism.

  Chuck Schumer
#+end_quote

[[http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/10/opinions/louis-schumer-iran-deal/index.html][These]] [[http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/schumer-holding-back-discussing-iran-nuclear-deal-article-1.2296909][two]] articles seem to outline the situation fairly well. I can't remember where I read the anecdotes I saw: various senate aides talking about how Schumer called their offices to explain his position and apologize rather than to gain support. His verifiable actions (cancelling public appearances) were those of a politician more concerned about re-election and political power than about outcome: he comes out looking like the worst kind of dishonest politician.

If it seems like I'm beating the Iran drum here, I am. This is the main positive action Obama took that harms US security. You may disagree. Quite a few senators did as well. A majority of senators agreed with me, some of them Democrats. I don't think it's outrageous to say there is room for legitimate debate on this point. Furthermore, [[https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/1191/text][HR 1191]] is problematic for two reasons: 1) it unconstitutionally ceded the senate's treaty power, and 2) Obama didn't follow the terms of the law with regards to the JCPOA (he was required to give all relevant information and documents to congress but did not). A strong case could be made for treason by Obama for entering the US into the JCPOA and releasing funds to Iran, a terrorist state. This was an impeachable offense, and I consider it a tragedy that he will never face justice for it. That he /felt/ it was "best" is not relevant. He lacked the authority.

  ISIS propaganda
#+end_quote

This is rather silly. Whatever a person says or does, it can be spun into propaganda by their opponents. As you say, whether it works is what matters. Lack of information, etc. Here's an action that on it's surface protects the nation (by keeping terrorists out, presumably), and you've placed yourself in the unenviable position of claiming it /harms/ the nation. I'll concede that it's possible that the action will prove to be harmful, but it is a weak position to take at this point.

#+begin_quote
  DACA
#+end_quote

I sympathize with the plight of /dreamers/. They are an excellent face for the argument of amnesty. I'm pretty sure the topic is covered in more depth elsewhere on this thread. Somewhere. Also, it doesn't even appear that Trump is serious about ending DACA, so the point may be moot anyways.

  "pivots"

He really is awful, isn't he? At least we have agreement on something.
