  however, Wikipedia is honest about itself as a source: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Academic_use]]

Yeah, but this is more of an internet debate, not an academic publication. Like, there are implicit norms and stuff; but ultimately, you're trying to cooperate to share information, not to prove your point to a courtroom.

  disappoint was understatement, actually this toxic mix of arrogance, indifference and gullibility drove me crazy. but you're right, let me remove that.

I'll be perfectly honest, I saw a lot of arrogance in what you said too. You didn't exactly contribute to the civility of this discussion.

As for gullibility... look, I don't know where you come from; what you know, what you've been through or how you did your research. But you can't just assume that everyone else on the internet is wrong and you just have to impose your opinions on them until they See The Light.

A discussion can't be constructive unless both people come at it in good faith, and with some humility; part of that is not act like you have the Ultimate Truth, and people only disagree with you because they lack your perspective.

I mean, you can do that, but what reliably happens is threads like this one where discussion becomes bitter and unproductive.
