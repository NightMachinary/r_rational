I hope you mean the US. Otherwise, you're a foreign actor trying to destabilize a world power. That's going to put us at odds.

You'll need to back that up. Republicans said similar things about Obama, and with good reason.

Again, back that up and prove you're not a party schill. Republicans said exactly the same thing about Obama for nearly his full time in office. (My personal view is that Obama only took one possibly impeachable action during his time in office, and even that is questionable.)

Also, your perception of the GOP appears to be more than a bit skewed. In what follows, when referring to "the GOP", I mean party leaders, office holders, and influential conservative think tanks. I am willing to grant this point as obvious to anyone with a brain: Trump panders to fascists and racists. However, the rest of the GOP does not (or at least makes an effort to not be seen to do so). This is distinct from saying that people of questionable morals agree with various policy proposals: one can desire a Wall for many reasons, only one of which is racism. As far as I can tell, most of the GOP loathes Trump and would replace him with Pence if they possibly could. The GOP does not want an authoritarian leader. More importantly, they don't want an embarrassing leader. And I believe if there are sufficient grounds to impeach Trump, the GOP will do so; maybe not easily, as doing so would inflict very real wounds on the party, but I think they will do so.

I sounds like your real goal is to live in a safer country. I can get behind a certain amount of obstructionism. The GOP was routinely lambasted in the media for being obstructionist during the Obama years (specifically 2011-2016), and with good reason. And in truth, the opposition party often earns the moniker. I agree that less powerful presidents would be good for the country. But I think it would be much more meaningful to discuss actual policy goals than obstructionism in general.

Congress should reign in the president, passing (or repealing) laws so as to reduce the powers of the executive. Wartime powers should be rescinded when we're not actually at war, and limited in scope when we are.

On the other hand, pushing for impeachment is likely to be costly, and unlikely to work.

What we should actually discuss is which policies are doing harm to national security, and what we can do about them in particular.
