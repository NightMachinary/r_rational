Ike Skelton didn't even vote for the ACA! He was on the list of seats the Democrats were trying to protect by not having vote for the ACA, and he still lost the seat. It wasn't a super unreasonable idea to think "if Skelton doesn't vote for the ACA, he will be around to vote on other things" given that the Dems had held onto the district for half a century. And like, yeah, given what we know now, sure, this ended up causing him to lose, but he was not one of the "guys the Democrats threw under the bus" cause he was one the ones the were trying to save.

Also, your general characterization of Democratic Party strategy is wrong.
