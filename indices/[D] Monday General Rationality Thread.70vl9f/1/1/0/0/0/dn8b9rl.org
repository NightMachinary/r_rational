  he was not one of the "guys the Democrats threw under the bus" cause he was one the ones the were trying to save.

Assuming that voters can't see through tactics of that sort is exactly the kind of cynical thinking that led to this situation in the first place. And no, they weren't trying to save him. They were trying to save the district. Or do you really think they wouldn't have replaced him with a more liberal democrat if they thought such a candidate would be able to hold the seat?

  Also, your general characterization of Democratic Party strategy is wrong.
#+end_quote

Yes, it's a general characterization, and quite wrong in the particulars. I know this. However, in the context of this discussion, where the question is whether to move left and shore up the bernie base, or move center to shore up the moderate base, "spot on" would be a more accurate term.

Look, governmental policy doesn't happen in a vacuum. A party, having chosen it's policy preferences, tries to convince its base, and the rest of the population that those preferences are the best ones. In the Obama period, the Democratic party had political capital to spare, and they spent it to push the country left on a number of social issues, with significant successes in healthcare and gay-rights (successes with climate-issues and trans-rights have been more limited). Pushing the policy preferences of the whole country has a cost, and Democrats burnt through a lot of political capital doing so, far more than they expected, and they didn't so much move the country as the party itself (being a significant fraction of the country.)
