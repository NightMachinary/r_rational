  This was a blue dog Democrat, the kind the Dems need a lot of to hold a majority in the House. But then, in 2010, The Tea Party came for him, and he was defeated.

Don't blame the Tea Party for these sorts of losses. These were the guys the Democrats threw under the bus in their rush to pass Obamacare and achieve other short-term gains. One might even make an argument that the party was actively purging itself of these moderate elements in order to push itself further to the left.
