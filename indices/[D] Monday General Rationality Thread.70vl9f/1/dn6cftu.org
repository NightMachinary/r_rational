In the US, I want the Democratic Party to take control of the House of Representatives in the midterm elections next year, but am unsure which strategy is more likely to work. They can either pander to the Bernie supporters with promises to do things the GOP will never accept compromise on, or pander to moderates in an effort to steal voters away from the Republican Party. I don't have any hard evidence as to which is more likely to work.
