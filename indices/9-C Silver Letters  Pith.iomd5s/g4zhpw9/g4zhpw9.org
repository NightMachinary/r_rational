Not a bad chapter, but definitely not my favorite chapter either. Some remarks:

- It feels kind of contrived that Lorne had the foresight and the time to put a tracker while he was choking Ana, but he couldn't simply stab her in the throat while he was at it. Like, okay, maybe he was really confident he'd kill her and so he took he time because he's sadistic. But then why bother with a tracker?

- The pace feels all over the place. This arc has two chapters and a half covering a period of 20 minutes, then half a chapter covering several weeks of time, and there's not much transition.

- On the second reading, I kind of get the point about ambition being like a high and that Ana is going through withdrawal, but on the first reading I was just kind of surprised how defeatist Ana was, considering she got out of tougher jams that this one. It felt like the group was completely resigned to their new status, even though they had a lot of possible solutions (eg going to a different city and stealing a body there, so that by the time Lorne catches up the tracker ping has expired).

I think maybe the second half would have been better served by playing on the format more. For instance Twilight did something kinda cool in the 2nd book, to communicate that the protagonist is depressed: it has 5-6 empty chapters in a row, representing the months that go by as Bella kind of goes through the motions and doesn't engage with the world around her.
