Let's assume I confirm this is a time traveler through various methods.

I'm still left dealing with a person of questionable motives. If I had the power to travel through time, I wouldn't use it to discourage myself from action, but rather manipulate events so my future goes better, which would be easy because I have all the resources associated with time travel. For this reason I have to assume one of three things is true:

1) This is a form of damage control. My future self has already changed something in the past that changes the course of history, and by doing this the damage can be mitigated.

2) Being told to give up on my dreams leads me on the path to acquire time-travel technology in the first place. If this is the case I would expect future me to be forthright about it.

3) This isn't actually a future version of me.

I can't imagine any reasonable version of myself acquiring time travel and then using my powers to prevent myself from obtaining time travel, unless the time travel is dangerous.

In any case, with time travel involved I can't make any reasonable plan of action without more information.
