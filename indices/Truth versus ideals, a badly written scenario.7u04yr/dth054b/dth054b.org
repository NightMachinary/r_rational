Well obviously I would kidnap and interrogate the individual because if they are actually future me (easily confirmable via checking if they share memories there should be no record of) then there's no possible scenario where they are acting the way that's described unless they are mentally compromised in some respect, whether insane or brainwashed.

Simply put they would clearly have to be from a different timeline so they can't think that making me change my actions is going to help /their/ timeline in any way. So if their goal is to join a timeline that they steer towards a better future then they wouldn't approach me the way they did.

If I actually had time travel tech I wouldn't condemn my dopple with living the same kind of life I would otherwise live. Instead i would use the time travel to accrue massive wealth and bring past me into the fold. Then I would do the standard time travel technique wherein I keep bringing tech into the past so that I can eventually have lots of people working on FAI who are all under my control (since only I have the tech) so I can focus on safety for however many decades I choose. Plus while I'm at it I would bring back anti-aging tech in a loop until I'm immortal and can more comfortably take my time with AGI.

Anyway if I find myself in this scenario I'm going to steal future me's time travel tech then kill them and hide the body since they are clearly compromised and can't be trusted. If they don't have time travel tech or the knowledge to make use of that then I suppose I wouldn't bother with killing them since I have no more power than I would otherwise have, so I just use them to accrue fame. If I can get time travel though then I utilize the previously mentioned time travel strats.
