I would interrogate this 'future self' and gather information about how the failure(s) occurred, the environment in which it (they) occurred, and attempt to deduce a better way of achieving my desired result. If the failures happen as predicted, that information can be verified and the psychological impact of failure minimized.

Failure isn't failure if you learn something from it.
