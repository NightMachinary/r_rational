  Having been drugged and interrogated while I was unconscious/amnesiac would still seem to have greater probably mass than meeting an actual time traveler, but that still brings the level of Significant Weirdness up to "somebody with at least Three-Letter Agency level of resources and competence has decided to interfere in my life, this way, personally"

I think the non time travel scenario is even more implausible than you give it credit for. Since while drugs that can prevent memory consolidation exist if you have no large gaps in your memory then you're assuming that any people involved have the ability to selectively erase memories and create fake memories. Which basically implies they are somehow maintaining a giant conspiracy to hide their advanced tech /at the very least/, plus the potential of that sort of tech is massive which raises more issues since the world has to still look the same as it currently does.
