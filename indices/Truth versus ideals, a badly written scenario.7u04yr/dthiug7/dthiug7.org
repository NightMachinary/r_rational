I would demand that my future self prove himself to really be my future self. Not by telling me a secret recognition code. But by giving me tons and tons of money. After all, if he is from the future, he should know the winning lottery numbers and have no problem making cash.

Then after I get the money, I cut off all contact and never speak to him again, because he is an obvious fraud. Any future self of mine would know that I have no goals in life that I'm working towards, and know that I know I'm headed for failure and misery, so what they just said made no sense whatsoever.
