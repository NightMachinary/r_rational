How the hell did my future self survive /my/ goals failing, is what I'd want to know. But leaving aside my instant snap conclusion that I'm not seeing a veridical base level reality, I'd expect my future self to be able to very rapidly walk me through what I was missing. There's nothing implausible about what my future self is saying. There's nobody on Earth who can pretend to be me, well enough to fool me, without /becoming/ me, even leaving aside all obvious recognition protocols. What in this scenario is supposed to be hard, aside from the base impossibility?
