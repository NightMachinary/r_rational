  but if you were to wake somebody up during the middle of the night, interrogate them whilst using these anti-memory consolidation drugs and then put them back to sleep, wouldn't they chock up the slight blip in their memory to simply a bad night's sleep?

In practice this doesn't work because if you're doing a thorough test that your dopple shares your memories then a short interrogation like that wouldn't be enough, plus you probably need much more extensive interactions in order for them to /perfectly/ copy your mannerisms so that your "dopple" doesn't seem off to you. Also it bears mentioning that the government involved would /also/ have to have cosmetic surgery tech far beyond anything publicly known to exist.

Plus there's the issue that under the effects of drugs which keep you from consolidating memories you're likely to be too out of it to actually be that useful as an interrogation subject, and remember there's no reason to think they could actually get you to tell them memories. After all they have no way of confirming that the things you say are legit and torture is famously unreliable in such scenarios. Remember even under hypnosis and drugs if people are lucid enough to give you information then they're lucid enough to be uncooperative.
