but if you were to wake somebody up during the middle of the night, interrogate them whilst using these anti-memory consolidation drugs and then put them back to sleep, wouldn't they chock up the slight blip in their memory to simply a bad night's sleep?

These drugs are probably a lot harder to use than that (since I haven't actually done the research), but why couldn't they be used to do what I described above?
