I already expect to fail my main goals (sample subset: estimated odds of cryonic revival: 4%), and thanks to major depression, I'm already describable as "miserable".

I'll be moderately curious whether this individual can pass the time-travel self-recognition protocol I came up with a while back, as doing so would jump the weirdness level from 'somebody found a body-double of me and is doing some extreme phishing' to 'somebody knows something I never wrote down or spoke the details of'. ... Having been drugged and interrogated while I was unconscious/amnesiac would still seem to have greater probably mass than meeting an actual time traveler, but that still brings the level of Significant Weirdness up to "somebody with at least Three-Letter Agency level of resources and competence has decided to interfere in my life, this way, personally", which starts implying that my best course of action could be to go camping at an undisclosed location for at least three months. (Screaming and flailing my arms as I run away being optional extras.)

I /might/ pause in my frenzied packing long enough to ask my doppel what their /positive/ suggested plans are, as opposed to the scenario's simple "stop doing what you're doing", but as I-the-poster lack any info on what the time-traveller would tell me-the-scenario-liver or what their actual motivations are, that's about as far as I can anticipate.
