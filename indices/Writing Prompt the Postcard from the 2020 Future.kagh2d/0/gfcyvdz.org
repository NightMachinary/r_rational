Dear self,

Check the news in Wuhan in January. Cybywy; you have time to do this right. Get the inlaws to get fiber, and when February comes, go out East with the baby and our wife, or you're not gonna have a minute of babysitting time for nine months.

Think about it: buy into Zoom, short the cruise lines, and remember that the market is pathologically insane so it's going to come right back after the crash.

Nothing you're currently planning to do to help any movement or organization worked out. Find other things to try.

We kept the exercise routine and diet up all year. I know you can do it, cause I already did.

Love, self.

Obviously I chose to write to myself with the best advice I could ever have gotten. Would it have worked? Yes. In February, I was looking at the oncoming COVID crisis and almost took it appropriately seriously, but didn't because I didn't want to believe how bad it was going to be. (My estimation was still short of what actually happened but not by much. I didn't have any actual reason not to expect it to happen. I just... couldn't believe it would happen.) If I'd had a note from the future? That'd tip me over.
