All of the following will be written in the code I use for quick & private me-to-me communication, for verification purposes.

Hello past me! It is present me. From the future!

The earlier, rocky, Beatles songs are actually much better than their later, more psychodelic ones. Listen to them, you'll see.

There will be a pandemic beginning in Wuhan China sometime January. Invest in Zoom, and Amazon. Encourage your parents & family to sell most other stocks, and do the fancy thing where you sell stocks now & buy them later (when the market is down) even though you don't own any stocks. idk, talk to the family broker. Stocks will only be down, like, for a very short while in February & March, then they'll shoot right back up again. Also suggested you start telling everyone you can about pandemics & how likely they are. This will surely increase your credibility among family and friends.

The pandemic will last about a year and 2-6 months. idk, it's still going on (knowledge from 12/12/2020). The vaccine is /just/ coming out (also may want to talk about how terribly slow the FDA is while discussing possible pandemics, made by Phizer, moderna, and AstroZeneca---so want to invest in them too if possible).

Also, stop being such a wimp. [name] /obviously/ likes you. Take her out to ice skating or whatever, since by the time things actually started moving there, the virus hit.

You place too much value on school, and not enough value on doing your own thing. Do your own thing more, and give homework the finger (or get a goddamn job and pay others to do it for you. This isn't rocket science). Textbooks are your friend.

The Bayesian Conspiracy is a fun podcast, and their Discord is super cool too.

Become a vegetarian. Animals have much more moral weight than you currently think.

Oh, and the other thing: by writing this, I am likely killing myself for you. Don't let me die in vain :). See you in a year! Byyyyyyeeeeee

Future you.
