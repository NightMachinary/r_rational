Dear Mom and Dad,

It's me from the future. (Code word from childhood, in case of emergencies) We look forward to seeing you in six months! Don't freak out and cancel your tickets when the growing concerns about the novel Coronavirus in Wuhan, China, breaks out of Quarantine and spreads across the globe. June is the quiet Golden Period of air travel with eerie empty airplanes. Here's how to stay safe. Surfaces aren't as terrifying as the news/social media will initially make it out to be. Instead, just follow these three rules:

1) Wear a mask, cloth is ok. Plastic face shields help too. 2) Stay six feet distant from strangers until you confirm their COVID-19 status. (You will know what this will mean soon enough.) 3) Exposure time matters. 15 minutes of shared air is dangerous. Ventilation helps. Being outdoors is best.

Mom --- you may be tempted to focus on real estate, but the market will be extremely volatile for the next year. Face-to-face will shut down in a global pandemic. Online delivery will boom. Buy Amazon and Zoom and Uber. Operation Warp Speed to develop a vaccine will help us reunite safely. Pfizer/BionTech(German Co) and Moderna) will lead the charge and are safe bets too.

Dad --- when everyone goes on lockdown, hang up your paintings outside the house and share your gallery on Facebook. They will finally start selling. Everyone will be just looking for a little bit of peace and beauty in 2020 and your landscapes and koi ponds are just the ticket.

Much love. Wish you were here.
