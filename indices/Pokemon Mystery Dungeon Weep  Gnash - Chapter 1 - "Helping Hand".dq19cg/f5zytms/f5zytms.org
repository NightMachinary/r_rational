Some guy turns blue. He doesn't want to be blue, so he goes and tries to be some other color. Even with the help of a new friend, he discovers that becoming not-blue is actually very difficult.

This fanfiction is meant to be rational. "Rational" is a loaded term that different people interpret differently, but most of what I mean by that is that this story will try to prioritize certain conventions that some other rational stories also use, and that I hope that people who like those stories will like it too.

Basic familiarity with the universe of the Pokemon Mystery Dungeon games is suggested but not required for reader enjoyment.

I hope to update on a weekly basis.

This story is dedicated to Eiffel 65.
