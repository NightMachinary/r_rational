The main difference is, Shiren is more challenging in general, harsher death penalties, and I think the story is looser (haven't played much PMD to compare it). You should start with "Mystery Dungeon: Shiren the Wanderer" for the DS, it's a remake of the SNES original which was the second game of the Mystery Dungeon series (and the first one featuring Shiren, the main character). The other one I've played is Shiren the Wanderer: The Tower of Fortune and the Dice of Fate, which only got localized to english in it's PSVita version, but I think it's not as good an introduction because of the day/night cycle mechanics introduced in it.
