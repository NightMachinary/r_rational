There are 2^{256} possible outputs from SHA256. There are 2^{8000000000} possible inputs that are exactly 1GB in length. That means that there are [[http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%282%5E8000000000%29%2F%282%5E256%29][1.77 x 10^{2408239888}]] inputs per output --- or, because we're trying to reverse the process, 1.77 x 10^{2408239888} outputs per input.

Your computer is infinite, so it can check all of them, so the question then becomes how many of these decompressed GB files match your validation attributes. My guess is that even with stringent checks on syntax, spacing, and metadata, there will be more than 2^{256} variations that would look valid on first glance, which means that it's likely you'll get more than one result in that pile of 1.77 x 10^{2408239888} results.

(Unless I'm horribly misunderstanding you, or my math is wrong, both of which are very possible.)
