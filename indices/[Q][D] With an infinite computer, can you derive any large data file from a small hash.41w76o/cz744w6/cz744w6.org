It's impossible because Kolmogorov copmlexity.

On the other hand your computer clearly isn't a Turing machine (it allows you to break halting problem by waiting for example 1 nanosecond and reseting it with the next combination if there's no output). For optimal performance install regular PC as a watchdog to do the resetting for you.

So who knows what's possible in this universe if basic mathemathical laws don't work :)
