You still need to get the information transferred somehow. You can get 256 bits with the hash, another couple dozen (?) with the exact size, and a more with the filetype. It's already compressed, so you can't save anything there, but you could get more out of the fact that it is English writing about physics (or whatever).

In short, no. But it is probably the best compression you can get, as you already have a bunch of the information without needing to pay for it.
