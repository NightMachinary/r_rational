Eh, everything is real. And nothing is. It's complicated. (The characters in that story are wrong, though, or rather insufficiently patternist. Most of humanity has not yet diverged; due to moral uncertainty, the only unambiguously moral choice is to turn the simulation off immediately. (And next time, don't fucking /change/ things - that's the one thing that makes it complicated.))
