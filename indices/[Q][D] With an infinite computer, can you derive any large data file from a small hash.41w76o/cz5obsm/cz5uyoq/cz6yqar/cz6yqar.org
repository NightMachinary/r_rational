It seems like, the larger the file is, the more likely it is that it should lead to significant compression.

1) On average, the size of a number's largest prime factor increases with the size of a number.

2) On average, prime numbers occur less frequently as we move from 2 to infinity - and therefore, the larger a prime number is, the more it's compressed by simply saying "the nth prime number".
