Now that I have read the responses, I agree with those who are saying that the number of results that seem like valid research, grammatically correct, and so on, would be too great to sort through by hand.

I think what threw my intuition off was realizing that there is a lot of specificity in language (or just about any other system of encoding useful information) which does increase the compression quite a bit beyond what a normal compression algorithm would be able to do. For example, the research being written in English words makes it compressible by a factor based on the difference between random assortments of characters and actual words. But it wouldn't be a big enough factor compared to the difference between 8 billion and 256 bits.
