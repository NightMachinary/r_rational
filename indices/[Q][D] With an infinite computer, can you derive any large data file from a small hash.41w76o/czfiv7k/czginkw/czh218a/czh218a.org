Yeah. I mean your intuition is right in most senses - this is not entirely dissimilar how real compression algorithms actually work - you just overestimated the /degree/ of compression possible.

(Or, perhaps the real flaw is that you maybe didn't fully realize that processing power is not really the limiting factor to compression, that all lossless compression has a strict upper bound, and that all lossy compression must get more lossy with scale)
