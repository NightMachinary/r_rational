Well, you can't really argue with the missing space between words, since then you would have to account for all [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram][N-grams]].

99.93% equates 10 Bits. I fear that thinking of clever rules may be counterproductive, as the time could be better spent memorizing words (one single 5 letter word is 13 bit of information).
