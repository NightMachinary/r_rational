Yea. There's some debate over how much control authors have (and/or /should/ have) over the canon of "their worlds", especially in regards to incorporating works by other authors.

But in this case, the characters, story, and general plot logic of Cursed Child are so horribly inconsistent (both with itself, and with the rest of the HP series), that I personally can't accept it as canonical and still enjoy the overall series, no matter what Rowling says.
