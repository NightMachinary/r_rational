I'm trying to make an exhaustive list of ways that someone pathologically afraid of death in the Harry Potter universe might seek their own immortality. Here's what I have so far:

Horcrux

Portrait

Ghost

Diary (traditional, nonenchanted)

Children

Sperm Bank/DNA preservation

Memories of living human beings

Preserved Pensieve memories

Personality overwrites

Clones

Historical impact

Monuments

Contributions to knowledge

Mentoring

Spiritual afterlife/heaven

Caches/time capsules

Time travel

Quantum Immortality

Alternate universes

Deadman's switch if certain unacceptable conditions are met

I'd like to imagine a Voldemort who sticks his fingers in as many pies as possible in order to maximize his impact on the world and make it impossible for himself to be eradicated. Imagine a version of Visser Three from r!Animorphs who's much more vulnerable and so unconcerned with value drift relative to the much more likely prospect of annihilation. Basically take Voldemort's sole defining character trait and turn it up to 11,000, then give him competent opponents and watch what happens. Imagine a Voldemort who murders infants to make redundant Horcruxes, then writes about it in his memoirs, and then goes and gets baptized by the Pope "just in case". The convergence of all these different strategies seems like it'd be really interesting to explore. Which combinations would be optimal? Which would have hidden drawbacks? What else could be added to this list?
