I feel like a large portion of your list would not be considered immortality by (canon or HPMOR) Voldemort. He is not interested in living forever through his legacy, he wants to live forever by not dying.

I would also not consider clones, quantum immortality and immortality by anthropic principle to be valid ways to preserve my identity, but that obviously depends on your definition of identity and we don't know enough about Voldemort to know what he would think on the topic.

Given that, and provided that getting the philosopher stone is not an option (if it is, that is obviously priority #1), I would start figuring out the exact details of (in this order) horcruxes, unicorn blood, /magical/ diaries, ghosts and paintings to see if any of them provide a useful method for life extension. In a pinch you could see if hacking a pensieve allows you to upload your entire consciousness (instead of just your memories), but even if that works it seems like a very limited existence.

A spiritual afterlife is an interesting one in canon HP (HPMOR Voldemort rejects it out of hand), but if it exists, it is not something that Voldemort will feel he has any control over. If everyone continues to exist after they die that's great, but that doesn't require any action on his part so it doesn't factor into his plans.
