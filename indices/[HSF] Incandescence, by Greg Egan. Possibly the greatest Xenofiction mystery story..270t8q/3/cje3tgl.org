Mystery story? the mystery was a really small part of what made me love the book. I read the whole thing with pen and paper at hand, and it taught me General Relativity better than any class I've ever taken.

Plus I'm a huge fan of stories about scientific discovery, like this and the Quicksilver trilogy.
