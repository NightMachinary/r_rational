  Utopia's don't lead to much warfare.

Need some logical backing for that assumption. Lots of people seem to like warfare, or at least organized conflict, and would be interested in it even as simply consensual sport. Utopia doesn't mean people are perfect, after all.

Why /global/ or /intergalactic/ utopia? That seems to be defining yourself out of interesting story elements. Even then, there could still be outsiders who need to be fought to defend this specific perfect society, or people defined out of it for whatever reason.

I'm a little tired of this idea that you can't have interesting conflict in a story with a "true" utopia -- that all conflict has to come from internal political and social friction for any "big" story. I'd love to see more attempts to have functional and "nice" societies in speculative and especially rational fiction.

Writers need to stop making society itself hold the idiot ball.
