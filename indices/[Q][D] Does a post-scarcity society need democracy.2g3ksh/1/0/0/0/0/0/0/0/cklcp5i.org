Thanks.

I think we have a different definition for utopia, I think I'm more absolutist/litteral/idealist on the use of the word, but to clarify exactly would need to go further than I have the motivation to.

  That is provably not possible without altering many, many people's ideals and goals

So you could also say "utopia cannot be reached while we still cling to these old ideals and goals".

While we may reject such an future (because it would be opposed to our current morals), well... we may be wrong. Future will be weird anyway. I mean, we have gay marriage... we have interracial marriage ! That's not something evident, when viewed from the past. If the religious nutjobs' society makes everyone happy, it's an utopia...

On the other hand, reasoning on general happiness leads most of the time to wireheading, ie getting a brain chip that rewards you all the time. Which is another can of worms.
