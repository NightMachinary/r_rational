Yeah, my bad, I was on my phone and couldn't go in depth. Still, "not a useful definition at all" is harsh, it's at least a guideline.

The point I wanted to make (or steal, actually) was, a lot of "utopia" seem good when you first learn about them, but when you think about actually living in them, it's boring... and not utopist. "No more work, everything at your hand, we'll sing psalms to the Lord all day" seems fine and one can't object against it, because these are things you would like or should like, but in reality you wouldn't want to live there after a while.

I don't want to live in a world where there are no stories left to tell or live, so any imaginary setting where you can't have stories is not a real utopia.

Anyway, it's late in here and I may not be expressing myself clearly in English, but if you're interested in the subject, you should find this post on lesswrong interesting :
