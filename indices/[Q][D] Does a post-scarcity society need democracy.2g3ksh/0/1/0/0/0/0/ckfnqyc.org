Yup. And even then, I think that the book was a little bit on the optimistic side of things. You look at a place like Reddit where the "downvote does not mean disagree" rule is basically ignored, and you can pretty clearly see how a reputation based system like that would have some serious and immediate problems, and act to squelch certain opinions. Or just look at the witch-hunts that happen almost daily all over the internet (and of course, before the internet as well).
