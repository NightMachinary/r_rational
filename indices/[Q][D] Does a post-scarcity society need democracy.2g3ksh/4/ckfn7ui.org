A) As [[/u/PeridexisErrant]] noted, you need to examine what function democracy is actually supposed to perform, and what function government is actually supposed to perform. Nastily clever hint: if your society has even-remotely Friendly AI, they ought to understand perfectly well what democracy is for.

B) Seen from a sufficiently advanced point-of-view, there is no such thing as /post/-scarcity. There is only "resources are replenished, recovered, or collected faster than the mortals can use them." Since mortals inevitably end up wasting more of whatever seems abundant, and since the phrase post-scarcity implies a value choice to keep the people small enough to live effectively nonscarce lifestyles rather than immediately growing everyone to the level of superbeing who would find resources scarce on a planetary scale, there will still be /some/ resource scarcity trade-offs and /some/ economy, but it might take place out of the view of your normal citizens.
