Democracy serves several functions.

1. Suppose your AIs are malevolent or actively hostile to society or a part of society. This is a very possible failure mode for any machine or biological creation. You need some clear and well defined mechanism to remove said AI that can't easily be subverted by whatever caused the malevolence in the AI. If they start ordering their mechas to shoot every third civilian in the streets there needs to be a way to stop them. If an enemy nation hacks them you need a way to stop them.

2. In the event of bad code in the AI you need a way to choose a better AI with better code. If the code has decided that writing fanfiction should be punishable by death there needs to be some mechanism for appeal.

You can just assume that nothing bad will ever happen to your post scarcity society but that's not a hugely realistic assumption.
