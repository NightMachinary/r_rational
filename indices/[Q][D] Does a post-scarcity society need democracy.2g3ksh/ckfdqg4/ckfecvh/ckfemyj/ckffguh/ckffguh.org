Sure. In /Down and Out/, pretty much all of the necessities of life (and most of the luxuries) are provided to you for free thanks to miraculous technological advancements. Instead, there's a reputation system called "Whuffie" which helps to regulate all of those things that can't be free for everyone, like who gets invited to a party, or who gets to use some bit of land somewhere. Think of it like reddit's karma system, but used through augmented reality and for nearly everything. If I hold the door open for you, you give me Whuffie, so (in theory) people who are good, nice, intelligent, etc. will have high Whuffie scores. Much of this system is subconscious, because everyone has brain implants.

The government just basically doesn't exist. Everything is done through decentralized networks, which includes Whuffie, so it's not like someone can apply power to the system. It's all ad-hoc and done on the fly, because they have the computing power to do it that way. Everything is done by mutual agreement, and usually on a small scale.

If anyone else is interested, you can get it for free (sans DRM) [[http://craphound.com/down/download.php][here]]. You can also read the short story [[http://www.salon.com/2003/08/26/truncat/][/Truncat/ here]], which takes place in the same universe.

Edit: I should note that on Reddit, karma is primarily used for visibility - there are relatively few permissions that you gain as your karma goes up, and since the karma totals for the users aren't displayed in the comments (or by the link submissions), most people won't know whether the person they're talking to has 3K karma or 150K karma. A better reputation system comparison would probably be StackExchange or Slashdot, which have more involved karma systems, more prominently displayed user karma, and greater permissions as you move up the ladder (though in those systems the ladder is set by the admins rather than flowing naturally from the other users, which is what Whuffie purports to do).
