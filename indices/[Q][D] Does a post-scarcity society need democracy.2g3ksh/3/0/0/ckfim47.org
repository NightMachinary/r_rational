This is the sort of regulation that the EU has for products. Anything containing certain chemicals has to supply a massive dossier of info containing tests, simulations, field runs, characterizations which ECHA and countries check over. If they miss a bit of data then skilled scientists from countries and other businesses can rip their reports apart in the public commenting phase. I've read some hilariously passive aggressive comments when they are commenting. Once they get past that skilled scientists dissect every bit of the report and decide if the chemical can be sold in the public.

I'd imagine that would be closer to the norm for AIs- you have in depth regulations about what they have to be like and how they have to be written which vary from purpose to purpose, vary according to what modules you include in them, standard code blocks that all have to have, standard code blocks that anyone can include without comment.

It would take too long if every bullet fired, every chemical submitted required in depth approval. You'd probably have regional or local governments which did a general approval on certain things, with humans being responsible for good management of these things within well defined categories, but a great deal of autonomy for how the AIs are used within those boundaries.
