First, we should note that post scarcity society is a merely economic state, but I'll consider a utopian example in the spirit of the post. Imagine an ideal government, constructed and maintained with superhuman care, dedicated to enabling or promoting (depending on philosophy) human flourishing. Clearly it must not require the input of anyone disinterested - but equally for those who /do/ care, there must be meaningful involvement. There are many forms that could take, from general debate and universal consensus, to a system like the parliamentary democracy I'm familiar with - with impartial advice and a flawless anticorruption watchdog. Or maybe a system like the benevolent quasi-dictatorship of /To The Stars/, where AIs and gestalt-consciousness committees call the shots.

Need democracy? Of course not, post scarcity societies can work around that kind of thing. Should have democracy? An entirely different question. Is the question the same as "does democracy lead to more human flourishing?" Either way, why?

Part of the fun is to examine what democracy /is/, in a way that lets us work out what defines it and about it we find valuable - and whether, in some circumstances, we might want to replace it with something else. I know that and why I would want a democracy in such a future - do you?

And by the same token - what level and kind of cognitive enhancement sets someone apart from humanity? What does it mean to be mortal if you have backups? So many interesting questions, and answers waiting to be found!
