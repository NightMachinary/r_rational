  It's not a real utopia if you don't actually want to live in it

No, that is not a useful definition of a utopia at all.

Do you actually think everyone on the planet has to want to live in a society for it to be called a utopia? Do you think you and radical religious nuts would want the same "perfect" society? There are obviously flavors to the idea of a perfect or near-perfect society, which is part of what makes the subject deeply interesting.

I was talking here specifically about a high level of competency of a social order, and how that seems to be lacking from a lot of sci-fi and speculative fiction. That does not preclude war, but it does mean the war has to be proven necessary and part of the optimal social order.
