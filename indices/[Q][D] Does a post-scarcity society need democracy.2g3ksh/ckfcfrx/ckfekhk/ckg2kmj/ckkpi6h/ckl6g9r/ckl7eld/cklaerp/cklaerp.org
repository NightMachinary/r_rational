No, I think your English is fine. And I am harsh. That was a correct label for my response, I think.

It is your logical leaps between your preferences and what could or could not be called a utopia that bothers me. It was on the edge of a very odd "no true Scotsman" combined with a reversed [[http://i.imgur.com/oRtej.jpg][Groucho Marx joke]]. Your extended response here is very interesting, however.

Do you see how your dissatisfaction, */in itself/*, is the seed of interesting stories to be told about utopias? Utopias are not usefully defined by making all of their possible members completely happy. That is provably not possible without altering many, many people's ideals and goals. A much more useful definition is a society that is /as perfect as possible/ and doesn't do blatantly less than the best good it is capable of.

I disagreed about war not being a feature of a utopian society because there would be people like you, but perhaps less balanced, who would find something to contest, some other society to poke with a stick, some aliens to shoot at, some internal status to be gained in a side-band social order bar fight.

It is your very disquiet with the idea of many peaceful utopian orders that proves utopias are a great place to set stories. A society can do nothing wrong, oppress none of their members, and still fail some people -- especially if it is a very "nice" utopia which refuses to alter people against their will using direct physical methods.
