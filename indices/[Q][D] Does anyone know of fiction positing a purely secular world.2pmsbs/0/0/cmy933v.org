It was an interesting movie, probably under-appreciated, but I feel like the sudden shift in attention to the "Creating a religion" aspect of it was a waste of a really cool idea. Especially when the protagonist used his skill to do better at his job, by creating fake stories from history. It felt nice and rational, like he was really being creative with his ability.
