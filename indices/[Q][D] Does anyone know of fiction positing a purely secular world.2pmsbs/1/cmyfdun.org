JRR Tolkien's Hobbit and Lord of the Rings are almost completely devoid of overt religion. People engage in ritual behaviours, and there are clear supernatural events going on, however there seem to be no characters with the social role of priests (except /maybe/ the Wizards to some extent), and commonplace religious activity like praying and worshipping, wearing religious symbols, making reference to divine entities etc is absent from the story.

I'm aware that the Silmarillion and other works expand on the Middle Earth pantheon, however in the two major books, the world might as well be completely secular.
