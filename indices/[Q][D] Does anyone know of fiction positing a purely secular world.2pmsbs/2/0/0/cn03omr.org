Hard, but not impossible. The Bayesian Conspiracy of EY's is quite obviously religious-like, but equally obviously non-religious. If someone were to make a novel with a similar premise I could call it focusing on the lack of religion.

Another scenario would be sci-fi forensic anthropologists examining extinct religions in the context of their own (secular) world. If you're willing to stretch the definition of "secular" than it could also be fantasy anthropologists comparing our current religions (that don't work) to their own rigorously tested religion-like systems.

There's also a lot of room for dystopias. Simply make everyone part of one specific cult or ideology and have typical religions expressly banned.
