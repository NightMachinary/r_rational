Is it religious to obey the commandments of obviously superior beings who regularly and provably walk among people, influencing daily events directly? Does worshiping processes and ideals, such as money, honor, or freedom count? What does "world" mean? Earth? Is this no mentions of religion occurring at all?

Lots of wiggle room here.

Most sci-fi books (especially the "hard" ones, and many from the golden age) feature purely secular worlds, as their writers were much more likely to be interested in the secular aspects of society than +boring+ other genre fiction writers usually are. Gods and religion are usually not mentioned in short stories about a first FTL journey, for example. That's where I'd look for discussions of pure secular societies, though a lot of fantasy counts in a looser sense.
