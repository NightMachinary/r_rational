Aside from "lots of science fiction" - go read /The Dispossessed/, it sounds like you'd be interested - not many spring to mind.

I guess the catch is that it takes quite deep worldbuilding to noticeably leave our religion without feeling forced so either it's just not mentioned because it's not relevant anymore, or assumed to be 'like reality unless noted'
