No. My response is "rigorously applied common sense" and "human nature". Basically, if you spend enough time doing the same activities or hanging around the same people, eventually your brain will become habituated to them and you will get bored and want to try something new and meet new people.

Also, people change over time. There's value drift, people's interests change, and what they need from relationships changes over time too. Fall in love with someone at year 1, year 5000 they're a totally different person and you're a totally different person, and the feelings have faded away. Experience brings people together and it can also bring them apart. Almost no one stays with their highschool sweetheart for very long at all after getting out of high school.

Probably the reason most people don't understand all this is because they can't imagine life trajectories that last thousands or millions of years or more, nor can they imagine how the dating/relationship markets will be impacted by astronomically large transhumanist population size.

Thing is, humans are more compatible with more people than they typically realize. Statistically speaking, if the chances of finding a compatible romantic partner were 1/(Total Human Population), then there would be basically zero chance of anyone ever finding a compatible romantic partner. It would be like looking for a yellow needle in a haystack. Maybe worse. So barring divine intervention, people have to have a lot more than just one potential partner out there.

In the distant post-scarcity transhumanist future, the human population would be a LOT bigger, which means there would be LOT more available romantic partners. One would probably have compatibility with many more potential partners than one could have romantic relationships with at a time.

Bottom line is, forever is a REALLY long time, and a lot can change in a billion years. You might think you've found your one true love that will last for all time. More than likely you will break up after your first millenium, and possibly even sooner than that. I'm quite certain that's what all the sensible dating experts will say within a few million years if humanity survives this century. And then I am going to tell everyone "I told you so."
