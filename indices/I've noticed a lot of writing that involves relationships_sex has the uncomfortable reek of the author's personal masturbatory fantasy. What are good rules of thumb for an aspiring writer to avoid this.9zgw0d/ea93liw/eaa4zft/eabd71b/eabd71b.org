Again not sure if that's really possible to do consistently. I mean it's one thing to try to dodge the bullet entirely and avoid the topic but it's not really a question of execution. There isn't anything more absurd happening than say a genius detective getting stranded in an isolated location where a murder happens. It's just that sex and romance are divisive.

You can put a lot of effort into making your vampire romance novel show realistic human depth but people are still going to call you out on writing vampire romance because it's seen as sleazy and what makes it sleazy seems more about fashion than anything. So for example the most vanilla of vanilla romcoms "Love Actually" gets a similarly bad rap these days for all the unremarkable tropes that have become hot button social issues since it was first released. I also remember when harem anime first became a thing it was mostly slapstick comedy: love interest #1 walks in on love interest #2 and the protagonist in a compromising position -> protagonist gets slapped into the next room where love interest #3 is undressing-> continue until commercial break. Not exactly high brow but it seems to have become viewed as even less savory somehow.

So even if your careful to try to avoid cringe as much as possible by navigating all the pitfalls of what your audience considers over the line there not much you can do in terms of future proofing. (I'm oh so eagerly anticipating the day when the Attack on Titan fanbase realises that the giant naked women crushing tiny people in their beloved series are not entirely...I want to say innocent but then again murder).

So the only real option seems to bite the bullet and actually present what you think ought to happen in the story you're writing and accept you won't please everybody.
