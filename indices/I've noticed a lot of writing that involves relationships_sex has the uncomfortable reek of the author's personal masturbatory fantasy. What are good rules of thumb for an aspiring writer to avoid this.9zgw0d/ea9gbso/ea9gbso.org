IMO a couple of things can help avoid this:

1. Avoid making the MC a thinly-veiled Self-Insert of yourself. Either make them an actual self-insert or make them their own character. Give them a disposition, upbringing, and backstory different from your own which results in them naturally reacting differently than you would to many given situations.

2. Don't have 90% of the opposite gender characters in the story be attracted to your protagonist. This is unrealistic not only for the obvious reasons but also because in real life more than half of the people I know are already in relationships. When the group consists of the main character, one token male character who acts as comic relief, and multiple women who are both single and attracted to the main character I just roll my eyes.

3. Have characters other than the MC be in relationships. "Beta couples" can help you avoid number 2.
