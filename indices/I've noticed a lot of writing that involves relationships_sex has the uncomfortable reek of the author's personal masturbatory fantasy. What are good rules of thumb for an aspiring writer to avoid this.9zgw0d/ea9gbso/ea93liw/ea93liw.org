I don't understand. Someone is writing a thing. You're asking for advice on how not to write the thing? Write...something else you enjoy?

Seriously you're not going to escape the accusation of self-indulgence no matter what. Peoples turn-offs are arbitrary and so specific that anything you make will set off someone's warning bells about how you're crafting a contrived scenario to satisfy your preconceptions about reality. They'll probably be right about that.

You can write things to be maximally painful for the audience in which case I will just accuse you of being a try hard instead.
