Well, depends...? Which part is the issue that you have? Is it the masturbatory feel? Cuz if it's that, just make sure both people are, well... people. Write from both perspectives, and make sure they're not identical (people will like different things).

IANAW, but, seems to me like it'd be just like with writing anything else; make sure your characters are fully fledged from the big-picture goals alll the way down to the little quirks, and make those come across.

Make sure that it's a fantasy from /all/ perspectives, not just the protagonists'.
