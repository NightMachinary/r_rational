Problem with masturbatory fantasies is lack of psychological and social realism. If all characters involved have lives and roles in the story outside of their relationship, then their interactions become more meaningful and less cringey. That being said, one should not describe the act itself in any more detail than is warranted by plot and chatacter development. Otherwise it's just gratuitous and grafted on.

Characters should be their own people with roles in the plot outside of their relationships to other characters.

My general rule of thumb is that no relationship can last forever. Even the strongest most loving relationships will probably start to fade after a few thousand years, if given the chance to play out for that long. If you plan for your lead character's romantic interest to break up with them eventually it is easier to flesh them out.
