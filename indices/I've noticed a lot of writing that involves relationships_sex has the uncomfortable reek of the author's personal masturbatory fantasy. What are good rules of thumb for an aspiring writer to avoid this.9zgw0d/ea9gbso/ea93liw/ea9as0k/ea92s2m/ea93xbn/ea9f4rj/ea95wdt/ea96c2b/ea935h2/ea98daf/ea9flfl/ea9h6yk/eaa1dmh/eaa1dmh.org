I believe it's a direct reference to martial god asura, which I haven't read.

That said there's some cases where cultivation methods depend on dual cultivation (sex). It's not too far of a stretch to imagine how one might utilize this if your opponent has a special quality body or bloodline that helps.

Regardless everyone in these stories would probably be considered psychopaths or sociopaths by modern standards so it probably doesn't matter.
