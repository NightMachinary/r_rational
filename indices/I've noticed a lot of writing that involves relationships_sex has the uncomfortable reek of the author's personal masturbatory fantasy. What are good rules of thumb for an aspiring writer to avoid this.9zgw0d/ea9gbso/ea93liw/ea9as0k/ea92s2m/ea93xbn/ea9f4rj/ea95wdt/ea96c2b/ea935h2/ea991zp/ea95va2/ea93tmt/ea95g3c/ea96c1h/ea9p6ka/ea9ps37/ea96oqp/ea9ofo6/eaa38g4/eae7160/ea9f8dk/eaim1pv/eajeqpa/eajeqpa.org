If you think it's hot, save it for your private stash. Doesn't matter if it's for totally innocent reasons or whatever.

A rule of thumb is that a character's sexual side should be implied, or hinted at, and otherwise left out of the story & up to the readers' imaginations.

Unless you're writing porn in which case it should be used to tease and back off, tease and back off, until the climax of the story.
