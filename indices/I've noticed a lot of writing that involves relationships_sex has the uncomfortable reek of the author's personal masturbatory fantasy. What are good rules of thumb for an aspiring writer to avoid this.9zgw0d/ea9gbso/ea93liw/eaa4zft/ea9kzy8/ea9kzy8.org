People are oddly entitled these days and quite performative about it on social media.

In our western societies even the poor have access to a dizzying amount of instant gratification. I think it fosters narcissism and the expectation that everything consumable is created just for them.

People would probably be a lot better off if they followed the advice of Epictetus, /"Men are disturbed not by things, but by the view which they take of them."/
