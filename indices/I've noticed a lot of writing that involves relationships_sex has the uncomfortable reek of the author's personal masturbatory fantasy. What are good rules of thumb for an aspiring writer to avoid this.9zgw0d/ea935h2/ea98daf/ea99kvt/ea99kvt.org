What do you mean by no mention of women?

#+begin_quote
  could have literally any woman in the world, turns them down due to high standards

  either gets one brilliant waifu he never leaves, or all of them

  rape is a battle tactic

One thing I do note from what stories I have read: In some Japanese stories the women are more fleshed out and interesting than the MC. In the Chinese works I have read, the male main character is always the most fleshed out and interesting being, with the women being typically relegated to being trophies or goals they have to work for.
