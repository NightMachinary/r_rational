  Xianxia/Wuxia, where rape is a legitimate battle tactic
#+end_quote

Is this an exaggeration, perhaps? I haven't met any xianxia so far in which rape would've been a /battle tactic/. Granted, there are several hentai anime series that have this trope, and I try to screen the xianxia titles before reading them, but still.
