The bird wasn't the protagonist though. It was still done in bad taste, but it felt more like a combination of [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfPower][Artifact Of Power]] x [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComedicReliefCharacters][Comedic Relief]], coupled with the author's poor brand of [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VulgarHumor][Vulgar Humor.]]

Also, since no women were targeted by that plot device, I'd argue that it wasn't about sex or relationships, or what OP was talking about in general.
