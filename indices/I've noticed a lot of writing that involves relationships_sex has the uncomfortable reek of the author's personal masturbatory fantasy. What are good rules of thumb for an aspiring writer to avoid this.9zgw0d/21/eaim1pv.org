My first thought would be to simply reduce the amount of detail you include when describing sex and the physical descriptions of characters.

As an example if you need to comunicate that your narrator is very attracted to some woman because that's going to impact the plot consider phrasing it more like:

She was the most beautiful woman I'd ever seen.

vs

She was about 5'6", fiery red hair, and curves in all the right places.

There's a similar phenomenon at work here to how saying "I love children" isn't creepy but saying "I love 12 year old boys" is. Or the weird assumptions D&D players can make based on the DM's description of random scenery. Where the choice of what details to include implies things about their importance that make it easy to read implications into them whether they were intended or not.
