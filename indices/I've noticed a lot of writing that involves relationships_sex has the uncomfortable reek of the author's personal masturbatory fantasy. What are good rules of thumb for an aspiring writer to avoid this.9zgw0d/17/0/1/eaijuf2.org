To be fair wether it's strictly true or not doesn't really affect whether it's good advice for writing about relationships. More relationships fall apart than last 'till death, even over human lifespans, and a sizable subset of relationships that do last a lifetime are coasting on a variant of the sunk cost fallacy or "cheat" by starting late in life or at least one partner dying early.

​

So "no relationship last forever, consider how the relationship breaks up before you start writing about it" can be a solid guideline for writing realistic relationships even if relationships can last forever juts because most won't.
