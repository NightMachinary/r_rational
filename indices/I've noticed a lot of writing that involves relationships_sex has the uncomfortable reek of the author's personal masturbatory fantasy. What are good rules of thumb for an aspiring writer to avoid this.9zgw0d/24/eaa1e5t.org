I personally think any sex ruins an intellectial narrative, i.e. if the story contains sex, then the entire story must be mired in and based in some kind of carnal theme, which is itself a kind of pornographic excercise. Sex should be the main thrust of a story, (intended) or be treated as a "background" character with no lines.

A rational story should /end/ when the protagonist secures mating rights/marries or whatever. Its less a matter of creative skill on the part of the author than the reader's unpredictable response to the material that makes "mixing" sexually and cognitively stimulating threads a bad move.

You'd really have to know your (very specific... possibly one person,) audience to avoid derailing a reader by making them uncomfortable or /too/ comfortable with the handling of such a tricky element.

However, it is an interesting exercise to see how close you can get to being sexually explicit without losing the reader by making it too "____" (insert any number of possible ways you could alienate a plethora of sexualities...)
