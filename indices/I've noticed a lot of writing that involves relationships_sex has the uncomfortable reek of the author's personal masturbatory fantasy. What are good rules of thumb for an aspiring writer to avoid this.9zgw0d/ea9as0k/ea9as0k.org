I've repeatedly observed this same phenomenon even from professional writers, from Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time in which women are constantly getting stripped naked and birched, paddled, spanked with a hair brush, and whipped, or threatened with same; to A Song of Fire and Ice, in which (in my opinion) George R. R. Martin has a bit of a fixation on castration; a fixation shared by Iain Banks who always seems to include at least one sexual organ removal scene in each of his books, and had one book (The Wasp Factory) in which that was a primary plot point rather than just being a mandatory scene; to Jack L. Chalker whose books always include multiple transgender transformations and scenes of identity death.

It appears that many authors need to include their personal fetish in their writing in order to keep their interest up enough to write a book.
