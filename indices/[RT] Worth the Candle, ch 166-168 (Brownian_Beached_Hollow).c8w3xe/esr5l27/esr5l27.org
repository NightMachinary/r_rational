I'm a big fan of how this arc has gone so far. Juniper's reaction to it was so muted and underwhelming in a really unsettling way that I /think/ was close to reality. (I'm not an expert, so it could just be one of those cases where it's a common misconception). Thanks to the discomfort that caused me, Amaryllis absolutely furious reaction paid such big dividends. I wasn't quite cheering in my seat, reading that, but it was close.

I also really appreciate how you didn't have anyone doubt Juniper. Not that they would've had reason to doubt his word over the evil house's, but in the current climate it's still refreshing. Pallida was the only one who seemed unconvinced, and that was on grounds of 'Well that's not /really/ rape' and, while that's certainly gross, it came from Pallida. She's not exactly set up to be likeable anyway.
