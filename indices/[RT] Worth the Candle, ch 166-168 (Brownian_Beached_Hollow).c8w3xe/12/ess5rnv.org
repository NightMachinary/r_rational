More than anything, the last chapter made me very hopeful about Bethel's moral character at her core. At this point I'm confident she had no intention of hurting or traumatizing Juniper and she seemed pretty quick to gather why what she did had that effect, and seemed very regretful for it. Before that conversation I would have thought it plausible that things could have gone a /lot/ worse, but this to me suggests Bethel is much more than a chaotic evil murderhouse.
