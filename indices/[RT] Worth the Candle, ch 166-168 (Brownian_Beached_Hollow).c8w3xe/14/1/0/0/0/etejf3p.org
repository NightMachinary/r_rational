And Juniper agrees with you. As do I, in fact. Amaryllis doesn't, because she's always had a bit of an aggressive streak, jumping to violence much more readily than others would. It's more subtle than your typical fantasy barbarian type, sure, because she's ALSO intelligent and calculating, but from the very beginning of the story she has a bit of a history of unnecessary violence.
