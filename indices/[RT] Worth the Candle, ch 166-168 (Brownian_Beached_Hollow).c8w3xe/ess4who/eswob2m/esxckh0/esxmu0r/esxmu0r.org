  With 2 I agree especially if that's their logic then I think it's absurd to jump to killing her because she raped Joon. She's torturing Mary and no one suggested that they should kill her because of that.
#+end_quote

I wouldn't say it's torture, but I suppose it is a little blurry. Mary is enduring it, but then she would endure a lot of things that the rest of the group would be unhappy about her enduring so maybe that doesn't say much.

#+begin_quote
  If we're going to treat Bethel as a malicious maximiser then they should have made a clear line and told her about what she does that will make them kill her.
#+end_quote

Describing the circumstances where they will kill Bethel, making threats against her as her abusers did, will not end well for them, which is why they've never done that.

#+begin_quote
  Tell her that if she raped one of them they'd kill her. Or work out a negotiation so she can contribute to the end of the world. Murder is so unMary (in terms of sacrifice for utility)
#+end_quote

Mary thought that Bethel could be a powerful and valuable ally in the task of saving the world. Bethel has just done something psychologically deleterious to someone who is not only Mary's best friend and the person she may be in love with, but also is under her belief system unambigiously the most important ally in the task of saving the world.

So now Bethel and Joon can't be kept together because it will be too dangerous for Joon's mental health, and when Bethel realises why she may become an active threat.

Mary experiences great anger and hatred in the moment of realisation, and then dials back down to be more in line with the rest of the group's planning, which is more in line with "we can't trust Bethel anymore, we need to find a way to stay separate from her and keep safe". Seems perfectly in character to me.

  The problem is if Bethel is meant to be like that they're not treating her like that. In fact none of their approaches are consistent with any sort of concept of Bethel. They're trying to morally convince her now but how does that make any sense?
#+end_quote

They're not trying to morally convince her. Valencia has gone in to say the words that maximise their safety. Her (devil's) model of Bethel indicates that Bethel does assign some value to the well-being of Joon, either terminally or instrumentally since if he fears her he won't live in her. That happens to resemble moral convincing.

#+begin_quote
  If point three happened, that is sexual desire overwhelmed Bethel then she is a victim too. Her ability to control herself and make decisions was stripped from her.
#+end_quote

My point was that we've explicitly been told that Bethel did have issues with being overwhelmed by a plethora of senses, but then she gained an entad that meant she was no longer overwhelmed. I take this as evidence that she was not "out-of-control" due to lust when she made advances on Juniper.

#+begin_quote
  However I will say that it's not at all house like to fuck your owners so I don't get where this is coming from unless it was all the physical body.
#+end_quote

She made advances on Juniper long before the body. So it wasn't all the body.

#+begin_quote
  At the end of the day we always knew sex with Bethel was on the cards because of the quests. Everyone knows about them and the fact that no one thought of speaking to the often homicidal and alien house about what consent is and how to conduct this stuff seems rather lax of them.
#+end_quote

Juniper finds that quest extremely distasteful, and does not have any intent of completing it. Quests aren't necessarily inevitabilities. And I've already covered why speaking to Bethel about consent is challenging at best and pointless at worst.

#+begin_quote
  Honestly I hope they tell the doe about consent because I highly expect her to rape Joon next. Again we know the quest. Clearly if they didn't speak to Bethel I doubt they told the doe.
#+end_quote

...if you expect the doe to respond meaningfully in any way to someone clearly explaining defined rules about consent to it... well then I suppose I understand why you might expect Bethel to respond productively to the same.
