That refers not only to rebuilding trust, or Joon coming to terms with the rape, but also to Bethel.

FWIW, I think Bethel acts incredibly human in this arc. I would have been disappointed in our gracious author if Bethel had managed to jump from "The sex thing didn't turn out how I wanted it to" into "Oh my god, I'm so so sorry" within 5 minutes, without passing through "denial" and "anger".
