If Bethel had come into existence yesterday, no one would be arguing with you. Bethel came into existence centuries ago.

If Bethel had never interacted with other sapient beings, no one would be arguing with you. Bethel has had possibly tens of thousands of people pass through her over the years and has had thousands of them live inside her for extended periods.

If Bethel had never been exposed to any moral teachings, no one would be arguing with you. Bethel has had kings and heroes inside her. There have undoubtedly been many, many conversations about the morality of various actions.

If Bethel had never encountered the idea that sex can be unpleasant, no one would be arguing with you. Bethel was raped and didn't like it.

If Bethel had no ability to understand human reactions or identify emotional responses then no one would be arguing with you. Bethel may actually be telepathic or empathic and she definitely has a physical sensorium that allows her to monitor literally every internal and external part of a person's body. Her awareness of other's thoughts are rivaled only by Val-with-a-devil.

Bethel raped Joon because she suddenly had the ability to have sex, she wanted to try it, and he seemed appealing.
