I think you'd be very surprised by how many people don't understand this despite being told about it. Bethel doesn't see herself like the kind of person who could hurt Joon or take advantage of him because that's how she views her own abusers. If she doesn't see herself as an abuser, then she doesn't think of what she does to Joon as abuse.

This is how people work a lot of the time. Rationalism and logical thinking isn't the norm in a lot of people's lives and they typically don't have the same exposure to sexual assault.
