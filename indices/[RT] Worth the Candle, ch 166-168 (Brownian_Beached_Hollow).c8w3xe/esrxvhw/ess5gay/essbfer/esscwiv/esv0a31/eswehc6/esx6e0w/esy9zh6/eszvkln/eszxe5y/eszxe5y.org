I only now realised that you are also the person I'm arguing with on another comment chain in this thread...

The whole point is this. Real life examples and the ignorance of huge parts of society on the topic of rape, clearly point to the fact that not everyone is aware of the second point you state here. Bethel is a rapist, yes. The thing is that she doesn't know that she's a rapist.

In her mind, Joon didn't mean "no" like that, this means she isn't a rapist in her mind. I have to say again, people do this all the time in reality. People molest, harass, rape, etc. other people every day and a lot of the time they'd argue that it was different in their case, it didn't really count or they had good intentions. You're acting as if Bethel had to be ignorant of consent or aware that she was raping Joon but the truth is that she just had to have thought processes that were fairly similar to most humans.
