It does matter if it was done by a machine.

I'm not suggesting that Joon doesn't need support I'm just talking about how you deal with a mindless rape machine versus Grak raping Joon versus Bethel raping Joon.

Sure Joon needs support but murdering Bethel only makes sense if she was being malicious.

--------------

Why can't she be trusted not to hurt people? What is Bethel's motivation for wanting to rape and hurt Joon?

They chose to live in her, to uplift her and raise her. They made her take missions she didn't want to do and what happened is a direct consequence.

Joon and Co had tons of time to explain the concept of consent to a house who obviously wouldn't understand it.

Either they did or didn't and both matter tremendously for if Bethel is malicious or ignorant.
