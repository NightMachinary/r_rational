I think that even to a meta-entad like Bethel, having people be cowed into not conveying all relevant useful information out of fear should have been a highly foreseeable negative consequence of regular threats of violence and attempts to manipulate herself into positions of power over others. Bethel knows that she lacks certain capabilities, but we've never really seen her make an effort to try to train herself to develop them except by eating other entads, which is a major personal failing.

If we want to get real hyper-autistic utilitarian here, maybe she should consider herself lucky nothing worse than completely destroying her relationship with Juniper happened as a result of that persistent negligence of proper interpersonal relationships.

Edit: I reread chapter 164 and have a lot more to say.

  “I always thought it was fumbling,” said Bethel. “Two creatures who can barely see each other, barely feel each other, who have to guess what certain physiological responses must mean, groping and grappling while they seek their own pleasure. It always seemed so inefficient. But I think I can see it better, how the mutuality of it works.”

With this line, horrifyingly enough given /after/ the rape, it might be that raping Juniper /was/ Bethel's attempt to try to develop her social skills, in which case it's a lot messier to diagnose her mistake from her own point of view. If she thought that this was a low-risk of backfiring way to develop her understanding of humans further, it is easier to sympathize with her failing. Pursuing training is exactly the sort of action she should have been pursuing, and not having a good index of what one doesn't know is hard to avoid.

I still think the problems are there, but we have to go one step further back to find them, and they're more myriad. Additionally, there is a bit of taking advantage of hindsight bias involved - I wouldn't have predicted ten chapters ago that due to her problems Bethel would rape Juniper or do anything similarly awful, and so condemning her for not anticipating the same is a bit of a cheat (I would argue she had privileged inside information of her own plans that on net counteracts this excuse, though). Regardless, we can say that an alien intelligence like Bethel should know that

1. she should not be aggressive when acting in high-uncertainty domains

2. should not learn by doing when acting in high-uncertainty domains

3. should be more wary of actions that require her to lie to others to proceed, due to an understanding that part of what informs others' actions is a different factual understanding than her own.

4. should be wary of being influenced by sudden changes to herself after incorporation of a new entad

5. should be patient and learn in smaller but more frequent increments when acting in high-uncertainty domains

6. should consult with others to guide her plans - even if only to reject their views out of mistrust later

7. should consult with her resources on human socialization more, even if she didn't trust any of her residents

8. should try to lean as far as she can from her modus operandi, where she is specifically pursuing improvement in areas her instincts are badly calibrated for

When Valencia explained Bethel's mistake to her in the most recent chapter, Bethel was pretty quick to pick up on what she had done wrong. Even chalking some of that up to Valencia's ability as a persuader, I think their conversation was not bizarre or lengthy enough for us to say Bethel wasn't capable of figuring out on her own that no means no due to her alien mindset. Bethel shouldn't get to demand respect as a fellow highly sentient being unless she's willing to be held to the standards of one.

Meta (still a continuation of the edit): I don't think you should have been downvoted for taking the point of view of the alien evildoer, necessarily, but your comment lacked any kind of hedging or acknowledgement of counterarguments which is probably a component of why it's getting such a bad reception, in addition to less justifiable but still sympathetic reasons like people not wanting to think about how rapists might think. This subreddit should be a place for being willing to delve into the mechanisms of thought behind literary tropes, in my opinion, even those involving violence, but if we're going to pursue that then I think we should try to make our analysis strong in proportion to the amount of weirdness of the topic under discussion, and I don't think you did a great job of doing so. To whatever extent people are downvoting you because you dared to bring up Bethel's point of view I disagree with them, but to whatever extent people are downvoting you because you failed to do a good job addressing Bethel's point of view in a way that acknowledged its flaws, or allowed for the legitimacy of sympathizing with Juniper's point of view, I concur with them.
