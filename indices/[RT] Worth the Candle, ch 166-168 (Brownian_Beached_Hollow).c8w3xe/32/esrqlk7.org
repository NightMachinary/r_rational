Great chapters! Male perspective in this rape situation is a great adition. I'd like to add my 2 cents to the discusion.

Situation is obviously much more complex than it appears.

A lot of blame for the situation lies on Juniper, since Bethel was a monster from start and he just though she was HIS monster. He was also giving her false signs knowing she has no social skills and could easily misread a situation, and knowing she has no empathy and not caring since he was using her skills.

Problem for Juniper was not sex part of the rape, it was lack of control and feeling powerless.

Juniper himself is obviously powerful and he likes have power in any relationship displayed so far.

Not surprisingly the way to deal with that situation is gaining more power and gaining control in the relationship by exercising power and banishing her from the group.

He played with fire to gain power, in part for his sexual relationships and he got burned by using powerfull socially retarded person.
