It gets called sand in a few places. Part of the idea is just that Juniper is fixating on the stuff that's wrong, like the grains of sand being too large, despite the fact that whether it fits the legal definition of sand or the legal definition of gravel is ultimately unimportant. (I'm open to changing it, if you found it sufficiently distracting, but that particular use of 'sand' was because it didn't feel like the right place for Juniper bitching about the sand again.)
