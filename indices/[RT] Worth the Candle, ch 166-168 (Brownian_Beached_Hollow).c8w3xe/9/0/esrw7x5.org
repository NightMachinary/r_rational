  For the spell, Zorisad Yosivun's Deep Searching, to succeed but the locus to be beyond restoration, the party could only gain the capability after it's already too late? Otherwise something does not add up.

Being capable doesn't mean doing the thing. For all we know, Joon+grpup could be /capable/ of doing it /right now/ without realizing it (i.e. Bethel eating the bottle). Zorisad Yosivun is a genie, so all the warnings about wording requests and interpreting the answers fully apply.
