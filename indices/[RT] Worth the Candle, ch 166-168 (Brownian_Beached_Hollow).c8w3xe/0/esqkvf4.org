I try to keep in mind when reading that just because something doesn't grab my attention it doesn't mean there is any fault in the writing, it can often just be personal taste. I'm not a big fan of Crime novels but I am a big fan of High Fantasy and irrespective of writing quality I'm going to enjoy one more than the other. On a smaller scale, in media some issues engage me more than others, and while sexual assault is just awful and a relevant topic to current society and there's a lot of important things to say on it...it's just not a topic that really piques my interest when it comes to fiction.

So as I was reading the second chapter of this batch I was thinking all of this and I was also thinking “well, it's not like the issue could take up any less screen time because it's nuanced and needs plenty of work to do the issue justice, so if the issues is going to be tackled then unfortunately for me it needs to be explored at length”, and then I started to get more drawn in. I started getting a sinking feeling in my gut, I started mirroring (on a much much smaller scale) what Joon and Amaryllis were respectively feeling and I had that kind of character immersion that only the best writing gives you, the sort I experienced earlier in the series when Amaryllis was writing from the doomed timeline or when Fenn and Joon had their therapy session.

You took a topic I am usually not engaged by in media and /really/ made me enjoy it's exploration and connect with a characters experience on the subject in a new way. I went from a kind of detached, almost “intellectual empathy” regarding Joon's situation to a more visceral simulation of his turmoil. Thanks for the insight and for the vicariousness awfulness i'm feeling which feels good in it's own weird way.
