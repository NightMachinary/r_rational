I don't think that it makes any sense to describe a person as "seeming disinterested" in response to visual inspection. A person can seem /un/interested very easily ("The doe gave no impression that she'd heard me aside from a flick of the ear.")---but I find it impossible to imagine, for example, a judge who seems /dis/interested when I look at him. (Obviously, a judge may "seem disinterested" in response to a financial or social audit---but that's not what the story is describing.)

A lack of material interest cannot be discerned from a person's demeanor.
