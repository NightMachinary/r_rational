You described playing chicken, then referred to the position as "piggyback". I don't know if this is a regional dialect thing, but "piggyback" to me always means the position with arms over the over person's shoulders, not legs over their shoulders.

Now I'm looking at definitions online and it appears to be either. Huh.
