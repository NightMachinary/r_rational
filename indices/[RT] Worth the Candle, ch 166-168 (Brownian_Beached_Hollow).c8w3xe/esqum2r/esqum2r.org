Great chapters. I don't want to defend Bethel because obviously what she did was rape. Having said that, she isn't human and I don't think she understands humans at all, and she honestly didn't know how wrong it was what she was doing, and that she does care a lot about Juniper and just wanted to get closer to him and make him happy and she ended up achieving the exact opposite of all of that, so as Valencia said it ends up being a tragedy for everyone.
