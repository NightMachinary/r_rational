As much as I feel for June, I can't help but keep thinking how sorry I feel for Bethel.

The flashback June had about his uncle tickling him must have been intentional for how it fits so well into the situation: Bethel did an action which made June's body react in what seemed to be a positive way, just like the uncle saw him laughing when he was tickled. And both were ignoring the mental side of things, encouraged by the physical. To Bethel sex is the same as tickling, she isn't human, she doesn't know the difference and she doesn't feel it. I don't think she will ever truly understand what she did and why would she? She isn't human.

To her its just like she tickled June, and then suddenly he is conspiring to kill her. No wonder Val was so scared, from that perspective it must feel to her like June is betraying her.

The whole situation is just so tragic, like [[https://www.reddit.com/user/RMcD94/][RMcD94]] mentioned, Bethel is like a dog who shat on the floor and had no idea what she was doing wrong at the time, and even now to her it is just an "arbitrary rule" she broke and is being punnished rediculously harshly for something she didn't know to be wrong at the time, but would do anything to make it right anyway. And there probably isn't anything that can make it right.
