One of the most mature takes I have seen on the subject of male abuse, I had been disgusted by all the scenes before where he gets aroused for whatever really simple reason and Bethel points it out, and this breakdown on the issues of consent has made the uncomfortable read worthwhile. What I thought was most important was reflecting how Juniper would feel shame, embarrassment, denial, then get more worked up and uncomfortable over time, and I liked that the people he was most afraid of being let down by ended up being the ones most determined to help him. It was /precisely because/ Mary and Val had been dealt a shit hand before that they got outraged about it, in contrast to Bethel having fucked up ideas on consent and feeling like a victim without realising how badly she was hurting others.

A lot better than Valencia or Bethel dying too. Bethel most likely spared Val because she was thinking about her conversation with Mary a few chapters ago. She does want to be a better person. Weird how merging with Ropey seems to have made her a bit more manic and unpredictable. But realising she was abusing Joon the same way she had been abused probably struck a chord.

Valencia did nothing wrong in her life, ever, and I hope to see plenty of her in the future, but I suspect her woobie status will bring the wrath of the DM eventually. More on Val - I am proud to see how shes grown from a scared child into someone who is a force to be reckoned with and a steadfast, mature friend, with or without a demon. Its insane to think she manipulated events, almost entirely without supernatural help, for Bethel to not have any hostages and Juniper to be in an environment where he could talk about what was on his mind. Then she overcomes fear to call out the deadliest being to exist outside an exclusion zone. No coincidence her name links to “Valor”.... what a Gryffindor.

I do think removing the final 2 truly interesting Companions from the picture will make these next few chapters blander, unless Wales has intent to expand on the current cast. Solace has been quiet and hostile since she was revived. Amaryllis is... odd, especially with her relationship to Joon. I love Grak but hes banging a 7 year old and it is fucked up. Raven and Pallida need a lot more work. The Locus however is still the OG.

Final note - this is the chapter I caught up on. What a fucking note. It was only yesterday I was reading Juniper's Kaiju-murdering shenanigans, and a few days before it was Fenn's demise.
