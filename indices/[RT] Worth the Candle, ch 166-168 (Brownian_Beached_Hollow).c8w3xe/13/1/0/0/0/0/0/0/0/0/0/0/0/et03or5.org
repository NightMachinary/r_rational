  Bethel can see Joon more deeply than anyone so she can see the heightened fear drug flowing through him and other internal signs of rape which other people couldn't.
#+end_quote

She could also see the pleasure. Valencia points out how physical and psychological pleasure are different, how fear and pleasure pathways are similar, and how Joon has the doublethink ability which convinces Bethel that she may have been mistaken while reading him.

  Bethel is a detached entity she is not that physical body
#+end_quote

She is though. That physical body isn't all of her, but it's part of her and anatomically correct. At the time she is literally under the effect of hormones.

  She like a wife raping husband, or a mother raping her daughter,
#+end_quote

This is the absolute majority of rapes. Being raped by a stranger is much less likely than being raped by someone you know personally. It sucks, but it's true. You can't say she's worse than people if what she does is what usually happens.

  if Bethel understood rape then she did it anyway because she's a sadist
#+end_quote

I have said this before but I'll try to explain it as simply as I can. People who understand rape and consent rape anyway without malice or understanding that it's wrong. Yes, that's weird. No it makes no logical sense. It's the same reason why people are anti-abortion but get one themselves because their case is "different" and they continue to judge everyone else. It's the same reason why nazi concentration camp guards could go home every day and be loving parents to their families and not think they did anything wrong. Cognitive dissonance is very powerful and people don't think rationally.

Bethel understands that no means no, but in this case she thought it didn't mean that because this was "different". She understands that you're not supposed to force yourself on someone, but "Joon would be happy" once it was over. Yes, this isn't true. This isn't what happened. This exact thought process goes through peoples heads all the time. It's not because they're overwhelmed by hormones, instincts, or drugs, it's because people, when faced with facts that conflict with their beliefs, are as likely to change the facts as they are to change their beliefs...to be honest they're more likely to change the facts.
