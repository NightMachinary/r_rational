Yes, that is true. I'm saying that right now, in the real world, a shit ton of otherwise normal people would not properly understand that and think that their circumstances are different. Tons and tons of young people, older people, and everything in between, could be (and have been) in a situation where they think that the person saying no doesn't really mean it and proceed anyway.

These people haven't been raised in Fritzl's basement, you are just vastly overestimating how well people in general understand this subject and how rational people tend to be.
