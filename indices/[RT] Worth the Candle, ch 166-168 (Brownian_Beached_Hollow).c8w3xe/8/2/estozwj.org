It's sad that Arthur/Uther saw all his life as degenerate cycles and here the degenerate cycles are continuing as a consequence of his improprieties and Bethel's not self-aware enough to recognize her transition from victim to perpetrator.

For all that Bethel is alien, she still has a lot of similar psychological mechanisms and preserving ego is surely one of them. That parallel seems like it'd be very destructive to her self-concept and equilibrium, and I must have a streak of schadenfreude because I want to see her reaction.
