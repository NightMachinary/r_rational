I doubt it will unless Bethel makes huge progress. Notice how upset she got with just the implication that what she did was even close to how she had been treated in the past. The Arthur thing would kick that up to 11. I really don't think Valencia can ever truly fix this, she may be able to make Bethel a member of the team again but this will always be a crack in their trust.
