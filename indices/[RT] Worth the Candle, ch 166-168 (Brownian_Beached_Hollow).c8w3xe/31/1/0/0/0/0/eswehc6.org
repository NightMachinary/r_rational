Valencia explicitly spelled this out. Bethel constantly threatens and scares people but amaryllis could live with it because she was assured that Bethel wouldn't actually harm any of them. Then she comes out and rapes the one person who genuinely likes her, the only one she doesn't have a grudge against. Amaryllis doesn't think they are safe anymore. As Val said, Amaryllis always thought Bethel would cross the line and become dangerous and this has just confirmed it for her.

Bethel understands the meaning of consent. She was raped herself, she was used by others without having a say and she knows it's wrong. As they explicitly point out in the chapters, she thought she knew what was going on and thought everyone would be happy, and she rationalized away the things that were in the way. This happens in real life. Remove the fantasy and I guarantee you that this exact situation happens all the time in our world, someone thinks they know better because otherwise the way they've planned things out was wrong.

Bethel not being malicious doesn't matter. Bethel is an incredibly powerful entity with few morals who has now proven that she is a clear and present threat to everyone around her. If she can't be trusted not to hurt people she herself doesn't want to hurt, then she has to be stopped. Just look at Val in this story, she is Bethels second closest friend and she is absolutely terrified that her explaining things to Bethel has a very high chance of her getting tortured to death.
