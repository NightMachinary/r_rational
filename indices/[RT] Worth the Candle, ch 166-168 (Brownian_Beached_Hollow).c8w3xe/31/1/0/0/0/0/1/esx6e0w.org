So then why did Bethel rape him?

Because she didn't understand consent?

You say that she raped him because she thought he'd be happy.

That sounds to me like someone who doesn't understand consent.

It doesn't matter if you are happy if you don't consent.

Did no one tell Bethel that? Did she know that and therefore was malicious?
