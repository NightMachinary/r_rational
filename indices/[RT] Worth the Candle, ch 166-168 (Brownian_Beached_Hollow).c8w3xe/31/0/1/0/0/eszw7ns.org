I see your perspective. You are suggesting just like that person irl Bethel should be expected to know and understand these things.

Therefore it is her responsibility for choosing to rape him which is a much more malicious perspective than other.

You raise a good point about awareness, she could see his internal feelings the entire time. That's incredibly evil, she must have lied about the happiness thing.
