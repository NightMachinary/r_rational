I do think he should have had to use some game trick to beat Fallatehr, similar to the memetic one he used against Harold. Or some combination with some other ability. Like say in a confrontation between soul mages you can use blood magic to increase the pressure in your brain and gain an advantage. Or something. I just don't think taking out his sword and stabbing him was a good ending. Especially considering how lengthy and convoluted the plot thread was.

I do think the Locus plot will have a better ending. It's far and away the longest plot thread we have going right now.
