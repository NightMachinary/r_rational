Not verified, no, but I think there are hints... "Caldwell Gatesmith has the dubious distinction of being responsible for two exclusions. ", his quest name " */A Door Into the Soul/* ", and in the description for the "Manifest Destiny" quest, " The exact nature of the magic that allows the immortal man named Manifest to puppet his subjects from a distance is unknown, ...", which sounds to me like Manifest uses portals to control his subjects.

Of course these aren't strong hints, and if Juniper got these quests from the description of two different exclusion zones, then this is all null and void, but it's never spelled out in the text how he got these particular quests. They are listed right after one another, too, which would be consistent with him getting two at once for one description of an exclusion zone. Either that, or me reading too much into things, or just a red herring^^
