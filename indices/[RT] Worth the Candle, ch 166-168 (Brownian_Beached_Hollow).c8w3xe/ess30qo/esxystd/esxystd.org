I wrote a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/c8w3xe/rt_worth_the_candle_ch_166168/esxxma9/][long response]] to RMcD94 that I think will address your points as well. Short answer: Bethel had more than enough information to know that what she did was wrong and why. She even had specific knowledge: Uther raped her, she didn't like it.

If she is a sapient moral agent then she had more than enough life experience to have recognized that this was a bad thing to do and it's appropriate to exile her, or even to destroy her if it's judged necessary in order to protect others from her.

If she's not sapient then there's nothing wrong with destroying her.

If she's sapient but not a moral agent then it's necessary to destroy her in order to protect others.
