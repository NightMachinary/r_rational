I always figured Gatesmith got two components of gates excluded - something like, first closing gates was excluded so that he couldn't cut people with them, and then he munchkined gates in general so hard they got excluded completely

That said, I can see where you're coming from and there isn't an author alive who doesn't take joy in hiding things in plain sight like this.
