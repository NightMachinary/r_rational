Eh, as much as I compliment him, he has taken the short path at times. Most recently the Harold thing. I get that there were some important moral decisions in the way that ended, and the prince's invulnerability plot line was important, but I still think that a mental battle of some kind would have been a better payoff.

And the way the Fallatehr plot line ended, that felt like a cop out too. I would have liked to have some sort of soul battle with Juniper winning and Fallatehr committing suicide somehow when he knew he was beaten. Just straight up killing him in a fight seems like it's leaving a lot of potential on the table.
