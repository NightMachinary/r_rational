Why is that necessarily a banal solution, mistake, or major literary fuckup? Solutions don't have to be proportionate to the complexity of the approach there or the effort expended. In this case, I think the lv. 20 virtue is a rather laterally elegant solution that aligns with how druids operate. I know the most recent chapters say that not everything has a moral or is commentary, but in the spirit of the "spiritual rule" of narrative, it wouldn't surprise me if Joon's effort to engage the locus is one of the oblique solutions expected from a druidic quest.

On a side note, I've noticed a trend of /r/ comments either directly praising AW for good writing/handling of topics or "trusting" him not to make a mistake. Both give me some secondhand awkwardness, with the former making me feel like a voyeur of wholesome thoughts and the latter triggering sympathy for the veiled pressure on AW. Kinda curious why the upsurge in the former; I like to think of it as the euphoric gushing of a finicky community finally satisfied by a r!treatment of uncomfortable topics.
