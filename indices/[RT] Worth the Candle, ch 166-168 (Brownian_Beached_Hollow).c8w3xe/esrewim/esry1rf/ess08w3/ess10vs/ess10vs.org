Humans can sense arousal.

If Amy said that she kept having sex with him because she felt his arousal what would the reaction be?

Clearly she still ignored him saying no, why did she ignore it?

Because he was aroused would suggest that she thinks that arousal is consent or doesn't know what consent is.

Which suggests the people responsible for humanising a house have done a bad job if no one explained to her arousal doesn't mean consent.

Even then if she thinks arousal means consent then what did she think the no was for?
