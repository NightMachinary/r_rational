If Bethel thought that Joon was saying no and just ignored his consent it means either a she doesn't know what consent is (and who's responsible for telling her about consent), in which case they should just tell her about consent problem solved. Even if she thinks he would enjoy being raped it's not relevant for consent.

Or b she knew it was rape, knows how Joon feels about rapes and did it to hurt him.
