Just because Bethel didn't have a great or even good upbringing doesn't necessarily excuse her actions. Just because we can trace the root causes of this event doesn't mean Bethel is blameless. It especially doesn't make the protagonists culpable when by the time they meet Bethel she is already a sociopath who we know has been sexually assaulted when she was younger.

Bethel isn't a dog, she made a conscious decision to ignore Joon saying no. They talk quite a bit about exactly why she did this, and it's not malicious on her part. She thought she knew best, that Joon would come to appreciate her being so forward, that if he was really so opposed he would do more. Bethel was wrong, and while she didn't and still doesn't see it as rape, she absolutely did rape Joon.

As far as Mary goes, in my opinion she saw Bethel as someone who was dangerous but useful. Bethel is the strongest one in the party and ridiculously useful, but a sociopath. Mary seemed to be of the opinion that Bethel's violent tendencies were worth it and that Bethel's personality would improve as she spent time living a better life. Bethel's sexual assault is both something that Mary has a strong emotional response to, but it could also be a sign that Bethel is not getting better and is a clear and present danger to all of them
