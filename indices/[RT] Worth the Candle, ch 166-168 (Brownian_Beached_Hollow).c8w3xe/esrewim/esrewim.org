  “How do you feel about her now?” asked Amaryllis.

  “Afraid, mostly,” I said. “Hurt, confused, sick. Ashamed. I'm worried she'll ... I don't know.”

  Amaryllis was staring out at the sea. “When I'm finished with her there won't be a piece bigger than a splinter.”

Amaryllis is the best fucking friend in the whole world. Valencia's right up there with her too, especially if she really is planning to live alone inside Bethel for an indeterminate length of time. The fact that she thinks of it as her being the best Gryffindor she can be is adorable, but also... something else, but I can't quite put my finger on it. Sad, maybe? I don't really know, something about it just strikes me as being more emotionally impactful than just "adorable."

Regarding the conversation itself... oof, Bethel. My knee-jerk reaction is to say fuck Bethel, because what she did was obviously awful and the closest she gets to recognizing that is a lovely little spot of victim blaming towards the end. However, while all of that is still true, thinking about it a bit more I do find a bit of a hope spot.

Most of her difficulty in recognizing the error of her actions hasn't been (from what we've seen) in recognizing that it was wrong to rape June, it was in recognizing that she DID rape June. She had a genuinely difficult time understanding that she hurt him and seemed offended by the fact that he felt threatened by her. There wasn't any malice, really. It's not that she didn't /care/ about June's feelings, it's that she didn't /understand/ them, while at the same time she was arrogant enough to think that she understood him better than he understood himself. She loudly declared that she would /never/ hurt him, and I think she really does sincerely believe that. She doesn't /want/ to hurt him and would not intentionally do so. The problem is, I think in her head that's become "I would never hurt Juniper, therefore nothing I do will ever harm Juniper." She's too arrogant to consider that her actions may not have the consequences she intends.

Thankfully, ignorance is much easier to correct than malice. This /is/ something that I think they could recover from. June and Bethel might even become friends again, and if they do they'll be much better friends than they were before. If that's going to happen, though, Bethel has a /lot/ of work ahead of her. She isn't a complete sociopath, but her empathy is /seriously/ underdeveloped/atrophied, and for her to fix things with Juniper that has to change.
