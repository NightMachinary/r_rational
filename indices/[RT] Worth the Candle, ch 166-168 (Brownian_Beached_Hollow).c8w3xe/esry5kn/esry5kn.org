That was a tough read, but a really rewarding one. I will admit I had been worried about whether this would be handled well - but not anymore.

  /So, we had sex, and I pretended that I was fine with it, and I've been stepping on eggshells and edited my spirit, and I've been feeling like shit about it, and that's why I'm not as happy as I should be about you trying to make this themed beach outing a success, and it's why seeing you in a bikini is making me a little bit anxious instead of just horny, not that you would want that, unless for some reason you do./

Much like Juniper, I was a little concerned what Amaryllis' reaction would be. After this paragraph, I was on the edge of my seat wondering whether the omission of those unsaid words would mean she didn't have a good reaction.

  “How do you feel about her now?” asked Amaryllis.

  “Afraid, mostly,” I said. “Hurt, confused, sick. Ashamed. I'm worried she'll ... I don't know.”

  Amaryllis was staring out at the sea. “When I'm finished with her there won't be a piece bigger than a splinter.”

To see her so angry, so supportive, and so willing to prioritise this above all other concerns is deeply satisfying. Amaryllis is the fucking best.

  “Those are problems we'll have to deal with,” said Amaryllis. “They're not inconsequential.”

I really like how she doesn't dismiss Juniper's worry about the big logistical difficulties, but rather notes them as lesser concerns.

  “It's going to be hard for me, knowing what I know, to doublethink around Juniper,” said Valencia. “I would rather not have to try. It was already hard not to pick up anything, before. I knew that something was wrong, really wrong, I just ...” she squeezed her fists. “I didn't want to betray trust.”

Valencia here stands as a beautiful contrast to Bethel, as someone who had access to enormous power (in this case, social power rather than pure might), and who stopped when she was asked.

  “You would call it that, if it were someone else,” said Valencia.
#+end_quote

Damn right, and exactly what he needed to hear (obviously, because devil).

#+begin_quote
  “I don't have to risk my life for you,” said Valencia. “I choose to risk my life because it's my life to do with as I please. If it could be me or someone else, I would still volunteer. That there's no other option only simplifies things.”

Okay, Mary and Valencia can be tied for the best.

  “There are no words,” Valencia lied.

"I could, but I fucking won't," Valencia thought.
