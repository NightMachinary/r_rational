Sorry for the late reply.

Like i said for Bethel, she is a completely alien intelligence without any obvius motivation behind her pshyology and clear antisocial tendencies. Add to that huge amout of power she has why would the group invite her along and introduce her to civilization and inocent people? That was just stupid. Even before that i always wondered about Joons motivation for saving the world. Mary was litteraly groomed for that, a she has unique pshyhology. Solance doesn't care one bit about the world only about the druids. Garak is leeching dopamine the magic connection with Joon gives him to avoid depresion...etc. Everyone has motivation except Joon. His only motivation is power and control the system is giving him (not a good sign) and his obsession with Mary (also not a good sign). We know he loves control from his stories (DM, dating choices etc...), but we never seen his obsessive past. What we do know is that Arthur was a better man that Juniper and he got corrupted by the system.

So my proposal that Junper will get fed up with this, Mary will deny him at certain point and he will become villian with Bethel's help. He subconsciosly planned it all along, that is why he empowered Bethel and brought her along.
