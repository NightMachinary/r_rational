Juniper mental proceses are mostly rationalisation of his action. Most inteligent and reasonable actions are atributed to Mary, or given in a backdrop in "we decided to use this.." without explaining mental process.

In this chapter we see Valencia doing what best suited Joon, giving control back to him and taking it away from Bethel. I wouldn't be suprised to see in the end Juniper being main villian of the story, since this saviour of the world complex is not rational or normal behavior. Him date raping Mary, or destroying the world when she finally rejects him wouldn't suprise many at this point.

His behavior is not healthy is my saying, and my ESL trying to say. It was unhealthy long before the rape, and it's what brought him into situtation that got him raped (he intentionally put him self into the position). Bethel was never a complete person so "she" can't have full responsibility for the action.
