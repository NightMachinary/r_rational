I think because it happens in a logical chain of thought, it's easier to follow and connect with. Often authors will write scenes like this in which the characters act in ways that don't make sense, whether due to lack of skill, laziness, or attempts at drama/comedy. It's hard to empathize with characters that do things you would never do, let alone things that no one would ever do.
