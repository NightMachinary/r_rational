I don't know why I am jumping in on this after almost a month but here I am. Val already explained why Bethel ignored the "no". Because she thought she knew better. Because they had agreed beforehand that if Bethel could feel, he would do it. Because she had a body and she really wanted to try it out and no was more inconvenient than yes. Because he enjoyed it.

That's the thing about rape though. Just because you don't want it doesn't mean you might not enjoy it. Arousal is an automatic response much like closing your eyes when sneezing.

And he didn't say no again because, /as mentioned in the chapter,/ Bethel is prone to escalation. A harder no might mean a harder yes. And she go a lot harder than anyone else. Despite the fact that she had no intention to hurt him and has not given any indication she would, she is extremely casual about murder and has thrown out a number of casual displays of absolute power. So in the moment it was best to go with the flow. Once he was far enough away to feel safe, he finally realized how terrifying and sickening it was.

I don't know why this went so long. The chapters do a good job of analyzing this from both sides.
