Well I have to think that the people who choose to live with her and upgrade her sentience are clearly responsible for how she develops.

But if he is being a Midwestern prude why ignore him when he says no? Did she think that by proceeding he would stop being a prude? Did she think that it was his fetish to say no?

I agree with you that I think she's not malicious but it's not clear at all what her reasons were and Val should find it out because it has serious consequences.

Either she's like a pet dog who shat in the house and no one told her that it wasn't acceptable and now she got shouted at she wants to make up for it.

Or she did know it was wrong and did it anyway (why?)

Potentially she was overwhelmed by lust, so who gave her a real body? Perhaps she is suffering from wanting to stop but being forced by urges to keep going. Who can Bethel talk to about her feelings?

Big difference yet Val doesn't seem to make an effort.
