The same reason as Juniper's uncles in his flashback; if you are tickling someone its thought of as normal to not stop if they say no. Sex isn't the same as tickling, but to Bethel it is. - After all, all she sees is the biological response of pleasure, just like all the uncle sees is June laughing.

This has made me seriously re-think the morality of tickling people as well...
