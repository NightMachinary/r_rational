Like someone else in this thread (can't seem to find it), I actually liked and appreciated Pallida more for speaking up. Like she says, there are "morals and ideas of the moment" and in a universe and history as multicultural as Aerb, judging other cultures and their interpretations of behaviors might be too insular without a big stick in hand. Reminder that hardly anybody in our world gave two hoots about male rape until relatively recently. There was [[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/c2p8sy/rt_worth_the_candle_ch_162165/ervjr0h/][a whole discussion of rape framing in the last thread]] and [[/u/c_a_l]]'s argument resonated with me in that using the same word of "rape" to refer to all types of unconsented sexual activity isn't realistic. In modern Western culture (not too sure if it's the same everywhere), it's rape by most accounts, but it's still complicated and there are plenty of people who will say that's not /really/ rape for all sorts of reasons.
