Most of the research for this chapter was in reading how these kinds of issues are dealt with by therapists, reading accounts from people who had been sexually assaulted (with a specific eye towards people who think that their sexual assault maybe wasn't, or who didn't initially characterize it as that). I don't have any specific links; most of it was either Google searches for survivor resources, or AskReddit threads. Plus I tried my best to get some perspectives from both non-Western countries and from the United States in other eras where rape and sexual assault were treated differently, just for the sake of perspective. (I love court cases for the window they give into how educated people think; [[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1399209540378549726&hl=en&as_sdt=6&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr][People v. Liberta]] is worth a read, if you can stomach it, in part because it gives some history, some comparisons, and some links, and especially touches on equal protection.)

I don't know if that answers the question?
