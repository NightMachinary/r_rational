The more I think about this the more I think there's something else.

I think Amy let her love for Joon rise.

Think about it. Amy wouldn't say let's kill them. Any would say oh no that's horrible, something has went wrong here. Is there a memetic agent corrupting her, did we fail to teach her about consent, is an entad that we forced into her manipulating her?

Instead Amy assumes Bethel was malicious and wants to kill her. Imagine reacting to any other part member like that.

Grak raped you? Well somethings gone wrong there.

Val raped her boyfriend? Well I probably didn't explain consent very well when I explained it to her (notably that she explained it to mind raped Val but never bothered to Bethel WHO IS A HOUSE)

Bethel raped you? Clearly she wanted to hurt you let's murder her it's the only choice.

These chapters have made me more sympathetic for Bethel than ever before. She's a savage dog that they chose to take into their home. They chose to attempt to domesticate her. She was force to take in mind altering entads (likely the human body overwhelmed her with sensations like being mind controlled) on a job she didn't want to do (Rath). Then Bethel as a dog takes a shit in the house and Amy's first reaction is to murder the dog not considering how she was the fucking person responsible for training her. Not only that as a savage dog she can't even fucking speak to anyone because Amy wants to kill her the moment she can and everyone is incredibly hostile towards her. Plus because she is a savage dog with nukes instead of thinking of educating her they think of alpha strike.

I really hope to see more introspection from Amy. What they've done with Bethel is incredibly irresponsible.

If she wasn't house trained why did they give her more weapons?

Why do they act like Bethel is morally responsible instead of feeling empathy for the savage dog they have to put down because its untrainable.

Just really this whole thing has made me disappointed in these characters and emphasises how they'll struggle to deal with anything alien. Again a reminder that Bethel is a house.

The best explanation for Amy being so blinkered is because she's infatuated with Joon
