I don't understand how you can argue with they didn't consent. If they said no they didn't consent. The only arguments would be like "I didn't hear them" or "I hear yes" or "we previously agreed on a safe word". If they didn't consent you're a rapist.

But I'll take your word for it since I haven't spoken to many rapists (that I know of probably lots of people I didn't realise)

I don't think Bethel is likely to be comparable to humans seeing as she is a house and cannot be overwhelmed by physical urges (apparently) so she was in the same mental state then. Whereas women irl have hormones changing their brain and the actions they do while in court and while in the bedroom they might not do both times.

Bethel should never have an action she would only do when certain drugs lower her inhibitions
