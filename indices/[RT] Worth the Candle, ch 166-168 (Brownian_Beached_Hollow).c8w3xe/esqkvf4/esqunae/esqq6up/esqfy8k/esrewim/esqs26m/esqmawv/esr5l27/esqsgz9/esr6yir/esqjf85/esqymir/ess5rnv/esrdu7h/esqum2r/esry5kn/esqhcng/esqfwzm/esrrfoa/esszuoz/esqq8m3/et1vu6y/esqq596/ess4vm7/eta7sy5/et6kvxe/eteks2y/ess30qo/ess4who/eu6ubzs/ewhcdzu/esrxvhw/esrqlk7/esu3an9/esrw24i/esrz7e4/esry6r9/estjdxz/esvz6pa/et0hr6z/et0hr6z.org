How does leaning on his friends for support push him further down the path of villainhood than shutting up and gathering power to unilaterally get rid of Bethel? You're saying he's doomed to be a villain at the same time you say he should've behaved like a sociopath.

Even your logic about Joon's romantic choices flies in the face of what's there in the text. Joon avoids romancing Mary because he thinks she's purpose-made by the GM for that role. He goes for Fenn specifically because she seems more likely to be his equal. The power imbalance only appears later and is a source of stress for both of them, not just Fenn.

He dates a 15 year old, unhappily, simply because she was there after he broke up with a girl his age who he was genuinely happy with. Your logic is built on special pleading. You even miss the fact that Joon's GMing is hardly a dominance struggle. His style is built around ideals that are incompatible with that view.
