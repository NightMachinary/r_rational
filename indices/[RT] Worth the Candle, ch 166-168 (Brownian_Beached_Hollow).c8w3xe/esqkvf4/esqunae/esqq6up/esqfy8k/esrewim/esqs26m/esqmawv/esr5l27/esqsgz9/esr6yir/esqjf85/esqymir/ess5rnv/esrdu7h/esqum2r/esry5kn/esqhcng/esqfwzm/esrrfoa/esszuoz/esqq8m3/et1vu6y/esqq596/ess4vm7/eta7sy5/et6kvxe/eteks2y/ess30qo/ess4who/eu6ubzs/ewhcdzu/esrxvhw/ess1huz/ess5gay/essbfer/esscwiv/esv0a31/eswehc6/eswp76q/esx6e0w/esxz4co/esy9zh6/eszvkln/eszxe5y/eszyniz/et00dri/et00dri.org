I think you're stuck on one fundamental point. Most people who strive to be rational think that something is true based on evidence, therefore they believe it, therefore they argue for it. Most people don't try to be completely rational in their beliefs. Bethel believes she's not a rapist, therefore the truth is that she doesn't rape Joon, therefore he didn't actually mean it when he said no.

This is wrong. We know it's wrong and that Bethel did rape him. This is also fundamentally how a significant part of people think.

On a side note, didn't Valencia explicitly state that Bethel having a body meant that she was experiencing sexual pleasure and desire for the first time? That kind of sinks your entire final paragraph. Also, I never mentioned drugs.
