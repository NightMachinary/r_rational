It's common in mature online fiction. Online writers (outside specific circles) are often fairly progressive and when you hang out on the internet, rape and the perception around it can become something that affects you deeply.

Just look at the last chapter thread and the amount of people who didn't think it was rape at all. The sad truth is that there will always be plenty of people who simply don't understand the concept.
