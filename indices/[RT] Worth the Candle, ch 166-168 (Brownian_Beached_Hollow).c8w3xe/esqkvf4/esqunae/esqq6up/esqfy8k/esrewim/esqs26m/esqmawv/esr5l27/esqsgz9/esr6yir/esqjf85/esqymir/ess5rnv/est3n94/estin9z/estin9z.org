I don't think what you say disagrees with the parent comment. After the last batch there was the potential for a truly sociopathic Bethel that becomes a threat. What the last chapter of this one shows is that she's just emotionally immature, as many people in the world are, and that doesn't excuse her or mitigate the harm she did, but it does cement moral dimensions that weren't as clear before.
