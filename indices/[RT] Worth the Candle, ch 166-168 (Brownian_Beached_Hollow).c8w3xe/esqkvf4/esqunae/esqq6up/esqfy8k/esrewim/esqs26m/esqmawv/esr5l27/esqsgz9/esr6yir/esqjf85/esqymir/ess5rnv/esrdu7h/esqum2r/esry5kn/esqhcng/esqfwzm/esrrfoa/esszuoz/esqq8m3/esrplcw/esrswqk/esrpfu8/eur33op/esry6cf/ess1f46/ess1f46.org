It has been my impression that Bethel just fished Oberlin's entad out of rubble, without permission of the rest of the party.

As to why Amaryllis didn't explain, well:

- There were much more pressing issues at that time.

- How was she to know that consuming that entad would give Bethel sexual urges, instead of just a puppet to control?

- How was she to know that Bethel would be interested in having sex with anyone?

- How was she to know that Bethel didn't understand this already?

- /You/ try lecturing the murderhouse about morality.
