I've been raped, and I thought it was really interesting because tickling is my go-to comparison as well. I /hated/ being tickled as a kid, probably even moreso than I hated being raped, because at least people are likely to be reasonably sympathetic to you if you've been raped. Nobody takes a kid complaining about how much they hate being tickled seriously.

Weirdly enough though I come down more on the Pallida side of the situation, although AW did leave her actual perspective fairly ambiguous which does a lot to allow her to represent a wide range of possible other viewpoints on the topic. I was very glad that AW did lampshade that it was possible to perceive the situation differently, instead of having the group have a monolithic and uniform perspective. Good for realism, especially in what should be a very culturally diverse place like Aerb.
