Also they gave Bethel a body without considering the physical urges impact on her mental health.

If we take her word that she didn't want to hurt him then she was overwhelmed by lust? Who's responsible for not checking for that? Imagine being a house and then suddenly you have this new urge you can't control which makes you ignore someone you care about say no. The mental trauma could be severe of course its unclear what the reason was since AW didn't state even her professed reason for ignoring him saying no.

There's the larger implication that no one spoke to Bethel about consent and how it works which is ridiculous since Amy did it for Val and they basically have all raised Bethel from what she was like when they found her.

Considering she was basically mentally insane she's their responsibility and I want to know what they did or more likely didn't do that led her to rape.

I don't understand the conversation with her because she quickly seems to understand its wrong but she doesn't ever ask why. If she knows why then why did she do it to begin with?
