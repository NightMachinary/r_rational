I definitely enjoy taking the unusual stances. Even in this thread I've had dozen different explanations for Bethel with varying degrees of maliciousness.

I agree with your last sentence, however your point and another user has made reminded me just how evil an act this is.

If Bethel did understand it then she was doing much worse than most simple humans who have only signals to go on. Bethel can see all the internal turmoil of Joon and keep raping him regardless.

It means that her utility function isn't what she says at all.

In fact if what you say is true she is so responsible that she's realistically lying to Val. She does want to harm Joon and her owners and everything seems to demonstrate that she is a sadist house which is bizarre but put it down to entad mergers.

Regardless how do you stop someone being a sadist? Val telling Bethel that Joon was hurt is pointless since Bethel knows that she raped him and knows that rape is damaging and did it deliberately.

The only solution is to draw clear lines with Bethel about the extent of her sadism. If she wants to maximise her pleasure you need to tell her what actions will result in being killed so she can properly map her utility.

In particular the response to killing her for raping him only is a reasonable punishment if she knew that. Then it would actually serve as a deterrent. If however they're not doing it for punishment but as preventative then that's fine if a bit over the top.

If no one told Bethel they'd kill her for raping then she probably was pretty confident she could get away with torturing Joon as she tortures Mary and it looks like she was right about that. She predicted they wouldn't instantly kill her and now she got to try out rape.
