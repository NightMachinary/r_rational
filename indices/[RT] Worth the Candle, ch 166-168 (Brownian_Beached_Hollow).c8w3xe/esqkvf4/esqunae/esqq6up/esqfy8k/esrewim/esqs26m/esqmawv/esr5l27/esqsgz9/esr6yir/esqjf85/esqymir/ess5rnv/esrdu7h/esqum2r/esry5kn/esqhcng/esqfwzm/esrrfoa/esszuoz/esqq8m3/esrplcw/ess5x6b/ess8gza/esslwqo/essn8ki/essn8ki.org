I do see where you're coming from, but looking at comments every time it happens as well as news stories, I can't really blame the writers (the good ones you mentioned anyway) for it. No matter how many stories do this kind of thing, there will always be new readers who only start thinking about it because of that specific story. As long as it isn't handled poorly I don't feel like it can be in too many stories.

With all that said, I do also think that I would be happier if this wasn't the main focus of another bunch of chapters.

P.S. I do feel like this story thread fits entirely with the theme of “broken and damaged people parade and the traumas they suffer” in this story.
