mmm, I think its more that Amy sees it as Rape. Or put another way; if Bethel goes and tortures June or kills a bunch of her friends, she would react in the same way even if Bethel couldn't really know at the time why that was so wrong. Also I guess since even if to bethel it isn't much, it is a big deal to June, and Amy knows it, so it being supportive and she loves him so of course she would support him.
