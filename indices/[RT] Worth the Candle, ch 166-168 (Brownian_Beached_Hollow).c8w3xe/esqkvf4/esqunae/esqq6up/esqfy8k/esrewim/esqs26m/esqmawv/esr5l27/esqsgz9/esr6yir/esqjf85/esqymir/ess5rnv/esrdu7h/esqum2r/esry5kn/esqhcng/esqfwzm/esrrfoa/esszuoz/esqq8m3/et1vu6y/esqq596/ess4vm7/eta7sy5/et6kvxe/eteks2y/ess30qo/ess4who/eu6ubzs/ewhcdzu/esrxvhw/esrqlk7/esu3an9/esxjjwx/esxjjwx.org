This event is one of the things i hate about d&d and fantazy in general.

We have no explanation on Bethel. People are guided by known psychology, and rest of the races have similar behavior granted by them from evolution. But we have no idea what guides Bethel, and neither does Joon or Mary. And yet they adopted her, traveled with her, empowered her and introduced her to civilization. Even after shes shown clear anti social tendencies. Any rational inteligent being should know right away that you do not trust completely alien entity with unknown motivation. Yet Joon trusted her. It could be the author knows whats hes doing and having Joon being ulitmate villian, or he just made MC complete idiot for no apparent reason and just be it a plot device. Its almost always the latter, but i hope its the former so i make analysis based on it.
