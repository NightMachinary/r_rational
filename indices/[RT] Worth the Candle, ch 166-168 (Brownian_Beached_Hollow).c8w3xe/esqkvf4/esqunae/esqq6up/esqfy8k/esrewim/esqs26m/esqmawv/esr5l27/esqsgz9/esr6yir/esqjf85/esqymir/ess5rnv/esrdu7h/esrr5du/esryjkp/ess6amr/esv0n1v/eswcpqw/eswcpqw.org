I...you do realize that this exact situation happens with people (aside from the “reading body functions and inhuman intelligence”) right? People who know about consent plan things out and become sure that the other person will like it an be happy, and then think that the other person saying “no” just doesn't really mean it.

Strip away the fantastical elements and the exact situation described in the book happens in the real world, and it happens a lot. The reason I described things like I did in my comment was to draw parallels to real world events.
