It's always interesting reading your comments, because they will reliably be contrarian.

Bethel in not "just a house". She is a sapient being. She has access to a sensorium so vast as to be effectively region-locked omniscience. She spent decades (centuries?) with heroes and villains and normal people. She has observed countless interactions among humans and other races. She has a wide array of information to draw on when she needs to make moral evaluations and has undoubtedly heard hundreds of people talking about power dynamics, the feeling of love, the experience of sex, and the powerful negative reactions when those things go badly.

Also: Uther raped her.

Uther forced her to create a body-simulation and have sex with him. Afterwards, he threatened her with destruction if she ever told anyone. She didn't like the feeling of being forced to do that. She was afraid when he threatened her. That's the sort of thing that makes a sensible person take care in situations where sex is involved.

In short: She's very smart. She knows that being raped is unpleasant and frightening. She has had more than enough time and data to understand human interactions. She knew, based on her sensorium, that Joon was upset and unhappy about her proposal even if there was some arousal as well. Despite all that, she went ahead anyway.

Now, you can and probably will find excuses for those things. Let me see if I can steelman them and respond:

- Just because she's seen hundreds or thousands of people talking about power and sex and love and rape is no reason that she would have viscerally understood those things. After all, she's a house. She doesn't have the squishy bits that make those things meaningful.

She demonstrably did understand that being raped and threatened was unpleasant. She should not have inflicted that unpleasantness on others.

- She had just received a body for the first time and was overwhelmed by lust. She was out of control and it's not her fault.

I find this wildly unlikely, but let's roll with it. Assume it's correct, what are the implications? Answer: Anytime Bethel gains access to a new feeling or experience, she may go out of control and harm one of her inhabitants. Therefore, it is not safe to live in her or associate with her. Furthermore, it is not safe for other people to live in her either.

When a human rapes someone and then successfully uses the insanity defense, they don't get off scot free. They get locked up in order to protect the rest of future society from them. There is no way to lock Bethel up, meaning that she must be destroyed in order to protect the rest of future society from her.

- She mistakenly thought that Joon was into it. Sexual arousal and fear can look similar.\\

That is only true for humans and their limited senses. Bethel can literally see inside your body. She has a level of body-reading rivaled only by Val's devil abilities.

At the end of the day, either Bethel is a sapient being with a moral compass or she's not. If she is then she shouldn't have done this and punishment is appropriate. If she isn't then there's nothing wrong with destroying her.
