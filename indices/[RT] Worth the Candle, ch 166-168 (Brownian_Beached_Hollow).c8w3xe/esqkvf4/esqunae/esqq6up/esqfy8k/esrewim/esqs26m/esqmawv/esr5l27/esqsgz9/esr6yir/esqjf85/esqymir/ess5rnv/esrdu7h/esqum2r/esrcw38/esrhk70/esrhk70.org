Again I really don't want to get trapped into defending her, and I wouldn't even try at all if she was a human, even a human who had been though the abuse that she had, because she would still have common ground in that case. But she isn't a human at all she isn't even biological. She has never been biological.

People expect her to be able to understand human behavior like she's a ghost of a human that is possessing the house, but that's not what it's like at all. The only thing she knows about humans is what she has learned from observing them and guessing about why they do things, and also, uh, killing them for like a hundred years. It would be like if crystalline aliens billions of years from now found a digital copy of your brain and used it as an AI program to run a house for some reason and eventually over a long period of time you were able to start to think you understood the crystals a little by observing the ones that lived in your house-body and you noticed that they communicated with each other through different colors and that if two crystals shone a certain wavelength of purple light into each other they bonded and appeared to enjoy each others company more. So eventually you met a crystal who helped you and made your life better, and you wanted that crystal to understand how much you liked them so you shine the correct wavelength of purple light into them, but instead of making them happy it ends up making them afraid of you and now they hate you. Because observation and guesswork isn't enough.

Except in this example you would still have a huge leg up on Bethel because you had memories of your life and even if you couldn't correctly map your motivations and desires and drives 1:1 onto the crystals you at least have as starting point. Bethel never had anything like that. She's never been horny or hungry or sleepy or anything, she started out as a house.
