I don't think Bethel actually cared about what Uther's sexual behavior towards her illusory projection of a person. What she didn't like was being stuffed with entads, threatened. So it's possible the parallel isn't obvious to her. (She's unaware that Joon was threatened by the implications of her power).

It's moot though - the problem is her overall moral alignment, starting from when she used to torture and kill people (which, lest we forget, was a lot more evil than anything she is doing right now) means that she doesn't care about Joon as himself, but rather what he represents - a person who wants to live in her and care for her and love her. Ropey may have shifted this to an extent. But in general, people can improve, but I don't know if they can't go from cold blooded murderers to self aware and sensitive to others needs and respectful of consent.
