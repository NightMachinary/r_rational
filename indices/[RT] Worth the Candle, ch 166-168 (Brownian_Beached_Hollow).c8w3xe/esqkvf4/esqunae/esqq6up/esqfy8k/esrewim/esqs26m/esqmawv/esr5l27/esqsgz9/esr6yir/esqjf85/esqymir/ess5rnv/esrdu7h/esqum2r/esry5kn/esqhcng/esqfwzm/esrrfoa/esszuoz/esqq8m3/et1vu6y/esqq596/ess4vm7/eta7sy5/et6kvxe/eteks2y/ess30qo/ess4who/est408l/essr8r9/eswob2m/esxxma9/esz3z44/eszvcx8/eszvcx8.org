  Also: Uther raped her.

That's a blatant misrepresentation. She emphatically did not care about, nor was she particularly affected by, providing Uther with holographic force-sex - any more than the typical human would care about, say, their character in an MMORPG being raped. Uther did go on to threaten, coerce and violate her autonomy, as a consequence of how much weight he put on it, and that /was/ terrible and traumatizing in a way that's reasonably analogous. Keeping in mind that the act itself was in fact meaningless to her, the nature of the violations (Uther of her, her of Juniper) were substantially different enough that we can't just say "she knows what it's like" and be done with it. (For the record, she was explicitly unaware that Juniper was feeling fear at the moment - perhaps because several emotions are chemically similar, or because he was using multithreading to suppress outward response.)

Further, you may be overestimating the depth of her experience of humans. While she is five hundred years old, a significant fraction of that was spent in the boundless pit, mutilating various invaders. Of the remainder, she was for a long time a severely limited intelligence, with limited or no ability to grasp the subtleties of human interactions. Then, her residents were often Penndraigs, who could hardly be role models. Hells, considering how socially regressive Aerb is as a whole, compared to the modern West, I'd sooner expect Bethel to have heard talks on "how to grit your teeth through your wedding night" than on the importance of affirmative consent.
