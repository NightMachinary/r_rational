Piggyback means the same for me, arms on shoulder, a girl with her legs on your shoulders would just be on your shoulders. It must be regional. I also know playing chicken with girls on your shoulders in the water to involve trying to remove the other parties top, but that's clearly not the context of the game here and it would be really inappropriate.
