In case you missed them, you can read some thoughts on adapating /Worth the Candle/ for tabletop games [[http://thingswhichborepeople.blogspot.com/2019/06/thoughts-on-adapting-worth-candle-for.html][here]] (entads, exclusions, tattoo magic, blood magic, bone magic) and [[http://thingswhichborepeople.blogspot.com/2019/06/thoughts-on-adapting-worth-candle-for_27.html][here]] (flower magic, pustule magic, druids), with more to follow if/when I feel compelled. This is the kind of junk that I post to [[/r/alexanderwales]].

WRT content warnings: My standard policy is not to use them for this story. On AO3, this fiction is marked "Creator Chose Not to Use Archive Warnings" and on RoyalRoad it's marked "Profanity, Gore, Sexual Content, Traumatizing Content", which was as many warning tags as they had. There was no warning for extended discussion of suicide in previous chapters, nor for discussion of sexual violence in ch 98, nor for statutory rape in 121, nor for the rather persistent and extreme levels of gore, violence, and existential horror elsewhere in the story. I've been hoping that "there are no trigger warnings" is enough, but I might put that in bigger letters in the summary, or lay out my policy there. I generally think that trigger warnings are helpful, but that they also act as spoilers, and I would rather turn away people who need trigger warnings without giving a reason than provide trigger warnings on specific chapters and/or for the work in general. (There's also the problem of providing a frame to chapters that doesn't exist within the text of the chapter itself.)

I'll /probably/ be adding a text doc that links to an exhaustive, spoilery list of stuff that happens and in which chapters, but it's low priority, and will probably be crowd-sourced, since there's a lot of story and I don't know exactly where people draw their lines.
