I was thinking, how could this be easily crowdsorced: After all, we'd need a document that's (ideally) editable by many people, or at least editable and commentable, and won't be taken down? Took me a while to realize this, but maybe this reddit thread could be this thing - or at least a start^^

So, provisional content notices (and spoilers) ahead! Once with each chapter and content notice behind a separate spoiler notice, so people can choose how far they want to be spoiled, and then all at once.

Currently my list entails:

General: Violence, Gore

Ch006 Discussion of Rape

Ch025 Discussion of Physical Child Abuse

Ch041 Discussion of Rape

Ch090 Discussion of Torture ("Enhanced Interrogation")

Ch092 Discussion of Rape

Ch098 Discussion of Sexual Violence

Ch113 Psychological torture

Ch121 Discussion of Statutory rape

Ch137 Discussion of Suicide

Ch164 Non-consensual sex

Ch166 Discussion of non-consensual sex

Ch167 Discussion of non-consensual sex

Ch168 Discussion of non-consensual sex

â€‹

Edit: and the whole list at once, although I can't get it to format like I want to... oh well:

General: Violence, Gore; Ch6 Discussion of Rape; Ch25 Discussion of Physical Child Abuse; Ch41 Discussion of Rape; Ch90 Discussion of Torture ("Enhanced Interrogation"); Ch92 Discussion of Rape; Ch98 Discussion of Sexual Violence; Ch113 Psychological torture; Ch121 Discussion of Statutory rape; Ch137 Discussion of Suicide; Ch164 Non-consensual sex; Ch166 Discussion of non-consensual sex; Ch167 Discussion of non-consensual sex; Ch168 Discussion of non-consensual sex
