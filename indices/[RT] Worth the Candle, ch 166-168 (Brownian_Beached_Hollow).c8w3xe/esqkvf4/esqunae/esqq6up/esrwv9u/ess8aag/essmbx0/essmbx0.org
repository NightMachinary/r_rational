I don't think it is entirely futile... After Chapter 162 I'm pretty sure Woodworking 100 would be excluded. On the other hand, Star Magic seems to deal with (extra-)dimensional spaces, which I'm guessing also includes portals, while Horticulture deals in some way with connections, plants and land, both of which are important for the locus.

Also, the most powerful aspects of Star Magic, Soul Magic and Horticulture probably ARE already excluded, at least that's my best guess for the City Made Manifest (aka, I think, the domain of Caldwell Gatesmith) and the lands of Pai Shep, so there exists

- some information on what they do, namely, portals into the soul and "fields impeccable, power absolute".
- a quest, and presumably a reward for ending the exclusion zones - if Juniper can break the exclusion on emporsened exclusion zones, he may be able to use the excluded aspects. Of course, there I agree, that's guesswork and a pretty big if^^ Much depends on how the game layer interacts with the exclusionary principle on emporsened exclusion zones... Maybe kill Captain Blue-in-the-bottle to see what the quest text says (also, killing him might help with getting Fenn back)?
