With regards to the locus, I think between Star Magic 100 (Edit: Assuming that's what allows portals), Horticulture 100, the Doe virtures, and maybe working with/killing Pai Shep and/or Manifest (who I think it's implied is Caldwell Gatesmith as well), there should be something to open up a portal to the bottle and establish a connection to the outside.

Of course, the exclusion zones are pretty high level quests, killing the excluded seemed a lot more doable with Prince's, and working with them will probably take Valencia, but Valencia will (hopefully?) come back, and if Juniper matches the excluded in skill, maybe it's possible. Although it sure would be helpful to have the manual to know what benefits would apply, and if it was even worth it^^

Then again, all these seem to miss the personal touch, so maybe additionally Juniper has to learn to accept the locus' way of thinking on some level and become a druid, which would make Amarillys (and probably Grak by then) into druids and get around the problem of there not being enough druids for the locus to expand...
