The thing I really like about this story is how well thought out the plot threads are. When Bethel was first introduced, she was antagonistic for all kinds of reasons and that was continuously demonstrated in her behavior. I kinda wondered what the point was, why was cthulhuraejepsen drawing this out rather than just fixing it. Make Bethel like everyone and play nice, use her unique powers to their fullest so the story could go on.

But nope, the plan the entire time, all those chapters of uncomfortable interactions, was to resolve it in this really complex way that helped everyone grow as characters. It helped Valencia grow since Juniper was trusting her again to use her powers, and gives her a new plot thread of living in the relocated Bethel. It helped Amaryllis grow in her relationship with Juniper, both romantically as well as trusting each other to rely on to solve problems. It gave Bethel a whole new dimension, she does truly care about the people living in her and is willing to recognize that she's wrong and change. And obviously it adds a huge amount of depth to Juniper with a very nuanced subject.

Not to mention that it's going to make the actual story more interesting since they don't have a super house at their immediate beck and call for the foreseeable future. I'm really interested to he ends up resolving the Locus question. I hope it's not just as getting the level 20 virtue and clicking whatever that button is.
