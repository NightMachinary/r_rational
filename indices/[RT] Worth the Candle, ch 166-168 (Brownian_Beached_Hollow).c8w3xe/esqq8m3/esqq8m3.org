I am wary of saying this, but I do want to express my opinion on the subject. I /desperately/ wish that rape hadn't happened. I did not particularly want to read an entire update more or less dedicated to managing the fallout of a rape. Of course, setting that bias aside, the execution was high quality as usual. I read the chapters and would even say I enjoyed them. But I would have vastly, /vastly/ preferred to read an entire update about pretty much any other possible plot thread. Even another thread dedicated to Bethel being an inhuman monster fumbling her way through human interaction, as long as it wasn't about rape.

I've just read enough rape story arcs for a lifetime. I dunno whether that means "I read too much fiction that relies on the rape card" or "I have unusually low tolerance for the rape card" but the difference is minimal in practice. I'm tired of seeing the formula play out. The victim getting all fucked up, the support network helping them out, the perpetrator either being brought to justice or redeemed. I've seen these steps too many times for them to have any novelty, and I just don't find them interesting at all without that novelty to distract me.

I'm still a huge fan of the story and will absolutely keep devouring every new update, but I will be extremely happy to put this arc behind us and move on to literally anything else.
