You make some solid points here. A fair number of angles I didn't consider.

With 2 I agree especially if that's their logic then I think it's absurd to jump to killing her because she raped Joon. She's torturing Mary and no one suggested that they should kill her because of that.

If we're going to treat Bethel as a malicious maximiser then they should have made a clear line and told her about what she does that will make them kill her.

Tell her that if she raped one of them they'd kill her. Or work out a negotiation so she can contribute to the end of the world. Murder is so unMary (in terms of sacrifice for utility)

The problem is if Bethel is meant to be like that they're not treating her like that. In fact none of their approaches are consistent with any sort of concept of Bethel. They're trying to morally convince her now but how does that make any sense?

I previously spoke about Bethel's alien nature and how you couldn't trust any presentation of her many chapters ago.

If point three happened, that is sexual desire overwhelmed Bethel then she is a victim too. Her ability to control herself and make decisions was stripped from her.

The entad she picked up was because they forced her to go on the mome rath mission.

However I will say that it's not at all house like to fuck your owners so I don't get where this is coming from unless it was all the physical body.

At the end of the day we always knew sex with Bethel was on the cards because of the quests. Everyone knows about them and the fact that no one thought of speaking to the often homicidal and alien house about what consent is and how to conduct this stuff seems rather lax of them.

Honestly I hope they tell the doe about consent because I highly expect her to rape Joon next, not like animals understand rape though just like houses don't. Again we know the quest. Clearly if they didn't speak to Bethel I doubt they told the doe.
