I think your idea that Amaryllis/the group failed to do the 'simple' task of teaching Bethel about consent ignores the reality of the group's relationship with Bethel.

Bethel has been perpetrating (non-sexual) consent violations against everyone from the very beginning. Most recently not leaving Amaryllis alone to sleep when she asked for it. There are countless others but I don't have time to do a thorough re-read. I also can't remember whether anyone ever said something like "this sort of thing isn't OK" - maybe yes maybe no. If no, I can still perfectly predict Bethel's reaction as "trololol I do what I want". She is absolutely not open to point-blank moralising. I would argue that Mary and Joon have been trying pretty hard with the more roundabout moralising that she actually might deign to listen to. But clearly that wasn't enough.

So you might suggest they should never have added her to the party in the first place. And to an extent I agree - I never liked the idea of adding in a murderous sadist with more power than the rest of the group combined who could potentially just kill or torture all of them whenever she liked. Tragic backstory or no, it certainly doesn't justify what she's done, and it doesn't make her any less dangerous or volatile. And very little since then has really changed my view there.

However, there are mitigating factors to that decision:

1. The game interface. It identified Bethel as a companion. The narrative consequences could be dire if they didn't take her in. And the very nature of the loyalty system suggested that she could be reformed/improve/whatever. Not to mention that up to this point, no companion has ever non-consensually harmed another/Joon while not being mind controlled. So they had a strong prior from all this that "it would be ok".
2. The meta-narrative. They are facing stronger and stronger threats, and hope to be able to save the world from them, empty the Hells, and make reality safe, etc. and they pass up the most powerful potential member of their group they've yet encountered? All it takes is a single apocalypse that they couldn't have averted without Bethel (Mome Rath), and any concerns about the dangers of having her in the group are, in the grand scheme of things, made redundant.
3. Actual signs of improvement. Her marriage to Ropey, which did seem to settle her a little. Sometimes actually respecting people's stated boundaries. It genuinely did seem that she was improving.

Now in my mind, this is not an easily-forseen outcome. You have to connect all of the following:

- "Bethel picked up the Oberlin-dummy entad" (did anyone actually know this, or did she just do it at some point in the chaos without telling anyone? My money is on the latter)
- "The Oberlin-dummy entad can give Bethel sexual feeling/desire" - not something at all obvious from what has been seen of it
- "Sexual desire can overwhelm Bethel, a house with about 8000 other senses that she explicitly stated were overwhelming her before she got an entad that stopped senses being overwhelming to her"
- "When sexual desire overwhelms Bethel, she'll want to have sex with Juniper" - okay, Mary and Joon might have been able to see this, but even then it's not totally obvious
- "When a lustful Bethel wants to have sex with Juniper, she won't take no for an answer" - potentially forseeable, given her numerous non-sexual consent violations, but it's clear from Bethel's statements in 168 that she didn't consider his no a 'real' no, implying that she does understand she shouldn't do it if the no was 'real'.

I just don't think it's reasonable that anybody could have forseen this. Even if they had, I don't think targeted moralising works on Bethel, so I dispute they could have "taught her about consent", a thing the ignoring of which seems to be one of her primary pleasures. And lastly I dispute that not accepting Bethel into the group is a "safe" decision in this world and this narrative for this group. The group is not stupid, and there was not an easy answer/preventative to what happened.
