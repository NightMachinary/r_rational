  At the end of the day, either Bethel is a sapient being with a moral compass or she's not. If she is then she shouldn't have done this and punishment is appropriate. If she isn't then there's nothing wrong with destroying her.

I really like how Bethel's personhood is not even questioned, and the entire group is not hung up on the punishment / "justice" thing. That is, the story is about healing and how to move forward from this event.

Punishment is fleetingly mentioned (and should be, narratively speaking, for reader's sake, since so many real life people would consider it). Different reinterpretations are explicitly non-discussed (Pallida mentions it, and is shut down by "discussing this is not productive"). Revenge fantasies are indulged (being angry and fantasizing about how to blow up bethel is not crazy).

And in the end, everyone acts sane so far. The victim's feelings are validated and his support group assembles. A trusted mediator is chosen. The perpetrator is not immediately cast out forever (Val: "you are still my friend"). Instead, Bethel is immediately temporarily separated, to begin the process of figuring out to what extent healing / reintegration is possible (if at all). It is acknowledged that this is a process with open end, on all sides (including the crew, Joon, and Bethel).

This arc is not just about our crew on Aerb, it is also about how close-knit groups of people can deal with that kind of thing. After initial reservations, I am actually happy with how [[/u/cthulhuraejepsen]] traded off perceived slight OOC-ness (at least from my reading) for more real-world relevance. To me, the last two chapters were super positive in their outlook.

[[/u/cthulhuraejepsen]] : You surely used for inspiration an amalgam of personal experience from people in your extended circle of acquaintances, half-remembered literature and explicitly remembered literature (e.g. other fics/stories/books that prompted you to mentally said "my characters would do this thing differently, but should learn from that thing", or serious blog posts or literature a la hypothetical "How anarchist communities should deal with rape: Ideals and Experiences from xyz").

Could you post some links for the "explicitly remembered literature" category that inspired this arc?
