There are a couple of relevant parts of the text. Her history with Uther is first told in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/33465051][Chapter 92]]. The scene in particular is towards the end, but the beginning also has some conversation on how he forcibly added entads to her. Her perspective is repeated, and reinforced, when they first meet Raven in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/37423922][Chapter 122]]:

  Bethel held out a hand, and Uther appeared above it, a talking head speaking with restrained fury.

  “If you speak about this to anyone, whisper so much as a word, I'll return here and start ripping away every piece of you. I'll smash your windows and tear up your floorboards. Your power? I'll load you with so many entads you won't be able to think, let alone speak. There are dark and twisted items of power, and I've been collecting the worst of them for quite some time, horrible things that would warp you beyond all recognition. Don't so much as think my name, do you understand?” I didn't know how close to the truth that actually was, since by her own admission her intellect and memory hadn't been fully formed at that point, but he was nearly snarling. He seemed ready to launch into something else, another threat from the look on his face, but Bethel waved the image away like it was a cloud of smoke.

  “Strange, to me, how important the act is to mortals,” said Bethel. “It was meaningless to me, and still is, but you care more about the images I projected with one power and the force I applied with another than his threats to me, or the decades of isolation he enforced. He deprived me of purpose, he refused to be my master, and it's the ephemeral, simulated flesh that makes you cringe in horror. No, don't speak.”
