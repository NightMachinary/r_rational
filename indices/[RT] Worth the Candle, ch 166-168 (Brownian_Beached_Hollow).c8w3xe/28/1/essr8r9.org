I'm pretty apologetic when it comes to Bethel, but comparing her to a dog is /not/ the way you should treat her.

If you compare her to a dog, you won't live. Fair enough. So she wants to be treated like a person, therefore she /is/ a person and a moral agent.

She has wronged at least 3 party members. She needs to own these wrongdoings and start fixing them. The good news is that she had displayed a positive dynamic in the past. The bad news, I think, her reaction in the last chapter was caused by selfishness first and genuine remorse second. Simply put she wants to be inhabitated and she realized that she's just scared away her inhabitants. It would be hard for her to reform and even harder to prove that she truly does (if she does it).

Her litmus test, I feel, would be letting Uther go. If Joon & co were letting her live in exile after what she'd done she must let Uther go, on her own.
