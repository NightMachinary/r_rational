This is just on the border of me not knowing if this pun was intentional or not.

For trigger warnings, I think it was Wildbow who had a disclaimer saying something along the lines of "if you are worried about trigger warnings then this is not the story for you" or something to that effect, and I've always liked that phrasing. It makes it abundantly clear what you're saying about the work without giving away spoilers in regards to when and what happens.
