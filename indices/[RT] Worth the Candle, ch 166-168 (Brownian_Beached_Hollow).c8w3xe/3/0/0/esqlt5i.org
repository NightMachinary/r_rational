  Readers should be cautioned that Worm is fairly dark as fiction goes, and it gets far darker as the story progresses. Morality isn't black and white, Taylor and her acquaintances aren't invincible, the heroes aren't winning the war between right and wrong, and superpowers haven't necessarily affected society for the better. Just the opposite on every count, really. Even on a more fundamental level, Taylor's day to day life is unhappy, with her clinging to the end of her rope from the story's outset. The denizens of the Wormverse (as readers have termed it) don't pull punches, and I try to avoid doing so myself, as a writer. There's graphic language, descriptions of violence and sex does happen (albeit offscreen). It would be easier to note the trigger warnings that don't apply than all the ones that do.

  All in all, this probably isn't a story for the sensitive or the young. I'd peg it with a PG-18 rating, but I think we all know that there's kids who can handle that sort of thing and there's adults who can't. Use your best judgement and ask in the comments below if you're still unsure.

  If I haven't scared you off yet, you can begin reading Taylor's story here. Enjoy.

The warning before Worm, for the record.
