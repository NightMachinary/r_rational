  All that said, be warned -- from the beginning of the story, Taylor is dealing with bullying, and it affects her more than in the thirty seconds of movie or two panels of comic that Peter Parker deals with being shoved against a locker by Flash. Taylor finds escape in her costume and superpowers, but that world isn't without it's problems either. Supervillains (and superheroes!) don't always pull their punches and people can die, or worse. All of this in mind, it probably isn't a story for the sensitive or the young. I'd tentatively peg it with a PG-13 warning. That said, given that the story isn't entirely written (It's my hope, as mentioned earlier, that you, the audience, will help shape it with your feedback), I can't definitively say how things will go or what rating the story would wind up with. Fair warning.

This is the warning from early 2012.

  Readers should be cautioned that Worm is fairly dark as fiction goes, and it gets far darker as the story progresses. Morality isn't black and white, Taylor and her acquaintances aren't invincible, the heroes aren't winning the war between right and wrong, and superpowers haven't necessarily affected society for the better. Just the opposite on every count, really. Even on a more fundamental level, Taylor's day to day life is unhappy, with her clinging to the end of her rope from the story's outset. The denizens of the Wormverse (as readers have termed it) don't pull punches, and I try to avoid doing so myself, as a writer. There's graphic language, descriptions of violence and sex does happen (offscreen). It would be easier to note the trigger warnings that don't apply than all the ones that do.

  All in all, this probably isn't a story for the sensitive or the young. I'd peg it with a PG-15 or PG-18 rating, but I think we all know that there's kids who can handle that sort of thing and there's adults who can't. Use your best judgement and ask in the comments below if you're still unsure.

  If I haven't scared you off yet, you can begin reading Taylor's story here. Enjoy.
