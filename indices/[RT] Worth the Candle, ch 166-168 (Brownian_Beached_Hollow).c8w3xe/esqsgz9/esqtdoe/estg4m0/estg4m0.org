This is underselling her power. The fiction makes it very clear that Val is leaving cracks on purpose. Its doesn't go into detail about what fixing things more completely would entail, but it admits that Val knows that there are words that could be said that would mend bridges. Those words may be inhumane, abusive and fundamentally opposed to the values of everyone involved, but the author isn't pretending they don't exist to justify this development, he's leading us to accept this outcome because it's what agrees with our values.
