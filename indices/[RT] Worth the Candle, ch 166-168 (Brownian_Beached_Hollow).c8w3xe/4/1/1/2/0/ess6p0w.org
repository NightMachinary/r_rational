I'm not really sure what we are disagreeing on here, as you said its the same thing to bethel, and both are consent violations and morally wrong. I was simply using the example of tickling to show how the "lets kill her" reaction would be completely not understandable to her, even if she knew about consent. To her it probably looks like a minor infraction, even if she acknowlages she did something wrong, and as you said she has no reason not to think so.
