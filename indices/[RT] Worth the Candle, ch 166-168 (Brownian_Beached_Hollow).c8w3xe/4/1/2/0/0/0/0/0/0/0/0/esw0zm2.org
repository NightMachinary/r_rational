Or, like it says Bethel thought in the chapter, he wants to say yes and will appreciate it but feels he shouldn't say yes and is putting up just a token resistance.

Bethel is probably the "smartest" party member at least in pure knowledge base wise, maybe behind Palladia or Raven. Bethel knows what consent is and isn't trying to hurt Joon. I think she honestly thought that ignoring him saying no would not only be better for him but would be something he would appreciate in the end.
