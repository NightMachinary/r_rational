  Either she's like a pet dog who shat in the house and no one told her that it wasn't acceptable and now she got shouted at she wants to make up for it.

#+end_quote

No one "gave" her a real body. The entad that let her do it was "emergency rescued" into her during the aftermath of Mome Rath. I'm 99% sure the thought process there was "we should keep this safe" rather than "this will buff Bethel".
