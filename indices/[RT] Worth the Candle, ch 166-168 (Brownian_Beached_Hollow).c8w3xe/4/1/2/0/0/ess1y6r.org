There's a lot of real life human women who don't seem to understand/believe that an erection does not equal eager consent. Bethel is a /house/, and no one was really responsible for humanizing her, and even if someone were, "advanced civilized sex etiquette" is going to be a low-priority lesson for an apparently asexual /house/.

  Even then if she thinks arousal means consent then what did she think the no was for?

I think she thought he was just being a midwestern prude, saying 'no' because he was supposed to, when really he was /obviously/ DTF.

To be clear, I'm not saying Bethel didn't do anything wrong. I'm saying it was more an error of understanding than an act of malice.
