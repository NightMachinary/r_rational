I really like how you handle this arc.

Amaryllis reaction and dialog sounded slightly OOC for me, but I can't really put the finger on it. Part of it is that I think Amaryllis or Valencia should have brought up the "this is a tragedy" framing in 167. Part of it is that Amaryllis should take more time to digest the situation. Say,

  “And if you tell her, so what?” asked Amaryllis. “You think that's going to solve anything? You think that she's going to agree, to understand that she hurt you? You think that this is going to help her grow and change as a person? Even if it did, Christ Juniper, she broke trust, and you've been miserable for the last three days, I can only imagine, are you -- do you think that you can keep living inside of her, knowing how much she can see, knowing that she might break trust again just because she likes to pull our strings?”

Amaryllis dialog is laser-focused on "validate Joon's feelings". Given the Amaryllis we have seen so far, this should not be her instinctive reaction; it should be "Shit. Hug Joon, don't rush things". Instead, it is Amaryllis who argues against the more reconcillatory approach that is taken in the end.

On the other side, I don't really agree with Valencia not pushing back against the "punishment" and "culpability" lines in 168. We get told that she is afraid of Bethel's immediate reaction; she could have said "This is not about punishment, it is about healing" and deferred the culpability discussion to the coming weeks/months in exile. So I'd like a bit of internal monologue that explains why she chooses to open that can of worms right now.

I do get the narrative need though, and this is a minor nit to pick in an otherwise awesome arc.
