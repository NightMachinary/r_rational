Same, the way rape was handled here is really unusual for me. I read a lot of fantasy, and while rape/threat of rape do pop up occasionally, usually it's just some variant of "look at this evil dude being really evil, doing evil things". This is true usually even with woman-authored fantasy (e.g. Wandering Inn). Nowhere close to the more subtle situation with a potentially redeemable character that has been the case here.
