She wanted it and genuinely thought he did too. She thought he was being weird and prudish and she knew for a fact that it was pleasurable to him.

The very simple truth for why a lot of horrible things happen despite there not being any/much malice behind it is that people sometimes plan out an idea of what's going to happen and stick to it. Bethel thought she knew what was going to happen and how it was going to turn out, she thought she could get what she wanted and Joon would be happy once it was done. Then there was an obstacle and Bethel rationalized it. She could even tell that he was receiving pleasure so her rationalization made sense. While it was a much lesser degree, I have personally experienced this many times before and I think almost everyone has, if not personally then on a macro level.

Throw in the fact that Bethel doesn't really understand people's minds and that her past makes it nearly impossible for her to think of herself as someone who abuses and takes advantage of people she likes....
