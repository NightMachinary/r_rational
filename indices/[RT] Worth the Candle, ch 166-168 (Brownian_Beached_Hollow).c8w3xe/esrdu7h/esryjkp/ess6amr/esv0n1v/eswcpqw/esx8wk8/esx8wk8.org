Right and unless those people were raised in Fritz basement they know consent is and they knew they were raping someone. Saying someone will be happy afterwards makes no sense unless you don't understand what consent is

If you think Bethel knew that she was raping him then why did Bethel do it?

If she didn't know it was rape then why didn't she know what consent is?
