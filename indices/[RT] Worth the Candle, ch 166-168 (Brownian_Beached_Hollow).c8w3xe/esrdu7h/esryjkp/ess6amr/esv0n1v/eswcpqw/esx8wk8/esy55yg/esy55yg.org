I think you are vastly overestimating people. On this subreddit there were people arguing last thread that Joon wasn't raped. That isn't an anomaly, Joons fear that Amaryllis won't believe him isn't unfounded. Less than a week ago a lawyer got his client free in a rape case by arguing that it isn't rape unless it's a stranger literally holding a gun to your head and threatening you verbally.

I'd like to live in a world where it takes someone “raised in Fritzl's basement” but unfortunately it doesn't take a lot of experience with people to learn that I don't.
