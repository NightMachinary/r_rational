A few things explained by other users, first is Bethel has familiarity with rape and so knows what it's like first hand unlike most rapists who have never been raped and as you say might argue out of ignorance.

Second Bethel can see Joon more deeply than anyone so she can see the heightened fear drug flowing through him and other internal signs of rape which other people couldn't.

Third Bethel is a detached entity she is not that physical body and so unlike mortals she is not bound to the random swings of hormones that can influence humans strongly.

Fourthly as Bethel is their house she has an obligation as a house to be like a home. That is provide a safe place and satisfy all the things that you would want from a home, like not worrying about being raped. She like a wife raping husband, or a mother raping her daughter, worse than a stranger raping someone imo because there is a greater violation.

Fifthly, if Bethel understood rape then she did it anyway because she's a sadist
