I really don't think you need an exhaustive trigger warning list or anything more than a general content warning (like the one for Worm mentioned) just to accommodate fair warning for every possible reader's aversions.

Forgot to comment [[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/c2p8sy/rt_worth_the_candle_ch_162165/erlnkhb/][on the art last week]]: wanted to agree with the general sentiment that it isn't a very marketable representation of WtC. Like [[/u/erwgv3g34]], I also think it's got too strong of a W40K flair. But mostly I'm with [[/u/ashinator92]] - I think detailed facial profiles should be avoided for white-bread-with-skim-milk-Joon and most-beautiful-woman-alive-for-first-person-narrator Mary, especially for the latter if the artist can't reproduce the exact rendition in your head. Your Trapper's Daughter example seems better art-wise, with the text's vague/subjective mystique.

Have any covers/cover mock-ups been commissioned? A few months ago, for the first book's cover, I was imagining Joon's back profile peeking out from behind one of Silmar's street corner walls ([[https://previews.123rf.com/images/estradaanton/estradaanton1806/estradaanton180600157/103433797-a-picture-of-serious-bearded-man-hiding-behind-wall-and-looking-to-the-side-he-has-gun-other-two-men.jpg][iffy inspiration]], can't find anything better) with the latter half of a greater umbral hound skulking down the next street with Sorian's Castle looming in the distance.
