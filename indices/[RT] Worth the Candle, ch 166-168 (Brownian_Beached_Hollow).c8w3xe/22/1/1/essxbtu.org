Not really.

At the end of a chapter, she says:

  “And you think that I'm culpable,” said Bethel. Something in the illusion had changed, subtle little differences that together *created an impression of malice*. Bethel's eyes were more sunken, the shadows around her darker and deeper, and the incidental folds of her clothing created points, almost spikes, rather than the aesthetic curves they'd been before. Her fists weren't quite clenched, but she was showing strain in the muscles of her hands. [...] For a moment, *Bethel seemed as though she would snap*, but that moment passed, and she relaxed. “You can undo it,” she said. “Repair it, rebuild it.” [...] “Then tell me what needs to be done,” said Bethel.

That's not the attitude of someone feeling remorse, or wondering about what they should change about themselves. That's the attitude of a child who had her favorite toy taken away, and will say whatever she thinks people want her to say to get the toy back.

(but yeah, "isn't capable" is maybe an hyperbole)
