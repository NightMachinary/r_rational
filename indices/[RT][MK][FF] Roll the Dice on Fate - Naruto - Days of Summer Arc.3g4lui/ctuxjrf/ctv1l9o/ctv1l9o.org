Ah, well if every generation had a copy of Tetsuo then I think his mum would have known what to expect and spoken to him a bit while he was a baby.

Although a scenario has been described where that would be the case for subsequent generations. Wherin he basically forks himself into the heads of his kids, either later in their development as a helpful nav pixie or earlier as the controlling intelligence. No idea if it'll ever come up. At that point the story would morph from 'fight to save to world' to 'Konoha conquers the multiverse to forcibly institute human rights'.
