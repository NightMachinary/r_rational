So, Tetsuo's a cat with nine lives, eh? I wonder... If he incarnated across the multiverse, which includes Naruto, and the available universes for reincarnation are roughly symmetrical to earth, then most chakra-brain reincarnations should be babies, due to the high infant-mortality rate across history. Unless the SI chakra brain is not in fact part of the bloodline package?
