I think I found another way to win the game, via your economic system:

1. Put 100% tax on people who sell [item you need]

2. Order top level craftsman to sell you [item you need].

3. Buy [item you need].

4. Collect tax.

5. Repeat 3 and 4 until you're satisfied with the mountain of stuff you have.

Since the gods don't kill the Flobovians for producing cuirasses out of thin air, this should be okay. Also, this works with spells, since spellcasters can be hired.
