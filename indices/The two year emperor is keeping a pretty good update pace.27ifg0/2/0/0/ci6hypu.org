Well, I read far too fast anyways...

I probably will check out the spin off sometime. I've got almost nothing else to read, in any case.

I'm not familiar with D&D rules, but would it have been possible for him to make a Wish like 'I wish for a magic item that makes it impossible for any god(or servants, or demons, or whatever) to harm me,' and survive, if he did it before they got there? As I said, I don't know the rules and this may be a stupid question.
