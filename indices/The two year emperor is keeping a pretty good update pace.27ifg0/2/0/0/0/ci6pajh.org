The wording of Wish is "can create or add to the powers of a magic item". So, technically there's no rule against such an item. In practice no DM would allow it and, as an author, I can't allow it either because it would remove all the tension from the story. This is why I nerfed those Wishes as hard as I did...the ones he used have a lot of room for creative application and abuse, but they aren't so totally broken that the story ends.
