Heh. Yeah, had I pushed the "Jake Wins" button at that time, the story would be over.

As to it becoming several orders larger -- well, we are currently at the start of act 2 in a 3 act story. It's definitely going to get longer. I don't know about several orders, though.

I'm flattered that you want it, though. If you're interested, I've written a spinoff story called "One Hot Night", which is on sale for $1 over at [[http://greendogpress.blogspot.com]]. (If I get a moderate number of sales, I'll write more.) It's based on a reference that Albrecht made about his grandnephew a while ago; the blurb is something like this:

"Ingfred is a 20-something in a society of immortals. All the good jobs are taken and it's hard to be taken seriously when you are, comparatively, an infant. So, he sets out to prove himself (and get ridiculously rich in the process). His goal? Arrange to undergo an illegal transformation, then sell the memory to The Experiential Herald -- something of a tabloid -- for a ridiculous amount of money. Problem is, the transformation is illegal, so how can he convince a High Mage to do it for him? Well, first he needs to convince the High Mage's bookie to help out. Things go downhill from there."
