Most of the original third act would have been a fight scene between the kids and the Dahl characters against the forces controlled by the pickle sent to destroy the world. It was an overcomplicated wildbow parody that wasn't awful conceptually but I realized too late I didn't have the technical aptitude (or the desire) to pull off.
