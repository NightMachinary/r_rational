1. It was all for a gag.

2. Chili was originally structured into three acts, and I decided to gut most of the third and slide it in at the end of the second. Gabriel and Lee would have had more relevance in the third.

3. Gabe was my escape plan. If I decided that I didn't want to finish the story, everyone would have turned into chocolate and died. I actually wrote this ending once right after the kids entered the factory but I felt too guilty to post it.

4. The AI does come back. Mr. Gun's shoes turn into chocolate and a dripping sound is heard when Mr. Bucket plays the audio recording of Keerthi's parents' death, which is them melting into chocolate.
