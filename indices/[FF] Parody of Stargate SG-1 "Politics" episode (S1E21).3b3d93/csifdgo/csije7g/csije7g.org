  Face it, pretty much everyone on SG-1 was an idiot. They missed obvious opportunities, they did things inefficiently, and they did things that were just plain dumb.

It doesn't really excuse it, but most of this is due to the fact that it was on television. To paraphrase Dan Harmon, you can blow up the Death Star at the end of the movie, but you can't do that at the end of the television episode. People work on that Death Star, dammit. We've been following Ricky the junior officer since the first episode. He's got this will-they-won't-they thing going on with Donna, the woman who primes the torpedoes. And on network television, you can't expect that people are going to watch the episodes in order. Some of them are going to tune in, see that Ricky and Donna have both been vaporized, scratch their heads wondering what happened, and then change the channel because they're confused. So every television episode (except maybe those at the start and end of the season, or during sweeps) is going to be circular, and bring things back to where they were. Ricky and Donna are also played by actors, who have contracts, so they can't be killed.

This is compounded by the fact that many of these episodes are written in parallel, which means that you can't set them up to depend on each other without incurring a lot of costs in the case of a rewrite. That's another incentive to be static.

This adherence to formula has started to break down somewhat in recent years, but it's still a staple of many network shows that are meant to go on forever. It's /terrible/ on scifi shows, because they find some new earth-shattering thing every few weeks, and then have to go right back to the status quo.
