"We saved the planet from an alien invasion! That we technically caused! And also, if they had been smart, they still would have had time to destroy at least their 10 least favorite major population centres!"

The problem is that until they have real effective orbital defences, it's a serious issue with public morale, and once they /do/ have real, effective orbital defences it's a serious issue with the global political climate. Because like they mentioned in the episode where Daniel goes on a spirit walk via mostlyAscendedKid, orbital defenses capable of shooting down Ha'taks can also fire at ground targets with the power of very large nukes.

It just goes to prove that old Jaffa proverb: 'The best defense is a good Ha'tak.'
