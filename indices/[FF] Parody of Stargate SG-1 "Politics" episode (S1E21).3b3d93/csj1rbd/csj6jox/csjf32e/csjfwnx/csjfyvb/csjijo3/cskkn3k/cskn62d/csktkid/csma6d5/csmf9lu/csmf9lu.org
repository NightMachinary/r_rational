It exists. It's a deadfic though, the first is finished but the Stlantis based second one is not.

[[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Series-1694][XSGCOM]]

Now, it's based on the early 90's original X-com instead of the current Enemy Unknown, so some things may be different. The writing and wording is a little awkward in some places, but the plot is well thought out, and the consequences of the technologies are also excellent. Jaffa are laughable tacticians to people used to competent and deadly Sectiods.
