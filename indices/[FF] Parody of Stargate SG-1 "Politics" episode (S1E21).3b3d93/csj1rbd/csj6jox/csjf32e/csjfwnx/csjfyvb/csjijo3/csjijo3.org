Oh, yeah, I forgot about that.

Oh, man, I /totally/ need to do that episode. The whole thing will consist of:

Teal'c: Well, that was surprisingly easy.

Jack: Yeah, seriously. Glad I shot Apophis first; who would have thought he actually had a personal force shield?!

Daniel: Yeah, and it's a good thing we all stayed behind cover the whole time too. Those staff weapons are pretty powerful.

Sam: Didn't really matter, Daniel. I mean, c'mon, we were...what?...ten feet from those guys when we opened fire? We're not /stormtroopers/ for God's sake, we're trained Air Force soldiers. We can actually hit what we aim at, there were only two of the bad guys for us to take down, and they were standing right in the open!

Jack: Yeah, seriously. C'mon, let's get Apophis into the brig and grab a beer. First round's on me.
