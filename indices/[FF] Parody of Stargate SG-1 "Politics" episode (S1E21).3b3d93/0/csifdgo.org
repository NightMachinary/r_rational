I was going to enter this in the weekly "One Man Industrial Revolution" challenge, but decided to do something original instead. This wouldn't get out of my head though, so I jotted it down and kicked it out the door.

Light, fluffy, parody fix-fic of Season 1, Episode 21, 'Politics'.

Face it, pretty much everyone on SG-1 was an idiot. They missed obvious opportunities, they did things inefficiently, and they did things that were just plain dumb.

This is a rational take on S1E21; it shouldn't require much knowledge of SG-1 at all beyond "there is a Stargate and they use it to visit other planets."
