Stargate: SG1 is the fun one. The general formula is that every episode involves visiting a new planet with each season having a big bad they defeat via handwavey writing.

Stargate: Atlantis I didn't watch.

Stargate: Universe is the knockoff of Battlestar Galactica + Star Trek Voyager that will make you sad about wasted potential
