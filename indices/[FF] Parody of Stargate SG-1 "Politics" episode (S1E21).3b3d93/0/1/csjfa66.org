From a realpolitik standpoint, the whole 'hiding everything that happens from everyone up to and including actual alien assaults on the planet with goddamn spaceships' was very, very stupid, and only worked because of insane handwavium.

Especially if the survival of the planet (or entire galaxy) relied on it. Imagine how many F-304s could have been produced in the same time with the alien tech upgraded budget and industry of the whole goddamn planet, and not just a single nation (or later group of nations) black ops budget.

This isn't even mentioning the issue that could have shown up if in that episode where the Go'auld tried to plant a sleeper agent in Russia to start a nuclear war, they had instead gone for some nuke-owning nation that didn't even know they existed, like Israel or India.
