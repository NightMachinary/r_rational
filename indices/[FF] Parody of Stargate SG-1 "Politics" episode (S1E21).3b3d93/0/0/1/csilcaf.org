Oh sure, obviously. There are lots of reasons--many of them good ones--why 'Status Quo is God' is a trope. That doesn't mean I can't have fun poking at the show.

Especially in this case. This thing just /would not/ get out of my head until I wrote it down. I actually have another one of S1E20 that I haven't posted yet; I'm debating doing a single story where each chapter is the rational version of one episode. If I do that, I'd like to have the chapters in order, so I'll wait to post E20.
