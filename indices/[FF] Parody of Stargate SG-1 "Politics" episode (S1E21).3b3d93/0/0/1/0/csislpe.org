To be fair, Stargate actually /did/ follow up somewhat rationally on some of the technologies they discovered over the course of the series. Not every single one, of course, and they didn't always do so optimally, but compared to the Star Treks out there it was fantastic. They started out the series with ordinary firearms and stuff, and by the end of the series humanity was building starships that outclassed pretty much everything else out there thanks to the technology they'd picked up. They stood on relatively even ground with warships that were designed by literal /gods/.

One particular instance that comes to mind is the episode where they encounter a planet where everybody's trapped in a Matrix-like VR sim, and then a couple seasons later we discover that the Tau'ri reverse-engineered the VR technology and were using it to run training simulations.

Then there was the time they rebuilt a Death Glider, and then when that didn't work well in the episode they took it for a test-fly they switched to a Death Glider version completely from scratch (the F-302). And improved greatly on the design in the process.

Or there was that time they met a Reol in "The Fifth Man", who naturally exudes a chemical that makes people see it as someone they know and trust, and then later used that chemical to disguise Daniel as Yu's most trusted servant to infiltrate a Goa'uld summit.

Or how they accidentally learned how to play time dilation tricks with black holes and Stargates, or how to cause an active Stargate to "jump" its connection from one gate to another, and used those deliberately in later episodes.

There was a lot of good rational stuff hidden in that show, especially by the usual science fiction television baseline.
