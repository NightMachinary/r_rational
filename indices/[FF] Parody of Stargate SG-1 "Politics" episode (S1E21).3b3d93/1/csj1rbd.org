I tend to agree with people here that Stargate wasn't perfect, but they were a lot better than other shows at remembering that they had discovered useful items and using them in later episodes. And they did do some other clever things. (Stargates don't go far enough to get to the Pegasus Galaxy? Line up a string of Stargates.)

Also, if you pay attention, an astonishing number of the devices found near the start of the series were one-of-a-kind and destroyed at the end of the episode, or otherwise had some reasonable in-story explanation as to why they couldn't reuse them. (Not counting the sarcophagus and the ability to disintegrate with their weapons, which were deliberately forgotten by the writers because they really break plots.)

And remember that the start of the Stargate series was /before/ strong story arcs were as common as they are now. Shows tended to be written as standalone episodes so that you could watch them in any order in syndication.
