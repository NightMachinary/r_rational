I don't know if anyone has read it, but a couple years ago the Atlantic published a fascinating literary deconstruction of one of the most polarizing Star Trek episodes.

The author's thesis is basically that in Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra, the Tamarians aren't really communicating with myths. Myths are basically function calls for various stratagems, and the story is less important than the strategy it calls. The most interesting part with me was the contrast between the verbose Trek technobabble and the Tamarian independent action of subordinates. It's an interesting argument for one of the more interesting episodes of Trek.
