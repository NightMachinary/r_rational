So instead of getting the wrench you need the first time, you get a wrench that's too small and now tell them to pick a random larger wrench? Sure you could technically eventually get the correct wrench selected, but you aren't actually communicating the information you need - you're making a broad statement and they're guessing at the specific answer, and probably getting it wrong.
