The MC is a character from one LN (about solving other's social problems) who finds himself in the world of another LN (About guilds led by Gods adventuring in dungeons). Our MC is very familiar with LN tropes and has a real munchkin positive attitude.

From memory I feel that the story jumps the shark in last couple arcs but besides that the story is an engaging look into how someone familiar with modern RPG mechanics and narrative tropes might exploit them.

This story doesn't fully match your requirements. It's less about one person making their way through the system than it is about them simply survivng for the moment.

MC here is someone with DC knowledge who has ended up in some DC universe and uses their meta-knowledge and smarts/metahuman-skill to survive in the face of some pretty dire situations.

Here's another one that doesn't quite match your requirements. One of our MC's is a young Tom Riddle and the other is the SI as a voice in his head. Our MC's go pretty hard in trying to find creative ways to grow in power and get the most they can out of hogwarts.
