You may be overestimating the degree of support Light reveals to Their priests about Ami. They may say "she's not that bad", and the Avatar may say "just leave her alone and she won't bother you", but they don't say that she's /good/. They can't atually: openly proclaiming her to be the first Keeper in history following the Light /will/ trigger a Black Crusade against her, which she won't be able to defend against.
