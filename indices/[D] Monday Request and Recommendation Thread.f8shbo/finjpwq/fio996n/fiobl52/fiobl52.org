Absolutely, but the mental contortions that every character goes through to fit their notion is ridiculous. The writing /explicitly shows/ characters being confused by her actions/behavior and positing the most ridiculous ideas to explain it while keeping her evil. One of the more egregious examples is the Fairies (and other characters) treating the temporary eye fix as an "evil action". They ALL know that she is not the one who actually damaged their eyes. So even if they thought that she was keeping the civilians alive for nefarious purposes, fixing their eyes is /obviously/ not an inherently evil action, even if they believe it's long term goal to be evil. It would be one thing if they didn't trust her and were convinced that she was going to sacrifice them all or something eventually, but continually acting as if fixing their eyes /in and of itself/ was an evil action is pure idiot-ball carrying.

It's the equivalent of me looking at a political prisoner in some authoritarian dictatorship and saying "Well they are keeping this prisoner in the jail for evil reasons, and therefore the fact they they stitched up his injuries is also evil".

And, again, if it wasn't every single character doing it, it would be a bit more believable, It is the universality that makes it problematic (to me).

-edit- Also, given that they want her to give up and seek sanctuary with the Light, triggering a black crusade against her that she knows she can't win seems like a pretty good outcome from the Light's perspective. (Also....when at least 1, maybe 2 different dark gods /already/ hate her....how far from a Dark Crusade is she really?
