The real world equivalent to the eyes issue would be more like this:

A group of your citizens were kidnapped, and maimed by a terrorist group. An authoritarian regime subsequently killed that group, for their own benefit, and seized those citizens. They have treated your citizens, but claim that if those citizens leave their custody that treatment will reverse, not by their choice of course.

You can't send anyone to verify due to the risk of your doctor's and soldiers being kidnapped and tortured into servitude, as the regime is known to do.
