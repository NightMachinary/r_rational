Dungeon Keeper Ami generally predates the dungeon core fiction which is mostly a subset of LitRPG, I think. I mean, everything you've written here is correct, but I wouldn't put Ami in the genre at all, it uses a very different set of tropes and mechanics. Maybe you could call it a grandfather of the genre.
