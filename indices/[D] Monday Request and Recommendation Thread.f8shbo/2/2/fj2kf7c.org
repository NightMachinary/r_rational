Just finished the last installment of Dungeon Keeper Ami and I share your frustration. For me, it's the case of characters that cannot learn. Ami never accept that "evilness of a Keeper" as a dogma. Time and time again, she tried to show that she's an exception. It's very wasteful. A teenage rational character will not try to fight that deep rooted stereotype the third time around (second time around for adult). Instead, they'll work around it. In case of badasses, they'll integrate them into their strategy. Maybe by acting haughty, or frame her action in sinister rhetoric. That's what I want to see from fiction repeatedly mentioned here. Not this shame excuse of character. Actually, when she casted Marda fighting Vampire as punishment I dared to hope the fiction turn good. But alas, that's one time occurrence. She's stays shitty until the end.

Nice worldbuilding though.

But again, full score of worldbuilding (which this fiction did not attain) cannot make a work pleasurable to read if the characters score dip into the negative.

In the spirit of Recommendation thread, I'd recommend its counter example [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28601/arrogant-young-master-template-a-variation-4][Arrogant Young Master Template A Variation 4]]. The main character knows exactly how to fit in in his stupid world. Bad worldbuilding and low writing skill hamper my reading enjoyment only a little. Counter recommend Wandering Inn. That one and Dungeon Keeper Ami are just the same.
