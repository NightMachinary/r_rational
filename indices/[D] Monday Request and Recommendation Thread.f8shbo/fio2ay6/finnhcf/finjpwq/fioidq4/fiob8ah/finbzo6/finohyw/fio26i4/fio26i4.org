Looking for novels/fics with teacher protagonist.

Since fantasy novels tend to focus on a growing protagonist, they usually have MC in the position of a student. Protagonist being a teacher is a big rarity, and I have yet to find one that would also qualify as rational.

And even among novels that do go this path, not many focus on actual teaching, the protagoist's work to see his students growth, instead going on solo adventures somewhere.

Can you make some suggestions please?
