#+begin_quote
  In a dark future, the demonic Grim Horde rules most of the Earth, and Britain has just fallen. The last survivor of the island is the young wizard Soren Marlowe, the newest student at the Nagoya Academy of Magic. To all appearances, he is a normal enough young man, if a little girl crazy.

  Little do they know that he's an exiled devil, one of the very same demons who helped destroy the fallen island! Now thrust into the middle of someone else's romantic comedy, Soren will need to think fast to keep his secret and, just maybe, find a little romance.

the novels adhears to the anime magical academy tropes but they are written competently enough that i didnt have a problem with them here(and i do have a problem with them in most harem light novels and anime, you know the ones)

but if thats something you dont like then this might not be the novel for you. I wanted to recommend it here because i think it deserves more attention cuz its kinda nice which is rare on RR. Its not particularly rational tho,
