But are they? It strikes me somewhat like the moties in Mote in God's Eye. If they do have fairly accurate abstraction capabilities, they could have a fairly accurate model of the captain and the ship's organization in their head. In that case, most communication is unnecessary, only executive level strategic functioning. They don't need to say pass the 3/4s wrench because they've brought it with them.

I admit it's a stretch, but it strikes me that superintelligences communicating could use incredibly dense messages expecting that they're decoded with linguistic and computational decompression.
