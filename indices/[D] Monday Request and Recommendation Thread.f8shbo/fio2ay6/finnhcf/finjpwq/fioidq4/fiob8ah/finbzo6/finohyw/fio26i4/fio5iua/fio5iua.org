Arrogant Young Master Template A Variation 4 is an example of this I've been enjoying lately. [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28601/arrogant-young-master-template-a-variation-4]]

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/yes-professor-hp-si.55067/]] Hasn't updated in a bit but I remember enjoying it and I don't think it's dead.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/my-trans-dimensional-overpowered-protagonist-harem-comedy-is-wrong-as-expected-oregairu-danmachi.367903/]] is an example of this. It has a very strong start, but ymmv on some of the later developments.

I'll also reccomend both the novels and the anime for El Melloi Case files, but that presupposes you have some prior knowledge of the nasuverse.
