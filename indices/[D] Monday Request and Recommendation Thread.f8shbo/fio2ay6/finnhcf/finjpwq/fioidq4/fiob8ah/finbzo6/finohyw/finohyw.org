I'd like to recommend a series of fanfic by Kantuur-Set, starting [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-past-but-no-future-a-kancolle-si-completed.661305/][here]].

The first one is a KanColle fanfic in which an SI character with no knowledge of the setting is reincarnated as the USS Salt Lake City's embodiment as one of many ship-girl hybrid in the middle of a war against evil, similar hybrids. She decides that she would rather stay off the radar for fear of conscription, and character drama proceeds from there.

It's a shortish (~30k words) fic with themes of transhumanism and actual serious mistakes made by the protagonist, and I highly recommend it.

The second in the series is about the embodiment of the battleship Yamato dealing with feeling useless due to excessive logistical costs for her deployment, and is a strong sequel.

The third is lighter in tone and set in the same universe, and finally the fourth is about a battleship who appears spontaneously after the war has been won with no enemies left to fight. These two were weaker, IMO, but still worth reading after loving the first two.

Overall, the biggest selling points for the whole set of four is that the author knows how to keep things concise and contained- each story ends at a good point without feeling the need to expand in unplanned ways past what would be effective.
