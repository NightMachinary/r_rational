Xianxia has been a hot topic on these threads this month. If anyone wants to get into Xianxia but stays away because of the one dimensional characters and bad english translations, I wholeheartedly recommend the manhua [[https://mangadex.org/chapter/723599/1][Heresy]] to change your mind. It has everything that defines a Xianxia. Power scaling, sects, hidden experts, arrogant nobles, and more. I really love this manhua because it shows the realistic divide between mortals and cultivators. The translation is well written and the artwork is exceptional.

I'm also loving arrogant young master on royalroad. If anyone has any xianxia recs that breaks the common mold I would be greatful.
