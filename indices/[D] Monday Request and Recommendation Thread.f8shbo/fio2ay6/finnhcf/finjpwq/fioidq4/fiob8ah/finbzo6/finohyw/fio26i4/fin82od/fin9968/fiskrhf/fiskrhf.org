I'm really impressed with heresy. Thank you for the rec. I love the little details, like how sect members walk around with their badges in interesting places, and all carry magic bags and tools.

​

The aesthetics are out of this world, definitely a more primal and ancient looking chinese setting. Really impressive, it's much cooler imho than the pretty silk robes and everything being clean and pristine. This has much more of an old, grounded feel to it, everything feels like it was made and is used.

​

The robe with the talismans in layers as protection, look so cool, that's how you make cool cultivation armor. Much better than what you generally get, and it can even be used as a way to show durability decreasing by burning talismans out as it gets damaged.

​

On the last chapter you can also see a villain pulling some very interesting and elaborated munchink. Very cool indeed. Instantly on the top 10 cultivation stories.
