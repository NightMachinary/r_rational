I've seen Dungeon Keeper Ami recommended for a long time on this sub. I finally got around to reading it, and it was....ok (as far as it's written so far, it's not yet completed). For the most part, the MC and her minions are pretty well written and work well. The plot is interesting and the story does a good job of maintaining pace and urgency. But basically the entire non-main cast is a masterclass in carrying the idiot ball. Time and time again people make decisions and judgements that are clearly bad and misinformed solely for the sake of the plot. This primarily plays out in people refusing to believe that Ami is not evil, or at least not particularly evil. Now, it would absolutely be reasonable for a few, or some subset of characters to be completely prejudiced by her status as a Keeper and refuse to believe any evidence to the contrary. That is a thing that happens in real life with real people. But for ABSOLUTELY EVERYONE to do so strains credulity and breaks my immersion in the story. These are not believable actions by believable characters. The only cases where people don't believe this are basically cases of divine intervention where Light gods straight up tell people "she's not that bad". Which happens twice. Even though the Light gods are shown to be willing to talk to basically any priest while they are in a church.

All in all, it's a decent story that has pretty good writing but it fails miserably at meeting the standards of rational fiction (it doesn't try to be rationalist, but that's perfectly fine). I haven't read much of the wider world of dungeon core fiction, so maybe it's a really good example of the genre, but if so that should be viewed as an indictment of the state of the category rather than praise of Dungeon Keeper Ami.
