I personally view it not as an idiot ball, but different mentality. This is a world where good and evil are tangible, objective things, steming from following the Light and Dark gods respectively, and Keepers are thoroughly evil. It's a /fact/, a rule that has never been broken until now. It takes personal contact to see beyond that.

Also, the last time anyone believed that a Keeper may not be that bad it resulted in a dwarf civil war.
