Also, re: [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-young-womans-political-record-youjo-senki-saga-of-tanya-the-evil.660569/][A Young Woman's Political Record]]: it's started updating again yay.

The author also recommended [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-young-girls-delinquency-record-youjo-senki-saga-of-tanya-the-evil.788149/][A Young Woman's Delinquency Record]], which is very good IMO. It's kind of a capitalist horror story about what would happen if Tanya ever managed to escape the war. It's kinda like that theoretical problem with time travel: modern business plans are super efficient, so Tanya basically just goes around the world destabilizing everything with advanced HR practices.

I don't know how rational it is, because like all Tanya stories it tends to rely quite a lot on contrived coincidences ruining Tanya's short-term plans. It's still great though.
