Ze Tian Ji is one that I'd say definitely breaks the mold. A lot of people love it or hate it because of how different it is from most cultivation novels, but personally I loved it. Overall it is much more of a political story that happens to have cultivation than a pure cultivation story, with physical power being less important than the other intangible ideas of power. If you are looking for a pure Xianxia story I wouldn't say its a great fit, but otherwise definitely check it out.
