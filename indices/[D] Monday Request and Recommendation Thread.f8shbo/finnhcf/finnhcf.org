Monday Bigpost Time!

Standard disclaimer: not all of these are necessarily rational, they're just stories that were good enough for me to stomach catching up to them. Most of these are wormfics, because I'm a shameless addict, but some of them aren't.

- [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/ashen-fe3h-quest.57644/][Ashen (FE:3H Quest)]] is a pretty great Fire Emblem: Three Houses quest. I was put off by this at first, because it doesn't follow canon, but I really can't fault it for being original. It's one of the most in-depth, quests I've seen in a while, and it has some of my favorite critical successes of all time.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21894865/chapters/52259905][Those Who Soar into Dawn]] is the intelligent FE:3H story I was expecting from /Ashen/ at first. This is the most explicitly rational thing here, but I don't know if the author has posted it to the subreddit yet. It's not the rational Fire Emblem I would write, but it's close enough that I'm recommending it with the same kind of investment with which I would recommend my own work.

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/my-hero-school-adventure-is-all-wrong-as-expected-bnha-x-oregairu.697066/][My Hero School Adventure is All Wrong, As Expected]] took a bit of effort to start reading. The first chapter has the mandatory edgy Hachiman essay, but once you get over that hump, you're greeted with one of the better Oregairu stories. I really like how seamless the crossover is, and while Hachiman's distorted perspective isn't quite as realistic as the one in the original, it's very much entertaining.

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/epeius-mass-effect-au.816218/][Epeius]] (formerly: First Contact) is a generic Mass Effect fic that's distinguished by update speed and common sense. The author has been maintaining a chapter a day for the last two months. The story is not ground breaking, and it's a bit tedious, but it still manages to stay true to the vision of a more intelligent version of Mass Effect canon.

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/would-that-i-were-born-no-princess-youjo-senki-final-fantasy-tactics-wotl.805228/][Would that I were born no princess...]] is one of the many Tanya fics that spawned in the wake of [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-young-womans-political-record-youjo-senki-saga-of-tanya-the-evil.660569/][A Young Woman's Political Record]]. It's not quite as fun, but I think the setting of FFT is cool enough to make up for that. I'm mostly invested for the hype of what's coming up soon, but what's there isn't bad.

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/fate-kaleid-liner-prisma-taylor-wormxnasu-magical-girl-taylor.478918/][Fate/Kaleid Liner Prisma Taylor]] is significantly less terrifying than the show it is based on. Taylor is stupidly powerful, the characters are fun, but it's not really saying anything significant or doing anything clever. Read it for the vague Fate/ cross. Not my least favorite, but close. You could swap it for /Oobleck/ and I'd be hard pressed to debate the change.

- [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/on-fluttering-wings-taylor-hebert-in-mgln.53204/][On Fluttering Wings]] resurrected last December, and I finally read it. Heartfelt magical bullshit in the Nanoha universe. Notable for being one of the few pre-canon stories with Taylor sent to another universe. I really wish it were longer than it is, but what is there looks promising. I would say that it's finished it's first arc and moved on to its second, even if it's not spelled out in traditional Worm fashion.

- [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/the-adventures-of-oobleck.48996/][The Adventures of Oobleck!!!]] is a sekirei crossover with RWBY (huh?). For a Sekirei cross, it's pretty generic, and there are a bunch of others I would recommend more, but for where it is now I think it's criminally underrated. Pretty decent RomCom bullshit.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12825430/1/Of-Elder-Scrolls-and-Huntsmen-Dragon-Rose][Of Elder Scrolls and Huntsmen]] somehow this fell in between my older posts and I forgot about it. I'm not that much of a RWBY fan, I swear. They just stuck out more this month. I like this one for having probably the most complete take on the world of /Skyrim/ of all of the stories I've ever read. There are some that go into more depth, but none that quite capture the blend of noob-friendly and interesting that this one does. It also gets points for people acting like people and taking reasonable steps to maintain relationships/curtail drama.

There are also a couple of honorable mentions.

- If you're looking for more RWBY, you might be okay with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12044591/1/Forged-Destiny][Forged Destiny]]. Don't let the /very large/ AU turn you away - not that it's a flawless story - it's that I like it because it lives and dies on its own merits. If you don't like RWBY, you might enjoy this. If you're not a fan of Coeur Al'Aran and his distinctive style of Jaunefic, you know immediately that you won't enjoy it. Simple and easy to recommend. It has clever moments and stupid moments on par with the average piece of original fiction.

- [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/its-not-wrong-to-make-friends-in-the-dungeon-danmachi-sanctioned-worm.59498/][It's Not Wrong to Make Friends in a Dungeon]] is a fun crack story crossover between Danmachi and Worm. I think that it has the same problem a lot of stories by [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/members/ravensdagger.17283/][RavensDagger]] do, where the crack starts to bleed into the genuine emotional moments of the fic. There also isn't much conflict, at all, which is funny given the premise. I dropped it, but there's a chance you'll like it more than I did.

- Speaking of Danmachi, I also read [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/heroic-myth-fate-grand-order-x-danmachi.729157/][Heroic Myth]], a crossover between that and Fate. SPAG could be much better, plot is kind of all over the place, but if you're a fan of Fate Stay Night it might be your thing. That's all I can say about it. I guess I wish the heroes were more familiar to me? Also, the cast grows a little too large for some of the scenes to handle.

(Tentative) Ranked List:

1.  On Fluttering Wings
2.  Of Elder Scrolls and Huntsmen (because of length and consistency, mostly)
3.  Ashen
4.  Those Who Soar into Dawn (/will/ move up when it gets longer, has first place potential)
5.  Hero School Adventure
6.  Were that I were born no princess...
7.  The Adventures of Oobleck
8.  Kaleid Liner Prisma Taylor
9.  Epeius
10. Honorable Mentions (in the order I mentioned them)
