The person who'd volunteered to keep it updated decided to stop (and was gracious enough to let us know). It's the kind of thing that really should be automated in some way, but I don't have the time/will to do it, and Automod just hadn't been updated. I'll update the post, at least, but if no one is going to update the page, then there's not a point in having that link. I'll probably just use the search link that [[/u/Ilverin]] suggested instead.
