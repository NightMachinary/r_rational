Nah, the trick is that you can have a room that contains more than 100% me. So it wouldn't even matter which clone dies, as long as one survives, if we ran on Waves Arisen rules instead - ie. it can defer the decision of which me becomes "final me". Not a practical difference in this scenario, but the lack of clear differentiation might have prevented the weird divergence of this arc.
