As for the calendar, I think you are better off using the ancient one instead of the modern day one for authenticity. Or just make up the names.

In fact, there are 4 seasons. So you could match each season to an element, and for the 3 months per season, you can name them anyway you like such as early, mid, and late air/water/earth/fire. That way you have 12 made up names which ties into the cycle of the elements.
