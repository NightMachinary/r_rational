Yey thank you for continuing!

As for what you said at the end, I personally love the avatar and how he's from the modern world, but I'm confused/worried about Black (Is she even from the series? I have no idea who she is). Also, I wish we got more from Zuko.

Regardless, thanks for the great chapter :)
