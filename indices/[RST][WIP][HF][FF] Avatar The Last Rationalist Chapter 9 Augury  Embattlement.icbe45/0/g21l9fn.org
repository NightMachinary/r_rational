I know that two buns or pigtail buns are called [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bun_(hairstyle][odango]]) which is a fairly japanese hairstyle, but I don't know what it's called if the buns themselves are layered. Maybe pigtail layered buns?

Don't call it double stacked buns, because that hairstyle is having two buns with one bun higher on the head than the other.
