Nice jabbing reference to Team Rocket. I must say, a Renegade trainer being indistinguishable from a normal one is quite a bit more plausible, and it's likely even if TR exists in this version they're a group of Renegade trainer instead.

Wonder what you'd do for Teams Aqua and Magma, if you covered them here?

Well now, this was quite good indeed. An interesting way to blend the Fossil Maniac into the narrative, as a bad guy, and we even got hints as to what Team Rocket may be in this universe. The invasion of Paras and their evolution was rather horrifying, especially as they just kept coming like the zombie films Blue remembered in his past, driven ever onwards by the spores infecting them...
