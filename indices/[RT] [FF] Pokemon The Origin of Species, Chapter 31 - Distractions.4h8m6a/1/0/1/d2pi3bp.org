Funny thing is, until I saw this comment I didn't make the connection that it's from an antagonist. Because a) I think I've seen this parable somewhere, I don't remember where, "for reals" as an illustration why "all crimes are the same" is counter-productive. And b) he has a point in this case in my opinion. It would be understandable if committing a crime using Pokemon (any crime, murder, arson, jaywalking) was seen as a serious aggravating circumstance, but to make it into its own kind of evil outside the normal justice? Maybe I'm not grasping properly the mindset of a world filled with monster and without effective means to fight them until recently, but on the other hand there's already a "Pokemon lives matter" sentiment (as represented by Leaf).

Edit: I don't know how faithful to canon this presentation on Renegades, and their treatment by society is. I have only fuzzy memories about team Rocket from the animation series I watched years ago. I've no other exposure to Pokemon canon except Pop-Cultural Osmosis.
