I definitely took the parable from somewhere, but I can't for the life of me remember where. I did some quick googling to try and find it, but it was probably somewhere on LessWrong or SlateStarCodex about perverse incentives.

In any case, "antagonist" might be too strong a word :) I purposefully avoided "villain," but even if I hadn't, remember that just because someone's values don't align with the protagonist/hero doesn't mean they're wrong about everything.

It's pretty much not faithful at all to any of the canons I'm aware of. The anime's response to Team Rocket was to treat them as mostly a nuisance, and the games never show any comeuppance for the various evil teams' criminal acts: for the most part they just lose their battles and leave of their own volition, or lose the "heart" to do villainy, as if they didn't just try to destroy the planet or take over the world or whatever, and society wouldn't maybe take some steps to ensure that they're not going to do so again.
