#+begin_quote
  and send *a* two more tumbling
#+end_quote

Superfluous "a".

#+begin_quote
  and *think* of ways to end it.
#+end_quote

Should be "thinks".

#+begin_quote
  and immediately *feel* dry
#+end_quote

Should be "feels".

#+begin_quote
  He's about to ask if */she/'/s/*
#+end_quote

Apostrophe isn't italicised.

Incidentally, reddit wasn't happy with the formatting =***she*'*s***= (i.e. "bold all, italicise all but the apostrophe"), so I had to insert =&#127;= (an undefined symbol with no representation in the HTML standard) to get it to parse correctly.

#+begin_quote
  "*Ylright*?"
#+end_quote

Maybe meant to be "Alright?" or "Y'alright?".

#+begin_quote
  torn out of the side. *Broken* "Said
#+end_quote

Missing period, or superfluous sentence.

#+begin_quote
  "*Who's* side
#+end_quote

Should be "Whose".

#+begin_quote
  "Just *incase*
#+end_quote

Missing space.
