Honestly, I've thought about this a lot and realized that the main thing that really drags out the writing process is the research.

Some chapters it's not so bad, a few hours here and there throughout the month. Other times I'll spend 5 hours in a week just to figure something out for one scene. And other times, I'll spend 5 hours in a week just to figure out that I have to scrap the scene I had in mind and come up with a new one, because reality just doesn't match the pokemon world enough for something to make sense (stupid reality).

As an example, for the chapter with the wigglytuff I spent maybe 3 hours learning about sound before I realized I would have to change the scene of the chapter's main source of conflict completely. That's 3 hours I would have saved if I had a Sound Expert I could just ask, but that's just one example, and every chapter could require a different expert.

So I've thought about delegating research duties to readers. I have a few readers that I checked some of my Japanese with back when I was wasting time figuring out translations that weren't terrible, but it's a bit harder when it comes to all the various scientific topics that could come up at any given time.

On top of that, the few times when I have had someone in my readership or real life that I could directly ask a question, it doesn't always save a significant amount of time. Some questions are a quick "yes, that's how it works" or "no, that's stupid," but for others I need to understand them well enough to incorporate the concept into the story properly, and not just on a surface level.

Proof reading and editing wouldn't save a significant amount of time, as I do it in dribs and drabs when I have spare minutes that won't be put toward anything more productive. Research is the real time sink, and maybe I'll figure something out once my website is done and I can have an easier flow of communication with my readers (and my readers can with each other too). Like I could put a blog post up about a question I have and see if anyone knows the answer.
