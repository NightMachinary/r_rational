So, you've mentioned in the past that giving you money won't lead to faster/longer chapters, since we aren't going to reach a point where writing fiction pays a competitive rate to your day job. But, given that I am already giving you money anyway, is there anything that could be done to increase your output?

Perhaps you could chose someone to copy edit your chapters so that you don't have to spend time rereading? or you could give someone your fanfiction password so you don't have to spend potential writing time using the awful ff.net site fixing small issues (or maybe that time and your writing time come from different budgets)? I'd be up for either task if you think it would lead to a few hundred extra words a month, or a bonus chapter a couple of times a year or something :).
