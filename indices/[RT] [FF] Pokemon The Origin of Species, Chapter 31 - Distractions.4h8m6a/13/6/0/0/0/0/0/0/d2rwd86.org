That last idea sounds great. As long as you can get people to visit the site somewhat regularly, I'm sure you will get responses at least some of the time, either from readers doing the research or just knowing the answer. That said, I think it would probably be fine for you to post questions here for now, if you feel like it, since authors are allowed one brainstorming post per chapter. Waiting makes sense though if the website will be up pretty soon and you don't feel like posting questions like that here.
