So, I was confused reading it, but now you've got me trying to figure out figure out exactly /why/ it doesn't sound right. English grammar isn't my strong suite, but I like the challenge. :)

The whole paragraph with tenses notated for reference:

#+begin_quote
  (Red's nidoran is already exhausted)*[simple present (but implied present perfect?)]*, (his poisonous spurs taking out a handful of the paras)*[present progressive]* before (he accumulates too many injuries for Red to heal with quick sprays of potion)*[simple present]*. (Spinarak takes his place and holds up better, until a parasect rushes forward and claws off two of its forelegs. Red withdraws it before the giant claws can close around its head, and an ember by Charmander swiftly engulfs the parasect.)*[simple present]* (Its flaming corpse did little to deter the red and orange swarm.)*[simple past]*
#+end_quote

After a lot of reading, [[https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/601/04/][this guide]] was the most directly applicable. The whole thing is worth a read, but some highlights:

#+begin_quote
  Generally, writers maintain one tense for the main discourse and indicate changes in time frame by changing tense relative to that primary tense, which is usually either simple past or simple present.

  ...

  *General guideline: Do shift tense to indicate a change in time frame from one action or state to another.*

  ...

  *General guideline: Establish a primary tense for the main discourse, and use occasional shifts to other tenses to indicate changes in time frame.*

  *Examples:*

  - Before they even /began/ deliberations, many jury members /had reached/ a verdict.

  /Began/ is past tense, referring to an action completed before the current time frame; /had reached/ is past perfect, referring to action from a time frame before that of another past event (the action of reaching was completed before the action of beginning.) ...

  [U]se present tense to describe action in a literary work, movie, or other fictional narrative. Occasionally, for dramatic effect, you may wish to narrate an event in present tense as though it were happening now. If you do, use present tense consistently throughout the narrative, making shifts only where appropriate.

  ...

  If the primary narration is in the present tense, then the present progressive or present perfect progressive is used to indicate action that is or has been underway as some other action begins. ...

  In general the use of perfect tenses is determined by their relationship to the tense of the primary narration. ... If the primary narration is in simple present, then action initiated before the time frame of the primary narration is described in present perfect.

  ...

  Time-orienting words and phrases like /before, after, by the time/, and others---when used to relate two or more actions in time---can be good indicators of the need for a perfect-tense verb in a sentence.

  ...

  - After everyone /had finished/ (past perfect) the main course, /we offered/ (past) our guests dessert.
  - After everyone has finished (present perfect) the main course, /we offer/ (present: habitual action) our guests dessert.
#+end_quote

After all of that, I think the primary error is using /before/ to switch from /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Present_continuous][present progressive/continuous]]/ to /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_present][simple present]]/.

Keeping to your original intent and flow, my suggestion would be:

Past statement. Past Perfect clause /before/ Present Progressive. I think this has the clearest progression of time and action as the paragraph unfolds.

#+begin_quote
  Red's nidoran was (already) exhausted. His poisonous spurs had taken out a handful of the paras before accumulating too many injuries for Red to heal with quick sprays of potion. Spinarak takes his place and holds up better, until a parasect rushes forward and claws off two of its forelegs.
#+end_quote

Another strong option:

Present Progressive sequence. This maintains the initial feeling of an action scene before moving back into narration.

#+begin_quote
  Red's nidoran is getting exhausted, his poisonous spurs taking out a handful of the paras before accumulating too many injuries for Red to heal with quick sprays of potion. Spinarak takes his place and holds up better, until a parasect rushes forward and claws off two of its forelegs.
#+end_quote

Some other options:

Past Perfect split clause /before/ Present Progressive.

  Red's nidoran had been exhausted, his poisonous spurs had taken out a handful of the paras before accumulating too many injuries for Red to heal with quick sprays of potion. Spinarak takes his place and holds up better, until a parasect rushes forward and claws off two of its forelegs.
#+end_quote

Past (primary tense), Past Perfect explaining clause. This treats the first sentence as a setup to narrate events that already took place before using context to switch into present.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Present Perfect split clause /before/ Simple Present (primary tense). Bonus: split-infinitive!

#+end_quote

Present (Perfect) statement. Present Perfect clause /before/ Simple Present (primary tense)

tldr; Read it. I spent way too much time on this.
