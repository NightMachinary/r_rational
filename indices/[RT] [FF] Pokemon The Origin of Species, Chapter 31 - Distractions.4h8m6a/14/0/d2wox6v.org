Good thinking! I don't think enough time has passed in the domestication of pokemon for physical features to drift enough from their natural state, however. As an explanation for why they have clothing might incorporate that too, but in all honesty it's far more likely to simply be a preservation of modesty, for pokemon with anatomy similar to humans.

Also keep in mind that many pokemon rely on senses besides sight that are stronger than humans', so even pokemon that look vaguely human would not deter a pokemon that can clearly smell the difference.
