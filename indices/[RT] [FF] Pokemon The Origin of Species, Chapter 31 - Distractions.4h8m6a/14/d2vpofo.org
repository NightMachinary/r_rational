A pet theory that I've come up with after you mentioned that Pokemon are trained not to attack humans - could this be why Machop/Machoke/Machamp look so humanoid?

As in, there's an incentive to make your Pokemon look more human so your opponent's Pokemon are less willing to attack them, and so over time they've deliberately been bred that way. I think it would tie in nicely with the end of the chapter about incentives that lead to behaviour you don't necessarily want to encourage.
