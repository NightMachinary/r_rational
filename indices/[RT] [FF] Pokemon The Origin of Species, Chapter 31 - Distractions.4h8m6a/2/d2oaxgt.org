Hey guys, welcome back! Super long chapter to make up for last month's brevity. Couple of notes: First, my website is almost ready to go, and patrons are going to get a sneak peek sometime this month. Thanks to everyone for your continued support!

Second, I'm in the last planning stages of a podcast on rationalist writing, which I'm pretty excited about. Episode topics will include everything from rational writing tips and discussion to reviews of media, rational or not, as well as feedback for listener's work, eventually. My co-host [[/u/alexanderwales]] and I have a lot to talk about on the subject, but any suggestions on specifics you'd like to hear about can be added to The List!

And finally, once again, if you leave a review that expects or justifies a response, please make an account and log in first! I don't mind anonymous reviews at all, but I've gotten some great reviews full of excellent questions and critiques that were sadly posted by guest accounts, preventing me from replying. I appreciate every review you guys leave, especially the long and detailed ones, so give me the chance to at least say thanks in return!

That's it for now. Hope you enjoy the chapter, and stay tuned in at [[/r/rational]] for updates on the website or podcast later this month!
