So it turns out, Soundcloud charges monthly for unlimited uploads: the free accounts only allow 180 minutes, which is maybe 5 episodes of our podcast if the first's length is any indication. I don't know if the podcast is going to be big enough to warrant the Pro account that would be necessary to host the whole thing there : /
