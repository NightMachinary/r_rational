[[https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/future-strategist/id1090750347?mt=2][Future Strategist]] by James Miller. It's kind of unfocused so far, with episodes about rationality topics, interviews with various people, and a debate on free trade. It's a rationalist podcast in the sense that the host is a LWer (and an economist), and this shines through in the choice of topics and guests, and in the kinds of arguments he makes. The interviews and debates were very interesting, and I imagine it will gain a bit of focus as it matures.
