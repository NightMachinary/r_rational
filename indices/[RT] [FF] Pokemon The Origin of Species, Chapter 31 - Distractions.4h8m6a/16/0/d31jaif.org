So a post scarcity society requires 3 things, correct? Infinite energy, infinite resources, and the tech to transmute or construct them into what you need.

In terms of creating items with pokeball technology, from a manufacturing perspective in my view it is possible, and in some cases the most efficient. But there are a few reasons the Pokemon world isn't quite at a post scarcity society.

1) It takes an enormous amount of energy to store and release pokemon, especially as often as it's done. Tons of resources go into procuring and maintaining the pokemon and apparatus necessary to keep a Region's pokeballs charged, not to mention their lights on and AC running.

2) Resources themselves are scarce. The presence of wild pokemon everywhere means gathering raw materials is a much more dangerous and expensive process than just setting up a mine or logging town would be for us.

3) Some services are so simple but still necessary that it's easier to just do them with manpower and pay the professional. Cooking food, for example, and farming it. Transmuting dirt into tomatoes might be possible, but the energy required isn't worth the time saved, and while the government subsidizes trainer related activities to make owning and using pokeballs affordable for many, it won't pay for the energy a private business needs to turn raw carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen into wooden benches.

Does that make sense?
