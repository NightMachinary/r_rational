Quick question... why was it necessary to exterminate the parasect? Seems like that was most of the population in the mountain, meaning this could amount to regional genocide. Wouldn't it have been safer for people and pokemon to just let them spread? Unless I'm mistaken there aren't many settlements near Mount Moon, and the parasect weren't a direct threat to the mining operation.

Love the introduction of Renegades, and the poke at Team Rocket ("They don't walk around with a big red R on their shirt.") Giovanni's blog at the end was particularly well-written.
