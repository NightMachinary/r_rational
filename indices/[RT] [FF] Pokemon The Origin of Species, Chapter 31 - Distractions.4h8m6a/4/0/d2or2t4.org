The paras colony will occasionally go on spreading sprees that can balloon their population out of control. This was indeed quite a lot of paras that got killed, which is unfortunate from an ecological standpoint, but they would have simply spread over the entire mountain if left unchecked and done their own damage to local species that would get displaced into nearby areas and do their own disruption and so on.

Natural predators and lack of sufficient nutrients would eventually shrink the colony's population to a more normal size once their spore season was over, but that can take months of the mountain side being dangerously inhospitable and even harder to pass through.

The mountain is fairly large though, and there are other colonies in it.
