Green mentions in an earlier chapter that Blues pidgey is close to evolution because of its longer head crest, but I don't think it detailed any further than that. So while it could just be a gradual change as a pokemon ages, I think it might be hard to differentiate between say a pidgey and a pidgeotto clearly.
