Yep, in my head it made sense because the nidoran's exhausted as the sentence starts, and then while taking out more paras becomes badly hurt as the sentence continues.

Changed it to this:

#+begin_quote
  Red's nidoran is already exhausted, and his poisonous spurs take out another handful of the paras before he accumulates too many injuries for Red to heal with quick sprays of potion. Spinarak takes his place and holds up better, until a parasect rushes forward and claws off two of its forelegs. Red withdraws it before the giant claws can close around its head, and an ember by Charmander swiftly engulfs the parasect. Its flaming corpse does little to deter the red and orange swarm.
