#+begin_quote
  Red's nidoran is already exhausted, his poisonous spurs taking out a handful of the paras until he accumulates too many injuries for Red to heal with quick sprays of potion. Spinarak takes his place and holds up better, and then a parasect rushes forward and claws off two of its forelegs. Red withdraws it before the giant claws can close around its head, and an ember by Charmander swiftly engulfs the parasect. Its flaming corpse does little to deter the red and orange swarm.

This isn't a big deal, but I still don't think this is quite right. I say this because

#+begin_quote
  Red's nidoran is already exhausted
#+end_quote

(in present tense) seems to "take place after" the following, which is also in present tense:

#+begin_quote
  his poisonous spurs taking out a handful of the paras until he accumulates too many injuries for Red to heal with quick sprays of potion.
#+end_quote

Like, conceptually the nidoran takes out the paras before being "already exhausted". Or, I would think so at least. The text below better expresses what I think you mean:

#+begin_quote
  Red's nidoran is already exhausted, his poisonous spurs having taken out a handful of the paras before he accumulated too many injuries for Red to heal with quick sprays of potion.
#+end_quote

As is, it still makes sense, but means something different. All of the "action" in the sentence takes place after the nidoran is exhausted. The reason I don't think this is what you mean is that this is the first we see of the nidoran. So like, either the sentence can mean "the nidoran is tired because all of this happened" or "the nidoran is tired and then all this happened".

Hmm, maybe you actually did mean the second of those though. In that case, I would change it to

#+begin_quote
  his poisonous spurs taking out a handful *more* of the paras until he accumulates too many injuries for Red to heal with quick sprays of potion.
#+end_quote

to make clear that there was other action that took place before the sentence, and that the action in the sentence is limited to what happened after the nidoran already became exhausted.
