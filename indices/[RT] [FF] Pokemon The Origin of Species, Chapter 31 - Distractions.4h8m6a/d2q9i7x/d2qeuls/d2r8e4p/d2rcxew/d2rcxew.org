That makes sense too: I like the idea of a shadowy coven of Mega Evolution stone holders, being careful about whom they release the stones to and judging trainers by their bond with their pokemon :) I might actually hint toward that way later in the story... If so, give me a name you'd like me to use to give you a shoutout!
