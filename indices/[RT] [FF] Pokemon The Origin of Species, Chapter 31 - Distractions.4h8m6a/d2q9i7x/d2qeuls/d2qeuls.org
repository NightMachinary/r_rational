Thanks, glad you're enjoying it!

I think the bond in Mega Evolution would probably be more sentiment than anything: as far as I'm aware, there hasn't been anyone in the games or anime that had both power stones but weren't able to mega evolve their pokemon. I would be happy to make it canon if, for example, the games won't let you mega evolve a pokemon without a certain level of friendship or hearts, but since you can just catch or get traded a pokemon and mega-evolve them right away with the right stones, I don't see any reason to think it's true.
