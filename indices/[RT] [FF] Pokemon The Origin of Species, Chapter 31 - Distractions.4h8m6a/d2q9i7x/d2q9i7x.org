Hi there, I came across this story a little over month ago, caught up and can't wait for more!

Just a quick question, I know the Fairy type has been brought up but what are your thoughts on Mega Evolution? I understand if/why it's not in the story, but I'm curious as to how you'd try to rationally explain or work around the "strong bond" needed to activate it.
