And I'm a couple days late again. But I've got to drop in and say great job. Fantastic chapter with the right mix of drama and action, combined with points of tension spread just far enough to keep it compelling but not too far that any of it felt like you had drawn the pace out.

I really enjoy seeing your take on realistic challenges presented by the different species of Pokemon. It's refreshing to see how Pokemon as weak as paras in game can be a disaster under the right circumstances. Too many writers require a horde of gyarados before its called an emergency.

With regards to your Renegades, are they investigated and tried in a court like in the world we know? Or are they just labelled as that and the word spreads to be careful of them? And if it is some kind of official crime, what kind of punishment do they recieve? You mentioned Hunters. Would that be like a bounty hunter type job?

Again great chapter!
