  Or are they just labelled as that and the word spreads to be careful of them? And if it is some kind of official crime, what kind of punishment do they recieve? You mentioned Hunters. Would that be like a bounty hunter type job?

There's a Most Wanted list in each region for confirmed renegades from there or neighboring regions. They're wanted dead or alive, and they rarely see the inside of a court room: if found guilty there's just one punishment, and to be taken alive they would have to essentially surrender upon being caught. The few who do are sometimes acquitted, most being those trainers who turn themselves in asserting that it was a mistake or misunderstanding.

Hunters are indeed bounty hunters, but a bit more official: anyone can join the hunt for a confirmed Renegade, but a Hunter is given license to train their pokemon specifically to attack people. They're known to attract a mixed type of person, and are sometime seen by police and Rangers as barely more than renegades themselves: "A gyarados in a ball is still a gyarados."
