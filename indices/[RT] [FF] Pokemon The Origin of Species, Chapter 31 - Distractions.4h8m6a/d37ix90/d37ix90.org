Hey I've got a big comment for you man! I found your fanfic online a while back, and I had never read one before so I though: "okay,I'll dabble and just see if I like it." well, 31 chapters later I can't get enough! I have seriously fallen in love with this! I can't begin to explain my disappointment when I got to chapter 29... When, in the top section you said "Sun and Moon Hype!" My heart sank.... "Sun and Moon? But that means this was written extremely recently! But the story isn't over! And that means I have to wait to see how my new favorite story is going to pan out!"..... Though as much as that pained me, I am still in love with this story, I seriously love the realism aspect that the story is lased with inside and out, it's not just a pokemon story and that makes it *seriously* unique and just fantastic! There aren't just battles at stakes, there are lives! Good heavens chapter 31 made me feel like I was in an episode of the Walking Dead! (that's a compliment, if you aren't a fan of it) All in all, You've found a new fan in me and if I have to wait for every new chapter you better believe I'm gonna do it!
