To be fair, the hoothoot wasn't really his fault :) But yes, most trainers have trouble keeping all their pokemon alive through major threats. I see the world of pokemon as an inherently dangerous place, as the whole point of raising pokemon to fight is to help keep trainers alive against deadly forces.
