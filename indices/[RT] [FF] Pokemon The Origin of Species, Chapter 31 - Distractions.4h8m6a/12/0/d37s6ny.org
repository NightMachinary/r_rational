Thank you, I'm glad to hear you've been enjoying it so much! It feels great to introduce someone to the world of fanfiction in a way that I was too: a rationalist fiction :) If you're impatient for the next chapter and want to read something similar meanwhile, check out [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9676374/1/Daystar-s-Remix-of-Rationality][my other story on fanfiction]]: it's a re-write of the first 4 chapters of Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality, which was one of the major inspirations for this story. If you like those 4 chapters, you can find the rest of the story (written by the original author) here:

Hope you enjoy it!

Out of curiosity, where did you run across my story if you weren't frequenting fanfiction before? Was it somewhere else on reddit, or a different site?
