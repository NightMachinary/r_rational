I think its a combination of two factors. I imagine even top tier trainers like rangers or ACEs lose quite a few "fodder" pokemon like spearows and rattattas, which creates a bottleneck like effect, resulting in only the incredibly skilled Fearows making the cut, or they end up with ridiculously powerful monsters like Charizards.\\
