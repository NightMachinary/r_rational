Or perhaps call it specifically "The Parable of the X" or something.

Also wanted to comment on some reviews you got.

  I cannot imagine any 11 year olds with the kind of minds your characters seem to possess. Precocious 15 year olds, perhaps, but not 11 year olds. Even if their circumstances forced them to mature faster. Pardon me for this, but maybe you're putting in a bit of "I wish this is how I could react to this situation" as opposed to "This is a reasonable 11 year old's response to this situation". Just my opinion, but if you agree with me, I think this story would make more sense by having them set out on their journey at 14 or 15. I just can't imagine parents sending out their kids into near certain death at the age of 11.

This is silly. Canon states that ten year olds go out into the world on Pokemon journeys. You don't have to explain or justify that anymore than you have to explain or justify the existence of Pokeballs. (Long-term backpacking in real life also tends to leave one looking, smelling, and often feeling like the victim of some bizarre and horrifically violent sexual crime, but it's canon that this isn't true in the Pokemon universe. So as long as you don't go jumping around pointing at it and making it a plot point or something, it doesn't distract/detract from the story.) My little brother is nine and the idea of him going out alone is laughable (he probably wouldn't even be able to carry all the things he needs in a backpack; that'a difficult even for fully-grown adults), but that's not the universe your characters live in.

So you have the choice of either making the environment so unchallenging that a ten year old could do it, or making your ten year olds mature enough to do it, or retconning canon. You chose the right option IMO. (It's definitely the most frequently chosen option by fanfic writers.)

Literary characters also don't have to speak and act in a perfectly realistic way; that would get boring quickly. Just don't make a big deal out of it by having other characters continuously point out how mature they are, or something. (Your characters can be exceptionally precocious even in canon, sure, but the basics of taking a pokemon journey and all the life skills that entails shouldn't be remarkable. And you haven't treated it as remarkable thus far, so I don't know what this reviewer is talking about.) And they wouldn't be so much more believable just because they're a few years older, anyway. (Actually I think a lot of people take a dip in maturity around 13/14/15 as they are faced with a lot of new emotions and impulses. Having them be 10/11 is a great way to curb the idea that this will be a story with romantic relationships and sexual drama. Actually, the only good reason I can think of for changing the characters into teenagers is because you wanted to write a story with relationships and sexual drama.)

Also as for the other review by the same commentator about the science/rationality exposition dumps--well, that's part of why I /love/ the story, so my two cents are to leave those in.

Thanks again for another great chapter. I loved the plot development.
