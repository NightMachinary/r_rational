Yeah, I wish that person signed in so I could respond to them directly.

I'm actually of two minds on this. On the one hand, I'm perfectly fine saying that environmental pressures have made humans in the pokemon world a standard deviation more mature and intelligent than they would be in our world... any kids that didn't treat pokemon like the deadly monsters they are would not have survived the dark ages before pokeballs were invented.

On the other hand, I honestly do believe that kids, even in our world, raised in certain circumstances, can grow to be as mature as their environment dictates. There are child soldiers in war torn countries that are forced to fight at the age Red and Blue and Leaf are. Throughout history, boys in particularly military cultures have been trained to fight and kill since pre-adolescence.

Whether these are the healthiest or best ways to raise children is obviously a different question. But when humanity's survival relies on training children to be soldiers, they're sure as hell going to be more mature than 21st century western 11 year olds.

As for intelligence, Red, Blue and Leaf are all gifted youngsters, even among their peers. Perhaps that doesn't account for ALL their intelligence, but I work with kids, and every once in awhile I'll meet an 11 or 12 year old who's more intelligent and well spoken than their older siblings and parents.

They're not typical kids, but to me they're realistic enough :)
