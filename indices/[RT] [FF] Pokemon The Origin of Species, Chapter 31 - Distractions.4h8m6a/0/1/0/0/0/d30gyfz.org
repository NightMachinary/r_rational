You know, sorry to ping you on an old thread, but something happened today to me that really made what you said ring true. I am traveling right now in India, and I met a kid, a ten year old, who took me around and showed me things in the area of the city we're in. He frankly was more street-smart and seemed more inwardly strong than I am (in a way that became even more heartbreaking when he offered to perform sexual acts in exchange for money). He also I guess emotionally manipulated me like a violin even though I was totally aware what he was doing. I am sort of out of sorts over this, but it made your comment about ten year olds acting so adult-like in a war-torn society all the more believable.
