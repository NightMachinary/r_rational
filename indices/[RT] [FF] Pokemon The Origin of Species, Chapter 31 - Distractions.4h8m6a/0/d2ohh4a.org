It's mildly possible that I am just wired on coffee, but I think this chapter was your best! It was exciting, dramatic, and clear what was going on at all times. Favourite quotes:

#+begin_quote
  "That's what makes renegades so scary, isn't it? They don't walk around with a big red R on their shirt. Anyone could be one."
#+end_quote

(Very HPMoR, by the way--a mild jab at canon that also epitomises how your story is different.)

#+begin_quote
  "Fire and fungi. Bugs and birds. Poison and paras. Simple equations with obvious outcomes, if the variables are anywhere near even. [...]"
#+end_quote

And finally the quote by Giovanni at the end. World building! Drama! Only one slight critique on that. "[T]here was once a wealthy province where petty crime ran rampant[...]" sounds weak, like a mythology rather than an actual historic event. The passive phrasing gives it that feeling. I'd recommend having Giovanni more specific as to the event/time period to give it historical credence.
