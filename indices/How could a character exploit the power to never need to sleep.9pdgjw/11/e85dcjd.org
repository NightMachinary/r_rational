No one has mentioned it yet, but without the need to sleep a person wouldn't necessarily need a domicile.

I can see having one for a place to work / study / live but it wouldn't be required. (Not to mention a lack of a bed taking up space.) They would be able to live in a much smaller place in a more expensive area while maintaining a higher standard of living.
