Does the character just not tire at all? Physically, emotionally, mentally, none of it? He's always fresh as the morning dew?

If that's the case, endurance athletics. He could win the Tour de France while barely trying.

If he can physically exhaust but never mentally tires, he could still be a great deal more productive than a normal person (as they tend to top out at about eight productive hours a day, giving this guy triple the productive time, compared to anyone else).

He would make lots of money as a truck driver or airline pilot (if the company could be convinced to exempt him from workplace safety regs).
