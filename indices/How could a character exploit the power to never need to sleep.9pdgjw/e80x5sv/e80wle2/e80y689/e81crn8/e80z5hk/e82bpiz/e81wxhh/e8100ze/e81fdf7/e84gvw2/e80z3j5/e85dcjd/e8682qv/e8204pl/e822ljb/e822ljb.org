If you want to be creative, he would be a great counter to villains whose power depends on sleep. Perhaps someone uses nightmares to terrorize and oppress a community, or even remote-control them.

They could also be a great sidekick to a hero whose power sends people to sleep. If it is a blanket AoE, they would be able to resist the effect and complete their object, or simply protect the other hero.

Or take it in a different direction. When it comes down to it, not being able to sleep is more of a rear-echelon power. He would be the perfect desk-based hero-coordinator, the perfect (political or super) leader's personal assistant, or even the perfect platoon priest, always available for guidance.
