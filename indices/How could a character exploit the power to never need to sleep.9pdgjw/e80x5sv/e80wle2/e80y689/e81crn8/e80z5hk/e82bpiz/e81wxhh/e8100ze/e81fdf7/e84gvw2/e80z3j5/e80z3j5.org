That depends heavily on his character motivation and goals.

I'm picturing a lot of scenarios where he gets the jump on someone while they're asleep, but that's assuming he's in a scenario where there's physical danger. In fact, any kind of one-on-one mortal danger could be averted if he turns it into a standoff and just waits as long as necessary for the other person to fall asleep.

He'll naturally be more well-read than most people, but he will also be able to react faster to news and world developments: he could react to developments in the asian stock market while a normal person won't know a thing until the morning.

If necessary, he could pull off the appearance of magically appearing somewhere, when in reality he had been concealed and patiently waiting for hours, tirelessly vigilant for the perfect moment to reveal himself.

Similarly he could maintain the illusion of having an eidetic memory or being super-intelligent by goofing off and partying all day, and then secretly studying for hours every night.

He would have time to maintain two identities, both with jobs, ID, and friends who can vouch for their existence.
