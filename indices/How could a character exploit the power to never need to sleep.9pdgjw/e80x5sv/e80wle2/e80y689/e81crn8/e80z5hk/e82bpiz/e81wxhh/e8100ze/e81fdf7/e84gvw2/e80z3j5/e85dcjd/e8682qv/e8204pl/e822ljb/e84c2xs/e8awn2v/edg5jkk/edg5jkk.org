You brought up a good point / flaw in this - he is always super rested and has all the benefits that come with that? that trumps not sleeping imo. What about a character that sleeps for 30 mins and then they are fully rested; a normal person apart from the fact that they have 7.5 hours more in a day than everyone else? hmmm i mean if you look at the average person they waste so much of their time that you could literally transform yourself into this super power character by having the discipline to focus on things and not be distracted for half your awake time every day.

Food for thought?
