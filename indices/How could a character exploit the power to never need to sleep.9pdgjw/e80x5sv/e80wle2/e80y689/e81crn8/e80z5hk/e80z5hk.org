It so depends what you mean with being perfectly rested.

Even if you got nine hours of sleep each night, factors always change. You could have restful or restless sleep. What if you're on something comfortable or not? Lights on or off? What if you do an all nighter, get nine hours then 24 hours later, get nine hours? What if you constantly shift when you go to sleep, even if you get nine hours every time? What if you do your best to fuck up your circadian rhythm?

Point is that no sleep is equal. Now, if that character always has perfect sleep, what about this: some nootropics make you feel like you can focus perfectly. You know how some days, you wake up and can focus perfectly, but others you can't? Is that included? Do they essentially have perfect focus/brain restfulness, or is that also going to be limited? What about when you focus doe too long, and need a break? Is that included?

What about the fact that when you sleep, your brain does stuff to help you understand and remember stuff? Is that process running all the time, but just without dreams?

If these all are perfect, your character essentially got a lot smarter, and maybe even got a (near?) perfect memory. And that's ignoring all the free time that character now has.

So yeah, you can definitely make it op if you want. Just remember any downsides. Like, can they go into any different state of consciousness/are prevented from some states? There's others, but you can probably think of some of them.
