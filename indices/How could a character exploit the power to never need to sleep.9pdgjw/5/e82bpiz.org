By far the most straightforward and also most generally applicable would be the general concept of a "side hustle".

​

Holding down two real jobs (or otehr full time occupation like education, or home improvement) has a lot of potential advantages form the obvious increased income and developing more diverse skillset, but also in ability to take employment risks.

Where a normal person has to consider the expected value of any high risk high reward venture which is usually pretty low thanks to the high risk part and compare it against the opportunity cost of the safe predictable option, our hypothetical insomniac can do both.

As much of what separates the extremely successful (Bill Gates) from the average (Bill from IT) is having taken one of those risks and it having worked out, being able to have one high risk thing and one low risk thing going all the time, is very powerful, and while doing it by sacrificing any social life/hobbies is a common way for the "highly motivated" to brute force success. This person can do so without the sacrifice, which also has the advantage that having a social life and hobbies is frequently how one comes up with the idea of their high risk venture in the first place as well as the connections one needs to get things done.
