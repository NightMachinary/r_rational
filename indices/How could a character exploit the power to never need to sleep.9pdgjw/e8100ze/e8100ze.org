1/3 more time than everybody else.

​

There are people out there that live on 2h of sleep per day using polyphasic sleep, in general they just tend to be better than average at most things.

​

I know a guy who is fully rested with 4h of sleep. He goes to bed at 12am wakes up at 4am everyday.

He is average, if anything the only thing he has going for him is that he's a doctor with a degree from a top university which can be attributed to the extra time he had to study. Well technically he co-owns a hospital, and has done so for 20+ years.

Other than that, he's fairly normal.

​

I assume that unless your character has some really big passions he'd be mostly bored. It's like what'd you do if you didn't have to work or go to school? Well play games, watch and read stuff etc. But when you played everything, read and watched everything and there's nothing left you want to do right now you get bored and start searching for things to do.

​

But in his case it's even worse since his massive extra chunk of free time is at night, when everything is closed, and most of his friends are sleeping.
