it's fairly good, even if it at times get confuced about what it wants to do. but the no fatigue part is in my mind stronger than perfectly rested. it's being able to read the phone book soo many time in one night that you have every single number in there memorized, witouth getting bored. even if you are perfectly rested, you probably can't stand five minutes of only reading the phonebook. a perfectly rested can still get boored watching paint dry. no fatigue? he will not.
