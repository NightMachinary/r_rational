assuming they don't find out/get the power before college the boring but easy answer is they get their masters at 21/22 instead of a bachelors; considering their are irl combined bachelors + masters 6 year programs and if "always completely rested as if he has had 9 hours of sleep." The fact they never get mental fatigue from studying would be massive; ofc to most effectively leverage this they would not do traditional college but instead sign up for a bunch of self paced exam based certificates; things like the CPA or the BAR exam don't actually require a degree (depending on state for bar most require law school some like CA don't)

ofc if they are actually motivated and had this power from the start they could just become the worlds best translator before finishing high school if they spent all "sleeping hours" learning different languages;

actually just realized assuming this "completely rested" isn't just mental but physical as well then best boxer /mma fighter / any physical sport would be easy if they are willinging to practice nights (or practice during day then at night do school work etc)
