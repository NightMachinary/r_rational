Well, now that I'm caught up, I have to say I really like the story.

I wish the introduction phase would end sooner (we /still/ don't know why the hell Ram is so special for the gods and/or the priests to make so much effort to keep him alive), but the overall pacing is pretty good.

The only thing I'd change is the short status updates before every few chapters, eg:

#+begin_quote
  As the note says, I'm trying for every Sunday here. I don't think I could write quickly enough to do biweekly updates for long. I have up through the end of Chapter 2 written, and part of 3.1.
#+end_quote

I'm going to be blunt: nobody cares. By now this is already obsolete.

These notes break the flow of the story, they make you sound way more insecure than the quality of the text warrants, and they don't bring the reader any information about the text.

I'd recommend you remove them, or at least put them at the end of the chapters.

(on the other hand, the sociological excerpts at the beginning of each arc are great!)
