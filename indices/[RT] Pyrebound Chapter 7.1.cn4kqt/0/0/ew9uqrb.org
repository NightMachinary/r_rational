1. The chapter "glosses" are a relic from the earliest days of the story, when I hadn't figured out how to hide the archive and needed something to go before the jump so I wouldn't hit new readers with spoilers due to reverse chronological ordering. The archive shouldn't be accessible now, but I kept them up through sheer inertia and to have a place to nag people about TWF voting. I'll give it 24 hours or so for people to reply to this with "stop! I love the inane commentary!" and then go through and gut them.
2. The slow buildup was inevitable for various reasons. I could have cut or compressed parts of Chapter 3, I guess, but that would have removed almost all action from the first third of the book and I liked how they turned out. The rest struck me as dramatically important for either exposition of relevant information or else as part of the long-term plot. However, you have inspired me to move a good part of the big reveal forward to try and break my bad authorial habit of playing cards too close to the chest for too long. That already just about wrecked one book. Thank you.
3. I think the only artist who's allowed to not be insecure about his work is Kanye West.
