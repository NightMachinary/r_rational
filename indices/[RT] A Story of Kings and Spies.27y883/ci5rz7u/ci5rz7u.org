There are two big problems with this (though I don't think those problems get in the way of the story too much).

- Let's say that Orin is a spy. What's to stop Orin's country from simply paying the money for a new stall? It would cost the Northern Kingdoms a thousand gold in order to cost Defensibleland far, far more than that. If we're at war, and I can spend a dollar to make you spend a hundred dollars, that's well worth my money.

- Orin might be a patsy who legitimately believes that an attack is coming, because he's been made to believe that by an outside party (a friend of a noble). If you're trying to bleed the kingdom dry, it makes more sense to use a patsy than a trained spy, because the patsy literally can't give you information that would let you distinguish truth from falsehood.
