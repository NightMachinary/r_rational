That's pretty kickass for you to say! Thanks! I'm glad it's not a technical nightmare (definitely an improvement from my early writing days), but it does develop slowly, I'll admit. World building for a bit then the actual action-action begins around Chapter 9. I'm planning on changing the delay for canon characters too (inserting new chapters) which should be soon. Like the "spirit" pun though ;) You do you and feel free to read it if you ever have an interest again!
