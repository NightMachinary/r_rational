I'd like you to watch this 20-second clip.

Okay so

1) The hiss is not aggression, the hiss is an indication of fear. You do NOT punish that animal. That is an animal who has less than zero experience with having been exposed to human punishment. It has never been punished. Bop it on the nose and it bops your jugular open.

2) You can see that there's a toy in the midst of the damage, meaning the animal was playing with its toy when it broke the furniture.

3) She knows that the human knows that she's the one who broke the furniture, and that doing such a thing is likely to upset the human.

I haven't drank in a while and this thread has already been removed but I just wanted to say that all you "rationalist" types who think you understand brains and cognition and whatever are just as stupid as religionists, all brains are brains and brains brain just like livers detoxify and stomachs digest. There's nothing magical about the human brain that elevates us above the other animals, you're just an animal, we're not special, the glob of jelly-flesh in your skull isn't even the most complex glob of jelly-flesh on this planet in comparison to dolphins, and I'd wager that ravens and elephants and most of the apes and most of the parrots and most of the whales would be capable of just as much "meta-cognition" - or whatever it is that you people think is somehow special - as we are if they had thumbs with which to invent language, there are statistically probably fuckin 12 planets in this galaxy alone with animals who have brains as complex as or more complex than a dolphin who also had our happy accident of the thumb, sapience is an imaginary word to denote the imaginary quality of human specialness, like "oh man we think about ourselves and we think about the fact that we think about ourselves and we think about the fact that we think about the fact that we think about ourselves, oh man how fucking special," do you know that the true feral children we've found aren't like Mowgli or Tarzan or any other Victorian bullshit - from back when science still thought there was a human soul that would make a human a human no matter what - the real feral children aren't capable of learning language if they're caught much later than age 6 and they growl and walk around on all fours and act like an animal. What separates you from the rest of the animals isn't your magical special big brain, it's culturally transmitted information,

eh whatever i'm done
