The problem being is that so many still use sentience when they mean sapience. Sure plenty of things have feelings but true Sapience is different. One philosopher put it quite well when describing that which makes humanity different than dogs, apes and other sentient creatures (forgive me as this is all paraphrase as i'm fuzzy on details). Why is thought special? Lizards think about their environment. Apes think about themselves and others. These are not special to humanity. What truly sets us apart, makes us special, is our observation of our observation of ourselves. We can think about the fact that we think about ourselves and even think about that.

I don't think i put it anywhere near as eloquently as the original author, whose name escapes me, but I think it makes my point.

There is a difference between being conscious and higher consciousness. A true line between sentience and sapience.
