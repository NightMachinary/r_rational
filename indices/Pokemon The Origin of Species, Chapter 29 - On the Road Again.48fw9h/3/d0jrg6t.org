Great chapter!

I really like your idea for a capture montage, that was an interesting and fun way to go about it without the crazy amount of danger that's usually involved with getting new pokemon.

Out of curiosity, what do trainers in your universe do when they get more than six pokemon? Do they just keep their best trained 'mon with them or do they carry everything?
