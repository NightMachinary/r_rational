I can't believe I forgot about the new chapter!

Another good chapter and I have to say I'm glad they seem to have decided against going through the mountain. I'm not sure I could read a whole other chapter about running from zubat.

The wigglytuff scenario was another example of the hazards of the Pokemon world that make this fic so interesting. Really sets it apart from the usual fics where it's just the occasional battle against a wild Pokemon.
