Mega Evolution is a thing that I don't think will ever be explored in the scope of the story: I keep having ideas for side stories that I have to cut just to keep the already bloated and super long main narrative from being even longer.

Who knows, maybe when this is finished and is super popular enough some sequel series might spin off from it and cover those topics. For now though it'll have to stay theoretical.
