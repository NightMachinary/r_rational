Hey guys, welcome back! First a quick thanks to everyone that's been supporting me on Patreon. I've updated the reward levels, and have gotten enough pledges to start working on my website, and I'm excited to share it with you all when it's done. It'll be a great place to consolidate all my writing and projects, and will include pokemon related things like a FAQ that brings together all the most commonly asked and many private questions about the story's world that I haven't had a chance to answer through the narrative yet.

Second, I was glad to hear how many people enjoyed the last chapter. It was one of the shining waypoints I've had in my mind for the story for over a year now, and it was good to finally put it on paper, so to speak. Rest assured that it isn't the last we'll see of Mew 2.351, and thanks again for the patience you all have for the story's update schedule. I'm as eager as anyone to share the rest of what I have in mind with you all.

Thanks for reading, and final note for those following the games... Sun and Moon hype! I'm excited to see what changes they'll bring to the world.
