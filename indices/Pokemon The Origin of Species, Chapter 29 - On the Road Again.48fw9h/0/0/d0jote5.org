Thank you. I definitely understand what you mean as I've been turned off by a lot of pokemon fanfic because of this very reason, and the only one I've been able to really enjoy has been Game of Champions, despite its super dark tone. If you have any other recommendations that you feel hits the "mood" right, I'd be happy to hear them :)
