Thanks for another great chapter! I want to congratulate you on something kind of vague: your mood. Pokemon fanfics tend to veer towards hyper dark and gritty in an attempt at drama and realism, or they tend to be a little too optimistic. You strike a balance that is very readable and feels like a very reasonable interpretation of the games. (Okay, I'm having a hard time describing this exactly and hope it makes sense. It's just that I have read a lot of Pokemon fanfic in my day, and your mood seems unique in a positive way.)
