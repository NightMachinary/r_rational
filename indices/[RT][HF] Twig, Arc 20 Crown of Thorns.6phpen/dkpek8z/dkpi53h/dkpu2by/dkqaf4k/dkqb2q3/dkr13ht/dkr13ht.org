Personally, I think the critical part to liking Twig is understanding and caring about the characters, more than the worldbuilding. The worldbuilding is as good as it is in Worm, but it's far less vivid. The powers in Worm made a sort of intuitive sense which made it easier and more exciting to read in the beginning. It takes a long time for the experiments of Twig to get to that same level of understanding. But the characters, especially the Lambs, make up for it in my mind. I found myself genuinely loving each of them in their own way, far more than I felt for anyone in Worm.

The pacing is also really on point; Twig leaves room to breathe and relax to make the conflict all the more tense. The one flaw I will readily admit: it sucks to have to wait for new chapters. Generally I will get caught up and then wait a few weeks before reading again, but part of me almost wishes it was released all at once (or maybe an arc at a time).

I absolutely recommend those who started Twig but couldn't get into it to give it another shot. Just don't expect 'Worm-but-everyone-is-Bonesaw' because it isn't that. It's its own thing.
