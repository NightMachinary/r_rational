No better time to catch up on Twig than the two months or so we have left. Who knows, maybe you'll end up as saddened as I am that it's ending.

I probably wouldn't be so annoyed if I didn't see a lot of the same sentiment on [[/r/Parahumans][r/Parahumans]], at least as of a couple months ago. It's quieted down since then, and most people seem to understand Wildbow doesn't like people talking about it, but I imagine that's gonna change now that we've entered the last arc.
