It gets way better, both about that and in general, in the second half. Reading through it again it feels almost as if the first half is mostly intended to set up the second half, and the very different dynamic it has, which it does well. Still, it is unfortunate that all I can tell people who aren't enthused by the book is "once you get through the first ~500,000 words you /might/ like it."
