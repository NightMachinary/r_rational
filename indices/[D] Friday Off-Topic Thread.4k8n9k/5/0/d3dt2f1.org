I am pretty sure I could come up with mind-caulk explanations for all of this given a huge amount of time and effort, but I essentially agree - Young Wizards makes 'sense' in that special YA Fiction sense where every single thing makes some sort of sense in it's own limited context if you don't think about it at all but when you go to consider everything as a whole everything stops making sense and is nonsense instead. The Powers give tons of obscure prophecies that are pointlessly obscure, are excessively cryptic, and are in person extremely odd.

Other weird bits:

- the demographics. One part basically stated there are something like 1/10 human people as wizards, which is crazy because no maskerade would survive where everyone's extended family contains between 2-5 wizards. On the other hand, another part implied 1/10000 - which is extremely different and much more reasonable, but at the same time why are two seniors and two junior wizards in walking distance of each other? Also, the characteristics of Wizards, from the book, are not that rare.

- The wealth. Fred materializes stuff worth approximately $FUCKOFF in Book 1, and nobody cares or tries to use that stuff to quit their day jobs to devote themselves to wizardry or even just donate it to charity - Star Sapphires, Lear Jets, cars, I think gold, etc. Book 3, we get aliens and other worlds and interstellar travel, but no-one is making mad bank off of any of the obvious possibilities.

- The time use: Wizardry is done by guys in their spare time when they can be bothered and peoples' school or jobs are not keeping them too busy, even when the fate of the world or universe is at stake. Seriously, WTF is this? Why aren't the superstar wizards who are going to have thier powers degrade in a few months excused class for the duration? Why are super advisory wizards who control time and teleporters also selling ad space on the radio?

- Why the fuck are Cats wizards and also fully human intelligent... but also apparantly cats and happy being domesticated and e.g. spayed/neutered and otherwise being exactly like our cats within human society?

- Do wizards not find it super fucking creepy to eat things that can talk to them?

[[http://markreads.net/reviews/][Markreads]] is currently going through Young Wizards right now too, if you are interested in an extremely pro-SJW community that is also extremely anti-spoilers, and they proceed at about 5 chapters per fortnight and are in the middle of Deep Wizardry.
