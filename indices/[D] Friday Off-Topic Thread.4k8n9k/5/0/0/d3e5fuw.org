Some of those plot holes are filled. Wizards are forbidden from creating money except in extreme emergencies, which I completely agree with given my knowledge of economics. I think the issue with the animal characters is that they're a little too human, they're all but stated to be sentient with their own societies that all happen to be aware of wizards. Creatures used to make food, however, do accept their fate, which I like because it's an alien psychology that can be explained by domestication.

I don't think the time use is nearly as big a plot hole as the fact that younger wizards are expected to use their power so much more. The nature of destiny in the story implies that a wizard will usually be available to solve an important problem, it's the fact that children are expected to go on these adventures themselves that befuddles me. Harry Potter actually had better justifications for why kids were going on adventures and fighting evil, and had a lot of mundane stuff to do when they weren't.
