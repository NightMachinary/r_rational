  and are in person extremely odd.

Well that, at least, /isn't/ at all nonsense. The Powers are /not/ human. Try squeezing a few fingers into a sockpuppet and using it to do an impression of a dog to talk to the dogs about dog problems. /That's/ the Powers trying to talk to humans.

  Why the fuck are Cats wizards and also fully human intelligent... but also apparantly cats and happy being domesticated and e.g. spayed/neutered and otherwise being exactly like our cats within human society?

I was under the impression the cats view domestic cats as slightly weird, and actually have a third gender-concept particularly for spayed-or-neutered cats of either sex.

  The time use: Wizardry is done by guys in their spare time when they can be bothered and peoples' school or jobs are not keeping them too busy, even when the fate of the world or universe is at stake. Seriously, WTF is this? Why aren't the superstar wizards who are going to have thier powers degrade in a few months excused class for the duration? Why are super advisory wizards who control time and teleporters also selling ad space on the radio?
#+end_quote

Yes, this is an actual plot hole. Except for Tom and Carl. I was always under the impression wizardry was their primary thing and the ad-space and writing was basically just part-time work designed to bring in monetary income and support their real jobs.

Do you not find it super fucking creepy to eat things that were literally alive, and in the case of meat, emotionally sentient?
