I just bought one of [[http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B00Z7MMOB4/ref=mp_s_a_1_27?qid=1463751402&sr=8-27&pi=AC_SX236_SY340_QL65&keywords=survival+card][these]] little survival cards. Not because I expect to ever need it, but because it doesn't feel fair to give charachters I write too many advantages compared to myself, so now I can justify them having a pocketknife on them or something.

My priorities are weird but, shit, it was only 99 cents! (A dollar actually, but that's close enough.)
