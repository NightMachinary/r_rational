Heh. I have habitually carried a Leatherman in my pocket for the past ~10 years or so. I actually find that having this sort of thing on you at all times comes in handy a surprisingly large amount of the time, and I recommend them - Leathermans are a larger investment, but the utility (especially pliers) is worth it for me. I use mine pretty much every day.
