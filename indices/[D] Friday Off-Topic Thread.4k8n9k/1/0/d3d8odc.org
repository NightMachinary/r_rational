I did.

I played it a lot at first, so it's not terrible, but after the first 2 games I lost motivation.

The writing is pretty great, but once you've seen a lot of the events, that's over and you notice that the game is pretty threadbare. There just isn't much to do.

The aliens are all the same. Yes, they look pretty different, but they're pretty much the same. There are no radically different playstyles. I would say less difference between nations than there is in CK2 or EU4. There is no real character to these randomly generated races. It's just a bunch of bonuses randomly assigned to a cool portrait.

- The fighting system is not that great. It's very hard to understand what is going on and most wars are decided in the first big engagement. (After the parties get done playing cat-and-mouse.)

- There should be a lot more events happening in the midgame. There is a lot of exploration stuff early and some late-game stuff, but inbetween it gets pretty boring.

- Sectors don't work correctly. Their AI is pretty dumb, bu what's more, they don't build robots or enact Edicts or even build out spaceports. So you still need to access all those planets, which are now hidden in the UI or remember where they all are on the map.

- You can't order a new fleet at once like you can order an army template in EU4. It gets really annoying in big empires to get a new fleet up and running. Especially since most of your ports are in sectors.

- Armies are even more annoying, since you can put attachments on them, but that has to be done for every unit separately. It's also kind of opaque on how many units you need and I don't feel like better army technology brings me much. The hard part is beating the enemy fleet and not the invasion of planets.

- I'm sure eventually, with a couple of expansion packs, all this gets improved, but currently, I'm done after about 30 hours.
