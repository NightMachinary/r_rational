I did most of the great walks and liked the Kepler and Routeburn best, I think (couldn't do the Milford, though I hiked around there too and it was gorgeous). Some of the less popular ones were cool too (Greenstone, Caples, Copland). I stayed in Wellington for a few months and did a ton of day hikes in the area, which were pleasant as well (e.g. the one with all the windmills in the album, or the walk from Welly to Pencarrow Head and beyond).
