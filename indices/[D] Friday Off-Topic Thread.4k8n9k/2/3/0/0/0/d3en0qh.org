I did it before then (2011? 2012? ish), so I wouldn't know. Bummer about the storm though! Those hot pools by Welcome Hut were fabulous! (though I developed flu-like systems briefly about a week after swimming in them, where I'd accidentally gotten some water splashed around my nose. A bit worrisome, but not amoebic meningoencephalitis in the end!)
