Does anyone here like hiking or other outdoorsy stuff? I recently tossed some photos from a few of the hikes I've done in recent years on [[https://imgur.com/a/SA96g][imgur]] and felt like sharing. What are y'all's favorite hikes? Where will your future outdoors adventures take you? I think the nicest places I've been would include the Sierras, Northern Arizona, the (US) Pacific Northwest, and the South Island of New Zealand (sadly, my camera broke a fifth of the way into my backpacking trip in the latter, so I don't have too many pictures from there). My next stops will be Iceland, the Scottish Highlands, more of the Pacific Northwest, and maybe parts of SE Asia.
