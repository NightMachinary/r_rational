Our state's got a pretty good DNR website, [[http://dnr.state.mn.us/state_trails/trailstartup.html][which you can see here.]] The best hiking is found north of the Twin Cities, and I'd consider it worth a weekend to check out the area, which has a huge wealth of state parks and trails. We did that three or four times a summer when I was a kid. Southern Minnesota tends to be more farmlands, which are vital to the state economy but quite boring.

(I grew up in St. Peter, Minnesota, which is about an hour west of Rochester, but I currently live in Duluth.)
