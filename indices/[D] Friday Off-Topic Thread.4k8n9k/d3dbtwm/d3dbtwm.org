My job allows me to listen to a lot of audiobooks on the clock. Coincidentally, the Starship Troopers audiobook is available on youtube.

It's pretty good. The movie seems like it pokes fun at the fascist human society it portrays, but the book lacks that parody element. It's not persuasive as in makes you think fascism ain't so bad, but it makes the world seem much more plausible, and the citizen/resident distinction is well explained within the culture of the world. There also aren't any technologies that should transform society but mysteriously don't, like the resurrection tubs the movie added for no apparent reason, and the scifi tech that does exist leads to societal changes that make sense. I recommend it. Good book. Also the first time I've come across power armour in fiction and liked it.
