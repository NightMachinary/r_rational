/Starship Troopers/ (the book) is definitely soaked in militarism and while I agree that it's not really going to persuade anyone towards fascism, it does portray fascism is a pretty positive light. It's hard to know what Heinlein was saying with that though; whether he's making a full-throated endorsement of fascism or just trying to steelman it. I'm sure if I read more biography of him that would be clear, but I don't really care to. (Reading more Heinlein didn't really help me, because he took a turn somewhere in his life and became much more leftist.)

The translation it made to film is one of the most fascinating ones out there, because while there are a lot of movie that aren't faithful adaptations, and a lot of movie that change the moral, there are relatively few where this happens for ideological reasons. Verhoeven grew up in Nazi-occupied Netherlands, so had some problems with military fascism (to put it lightly).
