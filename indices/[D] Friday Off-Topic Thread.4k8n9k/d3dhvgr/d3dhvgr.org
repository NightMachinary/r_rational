I've been reading through Diane Duane's Young Wizards series and loving it (so many feels!!), but there's an aspect of the setting I'd like to nitpick: the lack of communication. The Powers That Be rarely tell wizards what to do, or even directly notify them that they have work. Nita and Kit just look at their manuals and say, "Look! We're on active status, there must be something important to do," and go searching for it. Wouldn't it make more sense to be more direct?

The Powers aren't the only guilty ones, I'm surprised at how unorganized wizards are considering their goals of universal preservation. They do coordinate with each other sometimes, but so far it's seemed more along the lines of friends helping each other out with problems that are usually mutual. New wizards are all but forced to face their Ordeal alone, even when Seniors are consulted they usually just provide advice rather than direct assistance.

Lastly, I have no idea why wizards haven't told everyone about wizardry and the Lone Power. I understand minimizing outside influence on Earth, disrupting the natural order causes entropy, but wouldn't telling people the truth make the prevention of entropy easier? Aliens know about wizards, which does make errantry easier to do. Humans will presumably make contact with those aliens someday, so would hearing it from them make it easier to accept?
