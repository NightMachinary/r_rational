Here's how it went down for me:

I decided to do the 'experiment', so I put my arm down and held it still. Imagined moving it. Imagined not moving it. Realized that I wasn't actually changing my mind, because the hand was going to remain still for a while if I was going to do this experiment. Decided I needed a fixed time limit, and if I couldn't trick myself before then I was just going to end the experiment. Realized that that meant move the hand at the end of the countdown. Immediately discarded the countdown. Realized I had just changed my mind, but saw no further avenue toward deciding to move it again. Thought about how boring it was to just try to tell myself what I was thinking. Thought about having a countdown. Didn't trust myself to adhere to the countdown. Got annoyed with myself for being unable to decide on something as easy as moving my hand. Realized I was still holding my hand deliberately still. Was offended. Tried to trick myself into accepting the countdown idea again, but failed. Resumed watching Parasyte - the maxim. Moved hand at some point.
