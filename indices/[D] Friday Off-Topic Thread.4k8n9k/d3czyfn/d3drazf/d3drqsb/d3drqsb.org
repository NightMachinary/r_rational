I don't think I've ever bothered to read any stories just for [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BileFascination][bile fascination]].

I guess a close approximation might be /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3929411][Chunin Exam Day]]/. I'd rate its entirety at three stars, but its first half (before [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3929411/35][Chapter 35]] adds intolerable levels of Sasuke bashing to the increasingly frequent and rather boring harem shenanigans) deserves four stars if taken alone.
