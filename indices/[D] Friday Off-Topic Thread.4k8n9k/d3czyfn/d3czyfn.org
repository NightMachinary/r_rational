/[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30200089][Life After Life]]/ is a /vaguely/-interesting time-loop story, [[http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/life-after-life-kate-atkinson/1112411960?ean=9780316230803][available for three dollars from Barnes & Noble]]. It's written in a weirdly-disjointed way, it has more characters than I'm reliably able to remember, and its protagonist doesn't start to recall her past loops (beyond sudden premonitions of terror) and make plans for exploiting future loops until literally the last few pages of the book. Really, most of it is a slice-of-life story from approximately 1910 through 1950. It's a gigantic bait-and-switch, for someone who, after reading the summary, is expecting /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644][Time Braid]]/ or /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3929411][Chunin Exam Day]]/ or at the very least /[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1113651][Sisyphus]]/. It's one of those stories after whose reading I feel disgusted with myself for not having found a better way to spend a few hours. Still, I found it just barely fun enough to be worth three stars on Goodreads--and, if you want something approaching one hour of entertainment for every dollar of expenditure, it provides a nice value for your money.

(Generally, I rate books as follows:\\
- ★★★★★ = awesome enough to be read many times (e.g., /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644][Time Braid]]/: "That was incredible! I can't wait to read it again!");\\
- ★★★★☆ = fun enough to be read several times (e.g., /[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62111][The Swiss Family Robinson]]/: "That was pretty cool.");\\
- ★★★☆☆ = tolerable enough to be read once (e.g., /[[http://qntm.org/ra][Ra]]/: "Well, I guess it was better than nothing.");\\
- ★★☆☆☆ = boring enough that I give up partway through (e.g., /[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/816][Cryptonomicon]]/: "I think I should cut my losses here."); and\\
- ★☆☆☆☆ = unbearable enough that I shudder away from it almost immediately (e.g., /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8186071][Harry Crow]]/: "Ugh.").)
