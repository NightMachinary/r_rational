So, is anyone else playing Stellaris?

My experience with it so far has been fairly positive, though I haven't been able to put in as many hours as I'd like. It does feel like there's a lot of room for additions and improvements, but other than a few bugs I've run into (nothing terribly game-breaking), it's a great 4X.

I do run into the problem I normally have with 4X games, which is that I find the early parts (dominated by exploration and capture of resources) more enjoyable than the later parts (diplomacy and warfare). I don't think that's a result of anything Stellaris does though, that's just how I am with any sort of game like it.
