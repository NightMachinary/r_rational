I have been, overall I think its pretty decent right now and has an incredible amount of potential.

The biggest issue for me is that the empire doesn't feel like it has a real internal life. For example, in Victoria II and Crusader Kings II you really get the sense that their is a civilization and then there is you. You are trying to steer this civilization, but it has its own interesting dynamic behaviour that you have to work with and understand in order to accomplish anything. Its very different than, say, Civilization and 4Xs in general where you're basically a God emperor who extracts resources from the "civ/empire" that doesn't actually have a genuine civ/empire being simulated underneath.

Right now I can see sectors and pops giving that potential for internal life (and, in fact, its not completely devoid of internal life as it is). But as it stands the sectors make it feel a bit like you're the God Emperor who got a little lazy.

That said I like Stellaris for the reasons I love Civ. And, based on the already scheduled updates and my expectations of Paradox, I'm looking forward to loving what Stellaris will become.
