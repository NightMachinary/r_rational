I've been playing it, and yeah, it has the 4X problem in spades. Part of it is the lack of events (they're going to fix that in the somewhat-near future), part of it is that the micromanagement isn't very interesting, and part of it is the tech tree.

I actually think it's quite a clever bit of game design to have three random research options, and three simultaneous research threads. It means you can get drawn in interesting directions instead of following an optimal "build", and it means more things happening at once. But all that is undone by having most techs be /dreadfully/ boring, and by the humongous amount of time they all take.

I am cautiously optimistic about its long-term future, once updates, DLCs and mods have done their work. It might take a while though. And I'm not sure they'll be bold enough to prune the tech tree, so we may be stuck with that.
