Orphaned story idea:

In /Madoka Magica/, Kyubee refers to having received his energy quota from "this planet". This implies that the Incubators have more planets than just Earth. But he also stated and implied that human beings, with emotions that can effect magic, are rare, and no small bit crazy, compared to the multispecies, astronomical-scale civilization that produced the Incubators and is mature enough to worry about the heat-death of the universe.

So Empress Homura sets out to conquer and reunite the many unknown worlds of humanity and take the fight to the Incubators. This "demon" stuff doesn't fool her: she knows the Goddess Madoka cannot be satisfied until despair plagues humankind no more.

Mahou shojou power armor and genetically-engineered SPEHSS MAGICAL GIRLZ may appear.
