Whenever I've played, since I was in my teens, I always chose one and just stuck with it. Most people simply do not believe you will continue to use the exact same thing every time. They start expecting you to choose something different. Say I choose rock, and keep choosing rock, every time. I win some, I lose some, but after only a few throws, my opponent starts feeling more strongly that I'm going to stop throwing rock, and throw either of the others, so they start choosing either rock or scissors a lot more, and avoiding paper. As they start choosing those two options, my win percentage goes up.

This has worked for me every time I've played a bunch of throws. It also drives people nuts. It's hilarious.
