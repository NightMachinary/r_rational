Literally rationality: "How to win."

So it boils down to:

- Level 1 Winner Strategy: Repeat winning move.

- Level 1 Loser Strategy: Switch to the move not used in previous (losing) round -- ie, if you lost via paper-rock, play scissors.

- Level 2 Winner Strategy: Copy your opponent's losing move.

- Level 2 Loser Strategy: Copy your opponent's winning move.

- Level 3 Winner Strategy: Level 1 Loser Strategy

And so on. By this reasoning, the Level 6 Winner Strategy is the same as the Level 1 Winner Strategy; I don't know what that says.

Frustratingly, the video gave no tips on how to recover from a draw, which is the outcome in 33% of all theoretic matches (though, I suspect, that percentage is much higher in practice).

Funnily enough, I wrote a clickbait-style guide to RPS years ago; it's still on Pastebin [[https://pastebin.com/xmT2zi7S][here]]. I'm not sure how well it holds up to the strategy in the video, since it's less of a strategy and more of a collection of stray observations on human behavior.
