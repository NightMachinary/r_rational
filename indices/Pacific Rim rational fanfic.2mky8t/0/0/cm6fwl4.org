I feel I am in the same boat, I've pushed through it and while the writing is so needlessly complicated and incredibly difficult to read it is written very well in that style.

It's something that I think is very rare to find so consistent, even with the obvious issue that it is so pretentious that it fills a niche for that kind of writing.
