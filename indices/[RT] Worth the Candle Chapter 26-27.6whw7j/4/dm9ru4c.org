My current hypothesis is that the character sheet is actually some kind of soul magic.

There's haven't been any mention of soul mages. But since they are used for fuel and other stuff. I think if they exist it's week evidence that I'm right. If I'm right, encountering soul mages would be dangerous as they could probably spoof the loyalty points.
