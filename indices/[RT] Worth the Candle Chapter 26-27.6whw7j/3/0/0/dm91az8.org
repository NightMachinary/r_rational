It's actually a 0 to 9 scale. A neat psychology trick is that people will answer 1 more readily than 0, even if they mean the same thing. Using a zero-based scale is useful if you want to coerce a certain answer. I believe Alfred Kinsey got flak for this because he used a 0-6 scale for heterosexual and homosexual preference.
