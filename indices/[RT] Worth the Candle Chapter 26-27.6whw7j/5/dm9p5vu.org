It's a bit worrying how nonchalant Joon is about killing people. The world may be a game, but it is one where the lives at stake are very very real.

Fenn makes a good point in that regard:

  “Killing that gold mage is not our end goal. I know that's probably the best path you to get another level up, and gods help us that might be necessary, but the thing we are actually trying to accomplish is getting Amaryllis back to us.”

Though she assumes killing is necessary for leveling up - but is that true? I would bet that Joon gets xp gain from winning diplomatic encounters as well.
