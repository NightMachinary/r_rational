I think there's a very big difference between "this plan is stupid" and "this plan is so stupid that it would have required the equivalent of divine intervention". People make the reputation/money trade-off all the time, especially against unsuspecting customers, and I have to think that was even more true in a time when there was no internet and reputation was more purely word of mouth.

His plan didn't even necessarily have to be "I'm going to extort you", it could have been "I am going to charge you for fixing this thing", which is what crooked car mechanics often do. The first thing that he did was say that he would have to look at the tattoo; he's badly off-script by the time he gets punched in the stomach, and I don't think he'd have to reveal that he fucked them, just that this is a problem only he can fix, mixed with a complex explanation about skin magic he could make up on the spot.

At any rate, I think there's enough information to maybe conclude that the plan wasn't particularly smart, but I don't think it's so not smart that you have to say that this only happened because god did it.
