  His plan didn't even necessarily have to be "I'm going to extort you", it could have been "I am going to charge you for fixing this thing", which is what crooked car mechanics often do. The first thing that he did was say that he would have to look at the tattoo; he's badly off-script by the time he gets punched in the stomach, and I don't think he'd have to reveal that he fucked them, just that this is a problem only he can fix, mixed with a complex explanation about skin magic he could make up on the spot.

That's the best valid argument from anyone here that actually makes sense for the context he's operating in.

There's still a risk that they would have forced him to fix it for free (he botched the work after all, so the plan is still not very smart), but in your case his scheme might actually have been sustainable.
