If Zeke's plan had gone correctly (i.e. if Amaryllis' party /hadn't/ turned out to be an unexpectedly strong group of adventurers), he would have had a considerable degree of leverage over them. They can't afford to retaliate as long as he has control over the tattoo, so going and blabbing about extortion isn't an option from their perspective. If they wanted the teleportation key back, they would have had no choice but to give in to his demands, and it doesn't matter what they say about him /afterward/ if he leaves Barren Jewel immediately after receiving the money.

This incidentally also provides sufficient justification for why he didn't extort them immediately after finishing the tattoo: he didn't need to. Without knowing exactly how powerful Amaryllis' party was, he had no reason to believe that they could just barge back into his shop and threaten him the way he did, which meant that he was free to make his demands at whatever time he considered most convenient. At this point, we could postulate a number of reasons why "immediately" wasn't the most convenient time... but that's largely irrelevant to the main point, which is that in Zeke's mind, this was a /risk-free venture/--once he completed the tattoo, he could do pretty much whatever he wanted from that point up until he gave them the code word, and there wasn't a thing anyone in Amaryllis' party could have done about it.
