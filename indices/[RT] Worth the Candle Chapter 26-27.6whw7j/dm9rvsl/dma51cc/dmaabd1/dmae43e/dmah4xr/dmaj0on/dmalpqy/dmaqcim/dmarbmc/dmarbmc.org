  How would the tattoo mage's other customers find out about the attempted extortion?
#+end_quote

Trivial examples include /barging into his shop while he is serving a customer/ as has happened in the story /already/. Another one is telling people about it; word of mouth was clearly good enough to get them referred to him.

You have a lot of options there, and rival shops might even help you.

Ultimately, no amount of rationalizing makes his actions any less implausible.

  That's not mutually exclusive with other options. A good DM would keep in-game events plausible, so there has to be an explanation for what happened, even if on some level it happened for game/story reasons.

The umbrella category is an entity whose powers and knowledge and motives essentially make them some kind of DM, even if that entity is the gamification system itself.

There isn't any way to save the tattoo mage's plan. It's just plain stupid.
