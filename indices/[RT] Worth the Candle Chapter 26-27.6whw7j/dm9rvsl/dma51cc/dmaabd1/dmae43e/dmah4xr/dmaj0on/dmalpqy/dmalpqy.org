I don't think that is a convincing argument for extortion. You need to add additional conditions like his escape being time sensitive etc. and make more and more excuses for why he didn't choose other options available to him. Purporting an extreme amount of time-sensitiveness means that they would have been one of his last customers. Therefore his best option would have been to extort them right after making the tattoo.

As it is, the story shows that he is still receiving customers and doing other work, not to mention he could never know when, if ever, they would actually try to retrieve the box from the tattoo. It could have happened a month from now and he would not have gotten shit for this effort if his escape is truly imminent. It could have happened a week from now and then he'd have at least 3 weeks to spend with a ruined reputation.

The tattoo mage is either an idiot or there's another factor at play, which I am calling "the DM".
