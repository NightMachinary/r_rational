The tattoo mage /did/ have access to not-insignificant magic in his skin.

If it helps, imagine it as a 5th level wizard trying to pull one over on what he thinks are probably commoners, only to have them come back and be /much/ stronger than he had expected them to be, maybe a pair of 7th level characters, and found himself more scared by the prospect than he thought he would be.

And once all that's going on, he has access to magic, but that magic is an escalation, and they've already revealed that /they/ are strong, fast, and have magic items, plus they seem really willing to straight up kill him. So using the magic of his tattoos is actually not a great idea, because it's likely to result in a full-on battle in his shop, one that he no longer thinks that he would win, especially because they're acting really unconcerned about it.
