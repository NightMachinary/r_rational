[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/55zwfb/d_wednesday_worldbuilding_thread/d8fb6tj][Last week]] I posted my take on the universe of Young Wizards that I thought clarified some points that were left ambiguous in a way that tied into the themes of the series, like how wizard pets work and using that as an explanation for other nonwizard supernatural powers.

One thing that I realized I didn't rationalize, however, was the actual story. Young Wizards is really about children with magic powers fighting evil, often with little assistance. Nita and Kit are tackle most of their quests alone and only receive advice from adults, and that is implied to be the norm for wizard children.

I have yet to read all of the books, but so far a reason has not been given for this. It's made clear that younger wizards have more power, but it's never clear why. Sometimes it seems like it compensates for their lack of experience, but at others they're recruited because they inherently possess more power.

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/51low4/d_wednesday_worldbuilding_thread/d7cvjlz][I've tried to rationalize child heroes before in a way that didn't have unsettling implications]], but Young Wizards just avoids the question of why the Powers That Be throw children in the line of fire and hope they survive. Is there an explanation that is thematically appropriate for the series?
