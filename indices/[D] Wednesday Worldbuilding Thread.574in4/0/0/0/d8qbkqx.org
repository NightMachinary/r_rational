When I first considered that idea I was annoyed that it implied wizardry is tied to a person's idealism or innocence, which I associate with naïveté. But now that I think about it, a naïve wizard would probably fail while those that succeed would maintain their idealism in the face of darkness and evil that encourage you to give in to cynicism. That is actually one of my favorite themes for stories to explore...and I had completely forgotten that all the books in the series are about exactly that.
