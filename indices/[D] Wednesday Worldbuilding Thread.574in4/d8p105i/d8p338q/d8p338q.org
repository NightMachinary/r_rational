It sounds to me like the risks of the enhancement would result in a specialized school to indoctrinate the children in a philosophy that discourages unwanted behaviors. Don't go wirehead because you have a responsibility to others. Don't reprogram your emotions because that risks turning you inhuman, with horrific examples of dark lords past and present.

The willpower problem is very weird because there's no psychological model where you can make yourself want or not want something at will. Even if you could encourage the kids to want to do something, they could change their entire value system whenever they wanted and not want to change back. What sense of identity would these people have if they know they're minds are just programs?
