Why do people even want to create these types of mages if they're so difficult to control? It seems like every one of these mages is already considered insane even if they're on your side, and that's assuming you can even find them if they want to hide. The only story purpose I can see for them is for antagonists or ambiguous allies, since every one of these should be feared by everyone.
