Yeah one bit that's going to make indoctrination difficult; is that the mages of this world mainly come from this group of people. Mages in this world are the ideological descendants of magical engineers in the old world (so scientists and engineers basically), so they aren't a culture that's likely to be very fond of this sort of indoctrination even if it's extremely valuable.

There's also the problem that there's no way to know what kind of changes they have preformed to their mind without powerful and rare levels of magic, and with total control over one's emotions and physiological responses, deceit should come with great ease.\\
There's also the fact that you can't very well tell them to not reprogram their emotions /whatsoever/, that sort of thing isn't likely to fly. At the very least people want their kids to learn magic and that requires a tremendous amount of mental discipline that you can't acheive without either over a century of training, or manipulating your mind.
