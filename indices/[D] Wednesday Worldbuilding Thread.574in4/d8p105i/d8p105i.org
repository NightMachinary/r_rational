I'm homebrewing an extremely weird Pathfinder campaign setting. Which has led to come up against yet again, with some of the problems with trying to figure out all you can do with control over your own mind. Within the setting there is a group that due to magical alteration from birth has total control of their own mind, as well as the ability to run programs in their mind, which are far easier to design than any normal programming.\\
For all intensive purposes all the abilities a simulated human mind would have (except for being able to run far faster) these people have as well; though they still have normal human bodies bodies, plus this is a non-magitek fantasy setting so there are limitations on what they can do with many of their powers.\\
It's of note that the setting /was/ a magitek setting more advanced than our own before a magical cataclysm so modern logic and stuff is fair game to consider. The nature of the post cataclysm world basically means things are in a crude simulation running in the minds of insane gods so nearly all advanced tech and chemistry doesn't apply, and the new magic system makes magic highly reliant on mages to constantly power and maintain it making magitek doubly impractical at any large scale.

/So the question is, what do you expect from the psychology of a group of people that have been in total control of their minds source code from infancy?/ I immediately realized the problems from wireheading, so at the very least the magical enhancements (which /have/ to be done in infancy) have some weak protections against artificially giving yourself any sensations that are /too/ enjoyable. However these could be easily be circumvented once somebody has basic logic skills. So the question arises how do you stop people from gradually going down the road to wireheading, especially when you're talking about children? Another point arises, how would the ability to always have the willpower to act in the way you wish affect somebody? Especially if that's the only thing they knew. I have a strong suspicion that these people would have extremely condescending views on other humans, because they have no sympathy for a lack of complete self control.\\
I also wonder the effects of people from childhood being able to just shut off negative emotions at will. I wonder how likely it is that this could lead to everyone in this society being perfectly selfish rational agents, and how that would bode when these people have a disproportionate amount of power politically and magically.

There was a story on the reddit where somebody got the ability to manually control how much they liked things that is somewhat relevant but I can't find it for the life of me.\\
