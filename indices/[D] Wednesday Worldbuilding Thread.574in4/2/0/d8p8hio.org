Depends on what tech level you're at. Large enough creatures would take an army to fight, and squabbling feudal princes wouldn't want to leave themselves open to attack after exhausting their resources on the beasts.

You could also say the creatures have religious significance, so the people believe they are the will of the gods, who punish the greedy and sinful, which would carry over to just about any time frame you want to portray.
