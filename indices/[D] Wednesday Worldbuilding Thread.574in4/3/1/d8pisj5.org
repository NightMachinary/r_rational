As a rough number, the poles receive 200 watts/m^{2} less energy from the sun than the equator, so swapping climates would take a change of 400 w/m^{2} (if we accept a naive interpretation of climate).

If we assume that the creatures are deer-sized and have the population density of deer in a good habitat (100 kg, 20/km^{2),} then each fire creature would have to put out 2 MW of heat, and each ice creature would have to absorb that much.

The box in [[https://what-if.xkcd.com/35/][This What-If]] looks deer-sized. According to that, 2 MW of output would mean that the surface of the fire creatures is about 1300C. If I'm doing my math right (which I'm obviously not), then the ice creatures would need to be at -1000K, or else cheat somehow.

Of course, that's all assuming that the heat/cold is coming directly from their bodies, as opposed to any sort of area effect.
