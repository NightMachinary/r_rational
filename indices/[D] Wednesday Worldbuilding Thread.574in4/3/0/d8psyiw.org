Ooh boy, the global circulation is going to be messed up /so/ badly.

- Ocean currents are largely driven by density changes... caused by temperature and salinity changes at the poles (the salt is rejected by ice formation).
- "Hadley cells" (atmosphere) are responsible for the cross biophysical structure of earth, causing subtropical deserts (eg Australia, the Sahara...) and driven by temperature differences.

All of these things are deeply influenced by the Coriolis effect, and making the poles hot and the equator cold is going to be /very, very messy/.

Over the period of a short change (anything less than many thousands of years), expect chaos worse than the nightmares of climate change activists. Every existing ice sheet will melt. Most species would go extinct and ecosystems will collapse. Sea level will be all over the place. Rain and temperatures will be highly unpredictable, leading to massive agricultural problems. Expect plenty of storms, droughts, floods, mudslides, and other disasters.
