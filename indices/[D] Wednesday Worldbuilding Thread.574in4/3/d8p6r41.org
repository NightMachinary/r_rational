Let's say I have a world filled with magical fire and ice creatures. The fire creatures populate the poles and the ice the equator. Is it reasonable for such creatures to begin to reverse the climates of these regions, what effects might this have on the planet, and, if the creatures would be negligible, what external events might cause the reversal instead?
