I think this implies that the pole reversal won't happen by accident. But if the creatures are intelligent then I can easily imagine them creating some sort of magical technology to cause this reversal deliberately. Large elemental spires that create or absorb heat in a manner similar to their bodies but on a larger scale. Or something like that.
