Well keep in mind prior to the creation of these people the only magic users were: Clerics (as I said all the gods are insane so clerics can get away with damn near anything that the gods shattered mind can't /obviously/ tell is opposed to it's values) who tend to also go a bit insane from contact with their god, sorcerers who can can only master the one kind of magic in their bloodline, and humans that managed to become mages through over a century of training, along with some who mastered it without necromancy by being genius magical prodigies.

Plus while theirs a clear danger from the one's that turn off empathy and act as purely selfish agents, that's not necessarily going to be the norm. If a lot of powerful mages and the god (well more of a demigod, but it's complicated) of magic all become enamored with an idea it's not hard to imagine how lots of people could get on board with this project to make magic vastly more widespread.

I'm not sure why you think they'd all be dangerously insane. There's two main threats that come to mind: The people who wirehead themselves until they either die or are otherwise rendered impotent, and the people who go down the slippery slope of turning off unpleasant things like guilt until they become totally selfish.\\
The one's who become totally selfish are the only dangerous ones but they're still totally rational, given the existence of contract and truth magic and the massive drawbacks to being cut off from the rest of the magical world there's a clear incentive to follow the laws.
