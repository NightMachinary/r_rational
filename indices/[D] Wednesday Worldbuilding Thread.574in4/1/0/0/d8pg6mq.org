They're unlikely to be out-competed /as a whole/ in /any/ scenario because being the only people who can become mages in more than one very narrow area is a /tremendous advantage/. They are also basically immune to mind control so that also helps cement their political power. The only other groups that have been able to cement nearly as much power are the bloodline of people gifted in mind control, and /dragons/.

  Simply put, I expect them to use magic to make sure that everyone's in roughly the same mind space. And if they don't? Expect them to be outcompeted by those that do (ctrl-f 4. The Malthusian trap).

I can see your point about those who use strict indoctrination having more success if that means they are less likely to wirehead. However You can't use magic to make sure they're in the same mind-space, mind control on these people requires a /really/ good mage so you can't count on magic making a difference here.\\
The Malthusian traps are also going to be complicated by the fact that since these people hold so much power, anybody who defects is going to lose status, or worse.
