If there's a very dangerous and predatory species of natural animal that favors hunting humans and livestock (by "natural animal" I mean something like the larger dinosaurs, as opposed to a magical creature - something that could easily exist in our world), would it be realistic for humans to simply avoid their territory, or launch targeted extermination campaigns where their territory is particularly attractive, rather than outright launching a global campaign to drive the species to extinction?
