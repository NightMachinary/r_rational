[[http://amzn.to/2ughKhO][Irredeemable]] is quite good. It's basically about what would happen if Superman's spirit broke and he decided to just kill everyone, with a unique cast of non-DC heroes and villains. One of the main superheroes is fairly rationalist, and the comic deconstructs and explores some of the more nonsensical aspects of the Superman archetype, along with providing its own in-universe explanation for it.
