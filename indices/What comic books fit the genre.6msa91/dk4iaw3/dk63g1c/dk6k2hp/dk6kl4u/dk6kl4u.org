But it isn't going to save millions, that's the point. It's not a basic trolley problem, it's a nutjob acting like a supervillain and thinking that this will solve real, complex problems. Ozymandias is delusional, and between him and Doctor Manhattan, superhumans have extended the Cold War and made the world of Watchmen a worse place. Also, I think you may have misread the ending. His plan doesn't work, people are catching onto his deception mere hours after he set it off, and Rorschach's journal with the whole plot recorded in it survives his death.

It's also not necessarily rational to kill thousands to save millions, or even to kill one to save a billion. The idea that utility/disutility can be aggregated within groups of people may seem intuitive, but that doesn't mean it's true. I'd recommend reading this paper: [[http://www.pitt.edu/%7Emthompso/readings/taurek.pdf][http://www.pitt.edu/~mthompso/readings/taurek.pdf]] by John Taurek for what I'm getting at.
