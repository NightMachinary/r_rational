Whether the journal is published is irrelevant. As I also mentioned, the last chapter shows reports coming in that people are realizing that the squid was a mindless animal, and does not represent an alien invasion (you know, the threat that Ozymandias plans to unite the world against?).

And no, it will not save millions. You know how the Cold War ended in reality? If you guessed "not by fabricating a extraterrestrial threat by slaughtering millions of innocents", you are correct. Alan Moore wrote that part of Watchmen the way he did to mock the politics of Nixon, LBJ, Thatcher, etc., the Cold Warriors who thought you could end the war through nothing but violence and lying about the causes and effects of that violence. That Ozymandias (and the people he was created to mock) believes that what he's doing is for the greater good doesn't change that their logic is (at least in Alan Moore's belief) still that of a megalomaniacal supervillain straight out of the silver age of comics.
