k, so Im gonna spoil the ending now. The idea of killing thousands to save millions, in my mind is a pretty rational decision. The fact that the antagonist is a genius, and sees that this is the best solution for the impending WW3, is what makes the ending so good. And that it isn't futile, but that it actually works, and Manhattan understands that.

I understand your point, and obviously he's insane. But it's a very calculated insanity and rationally thought out.
