I love Watchmen, but I'm not quite sure it's rational. The entire point of the story is that all of the characters are inherently irrational because of their psychological issues that don't really get resolved. The villain's plan also came across to me as a bit of a cliche by today's standards and the comic doesn't seem to recognize how short-term it's impact will be given the political situation. It's still a masterpiece that everyone should read, but I don't think a story about intrinsically flawed people failing to be heroes is appealing in the way rational fiction is meant to be.
