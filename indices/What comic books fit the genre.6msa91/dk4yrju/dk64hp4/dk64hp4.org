Not entirely sure that counts. Project Valkyrie seems to be chasing warm fuzzies over pure utilities, and nobody has mentioned having superheroes with super strength power turbines or do heavy construction. Of all the characters, Feral is the only one who has figured out how to make her power scale usefully.

SFP is good, don't get me wrong, but the main character in particular doesn't strike me as very rational.
