Invincible is fairly rational, or at least it introduces interesting questions. Particularly in the later arcs with Dinosaurus and then Rex. It's very interesting seeing a superhero struggle with utilitarianism. As an example, there's a story arc where Dinosaurus stops the MC from singlehandedly fixing destroyed cities after a massive catastrophe because he would be damaging the medium and long-term recovery of the economy.

Private Eye by Brian K. Vaughan(anything by this guy, actually). In the future, after every single piece of information on the internet was released to the public and you could find out anyone's dirtiest secret with just a websearch, privacy becomes sacrosanct. Enter our MC, an unlicensed private detective.
