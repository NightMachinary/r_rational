I think Injustice: Gods Among Us comes pretty close to rational fiction. Superman and his supporters definitely are not rational, or true to their canon counterparts, but that's intentional so we have another reason to root against them. Aside from the villains, all the other characters are genuinely intelligent and use the resources available to them in fairly clever ways. It helps that the writing, plot, and character development are good too.

If you haven't checked out Superman: Red Son, I think it's rational aside from the forced appearances by characters outside of Superman's mythos. Superman is still a good person even when raised as a communist, but reacts to the systemic injustice by using his powers to fullest extent that he can only for that to believably backfire. It's a really interesting character study.
