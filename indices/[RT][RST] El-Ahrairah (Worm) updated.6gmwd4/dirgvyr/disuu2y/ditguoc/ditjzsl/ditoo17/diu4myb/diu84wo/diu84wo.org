I actually agree with a lot of your points -- don't confuse me for the OP.

El-A is not good as a stand-alone product since it relies on a parallel progression alongside the original to drive the story along. It was disrupted by deviations (a duel with the LV team, no leviathan) which really threw off my sense of knowing where the story's is headed. The threat of Scion ending the world as we know it is a threat enough for me, and if the point of the story is to see a know-it-all trying to coordinate shards rather than drive them into conflict, then I'm fine not seeing her in mortal danger in each chapter.

For me, the story is an optimization game where the author throws Taylor into situations and she Thinks her way out of it.
