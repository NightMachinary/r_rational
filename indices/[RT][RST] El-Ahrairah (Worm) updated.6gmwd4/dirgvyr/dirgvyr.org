I know it's been posted here before, but in case some people haven't realized yet, this is a /really good/ Worm fanfic that /definitely/ deserves the read. Intelligent characters of all levels (1, 2, and 3) abound, and halfway through there's one of the best examples of a solvable mystery I've ever seen (that doesn't come from HPMoR). I debated with myself a little about whether to add the [RST] tag to a story whose author didn't explicitly claim it to be a rationalist tale, but the themes of the story are just so, so strongly rationalist that in the end I felt it was deserved.

If you're new to this story, give it a read. And if you're not... well, here's your reminder that it updated.

*EDIT:* There's also an UNSONG reference halfway through one of the new chapters, so hey.
