Not sure i'd call it "really good". The way she immediatly becomes completely overpowered ( the precog aspect of her power felt very forced ) is very unsatisfying for a story. And she easely befriends cauldron, the protectorate, director pigot and deals with coil in the first few chapter, which is kind of ridiculous... Only read it to page 32 before droping it, so maybe it gets better, but so far havn't seen anything to distinguish it from the miriade other power-fantasy-worm-fanfic.
