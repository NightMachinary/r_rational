I am the OP, and I think I understand your complaint. To start things off, let me address the last part of your post, since I think it neatly encapsulates our disagreement:

#+begin_quote
  How would you feel about a story of jedi frodo, smashing everything with ease for most of the story, while sauron has a deathstar being constructed but not ready until 5 to 15 years.
#+end_quote

I realize this is meant as a rhetorical question, but I'll answer anyway. I'd be absolutely fine with such a story, /as long as Frodo knows and understands that Sauron needs to be stopped before he completes his Death Star and all of his actions are geared toward achieving that end/. If he just goes around "smashing everything" and winning a bunch of smaller battles that don't really matter until, boom, 15 years later Sauron blows up Middle Earth, then yeah, I wouldn't be very happy with that story--but not because the threat was distant. I'd dislike the story because the protagonist was an idiot who /didn't prioritize stopping Sauron over winning a bunch of smaller conflicts/.

Again, you seem to be viewing this as a story in which Taylor's obstacles are meant to be other parahumans--which, to be fair, many of them are, since this is still a Worm fanfic we're talking about. But unlike most Worm fanfics (and arguably, Worm itself), the overarching, /core/ conflict of the story is always about stopping Scion and the cycle, from the very first chapter onward. Taylor, who recognizes this, takes only those steps which forward Cauldron's goal--she removed Coil, not because she was appalled at what he did to Lisa, but because he presented a hurdle to that goal. (Of course, like everyone else, she too is prone to making mistakes, and that comes up later in the story, but I feel like that's not your core disagreement, which is why this is merely a parenthetical note.)

So, with this perspective in mind, let's take a look at the list of things you felt was "too easy" for her:

#+begin_quote
  -she gets a power that identifies shadow stalker's indentity instantly, as well as coil and everyone else.
#+end_quote

See, this sort of thing is what I would characterize as irrelevant. Shadow Stalker plays a (minor) role in the story for all of two chapters before disappearing again because in the larger context, /she is not and has never been important/. Taylor has so many more important things on her plate that Shadow Stalker is a non-entity; complaining about her (or Coil) is like complaining that the Frodo swatted a mosquito at some point during his journey, all while Sauron was slowly completing his Death Star.

#+begin_quote
  -she get's recruted by cauldron, and becomes instant good friend with the most powerfull precog, doctor, and number man.
#+end_quote

So, uh, I'm not exactly sure what your beef with this part is, since it really has nothing to do with your main objection? Like, she's getting along with her new co-workers, so what? She got along just fine with the Undersiders in canon after joining up too. If your complaint is just that Cauldron is too /important/ and that having them be cozying up to her so early on in the story is jarring, fine. But that's subjective, which means you still can't really use that as ammunition against the story's /plot/.

#+begin_quote
  - she instantly solves eidolon's issue, making him indebted to her.
#+end_quote

Same response as above.

#+begin_quote
  -any plan she makes just always work perfectly on the first try (like the plan to antagonize shadow stalker to make friend with the protectorate, or the fight with the other protectorate team, or the plan to give piggot superpower to bring her to her side)
#+end_quote

If you read on in the story, you'll find that this is simply false, and that some of Taylor's early shenanigans actually lead to /considerable/ repercussions later on in the story. But fine, I acknowledge this at least as a complaint that could conceivably get a reader to stop reading the story before it became obvious that it wasn't a fix-everything power-fantasy. Still, if you yourself only got so far into the story before quitting, I don't think you should be quite so confident in making this kind of assertion (that every one of Taylor's plans goes right).

#+begin_quote
  -her father just accepts all this without more than a small talk.
#+end_quote

Again, irrelevant. Danny is about as important in this story as Shadow Stalker--which is to say, he's there to provide an emotional foundation for Taylor's character, and that's about it.

#+begin_quote
  -she can make heroe's stuff work.
#+end_quote

Um, what?

#+begin_quote
  -She becomes precog after one week sparing with contessa. -she understands how to make formula cape perfectly after a week of late night work, in barrely a couple chapter.
#+end_quote

Now, I grouped these last two complaints together because I felt that these, above all, represent actual problems with the story. As [[/u/eaglejarl]] said, Taylor often gets powerups that are never really foreshadowed, meaning that the story sometimes violates Sanderson's First Law, and I agree that this detracts from its "rationality score". It's been something that I willingly looked past since the rest of the story was so impressive, but yeah, not a good thing.

But the impression I've been getting from you is that you mainly dislike how "easy" Taylor has it, and that's the illusion that I've been aiming to deconstruct in this comment. Taylor's life is only easy if you focus so hard on the little things that you miss the big picture--that lurking threat of destruction that's always there in the background, that most people never even get a glimpse of, and that Taylor is staring /dead in the face/ every day of her life.

In short, no, this is not a fix-fic. This is not a power-fantasy. I can understand that you subjectively dislike how the beginning of the story played out, and I can even understand how you might mistake it for some kind of power-fantasy fix-fic early on. But ultimately, it really isn't either of those things, so I'd appreciate it if you didn't bill it /as/ those things, at least without reading it all the way through.

Does El-Ahrairah have problems? Of course it does. Does that make it some kind of power-fantasy? No, it definitely doesn't.
