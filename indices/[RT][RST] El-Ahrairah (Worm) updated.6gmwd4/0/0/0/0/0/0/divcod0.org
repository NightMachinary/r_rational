  There's no such thing as a character being "overpowered" in an absolute sense, only characters that are overpowered relative to the obstacles presented to them.

I think you're generally right, but I would quibble a bit: the more powerful a character is, the harder it is to give them meaningful challenges and the harder it is for the audience to identify with them. That's why most of Superman's plotlines devolve to "and then the bad guy got kryptonite so Superman wasn't powerful any more" or "and then Lois got kidnapped, which is a type of problem where Superman isn't powerful because his powers don't apply."

Regardless, the problem with ElAh is that Taylor is overpowered compared to the challenges she is seen to be facing in the first XX,000 words of the story. Yes, there are bigger challenges on the horizon /but they are on the horizon/. What's on the page is what matters most.

Saying it differently: imagine that I gave you a trilogy of books, each one a million words long. The first novel (remember, 1M words) has the hero steamroll every problem with ease. There's no challenge, no real relationships are formed, and the hero never has any moments of self-doubt or emotional difficulty. I promise that in the third book he's going to fight a really big Big Bad and it's going to be really hard, but the entire first book has nothing in it to engage you. Would you keep reading all the way to the end of the first novel? Would you read the second?

Obviously I'm being hyperbolic when I talk about novels a million words long, but it should make the point. Most of us are perfectly willing to read a thousand words of curbstomp victories before the real challenges start. Most of us are NOT willing to read a million words of curbstomp victories before the real challenges start. Somewhere in between a thousand and a million there is a number of words where people say "not enough challenge for too long; I'm out." That number will be different for different people, and clearly yours is extremely high. Mine, and apparently [[/u/Towerowl]]'s, is much lower.

For the record: I don't recall exactly where I dropped out, but I definitely read several tens of thousands of words, so the argument "well, you didn't read far enough" isn't going to convince me.

On the question of Eidolon vs Shadow Stalker: I would agree that Taylor instantly identifying Shadow Stalker isn't a big deal. Shadow Stalker is not significant to the plot, has no redeeming features that make us care about her, never solves or causes any problems, and isn't powerful enough to be important in the setting. Anyone who hadn't already read Worm would consider her appearance a waste of words; the only reason it's useful to have her onscreen here is to give Worm fans closure.

On the other hand, Eidolon /is/ important. He appears repeatedly, is very sympathetic, solves various problems, and is enormously powerful in the setting. Instantly gaining his trust and help is another powerup, and powerups should not be gained as easily as Taylor gains this one. They especially should not be gained using an ability that is not foreshadowed at all.

  Danny is about as important in this story as Shadow Stalker--which is to say, he's there to provide an emotional foundation for Taylor's character, and that's about it.
#+end_quote

See, this is a problem. If Danny is there to provide an emotional foundation, he doesn't do that. Taylor barely thinks about him, and she should. In canon her relationship with her father was a big deal; it provided some pathos and made her much more sympathetic. Here, her relationship is literally "I need to save the world and you don't matter enough for me to make time with you." She doesn't need him the way canon!Taylor did, or the way any 15-year-old should need their (loving, caring) parent. Her relationship with Danny was a great opportunity to give her a real challenge and the author didn't take it.
