It's funny you quoting yud, cause this is exactly what i was thinking about about when i wrote my comment, hopefully this means we come from the same understanding of what makes good fiction...

I don't think i have ever claimed tailor was overpowered "in an absolute sense". on the contrary, i truly think she is overpowered compared to everything around her. Kindly point to the death star equivalent Tailor faces (in the first 32 page, obviously, as i haven't read further and maybe the writting style and tone completely changes after that). As far as i could tell, everything goes her way and setbacks are either ridiculously tiny or temporary:

-she gets a power that identifies shadow stalker's indentity instantly, as well as coil and everyone else. -she get's recruted by cauldron, and becomes instant good friend with the most powerfull precog, doctor, and number man. - she instantly solves eidolon's issue, making him indebted to her. -any plan she makes just always work perfectly on the first try (like the plan to antagonize shadow stalker to make friend with the protectorate, or the fight with the other protectorate team, or the plan to give piggot superpower to bring her to her side) -her father just accepts all this without more than a small talk. -she can make heroe's stuff work. -She becomes precog after one week sparing with contessa. -she understands how to make formula cape perfectly after a week of late night work, in barrely a couple chapter.

Yeah, no death star.

It could well be that eventually she does meet a strong adversary (but the way the beginning of this story goes makes me doubt she would struggles for more than 1 paragraph) but the trivially easy begining makes the story boring until we get there.

There is the threat of scion, but it is distant. How would you feel about a story of jedi frodo, smashing everything with ease for most of the story, while sauron has a deathstar being constructed but not ready until 5 to 15 years.
