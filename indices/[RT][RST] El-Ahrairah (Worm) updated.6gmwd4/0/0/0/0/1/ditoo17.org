If you read the story with an ear to the ground, you'd realize that Jack Slash will become the main foil when he enters the story. Taylor's power is basically a literate version of Broadcast and sparks fly when they finally meet!

The story IS a fix-fic where problems are solved rapidly (but often imperfectly which comes up later) BUT unlike most Mary Sue fix-fics, this one is written with loving care to the core content and a deep understanding of side characters that aren't given a chance in the original... a few qualities that make it an engrossing read in my opinion. This author has captured the music of the Interlude with all the right notes.

I'm a fan and I lost my evening last night catching up.
