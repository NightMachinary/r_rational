For what it's worth, I agree with every objection you made and will add another of my own: Taylor's character. It is completely different from canon and, honestly, there isn't much there. She isn't an uncertain 15-year-old girl, she is the Grey Lensman -- always confident, always knowing the right answer, always completely understanding why people are doing what they're doing, never really angry at her opponents but just a little disappointed that they're getting in her way instead of helping. It gets dull fast.

Here's a second one: she develops new powers as the plot demands, often without warning. She starts off with "see a text description of someone's power and interpret it". Not long after she adds "understand the person's motivations and intent". Then "combat precog". Then "push her emotions into her power well enough that she can fool Alexandria's body-reading". Then "run simulations of herself and talk to them and shift sensory feeds between herself and them to avoid nausea-inducement and they are always fine with being turned off even though they fully understand that that means they die".
