Then I guess we just have different taste in fiction, and there's little point arguing about it. I prefer a weak protagonist who manages to get by despite his disdvantage, rather than a senseless rapide escalation of power for both protagonist and antagonist.

And you seem not to mind having to go through a vast periode at the beginning of the story during which nothing threatens the protagonist.

I cann't say i understand how you can enjoy it, but if you do then there really isn't anything i can do to change your subjective experience even assuming i'd want to.

So it comes down to: you recomend this story, i recomend against this story. We both feel our own reason expressed in the conversation trump the other's and now we're just talking past each other. As much as i hate disagreing with someone (as that suggest that one of us is wrong and i don't want to be wrong), this is both very subjective and low stakes, so how about leaving it at that?
