There's no such thing as a character being "overpowered" in an absolute sense, only characters that are overpowered relative to the obstacles presented to them. Taylor in this story shares the same goals as Cauldron does, and therefore faces the same stakes: the complete obliteration of /thousands of parallel Earths/. You complain about Coil being dealt with so easily, but the point is that this is /not an average Wormfic/. Coil is not Taylor's opponent here the same way he was in canon or in many less ambitious Worm stories; in fact, he's not even a blip on her radar. With how much overwhelming force the enemy has at their disposal, for Taylor to have as much power as she does--the backing of Cauldron, etc.--is a /necessity/. It's also worth noting that some background parts of the setting have been changed as well, purely to make the cycle that much more efficient and difficult to stop--and in this sense, too, the story follows rationalist lines. To quote Eliezer Yudkowsky:

  Rule One: If you do anything to increase the protagonist's power, or make their life easier, you must also amplify their opponent or add extra difficulties to their life. *You can't make Frodo a Jedi unless you give Sauron the Death Star.* Otherwise, even if it is well-written in all other ways, your story will suck because the reader will know to expect an unending string of easy victories, leading them to neither wonder or care about what happens next. The Mary Sue is not defined by her power being too strong, but by her challenges being too easily overcome.
