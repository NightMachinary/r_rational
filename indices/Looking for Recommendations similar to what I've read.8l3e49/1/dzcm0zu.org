Well, the genre codifier of "rational fiction" is widely considered to be [[http://www.hpmor.com][/Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality/]]. It's pretty great.

[[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning][/Mother of Learning/]] seems to be generally well liked on this subreddit. I read the first chapter or two, maybe like a year ago, then decided I'd much rather wait for the entire story to be posted so I could read it all at once (apparently it's getting relatively close to wrapping up). From what I remember, it's good.
