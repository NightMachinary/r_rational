MoL is indeed a great read, and perhaps more closely fits the stories the OP cited, with the protagonist developing skills (albeit without a Sudden Game Interface) in a fantasy world.

If you /like/ the game interface, then The Games We Play is a classic of that genre. Also Harry Potter and the Natural 20, which is hilarious if you take even a casual interest in D&D, but is incomplete rather than serial.

And don't forget the recursive fics of HPMoR. Significant Digits is probably the biggest sequel, and Following the Phoenix was a pretty decent AU.
