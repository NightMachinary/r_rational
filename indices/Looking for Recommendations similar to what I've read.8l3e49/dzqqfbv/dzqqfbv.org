So I started Mother of Learning based on the recommendations here and others. Wow. Now I'm caught up and kind of sad I didn't wait until it was finished because it is so good.

I'll be honest, I tried Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality and while I liked it at first, I couldn't really get into it.

Aside from those two, I think I might check out the pokemon one next. Still looking for more recommendations as it seems to be relatively spread out (as in many recommendations on MoL and HPMoR but only one-offs on most of the others).
