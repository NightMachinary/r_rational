Well, Alexander Wales is the non-pseudonym pseudonym of the person who wrote /Worth the Candle,/ so you might want to check out his other original web serials, like /Shadows of the Limelight,/ or rational fanfiction, like /Branches on the Tree of Time/, or /Metropolitan Man/, which are fics of Terminator and Superman respectively.

By other authors, rational fanfics I really enjoy include /Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality,/ or if you're an Animorphs fan, /Animorphs: The Reckoning/ is great. If you like Pokemon, my own story /Pokemon: the Origin of Species/ is also fairly popular around here.

For non-fanfic, /A Practical Guide to Evil/ is an amazing classic fantasy series, and /Worm/ (or Parahumans) is an incredibly good and long superhero series.

Sorry for no links, on mobile. You can find them and a bunch of other really good stories in our sidebar links :) Welcome to the community!
