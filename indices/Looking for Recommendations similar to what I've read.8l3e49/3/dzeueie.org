You know, I was following and enjoying The Wandering Inn, then took a short break, came back to see that there were six straight chapters about Flos, King of Hype, and gave up.

[[#s][Plus]] and that made me sad :(

Opinions vary on the rationality level of With This Ring, but if you enjoy it, you'll never lack reading material, because it updates over a thousand words /every day/. And has done for five years, with about another 15-20 to go. Over 2 million words and counting.

Summary: An author self-insert enters the Young Justice universe, carrying the author's (extensive) general knowledge of DC comics, but having forgotten all about Young Justice itself - and wearing an orange power ring, fuelled by avarice. Superheroing, technological uplift, friendship and utilitarianism ensue. Also contains an alternate "what if he arrived just after a really bad day at work" Renegade timeline, initially just a few alternate chapters but developing into a full-blown second story, with different allies, power sets, personality, and thoroughly butterflied events. Prior canon knowledge may add to the reading experience, but is not required.
