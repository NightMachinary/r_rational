I guess I could see how that looks. My intuition is that using the styling from a WordPress theme on an HTML file produced from Scrivener is going to look terrible though. If you go look at the source of the HTML, it's got a bunch of stuff that no human would put in, and stripping all of it out is a pain -- plus even if I did that, the WordPress CSS /probably/ wouldn't work correctly, since it's not intended for that sort of "whole book" approach with chapter breaks.

And there's a limit to how much work I want to do on presentation for a book that you can only find if you know where to look.

(Now, if you're /volunteering/, I'd be happy to have a better-formatted copy up, so long as I'm not the one that's doing the work ...)
