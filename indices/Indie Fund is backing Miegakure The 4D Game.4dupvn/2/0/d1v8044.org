I'll take that bet. Miegakure getting outside funding means that Marc has some outside forces to account to, to actually release it sooner or later and he has completed multiple levels/worlds of the game. While Vale on the other hand is notorious for constantly delaying releases.

So I'd be willing to take a low-value bet that Miegakure will release before Half Life 3.

Them releasing by 2018 (Half Life's current expected release)? That's a different bet!
