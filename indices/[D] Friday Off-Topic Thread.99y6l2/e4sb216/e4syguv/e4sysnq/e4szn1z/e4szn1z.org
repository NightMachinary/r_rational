Glad you like it! I remembered the multireddit as being larger, and just figured out why - there's a lot of smaller imaginary____ subreddits that aren't included, but /are/ in [[https://www.reddit.com/user/Lol33ta/m/imaginarylandscapes/][this one]] - it has 41 subreddits in it total. If you run out, you can check through there (and some of the subreddits are pretty specific - [[/r/imaginarypirates]] for example).
