I use the "puppy reinforcement" anki extension, which will semi-randomly show me images from a folder on my computer during anki reviews as a method of motivation. I find it really helps, but I also am an anki beast (I do 300 reviews a day when I'm behaving myself), so I need lots of images. I tend to batch download them from some subreddits or from instagram accounts (they don't need to be high resolution).

phylogenik's post with his hiking photos got me thinking: does anyone have recommendations? At the moment I have cute animal pictures (animations don't work) and some travel pictures/etc from a variety of subs and instagrams, but I'm happy for pretty much anything - some cool technology or space pictures might be good, for example. Not interested in food pictures but apart from that all good. Also, I have a special soft spot for infrastructure, especially cool highways / roundabouts.

So, who can recommend sources such as:

- Instagrams
- Subreddits
- A personal collection of wallpaper files you've been amassing since 2007 and are happy to put into a zip / imgur gallery and link me to?

*tl;dr: looking for instagrams or subreddits with aesthetically pleasing or otherwise interesting images*
