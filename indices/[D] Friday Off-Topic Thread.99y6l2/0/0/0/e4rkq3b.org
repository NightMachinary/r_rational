Thanks! Yah, balancing exposure and saturation and stuff is tricky, since I'm using cheapo monitors that haven't been calibrated properly -- the same image looks quite different on each, so I usually drag it around while editing and eyeball some average of the three. Afterwards I'll pull it up on my iPhone (afaik it has a really nice screen that apple's taken pains to calibrate well by default?) and usually it looks good enough that I don't bother going back to make more touchups. I'll keep the underexposure point in mind!

Hiking accessibility played a big role in deciding where I should go for grad school lol! So many cool spots within 2-hours' drive (granite cliffs and alpine lakes, oceans and big herds of tule elk, giant redwoods, etc.). And family lives in AZ, so I visit there yearly too.

Lenses currently in my possession are the SELP1650 and SEL55210 kits, the SEL50F18 nifty fifty (i.e. 75 mm equivalent, with the 1.5x crop sensor), a Rokinon 12mm F2.0, and a SEL18200. The last one is the most recent -- picked it up last month for $130 -- and was bought because I was getting tired of swapping out lenses in the field (specifically, I've dropped lenses a few times while scrambling to change them. I try to limit photography-related delays to at most 15-30 minutes per 8h dayhiking trip in consideration of my sometimes bored-while-waiting-for-me partner, so everything is taken while moving lol). Has served me well so far! Otherwise I probably use the 12mm the most, since it's the widest.
