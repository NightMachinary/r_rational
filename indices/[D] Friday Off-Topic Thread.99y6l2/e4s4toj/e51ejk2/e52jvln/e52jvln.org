Heh....I have great plot reveal planned at the end of arc/act 2, that will recontextualize every piece of information the protagonist has discovered into a horrifying warning about an impending future disaster instead of the previously benign information about exploring an abandoned ruin. Unfortunately, writing this part needs a lot of work for me to properly set up the foreshadowing.
