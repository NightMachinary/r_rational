I like horror stories with a twist that make it worth reading the entire story again. That's not a subject or theme, though....

The fact that [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere_(novel)][The Sphere]] doesn't reflect conscious beings is very scary to me. The realization that a natural phenomenon is being imitated by a creepy intelligence that seems interested in sentient humans is horrifying. It has just the right blend of inexplicable, malevolent, and irresistable.

I guess the theme 'we don't understand it but it has purpose' is what I find scary.
