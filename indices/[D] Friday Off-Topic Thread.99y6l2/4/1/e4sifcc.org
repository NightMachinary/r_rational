5e is pretty good with it. You can use the trait of a Hag (+2 CR when part of a coven) in combination with chained permanent True Polymorph casts to boost something from CR 2 to CR 7 (or CR 9 with Volo's Guide to Monsters). This works with Find Greater Steed if you want a more powerful "mount".

Summoning some Chwinga to get their charms or else Pixies to polymorph you is normal-tier broken.

Using Wish to bypass casting time is also normal-tier broken, with a Wished Planar Binding requiring that you keep the creature in range for 1 round instead of 1 hour. It also works well with Forbiddance, Hallow, etc.

Glyph of Warding can hold buffs and bypass spells-per-day, casting time, and concentration for 200 gp and a same-level spell slot. Forbiddance, Guards and Wards, Hallow, or Druid Grove are good choices once you have enough spell slots.

There's nothing preventing a Simulacrum from casting Simulacrum, even by Wish, so you can create a chain of 10 duplicates per minute (that each have everything except their 9th level spell slot). Alternatively, you could have one spend its Wish on getting 25k GP of components, then a bunch making Simulacrua the normal, 12-hour way, and have thirteen of them spend their Wish on granting your party permanent resistance to one damage type each.

A Zealot Barbarian can survive any amount of normal damage once it reaches lvl 20.

EDIT:

True Polymorph (or convince it to shapechange) something powerful into a humanoid, then Magic Jar yourself into it. Cancel/dispel the transformation, and enjoy your new, more powerful body with all of your class abilities intact.
