These are really good. I think the first two are a bit underexposed, but they are all well done. The shot in the redwoods is absolutely fantastic, and I envy your ability to hike in such amazing locations. I'm not personally good enough to give detailed critiques, but these are all much better than "beginner with a nice camera". What lenses do you have for your camera?
