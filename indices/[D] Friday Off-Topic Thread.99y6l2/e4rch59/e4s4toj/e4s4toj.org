I've been interested in learning how to write horror scenes. Horror in a textual medium is a very fascinating topic since so much of horror in other mediums is strengthened by jump-scares, creeping sounds of dread, spooky atmosphere, mounting tension watching someone approach an obvious trap, and other aspects which rely on a visual and auditory medium.

However with text, the burden of horrifying the reader must be placed more on the intellectual aspects. For example, /Carrie/ by Stephen King was an amazing horror novel due to how it starkly displayed the heated outcome of psychological abuse. The horror was derived from the more mundane actions in the story rather than Carrie's paranormal powers.

The summary of my long-winded post to ask what subject matters or themes would you be curious to read about in a horror story with paranormal aspects with a rational protagonist?

I'm just getting a feel for what you guys would be interested in reading about since you are the type of audience I would like to write for. ;D
