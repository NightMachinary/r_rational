  how do you break the game with a simple and obvious combination of spells?

There are many huge problems in 3/3.5 that occur with high level spells; almost all playtesting was focused on lower levels, as I understand it, so the game has a lot of difficulties with high level play. However, there also some poorly written or thought out things from lower levels too.

Here are some examples from 3/3.5; a lot of the various writeups are borrowed from FrankTrollman's descriptions of these rules holes.

- *Free Vacation To The Negative Energy Plane, No Save*: Travel to any plane with your party with appropriate protections, then cast /Gate/ to summon the campaign's Big Bad Evil Guy enemy and force him to cast buff spells on you for 20 rounds while your entire party all whales on him for the duration. Gate allows no saves or resistance for almost all potential foes (gods and unique beings are exempt - and "unique beings" includes basically the Tarrasque and very few other foes). Basically, if Evil Necromancer Karl is theoretically menacing your campaign world, he will instantly die with no way to fight back meaningfully.

- *Balor Mining:* In 3.0 D&D, at least part of the reason that (Su) supernatural abilities were chosen was so that they wouldn't be granted by Shapechange because they would be broken if grafted onto PC characters. In 3.5, Shapechange now gives Su abilities for no reason, and the exploits are everywhere. When you Shapechange into a Balor, you /gain it's (Su) ability to be carrying a +1 Vorpal Longsword./ So you Shapechange into a Balor and get a +1 Vorpal Longsword, drop the +1 Vorpal Longsword on the ground, spend a Free Action flipping off the Wealth By Level guidelines, and Shapechange into ... another Balor, holding another +1 Vorpal Longsword.

- *Wishing For More Wishes*. Wishes can make or improve magic items, with an attached XP cost. You can wish for items that have exceptionally huge XP costs, and not actually pay for any of those XP costs because the original wish is, for example, a spell-like ability (off an Efreeti or the like). These wishes are on the list of explicit wishes the DM is told not to dick you with, so ... the whole Wish paradigm is broken. There are various ways to exploit Wish, the simplest involves getting to a (Sp) wish for a magic item that casts infinite Wishes. Even if your DM is as dickish as possible with wishes, there are a few ways to get Wish (Sp/Su) on your own character sheet, such as the Ur Priest PRC from Complete Divine.

Of course, there are also broken magic items.

- *Candle of Invocation.* I already mentioned one of the ways Gate was totally broken, right? Here's a way to cast Gate for <10k GP - which is of course broken as fuck. Also, an exceptionally literal reading of the rules might allow you to Use Magic Device to prepare spells as a nonspellcaster, which is even worse. There is no reason for this item to exist.

- *Dust of Sneezing and Choking.* Stunning for 5d4 rounds with no save or resistance of anything is pretty absurd, not a lot of enemies can win a fight that starts with 12 rounds of them not being allowed to fight back.

There are even some broken monsters

- *The Shadow* Shadows are CR3 incorporeal monsters who turn humanoids they kill with their strength drain into a shadow under the control of the original shadow. You can make a shadow under your control kill some peasants and then it's off to the races as your shadow army grows exponentially to wipe out the entire kingdom in a couple days, and all life on the globe not long thereafter. It's like a zombie plague except you can't fight back without magic weapons and they go through barricades and fly and have better senses than you and turn people in at most 24 seconds from death.

Of course, they published dozens and dozens of books with hundreds of cumulative spells, monsters, and items in them, many poorly written and thought out. For example, Frostburn:

- *Ice Assassin Duplication*: You can make an Ice Assassin copy of a creature with all it's abilities under your complete control. If you make a copy of a creature that can /itself/ make an Ice Assassin, things get pretty crazy pretty fast.

- *Shivering Touch*. The power level of enemy creatures is /in no way/ correlated with random numbers from their stat line. 3d6 dex damage is enough to kill pretty much all dragons instantly fairly reliably; maximized or empowered, the number of things that survive shrinks rapidly. It's sort of crazy, though due to tactical considerations less so than a lot of the other crazy in this list.
