Shit, that's impressive. What are in your decks?

My "300 reviews a day" mode decks are stuff from courses I'm taking, but I have some flags and French word decks for in between semesters. I can't imagine I'd be able to benefit from the deck and the TV show both, but maybe it's the way I structure most of my cards. I think they're a lot longer than they should be.

Now I'm wondering if I can make a tag for ones that will be easy to do during TV shows (you know, simple histology slides or something like that)...
