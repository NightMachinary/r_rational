Yeah, I'll open up one card from my two study decks:

*Human Reproduction, Development and Ageing*

#+begin_quote
  As primary oocytes enlarge after puberty, the follicular cells become cuboidal/columnar, and at this stage, the structure is called a primary follicule.

  As the primary oocyte begins to grow, it is surrounded by an intercellular material called the [ZONA PELLUCIDA].

  As the follicule continues to grow, the single layer of follicular cells undergoes mitoses, becomes multilayered and is called the granulosa layer.

(yes, that is all /one/ cloze card, with a lot of those factoids blacked out at different times. They're not all that bad, but it's pretty representative of the minor heart attack I had at the thought of doing 700 of the damn things! 300 takes me an HOUR)

*Introduction to Organic Chemistry*

#+begin_quote
  Front: What are the three most important alkane reactions?

  Back: Combustion, Halogenation, Dehydrogenation
#+end_quote

(I also have some epic cloze cards in Organic Chem, don't worry)
