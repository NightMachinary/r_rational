Soooo....I have the first chapter in a quest I'm writing and planning out. I'm not actually ready to post the quest to SpaceBattles or SufficientVelocity yet, but I'm approaching a point where I want to get other people to take a look at what I've written and to act as a beta for me.

I'm not actually asking for a beta/editor, but I'm wondering how do other people here get others to proof-read their works? I'm curious about what other writers of (hopefully) rational fiction do when it comes to the editing phase in general and if there's anything I should be aware of.
