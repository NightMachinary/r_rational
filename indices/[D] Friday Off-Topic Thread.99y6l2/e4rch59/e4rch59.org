I've been getting more into photography lately, having bought my first inexpensive (~$250) interchangeable lens camera last year (but then stopped with the photo-taking for a time, as demands on my schedule escalated). As of a month ago I've picked it up again on the weekends. Have shared on instagram, facebook, and reddit but typically don't get much feedback, so have been wondering what people think and where I can improve (never had exposure to anything remotely resembling formal training). :] It's been a nice, very low-investment avenue for artistic expression (I used to draw a fair bit -- much easier to snap a photo!) and I figure some of the shots might be neat to show grandkids or whatever half a century hence. I vaguely recall posting [[https://imgur.com/a/SA96g][this]] long album here a few years ago, taken exclusively with cell-phones and point-and-shoots, and so wonder as to the extent by which more recent photos differ (beyond the gratuitous shallow depth-of-field).

Some example photos:

*landscapes* (while hiking) being the most common:

more abstract, artsy shots:
