I like the various artwork compilation subreddits that have fantasy themes, like [[/r/imaginarylandscapes]] (there's also [[https://www.reddit.com/user/One_Giant_Nostril/m/imaginarynetwork/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=ImaginaryLandscapes&utm_content=t5_2sf9b][a multireddit]] that you could download from potentially).
