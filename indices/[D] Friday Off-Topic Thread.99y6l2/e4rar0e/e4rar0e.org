i suspect everyone here is familiar with D&D. and how strange that system can get when you start to break down the magic system into what the rules technically allow you to do (anytime people do this, the rules change in response to fix the problem).

so, lets look at Pathfinder. this game is full of holes, because its based on the old 3.5 edition. it contains such fun things as: a level 20 wizard can be Immortal, can gain a feat to ignore component costs up to 100gp(with a gold holy symbol), and can make all kinds of magic items with the free feats the class gives. the wizard can also invest in businesses (with complete campaign), and use simulacrium to make copies of himself to help. technically, one wizard can live forever and slowly change the world. he can even live on his own demiplane that he created.

so my question to you: how do you break the game with a simple and obvious combination of spells? it does vary by edition. for example, false focus and continual flame would let a wizard make a 110gp item for every 2nd level+ spell slot every day, for no cost, then sell for half price (55gp). whereas in 3.0 D&D, summon monster at a sufficient level to summon 1 or more djin makes a stupid amount of money from asking for organic material (such as spices- saffron is basically worth its weight in gold), and wine, both of which are pemanent, as well as using gold to create walls of iron (a net gain in value if you want more iron), then cast fabricate to break bulk materials into useful shapes for crafters.

the problem does tend to get worse as new books are added, but many times can exist even in core as nobody actually sat down with enough of the potential problems to think about how they work together in the world.
