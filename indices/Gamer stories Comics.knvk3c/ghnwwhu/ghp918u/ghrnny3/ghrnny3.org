My least favorite part about Solo Leveling is the fact that no one other than the MC can improve. Like what's the point of training or practicing if you're always stuck at the same rank regardless of what you do. Maybe this changes later, but I couldn't get past more than 30 chapters. The world just seemed very poorly thought out.
