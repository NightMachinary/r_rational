  How you use your abilities matters as much as what they are.

Sure, but whether this can actually make a meaningful difference really depends on the design of the world. If you have a world like Worm, this can work because powers are so varied in scope and application. There's a lot of room for creative uses of ‘weak' powers.

But if you have fairly generic video game skills with limited scope (e.g. attacks deal poison, increased durability, etc.), this doesn't really work. At some point, diminishing returns from practice means that you'll reach the peak of what you can achieve with that skill.

Also, to make a setting like this work, you pretty much need the MC to have a ‘weak' skill that they use creatively. Or if they have have a strong skill, then there needs to be meaningful limitations or restrictions. Otherwise, it's basically a power trip with very little that's interesting in terms of plot. (Unless it's a parody of some kind, but that's a different discussion).
