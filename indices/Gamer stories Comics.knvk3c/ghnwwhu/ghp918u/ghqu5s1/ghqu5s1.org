The Solo Levelling /manhua/ is great purely from a rule-of-cool spectacle sense. The plot and characters are pretty garbage, but it's sort of like complaining about the plot at a fireworks show. If the OP likes The Gamer they might even like the plot idk.

I'm not sure I really get the degree of praise for DCC, having only read the free chapters. It's fun, and the occasional cleverness can be interesting, but it feels bogged down by just how much of the story is the setting being gratuitously dickish. Everything ends up revolving around that to the detriment of depth in almost any aspect of the story; what the characters do, how they do it, the humor, the NPCs, etc. WtC also has a fucked up setting, but it's also a lot more than just that, whereas it's plausibly half the word count of DCC.
