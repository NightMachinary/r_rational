That's not really what I intend, but it's one of the signs. It's hard to explain. Why does the MC getting his Gamer Power(I know what it really is but let's just call it this) suddenly turn him from short and average kid into a tall, buff, supermodel-like person? I've completely read the web novel, and his appearance change is a big symptom and indication of his total personality change.

Whenever he meets that strong American hunter, he always acts cocky and looks like he's picking a fight or disrespecting him, and this is literally how he acts towards everyone. I wouldn't really put much into the fact that he's nice to his family, in every Korean web novel even the most evil and assholish of MCs are at least nice to their family. The MC's interpersonal relationships with people that aren't his friends are just terrible.

There's also that one guy he kills in the ice elf dungeon. Sure he was kinda an ass, but it's not like the MC did any reassuring or even tried to calm things down, especially when he just hopped into their group. These things are a lot more noticeable in the webnovel.

There's nothing wrong with being handsome, but I have issues with how the novel handles his transformation. His personality both pre and post Gamer Power is totally inconsistent, and even if you factor in how overpowered his Gamer Power is, that's a lot of dissonance still. It just feels incredibly cheap, the way everything is set up and handled.

That said, as long as you stick to only the manhwa and ignore the web novel and don't think critically about the story in any capacity, it's great.

Perhaps I just have my grievances against the edgier power fantasy novels.
