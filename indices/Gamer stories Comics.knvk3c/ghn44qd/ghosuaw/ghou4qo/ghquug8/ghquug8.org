Idk what kinds of stuff you'll like, but these are stuff that I enjoyed. To be honest, I haven't read too many novels like The Gamer, but The Novel's Extra kind of qualifies. It's technically an isekai, but many characters in The Gamer also have powers, so it's easier to consider it an alternative universe than “real life Earth”.

At the end of the day, The Novel's Extra is a flawed work. The system is not really interesting or creative, and the plot is kind of all over the place about half way through the story (which is about the point I dropped it). However, I rank it very highly among light novels for the things it does really well: - The characters have depth. Not a whole lot, but the MC has moments of quiet self-reflection about his circumstances, and the side characters' backgrounds and motivations are explored. - The plot progression is really great, at least in the beginning. The story moves quickly from one threat to another and each one feels unique. It's not just another powerful monster for the MC to beat, or a generic fight against some other character. - The author knows how to build anticipation. This is best evidenced when the MC challenges another character to an archery competition having never used a bow in his life. That whole competition is hyped really well and payoff is very satisfying.

If you want a really detailed system, then Delve is pretty good if you're okay with other characters also having access to the system. In this story, it's more about how people choose to distribute their skill points and which classes they try to gain access to. However, the story progression is really slow, and is often bogged down by math when the MC is trying to optimize his growth.

Another interesting idea is Leaves of Terranthir, in which, only the main character has access to the system and is reborn in a Dark Souls like world. In this one, the story revolves more about figuring out how the system and the world even works. It's a bit slow and there's not a whole lot of character interaction yet (MC meets the first living character about 15 chapters in).
