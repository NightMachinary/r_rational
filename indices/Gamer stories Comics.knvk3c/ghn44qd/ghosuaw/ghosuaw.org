They are probably talking about the [[https://www.webtoons.com/en/action/the-gamer/list?title_no=88][The Gamer]], a manhwa largely based in our world where the main character is the only one who has access to a game-like system, if I remember correctly. Fanfic crossovers with it are more popular than the original, as it's quite easy to think "But what if Frodo could spec into magic and just summon his own eagles?" and get to writing. The Erogamer has been mentioned numerous times on this sub, and that story is basically "What if The Gamer, but lewd (and better written)?"
