This is not unfair. The start of the story has trigger warnings, rape in particular. For those for whom it isn't relevant it does a decent job.... shall we say easing you into it? The boundaries of consent are a fairly big theme running through the whole story in a variety of subtle ways, and this is obviously a big deal for some people.
