Note that the whole thing is also available from Patreon [[https://www.patreon.com/dinniman]] for $3 / month. That means you can get the entire story, first to last, for $3. You don't get the cute Toby bits (his pug, not part of the book proper) and there are tiny differences between the three versions (Patreon, Royal Road, Amazon) -- a sentence added, a typo fixed -- but nothing that matters.

Also, the part that's on Amazon is in Kindle Unlimited, so you can read it free of you have a KU account.

I strongly recommend this series. It's brilliantly written and incredibly engaging.
