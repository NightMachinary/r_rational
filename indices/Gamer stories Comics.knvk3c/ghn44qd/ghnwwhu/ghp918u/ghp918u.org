I'd HARD de-rec Solo Leveling. Now I'm less of the rational-seeking type of reader here, commonly delving into the trash piles of Japanese, Chinese, and English webnovels(and god forbid, sometimes even MTL!), and even then Solo Leveling was one of the worse ones I've read.

After the MC gets his Gamer Power, his identity literally turns a complete 180, from a hardworking, average, and kind Korean teen to an aggressive mega-attractive Kpop star-looking asshole who responds to even the slightest provocation with death, all while acting very arrogant.

It's not wrong to say that he becomes the stereotypical Chinese webnovel protagonist, and that is NOT a good thing, given their propensity for violence, arrogance, and violence. He also really never uses his brain for any fights since his abilities are so broken, and then there's the extreme nationalism and the treatment of Japan and America. After the shit Japan pulls they literally call him his savior, and both America and China are licking his boots.

The ending was also quite a mess. The story is so unpolished that I wouldn't recommend it to anybody on [[/r/rational][r/rational]], and even on subs like [[/r/noveltranslations][r/noveltranslations]] I'd be very cautious about it. The only thing good about the series is the manhwa's art.

Worth the Candle and Dungeon Crawler Carl are fantastic though. WtC is praised enough on this sub, but I really appreciate what DCC does. I don't really like how over the top comedy is blended into a lot of stories, especially ones as dark as DCC, but DCC does it perfectly. It fits so well with the dark story without ever feeling out of place or unnecessary, I'd even say it's crucial to the atmosphere of the story, which I absolutely love. The writing is not a masterpiece but it's my favorite in how it blends in the humor so perfectly. For a web novel, Carl is surprisingly rational too, arguably showing more smarts than you see from the typical game system MC. I really enjoy watching him try to break the limits of the system constantly for one benefit or another.
