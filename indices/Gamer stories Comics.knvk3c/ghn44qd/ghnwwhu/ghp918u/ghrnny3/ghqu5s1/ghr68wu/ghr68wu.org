  After the MC gets his Gamer Power, his identity literally turns a complete 180, from a hardworking, average, and kind Korean teen to an aggressive mega-attractive Kpop star-looking asshole who responds to even the slightest provocation with death, all while acting very arrogant.

I'm not a fan of Solo Leveling, but criticizing the mc for being handsome is kind of silly. Which is all your character criticism seems to be. Because his appearance changes, your perception of him changes and so does the words you use for his traits. He continues being a kind (helps his family and friends), hardworking, timid korean kid.

​

Sociability level for instance, good looking people can be introverts, it just changes how they are perceived, instead of shy or quiet people see them as distant, arrogant, aloof, standoffish, cold etc.

​

Hardworking can just as easily be seen as arrogant, proud, aloof, assholish etc.

​

He's not particularly violent either, maybe something changes in the novel but he doesn't kill anybody in cold blood IIRC. The most he does is spar or face off people that are rude towards him or people he cares about, generally involving 'showing off his powerful aura'.

​

I'm not a fan of solo leveling though, I'd have dropped it already if my IRL friends didn't force me to read it so we can talk about it..
