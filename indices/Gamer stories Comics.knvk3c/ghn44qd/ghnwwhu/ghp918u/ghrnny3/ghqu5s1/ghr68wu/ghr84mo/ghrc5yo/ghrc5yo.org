Again I'm not a fan. It's a generic 'Look at how cool the author self insert is today' type of story. The plot and everything around is there just for that purpose.

I only read it because a friend kept recommending it to me and the art is good. It's too good for what it is in fact, 50-100 years ago that level of art would be museum worthy, it's insane that nowadays that's normally seen in popular korean webcomics.

My only problem was that your criticism of the main character seemed to be exclusively caused by the fact that he becomes handsome. Sure, that's something that didn't need to happen, it's silly power fantasy, harem type generic manhwa fluff. That type of thing is expected there, it happens before chapter 5 if that's an issue you should have dropped it there.

My view / point is that the MC didn't change, that's always who he was, it's just that in the beginning those traits seem different because people can more easily empathize with him than they can later on. Coupled with a general tendency some people have to disliking good looking individuals of the same sex as them.. This dislike can alter the way they see the character or person and label their traits more negatively than they would if the person wasn't good looking.
