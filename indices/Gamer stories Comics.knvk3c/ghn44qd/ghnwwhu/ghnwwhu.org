Solo Levelling Probably the closest to what you're looking for. Similar in nature to The Gamer in that you have a main character with video game powers in a world with non-levelling supernatural powers. Less whimsical, more gritty, death happens a fair bit. Korean web novel being converted into a manhwa. I'd recommend reading the manwha first until you run out and then picking up from the web novel.

"Greg Veder vs The World" is a The Gamer/Worm fusion fanfiction. I haven't checked up on it in a while so I don't quite remember where it's at. Main character has game type statistics but is not in a video game. Warning: Has a lot of the grittiness you'd expect from Worm.

"The City and the Dungeon" by Mathew Schmidtt is a good audiobook. Set in the near future, main character has game type statstics but so do all "Delvers".

"Dungeon Crawler Carl" used to be free on royal road, now the first book can be gotten from Amazon and I think the rest of the chapters are still available on Royal Road. Fantastic. Main character has game stats, and so do most others, but the nature of reality is a little bit uncertain. Each chapter has an afterword by the author where he chronicles his pug's valiant struggles against an army of clone infiltrators

"Worth the Candle" is a high fantasy type story available on Royal Road and AOOO. Main character has stats and is working through what appears to be a fantasy world. Nature of reality is heavily uncertain. Warning: Really heavy sometimes. Author chooses not to use content warnings.

"Street Cultivation" Audiobook series. Low powered street-level fantasy. Technically everyone has stats- Everyone has access to ki and it can be quantified using a phone app. I recommend it if you've got audiobook access but it's much more of an underdog story than the Deus Ex Machina stompfest that The Gamer tends to be.
