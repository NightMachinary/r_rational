One manga I enjoyed with this premise is "So I'm a spider, so what?!" (Kumo desu ga, nani ka?!). The premise is a girl getting isekai'd as a low level spider in Generic RPG-land, and from there on just leveling up her way to godhood. I've read the manga, but apparently the LN (and upcoming anime) cover a bit more than just her personal journey. In general though I'd say it does a good job of balancing the typical grinding mechanics of this genre (which, let's face it, is basically the literary equivalent of a clicker game) with some good humor, carried mainly by a protagonist who is somewhat goofy and quirky.
