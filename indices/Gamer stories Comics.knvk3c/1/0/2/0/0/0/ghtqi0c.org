I'm sorry, but you may want to reread the first chunk of the manwha. You are completely wrong about this. The character you read about at the beginning is nothing like the character after he gets the power. If the story was self aware at all it could make the argument that power corrupts, but it never points out that he has stopped behaving like a human being with empathy.
