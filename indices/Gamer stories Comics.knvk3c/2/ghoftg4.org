The Gamer has been ridiculously popular for fanfiction crossovers, but they're almost all written for the "Wow, cool!" factor rather than being rational.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/kill-them-all-worm-gamer.830187/reader/][Kill Them All]] is a Worm/Gamer crossover where Taylor gets the Gamer powers instead of her usual bug control. It's a train ride of escalation, bad teenage decision making and some actual character growth, and is complete. I wouldn't call it rational, but it was a fun read.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-hardcore-game-gamer-40k-si.846904/][A Hardcore Game]] has a Gamer character inserted into Warhammer 40K. The writing quality is not great, but the character makes reasonable decisions, faces actual consequences for his actions, and real threats.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/siren-song-worm-x-the-gamer-oc.633613/reader/][Siren Song]] is another Gamer/Worm cross. One of Heartbreaker's children from the original story gets the Gamer powers. This actually makes him more sane rather than less. He exploits the system reasonably well, experiments with it, weighs the pros and cons of various social decisions, it's sort of rational. Long but probably dead now.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-daring-synthesis-worm-the-gamer.607375/reader/][A Daring Synthesis]] Another Worm crossover. Spacebattles loves Worm. This one has a canon-correct Greg Veder. In other words, 100% cringe. One of the few Gamer crossovers that has mental stats actually affect personality. Greg grows into it. Painfully. It feels very realistic, and given Greg's low starting point, it's rational enough.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-games-we-play-rwby-the-gamer-ryuugi-complete.351105/][The Games We Play]] The most well known one on this list. A cross over with early RWBY, it's better viewed as injecting a Gamer into a completely original world, since so little of the canon worldbuilding was complete by the time this was finished. Its own worldbuilding is very good, the Gamer makes good use of his abilities, but it does start to feel like a treadmill of bigger enemies, bigger numbers. Still, complete and fairly well written.

Why are these all Spacebattles? Because it's easy to find the stories and they have Reader Mode to make it easy to read.
