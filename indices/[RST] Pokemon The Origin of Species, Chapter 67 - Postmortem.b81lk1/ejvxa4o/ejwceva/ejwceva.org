The silence is back, and this time Leaf pushes through her shock. "Blue, you don't mean that."

"Would you have done different?" Blue asks, eyes piercing her. "Be honest, Leaf. For her, for him, for me. Would you have stayed outside?"

Leaf's throat locks. She can't /know/ what she would have done... she could say that, could try to stand up for Red, but...

Blue reads it on her face, and nods. "That's what it means to be someone's /friend,/" Blue says, looking back at Red now. "That's what you don't get, Red. You're talking about risk and the smart thing to do like it's a game, like your decisions don't say things about who you are, how people see you. Forget strangers you're on a mission with, how could anyone trust you to have their back on a journey, if they know that's how you see things?"
