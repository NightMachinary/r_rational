Yes.

So then I'd say... Blue's not recognizing that Aiko didn't earn that level of loyalty/trust from Red. Because I /can/ see Red following Blue into that building... because Blue (in this hypothetical) would have considered what Red was saying.

So Blue is reacting to the idea that Red wouldn't back /Blue/ up when he needed it, without realizing that Aiko and Red didn't have that level of bond.
