As much as I think Red definitely did the right thing from a utilitarian standpoint, and that I would've done the same if presented with the choices he had, I do feel a lot of people here are overly critical of Blue.

It still is something of a cold-hearted decision to stand to the side as two people, and particularly friends, ran in to what you felt was certain doom. Blue was right at the very least about it reflecting the kind of person Red is.

I guess the problem was just their differences in how accepting they would be of such a person.
