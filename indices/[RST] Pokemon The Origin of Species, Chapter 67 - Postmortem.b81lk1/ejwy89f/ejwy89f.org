I don't think that Red's honesty was a mistake. He hasn't been appointed a leader; it's not up to him to decide whether or not someone gets to make an informed choice. In the case of the Gym Second, it was the other way around, actually.

I think that Jack's decision to go in was...probably a mistake, but he did specifically tell Aiko and Red that they were not obligated to come, that he was doing it for emotional reasons, that it wasn't smart. So he didn't really betray his position in making that mistake.

Aiko's decision was much the same as Jack's. She went because she would feel guilty otherwise. I'd call it a weakness, a character flaw, because it hindered her from doing what /really/ needed to be done; but we all have character flaws. I certainly do. So, if the goal is to save as many lives as possible, it was a mistake; but if she prioritised other goals, especially if she placed little value on her own life, then perhaps not.

In the end, the mistake that was the most glaring, the most un-forced, the strongest example of letting emotions cloud good judgement, was Blue seeking Red out to chastise him.
