I think it happened in chapter 52, right before Leaf left for the cruise. And, yes, it was about the pokemon's inability to survive in the wild while they still had their conditioning. Leaf's plan would involve removing all their conditioning besides the "be nice to humans" part. I guess the best solution would be to design some pokeballs that only includes this side of the usual conditioning without the following commands part.
