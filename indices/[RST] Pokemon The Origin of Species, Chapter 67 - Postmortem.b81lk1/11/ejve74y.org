Ah, I thought this was building for a while, and with what happened to trigger it the fight between Blue and Red was a big one. More than anything else in the story I want more Leaf and Red, but that's going to be shaky with what's just happened. Though good for Leaf finding what she ultimately wants to achieve, it's a big goal, big as Red's, probably harder to achieve, though they are both monumental in sum. Surprisingly Blue is now the one lagging behind as far as goals go, being somewhat easier to achieve, which is ironic considering how goal oriented he is compared to the others.

Definitely looking forward to more Red as a psychic though. Good chapter, looking forward to the next one.
