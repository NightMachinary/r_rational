Incredibly strong final chapter of this incredibly long first arc of the story!

â€‹

I just wish the fight between Red and Blue had been a bit more balanced, since Blue's arguments felt quite weak and irrational in comparison to Red's. If for example he had claimed that Red could have made a difference by joining the group, thus at the very least potentially mitigating the tragedy, then it would have been much more impactful.

As things stand now, Blue's being clearly irrational and blinded by his "heroic trainer" persona: his argument basically amounts to a deontological grandstanding of heroic virtue signaling. While I don't think it's out of character for him to make such an argument, I think it would make for a much more compelling and deep-rooted inter-personal conflict if only he had thought into it a bit more and came up with more reasonable and convincing arguments on top of it. That way, Leaf would be stuck in the middle as opposed to clearly leaning on Red's side (as any reasonable person would).

Of course, perhaps this is all part of the author's plan in order to set-up some future developments so..we shall see! I cannot wait for the next chapter, hope you will surprise us again with a mid-month treat (hopefully a bit less of a tragic one this time around!)

P.S. That final scene with all the gym leaders greeting a nervous and slightly star-struck Red was pretty funny and awesome.
