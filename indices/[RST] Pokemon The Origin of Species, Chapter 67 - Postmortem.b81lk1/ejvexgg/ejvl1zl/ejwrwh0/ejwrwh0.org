It's not just that Blue is being unreasonable. He's being hypocritical. He wishes his grandfather had acted more like Red, and is in fact trying to work out a way to bring that about, even though Professor Oak had much more reason to enter the fray than Red did; he actually saved lives, and didn't as yet die. If Red is a coward for refusing to pointlessly commit suicide, then Blue is doubly so for wanting to take away someone else's choices and stop them from making a /meaningful/ sacrifice.

Edit: And rereading, Blue was doubly hypocritical, because Red stated that he should have lied to stop someone from sacrificing themselves, and Blue attacked him for it: "You would have condemned them all to death, just to save two lives?" Yet Blue would be willing to lie, and condemn a lot of people to death, to save just one life.
