Deserters are disobeying the orders of those who have the responsibility to decide what is best. If Jack had ordered Red to enter the building, on his authority as Gym Second, I expect that Red would have protested the danger, but ultimately obeyed. Jack didn't give that order, because he knew it wasn't necessarily best. So Red doesn't qualify as a deserter. He was being smart. Jack acknowledged that and authorised it.
