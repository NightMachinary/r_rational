Again, I am not saying Red is a deserter. I understand he isn't "disobeying lawful authority." But you /have/ answered my question: you believe desertion /is/ cowardice. I agree.

Now I /am/ equating your regiment marching into a hopeless battle with your "friend jump[ing] into a volcano without any highly trained ice pokemon." I consider refusing to join them/him perfectly reasonable risk-avoidance. I'm aware that refusing to join the former is desertion. I see no paradox.

Appeals to dictionaries kind of miss the point. You think of cowardice as some kind of moral failing, from what I glean from your comments. I don't. And I definitely don't view disobeying orders that would lead to one's death, "lawful authority" be damned, as a moral failing. Cowardice? Almost certainly. Valuing one's life typically necessitates it.
