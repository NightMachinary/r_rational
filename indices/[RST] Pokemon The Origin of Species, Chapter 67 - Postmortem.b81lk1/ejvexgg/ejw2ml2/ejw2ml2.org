  "You didn't know that ahead of time, you're saying it now, after the fact!"

Once Red sticks to his guns about it being suicidal, Blue insists that his decision making process is being determined by too much risk aversion; this time it may or may not have been suicide, but next time he may make the same call and let his team mates die rather than risk himself.

Glad you enjoyed the chapter!
