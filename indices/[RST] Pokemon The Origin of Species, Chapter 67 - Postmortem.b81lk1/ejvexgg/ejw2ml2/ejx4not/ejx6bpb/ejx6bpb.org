don't think so, really. maybe teleport them out as shit starts coming out using abras, or something, but even that feels like quite a stretch. Blue is in the wrong here, and while that sort of thing is easier to decide in hindsight, knowing what happened, he wasn't there, doesn't know the extent of the situation, so he is essentially just venting there. Understandable, in my opinion but not helping.
