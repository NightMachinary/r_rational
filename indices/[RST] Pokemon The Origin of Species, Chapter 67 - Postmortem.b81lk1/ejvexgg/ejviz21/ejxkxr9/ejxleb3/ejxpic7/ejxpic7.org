You may be right, of course, but the text just reads differently to me. It's funny how we all read the same text and yet come to such different conclusions.

I worry too about their relationship, as I loved to see it evolve during the story. I find it amusing how I thought of most of Red's worries when he decided against going to learn from Sabrina on the cruise as unfounded, and yet now, when they seem to ring truer than ever, he is ignoring them. Even so, I think they will be alright in the long run. After all, even if your interpretation or mine is true, they separated on what looks like good terms and I don't think the connection they formed during the storm will be washed away so easily. I may be a little too optimistic here.
