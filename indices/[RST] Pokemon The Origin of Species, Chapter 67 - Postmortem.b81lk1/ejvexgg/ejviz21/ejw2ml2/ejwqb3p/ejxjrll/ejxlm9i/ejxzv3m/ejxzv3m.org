I'm fine with Blue having two minds on the subject, but he then needs to apologise to Red for taking that out on him. If Blue ever wants to be an effective leader, he needs to be aware of when his judgement is compromised by emotion, and actually take Leaf's suggestion that this isn't the best time to be discussing it.
