Proving your rightness through hindsight is how Blue won all those Objections, isn't it?

And meanwhile, Blue is considering how to stop his grandfather from doing something /actually/ heroic, saving lives at the cost of his own, not just throwing a life away. You can't have it both ways. If it would be right for Professor Oak to stay home next time, then it was much more right for Red to stay out of the burning building. If it would be wrong, if it's worth Professor Oak potentially sacrificing himself for a good chance of saving others, then Blue's plans are purely selfish (I might even say "cowardly").
