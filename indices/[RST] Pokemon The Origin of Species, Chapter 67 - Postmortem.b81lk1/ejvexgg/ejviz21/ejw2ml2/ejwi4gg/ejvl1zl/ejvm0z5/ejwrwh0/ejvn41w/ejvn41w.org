Fair points! However, my main criticism is that Blue's argument could have easily been more reasonable, while not losing any of this "emotional hammer" aspect of it.

​

If a friend jumped into a volcano without any highly trained ice pokemon, would it be considered cowardly not to follow them?

​

Red's argument is that there's nothing he could've done anyways except for lying, so he tried and failed to convince Aiko to stay out. Blue retorts by saying "then you should've died!" which I'm sure even non rationalists would argue against. What if he instead replied something like "Sure you might have died too, but you might also have saved them! Didn't you think of that, Red?"
