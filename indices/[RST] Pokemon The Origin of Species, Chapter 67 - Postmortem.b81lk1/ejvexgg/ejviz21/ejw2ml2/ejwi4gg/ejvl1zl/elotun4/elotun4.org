I feel that our judgement of whose argument is stronger is heavily biased by hindsight. Red doesn't to my knowledge know anything about structural integrity and making the decision to stay out of the building frankly seemed weird to me, especially when an authority figure is heading inside.

I think that Red's case looks stronger because of what actually ended up happening but if Aiko and the Second had died to pokemon attacks inside the building instead the story would have been different. I feel that Blue's perspective is valid.
