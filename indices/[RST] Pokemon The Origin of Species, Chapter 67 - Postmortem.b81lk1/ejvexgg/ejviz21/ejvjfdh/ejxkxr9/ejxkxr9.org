Leaf didn't strike me as upset or disappointed in Red when he first told her about his decision. It seems it's more of a clash between her image of Red built upon their night in the storm and his decisions then and the reality of him now and his decision when it came to Aiko. Leaf is looking for what changed between his time with her and his time with Aiko. She expected him to follow Aiko, but that doesn't necessarily mean that she also wanted him to. She was quick to take Red's side when Blue started accusing him, so I too think she was clearly leaning on Red's side overall.
