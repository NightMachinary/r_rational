Up to the reader of course, its just not how I see it! here, let me re-look at the text...

Ok, so here is her first reaction:

#+begin_quote
  She stares at him, unable to understand what he's saying for a moment, then unable to to accept it. "You didn't... no, Red, you risked yourself to save strangers, you don't... how could you not..."
#+end_quote

I think "how could you not" has to imply some level of condemnation there, some level of moral disapproval. And later on she tries to make excuses, but they feel like excuses - like she is saying he made a mistake.

And during the Blue fight, we have moments like these:

#+begin_quote
  "Would you have done different?" Blue asks, eyes piercing her. "Be honest, Leaf. For her, for him, for me. Would you have stayed outside?" Leaf's throat locks. She can't know what she would have done... she could say that, could try to stand up for Red, but... '
#+end_quote

Here she even thinks about how she could support Red, but she cant honestly say it - she herself wouldnt do it (so she thinks).

I am not saying she hates Red or anything, and I really hope she comes around to understanding his viewpoint (actually I am super worried about that, given how much connecting they did during their fight in the city, for that all to be washed away - it would seem so unfair. Though I also ship em heavily, that adds to the worries!). But right now, though she wants to support him and doesnt hate him, I think the text says that she, from a moral standpoint, is closer to Blue than Red by a good margin.
