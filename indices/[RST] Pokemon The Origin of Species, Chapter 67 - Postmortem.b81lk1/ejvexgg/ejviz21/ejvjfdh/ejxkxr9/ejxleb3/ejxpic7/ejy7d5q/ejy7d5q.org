Yeah, thats totally fair - language, particularly emotional language, is funny that way. And Leaf certainly also thinks blue is a huge asshole right now, complicating things.

I have the same thought re: Sabrina - before him choosing not to go was a mistake, his relationship with Blue and Leaf was going to be fine! He cant let opportunities pass because of friends (or really, infatuation if we are being honest), and he can see them on weekends and itll all be fine. Now, even though it may still be smart, he has all these damaged relationships that he is leaving behind.

On the Leaf relationship being "washed away", maybe I am bringing in some meta-instincts here - this chapter was the end of part 1! But red and leaf had a lot of conversations they wanted to have and havent yet - their whole Aiko convo was hugely derailed by Blue, Leaf had intended to apologize/discuss the cruise and hasnt, etc. Since its the end of Part 1, however, I feel like its unlikely we will go /back/ to those topics, if red and leaf have another heart to heart on Part 1 topics, it would still be in that section. Thus my fear! Hopefully I am wrong on the subject.
