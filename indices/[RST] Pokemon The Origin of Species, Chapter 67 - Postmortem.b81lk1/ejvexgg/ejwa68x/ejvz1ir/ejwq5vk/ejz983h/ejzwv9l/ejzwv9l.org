While that's definitely an interesting thought, overall I'm of the position that ultimately trying to read rationality into anyone's perspective here is a mistake - they're hurt, and lashing out in an attempt to redirect the pain. Blue expected better from his friend and is struggling to cope with Aiko's death. Red is SUPER DEEPLY traumatized in a completely different direction from Blue, and had to feel a friend die when he was already emotionally exhausted, so he's just shutting down and trying to shove every part of him that's able to hurt behind a locked door. And Leaf... well, she's the least offensive here since she's not attacking anybody, but also her attempt to just put it off and hide from the truth of a deep-set conflict finally coming out into the open really doesn't solve anything so much as just being, well, a kid desperate to keep her friends together. This is the low point of the story so far, and ultimately I think it's more about everything being frayed and broken than about any one specific point of failure.
