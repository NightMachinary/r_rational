What if the story instead follows the original games a bit more closely, and the final result of this fight will be a championship showdown between Blue and Red at the very end? I doubt that's the direction this story's heading towards, but I wouldn't mind if it were. After all, now that Game of Champions is no more I feel the need for some epic rivalry shenanigans :)
