Wait, are you treating Leaf's new ambition as actually a good thing? My initial impression of it was more a creeping horror at the idea of essentially mind-controlling every animal on the planet. The failure states of such a conditioning program could very easily include several types of regional or even global ecological meltdown, and that's only considering honest mistakes rather than deliberate subversion. And then the ethical implications are /highly/ debatable to say the least.

Tl;dr Leaf's goal is scary not exciting.
