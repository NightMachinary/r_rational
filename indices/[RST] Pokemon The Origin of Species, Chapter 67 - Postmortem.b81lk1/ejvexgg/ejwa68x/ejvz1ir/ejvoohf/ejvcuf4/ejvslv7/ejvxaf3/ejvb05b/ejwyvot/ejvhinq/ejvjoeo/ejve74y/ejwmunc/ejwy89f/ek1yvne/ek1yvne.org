  I think that Jack's decision to go in was...probably a mistake, but he did specifically tell Aiko and Red that they were not obligated to come, that he was doing it for emotional reasons, that it wasn't smart. So he didn't really betray his position in making that mistake.

I think Jack should have ordered Aiko and Red to stay and help where they could outside. It's his responsibility to keep Aiko and Red reasonably safe.
