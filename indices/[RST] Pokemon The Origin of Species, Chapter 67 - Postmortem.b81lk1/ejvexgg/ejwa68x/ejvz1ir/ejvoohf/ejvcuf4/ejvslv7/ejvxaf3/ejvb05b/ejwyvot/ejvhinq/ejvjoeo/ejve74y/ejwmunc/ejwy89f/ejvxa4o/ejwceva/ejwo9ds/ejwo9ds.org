Hmm. Yes, I agree, but maybe...

Maybe what's going on here is that there's this underlying assumption that, if you're the person who needs your back watched, you're "in the right", and your friends should watch your back.

But there's a possible script inversion. If someone says, "I don't have your back on this", why do you NOT consider NOT doing it? This thought isn't complete, but I kinda want to keep going in this direction...
