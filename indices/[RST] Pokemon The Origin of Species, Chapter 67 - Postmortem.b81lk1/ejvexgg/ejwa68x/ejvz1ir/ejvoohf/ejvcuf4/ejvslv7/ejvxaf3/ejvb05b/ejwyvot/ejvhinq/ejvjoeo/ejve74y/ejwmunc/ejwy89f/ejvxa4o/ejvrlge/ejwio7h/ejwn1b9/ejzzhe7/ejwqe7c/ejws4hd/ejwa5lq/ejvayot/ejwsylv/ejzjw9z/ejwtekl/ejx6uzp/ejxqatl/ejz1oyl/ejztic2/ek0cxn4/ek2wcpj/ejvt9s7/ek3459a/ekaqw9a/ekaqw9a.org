Ok so over the course of the last few days I binged read this fic and god damn, over 600k of words and it's only felt like maybe 100k from how fast I read it.

I knew this fic was still active but I had put it off because I had wanted to read the story in it's entirety or at the very least a good chunk of it so it's kind of funny that when I finally do decided to read it I get to it just as part 1 is ending.

Idk if you'll see this but I'll write down my thoughts about how I feel about the story so far.

-i absolutely cannot wait until mewtwo escapes, or finally takes initiative.

-your characterization is very good, usually whenever I read something I don't take time to envision everything out fully, mostly minor details like what side character did what, but on this fic I forced myself to really take it in bc I knew that you can make your characters seem interesting

-which leads me to my next point. Aiko. God damn I didn't like her when she first came into the story. That didn't last long when it was clear she was going to be joining them for her journey. But damn she really grew on me. Her death was shocking but didn't really have that much on an oomph to it since I blitzed through the story but damn I know to others it was a shock. Ever since she saw one of the legendary pokemon I thought she was officially a main character and wasn't going to be killed off. Negl I skimmed through the chapter when she was going into the building bc I honestly didn't think she was going to die. Really hammered in how mundane the death of a main character can be and I know Red's fear of death is overwhelming now

That's about it for now. Can't wait to see how this goes.
