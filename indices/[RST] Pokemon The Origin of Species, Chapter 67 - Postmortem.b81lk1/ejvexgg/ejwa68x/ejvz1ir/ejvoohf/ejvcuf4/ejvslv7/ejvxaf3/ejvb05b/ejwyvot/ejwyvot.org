Ok so I don't know if anyone but me noticed this, and maybe I'm just crazy, but here goes.

Aiko supposedly saw Ho-oh once, right? Ho-oh is famous for having revived the fallen Legendary Beasts who perished in a burning tower, and left a rainbow in its wake after the fact...

Aiko died in a burning building, and it's pointed out that the day after it all went down that a rainbow is in the sky. Coincidence, or am I going crazy?

EDIT: For the record, I'm not saying I think Aiko is going to rise from the dead, I just noticed the parallel is all and wondered if only I noticed.
