Arc 1 complete! And the Sabrina join for long-awaited narrative shift is a go , I was pretty confident on all of our prediction there at least.

An obviously very impactful chapter, I think personally I was let down a bit by how little internal perspective and processing we got from Red. I think I understand the decision to put it in primarily Leaf's perspective - she is the more balanced in between the two for the confrontation, so you want the (relative) outside view. And she can be open with Red so he can tell her his feelings, giving us that internal process. I just feel like Red went through so many events without his perspective for a stretch, so seeing his own journey along that path was something I wanted to see.

I also find myself surprised at how harsh Leaf was with Red's decision to stay behind. But maybe I was wrong to assume that - Leaf is more understanding in general, but they are still friends who battle together, it can feel like Red saying "I would let you die in the future". And maybe I am also biased as I am wholly on Red's side in this, I suppose there is an argument on the other side: you can never know how dangerous things will be, you have to take risks and have each other's back in the face of uncertainty to function as a combat team? I think all the contextual elements of the moment make me on Red's side (hell, the Second literally saying its a dumb idea), but without those I can see intellectually how for Blue and even Leaf it was Red breaking The Rules and defecting from his team. Emotionally I dont feel that though!

Final Note: Leaf's plan is still at the nascent stages, but is an interesting first step, she always had goals but not a path forward for them. On first brush it seems unworkable? Like catching enough pokemon already seems like a constraint, and of course such conditioning doesn't pass down to children, and also its unproven how long it lasts outside of a pokeball. I wouldn't expect draft 0.0.1 to have all the kinks work out though, and I think a focus on the rampaging pokemon over the stormbringers themselves is a perspective we havent yet seen, a different angle of attack.
