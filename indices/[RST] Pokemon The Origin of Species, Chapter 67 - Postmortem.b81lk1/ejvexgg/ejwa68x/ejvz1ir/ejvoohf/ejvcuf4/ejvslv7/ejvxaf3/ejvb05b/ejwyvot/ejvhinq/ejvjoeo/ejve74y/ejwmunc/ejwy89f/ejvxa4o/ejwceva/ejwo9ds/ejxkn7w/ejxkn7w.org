Yeah, I agree. It's kind of what Blue did way earlier before they reached Aiko's ranch, where he was going to lead everyone back up to help with a Tier 1, and they were all like "Meeeh" and he took that as a sign that maybe it's not the best decision. Good leadership/teamwork relies on taking in feedback from others.

But at the end of the day, someone may just have different priorities/knowledge/values. And when the chips are down, someone who will trust/stick together has a different relationship than someone who will always decide for themselves.
