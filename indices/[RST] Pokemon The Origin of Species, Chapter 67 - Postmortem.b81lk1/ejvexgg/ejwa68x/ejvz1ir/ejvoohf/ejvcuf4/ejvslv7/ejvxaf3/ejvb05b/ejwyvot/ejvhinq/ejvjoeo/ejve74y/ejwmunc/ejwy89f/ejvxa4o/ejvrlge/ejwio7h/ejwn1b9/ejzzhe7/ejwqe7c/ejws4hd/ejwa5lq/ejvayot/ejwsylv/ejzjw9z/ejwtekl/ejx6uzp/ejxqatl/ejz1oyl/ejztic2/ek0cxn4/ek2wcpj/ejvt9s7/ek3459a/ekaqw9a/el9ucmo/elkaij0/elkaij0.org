I've binged the whole thing the past few days. And man, what a stopping point! I predicted the this clash between Red and Blue when we learned the stormbringer was coming to town. The story was going there anyhow. And the chapter did it justice.

I hope they don't reconcile soon because that would weaken the conflict between the two. I think Blue will realize that he was way too harsh on Red when he learns the full story but ego on both sides will prevent them from talking it out and resolving this... Blue will have voice in the back of his mind that says "dude, he did risk his life plenty of times, don't you think it's unreasonable to expect him to die alongside her?" But he will stomp that voice down and justify how he acted. Confirmation bias and self-serving bias are in effect. He will probably realize what an ass he has been after another big and impactful event that changes his views drastically.

Also, is there another story I might read after this? Maybe from the same author? I read MOL, HPMOR and WTC, don't like wildblow stories that much due to how dark they are. I remember the author recommending a few other stories in previous chapters but don't remember what they were...
