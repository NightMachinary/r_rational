...wow. I know I this deserves a larger comment, but I don't think I can make it justice. I'll say that I had lost a bit of interest recently. I had too much hype for the storbringer attack, so it acually dissapointed me.

That is, until today. What a development. What a clash of personalities. What amazing portrayal of characters breaking and coping. What sea of possible futures. Thank you.
