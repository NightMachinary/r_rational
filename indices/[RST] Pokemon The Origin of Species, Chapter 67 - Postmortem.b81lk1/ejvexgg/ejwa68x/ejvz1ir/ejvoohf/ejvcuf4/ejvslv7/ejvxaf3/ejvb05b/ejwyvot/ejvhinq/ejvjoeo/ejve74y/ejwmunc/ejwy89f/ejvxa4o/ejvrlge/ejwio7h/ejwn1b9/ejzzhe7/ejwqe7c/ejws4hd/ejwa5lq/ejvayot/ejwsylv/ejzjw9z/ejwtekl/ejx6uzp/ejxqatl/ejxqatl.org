Excellent chapter!

The best part for me was seeing Leaf finally understand Red's perspective on Pok√©mon, their value and their dangers. Great change from the reaction Leaf had on the cruise.

I hated seeing Red and Blue fight, but that was to be expected and was well written.

I'm conflicted on Red becoming Sabrina's student. On one hand Red will get to explore psychic phenomena, but on the other hand it seems like running away from all his problems. Like from dealing with his grief without using a partition, or from his Aiko's death, or from his argument with Blue.

Will we get a new chapter next month or do you need time to plan out Part 2 or something?

Also, please, what happened to Seto and the woman driving Laura? At least Karen is alive, but sadly her Hydreigon died.
