This doesn't really have anything to do with the current chapter, but I've had this thought for a while and the end of the arc seems like a decent place for it.

I hope the subject of lucario comes up at some point. I'm interested to see how you'd handle the "genetically predisposed to justice" thing. Also aura, to a lesser extent, since I'm guessing the answer is functionally the same as the answer to all the other pokemon-based magic. Though if there are human aura users like there are human psychics and darks, that could be interesting.

My current best guess is that lucario are actually partly psychic, with a low-power, long-range, high-specificity mind-reading, and base their actions on the averaged morality of the humans around them.
