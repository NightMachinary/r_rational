Blue's reaction at finding out the choices Red made was to be expected. After all, this was exactly what their conversation right before Red left for the cruise, was about. In this instance, Red was right, of course. He could do nothing in that situation to help Aiko. Blue is mostly being emotional here, but he is right that this was a matter of trust as well. I feel that if they would adjust their views a little, they could reach a common ground.

Instead, Red runs away. This may be an unpopular opinion, but this is how I see him going to learn from Sabrina. I get that this psychic training is important to him and it's a great opportunity and all that, but I don't think that, in the wake of one of friends dying, after the fall out with his best friend, after a traumatic night, this is the best decision. I hoped that they would learn something from this terrible experience, that it would help them grow as people. It seems it worked that way for Leaf, but Red and Blue are stuck to their old ways or worse. And if they don't communicate, I don't see it changing.

And other reason I don't like Red going to learn from Sabrina, is the way his partition works. The way I understand it, his partition helped him deal with his grief for his father by locking part of it away. It may have helped him in the short term, but in the long term, it stunted his personal growth. I think it would have been healthier for him to deal with it like everybody else and I thought his character arc was pointing towards learning to accept that pain as part of himself and stop using his psychic powers to ignore it. Instead, it seems he learned how to manipulate that partition to do exactly that with his other emotions too and I don't doubt Sabrina will push him in that direction too. The part from his perspective at the end shows this the best. There is no emotion coming through. Red seems to be simply going through the motions and everything that happened appears much more distant that it was for Blue or Leaf.

This is my reading of this chapter, and I know it may be completely wrong but I wanted to share it anyway.

Entertaining chapter as always and looking forward to the (probable) time skip. I'm really curious to see where we will pick up in May.
