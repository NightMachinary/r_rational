I dont need to be an architect to know a burning building is unsafe. Especially eithout much extra support.

What could Red have contributed? At best he was a pair of hands.

I remember looking at that before knowing what happened and thinking Red made the right choice. Several times before, people ignored burning or damaged buildings. They focused on staying in the open.

Collapse was a strong risk. And there were no plans set up for id it collapsed. No survival scenario.
