Is there even a way to release caught pokemon in the wild in this world? I remember Aiko telling Leaf that the sakki was a way to remove the pokemon's conditioning permanently as if there wasn't any other way to do that yet. Because if this is true, Leaf will have to find a way to release them too, not just a way to catch them.
