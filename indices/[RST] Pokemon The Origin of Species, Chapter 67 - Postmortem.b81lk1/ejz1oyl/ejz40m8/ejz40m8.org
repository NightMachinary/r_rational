As one of our resident shippers, I had suspected a Blue/Aiko feeling, but I feel like right now we lack evidence for it. Blue's perspective on the Elaine-kiss seems to be that of someone who has put no thought at all into romance, not someone who had feelings elsewhere. I would have to re-read the cave section for full details though, as that is their last major interaction.
