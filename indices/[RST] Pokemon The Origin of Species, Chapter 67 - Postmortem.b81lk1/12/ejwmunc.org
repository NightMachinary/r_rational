Great chap!

Gotta say I understand why Blue thinks as he does but I agree more with Red.

The gym Second, who was in charge of the situation, told them that he knew what he was doing was an unreasonable risk, and that he was willing to take it anyway, but didn't expect them to do so as well. Aiko chose to do it anyway, and they died. I guess the main point is that none of the people who were actually there in the situation thought that Red was making the wrong decision; neither Aiko nor the Second thought he should come.

It's also interesting to see Leaf going through /that/ moment, the point where you intuitively and deeply realize that, for lack of better phrasing, the world is not a fundamentally save place. You and everyone you know really could die at any time, and eventually you will. I had that moment when I was a little younger than her, so seeing her experience it first-person was really meaningful to me. Surprisingly I haven't really seen many works of fiction that go into this, this change that people who have seen the fragility of existence for what it really is and know what they must do because of it. And because of it there's not really a word for it. So I just call that change that comes to those who know having /it/. Red had /it/ for quite a while, and now Leaf does. I know I'm rambling a bit and not explaining myself well, but I think people who have /it/ will know what I mean.

As unfortunate as the circumstances around it are, I am glad to see that Red will be pursuing study with Sabrina. The descriptions and investigations of psychic phenomena are easily the most interesting thing in this story to me; in fact I think it's the best exploration I've seen of the concept in any science fiction and fantasy.
