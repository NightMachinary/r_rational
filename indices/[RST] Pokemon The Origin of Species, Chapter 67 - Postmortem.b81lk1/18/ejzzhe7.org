Holy crap, what a fantastic chapter. Everything is broken, and you can /feel/ the emotion and pain pouring out of these three. I've seen a comment mourning that we don't get much of Red's perspective on the situation, but I actually really like it - he's closing himself off to everything, to a degree that includes us, and not returning to his perspective until the brief final segment showing his decision sells both just how much this has taken out of him /and/ the sheer awful finality of the way he's running away.

I love how everybody's in the wrong here - Leaf is caught between her natural inclination towards the simple moral viewpoint of “just save them” and the sheer degree to which she can understand what's broken in Red after he projected his emotions (and after getting a bit of a “this world is broken and horrible” moment herself), and in her desperation to save her friendship - to not feel even worse than today already does - she's left just ineffectually trying to convince the other two to run away from a conflict that was, in retrospect, inevitable since the first moment we saw Red planning to try and manipulate Blue to keep him relatively safe. Blue is hurt and scared and angry, and a bone-deep difference in worldviews was just brought to light between him and his closest friend in the most painful and violent way it possibly could. Blue rages at the world for being cruel, he rages at the storm gods for killing people, and it all comes out in him running away from the pain by projecting everything into anger at Red for being there and not saving Aiko. And Red is just so emotionally worn out from this whole ordeal, culminating in Leaf's injury and Aiko's death just completely breaking him. Where Blue's trauma is channeled into rage, Red's manifests as a crushing despair, so heavy that everything seems useless. The world is cold and dark and cruel, and no matter how much he tries to ameliorate that, the feelings from his father's death sneak up and whisper in his ear that it'll still always remain true. Faced with the pain, he runs away, trying to lock every vulnerable part of him behind his partition in an attempt to not have to keep /feeling/ that despair. Faced with Blue's accusation, he lashes out in defense because the moment he admits that he's hurting, the moment he lets himself be anything other than the cold, heartless, perfectly rational actor, it's all going to come crashing back down on him. He tries to project the survivor's guilt and self-blame onto anyone else who presents themself, Aiko, the Second, Blue himself - even the one mistake he considers his own is a cold, edged thing blaming himself for letting the others make their decision - and ultimately, rather than face the pain of opening up to his friends in this darkest hour, he leaves the bridge to burn behind him, running away from that as well by going to follow the one path he's certain won't force him to deal with his feelings for them.

It's just this moment of utter despair, and these moments only make the eventual points of hope all the more satisfying. I'm going to be on the edge of my seat for the next update, and the next, and the next; it's going to hurt so much with their relationship left here until they finally manage to resolve it, and I'm going to love every moment of waiting for it.
