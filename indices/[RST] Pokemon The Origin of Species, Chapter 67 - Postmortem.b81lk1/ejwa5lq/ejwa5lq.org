Man, this is definitely going to change things, I'm still quite upset/sad that Aiko is dead, she seemed like she had plot armor, damnit!

But that's what makes me keep coming back, the emotional punches in this story are quite well done, and I can almost see myself as whatever character is currently "speaking".

And man, I can understand both sides of Blue & Red's argument, but I do agree with another poster that Blue seemed a bit too agressive, it seemed a bit one-sided when it comes to who I agree with (Red).

EDIT: After reading the edit you have for the argument scene, I'd say I agree with Blue, but I don't think either were going to end up with a discussion, as they are both tired/hurting a lot mentally, and already argue quite a lot.

My last thought is that even the second said going into the building was a dumb idea, I don't think he should have let a young trainer come in with him on what he was quite sure would turn out as a suicide mission.
