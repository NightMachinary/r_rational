Honestly I think Blue's reaction is pretty realistically unreasonable: just logically sound enough for him to curl into his ideology and defend it with gnashing teeth, especially when driven by such a heavy loss.

I'd also like to point out Red very quickly abandons trying to persuade Blue and instead tries to make him feel as bad as possible, such as Red shifting the responsibility of Aiko's death on Blue's contagious attitude, which isn't very "rational".
