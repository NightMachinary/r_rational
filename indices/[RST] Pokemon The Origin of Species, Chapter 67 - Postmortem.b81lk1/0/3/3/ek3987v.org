I think you're overestimating how willing the majority of people are to risk themselves. Red and Blue and Leaf are /all/ more willing to risk themselves than average, and Blue and Leaf are /way/ more willing to blame others for not risking themselves than most people.

Most people would accept that another person did not risk themselves to save another for no other reason than that they didn't want to (E.g. a bone marrow or kidney donation), no risk calculus necessary.
