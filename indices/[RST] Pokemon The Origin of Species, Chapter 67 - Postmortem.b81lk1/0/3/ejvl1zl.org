AS a rationalist of course you don't see blue's response as a reasonable thing, you see irrationality of that caliber and shy away. Most people aren't rationalist- the desire to save a friend or die trying is a root emotion in a lot of people, its an emotional hammer strong enough to break mountains. To you blues argument was faulty- it is, its not logical, but emotions rarely are. It might be a lacking in us that we see blue as being unreasonable when in the face of the majority they'd agree with him, i believe.
