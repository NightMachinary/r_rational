  I'm asking when risk-avoidance counts as cowardice.
#+end_quote

No, that's not all you said. You equated cowardice with desertion. I quote, "If you do [consider deserters cowards], why is it any different?" And I answered that, drawing a distinction around desertion, which is specifically about disobeying lawful authority. It's a subset of cowardice.

Interestingly enough, people often talk about courage as the ability to overcome fear to get a job done, but dictionary.reference.com doesn't think so; it suggests that courage is about facing something /without/ fear, and it defines cowardice in terms of a lack of courage. By those dictionary definitions, I'd agree with you that "Cowardice is often sensible." Fear has an important role in our lives. On the other hand, if we use the Hollywood definition of courage, then I suppose that cowardice is about the failure to do what needs to be done due to fear, which answers your question about risk avoidance.
