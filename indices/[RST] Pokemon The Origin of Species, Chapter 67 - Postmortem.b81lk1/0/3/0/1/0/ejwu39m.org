I agree with all this in an on-the-ground decision - I think the key thing to remember is that Blue wasnt there, and knows none of these details! Blue will say "then you should have died!!" but he doesnt actually mean that, he thinks, really, that Red could have Been A Hero, he should have taken the risk of dying. Friends choose to die for each other, because by being willing to die you become strong enough to save each other and avoid that fate.

Blue also has faith in Aiko - that she would only have gone if it was possible to win. He didnt know how the pressure affected her and subtly twisted her priorities. Also Blue just saw his Gramps risk his life for him in the same suicidal way and is super-moved, and also never really had his own hero moment while Red did and /botched it/ and he is angry and weirdly jealous. Blue has a lot going on right now!
