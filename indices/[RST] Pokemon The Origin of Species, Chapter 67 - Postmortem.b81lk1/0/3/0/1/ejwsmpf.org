Suicidal odds are fine if there is actually a chance of doing some good. Red, and Aiko, for that matter, had nothing that would allow them to clear the rubble that was trapping the people inside, nor a way to shore up the rubble if the building collapses upon them. It's the same reason that civilians are discouraged from running into burning buildings to rescue people: it's dangerous even with the right training and equipment, without it you're more likely to require rescuing yourself, provided that you survive at all.

Blue kicking Red's ass for his decision is like reprimanding an unarmed ten-year-old student for not even trying to restrain and disarm an adult school shooter.

Red would gladly give his live if it meant a reasonable chance of saving others, and he took that risk many times that night. Blue thinks he should gladly give his life even when the chances of doing good are absurdly slim.
