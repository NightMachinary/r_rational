I think we should be more charitable to Blue - emotionally we are also biased by how much of a complete asshole he is being! But (and I am repeating myself here, my apologies) if you are going to have the goal of "be a super strong combat team that beats gods", then you are certainly going to enter situations that look very close to suicidal. Combat teams need to have each others backs at critical moments, a mutual willingness to die for each other makes the whole team stronger and ironically more likely to survive.

That of course doesn't mean you should follow them into dumb suicide decisions! There is no one rule to follow here, you have to just...be correct. That's hard to accept, you have to just *be right*, and trust each other that they made the right call sometimes even when its hard.
