You are probably right that we won't have a conversation about what happened on the cruise now that Part I is over. Which is a shame because I was looking forward to that. And it would have helped them understand each other better. Which, again, I would have liked to see happen.

On the other hand, I feel like some of those issues were at least addressed this chapter. When Leaf was dealing with her feelings about the consequences of Zapdos' storm, she remembered some of Red's views and seemed to understand his perspective better than before and even agree with him someway. As a result, she empathizes with him a lot more than she used to. I think that's one of the reasons she grew angry at Blue when he refused to absolve Red of the blame for Aiko's decision. She understood what Red was going through, how hard it was for him, how much he blamed himself because she knows him now better than she ever did. So, she tried to help him and have Blue help him too.

So, while the situation is far from perfect, I think it's a improvement, however small, on how it was when they left the cruise. Of course, a heart to heart conversation would been welcome in this situation, but with Blue and everything that happened, I guess it just wasn't possible. We will have to wait and hope for the best.
