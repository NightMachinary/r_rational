I also read the Blue/Oak section as Blue both wanting his grandfather to not risk himself, and also being super-moved by his emotional commitment. Blue has his practical side, but also highly values the love on display there, and if the situation was reversed Blue would want himself to be doing pretty close to what his grandfather is doing - he has two minds on the issue, like most do, and at times one side comes out. Thats how I read your intent in pairing that opening with the conclusion, at least!
