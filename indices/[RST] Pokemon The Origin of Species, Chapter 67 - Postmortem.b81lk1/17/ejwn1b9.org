I think the third of the gym's thought that" It wasn't his friends, surely? If it were Oak and Juniper, wouldn't they have all gone in together? 'Who went in there, Verres?'" is really important to keep in mind. From the smaller interlude of chapter 66. At the same time i'm not sure that i can disagree with Red either in hoping that he could have changed Aiko's mind or in it being the wrong decision to go in.

I'm really interested in seeing what Lt. Surge says to Blue in the near future. Especially considering the his bigger picture experience i mean i know that i was surprised how "cold" the priorities of the Gym were when we first saw Zapdos show up.

The other thing is that well Blue is more or less emotionally compromised by the depths to which his Grandfather is and was willing to go to keep him safe, i mean Blue even has the immediate thought of how to keep his Grandfather safe instead of rushing to keep him safe. It by no means excuses the fact that he did just tell his best friend that he was better off trying and potentially dying than being in his words a "coward." But it should be at least kept in mind that his big role model was just putting his larger philosophy to practice and it makes the degree to which he holds his best friend to the same or a similar standard seem more like his frustration is more of a betrayal than anything else. Like he has a point in a world where you're fighting for your life it's of the upmost importance to know the people beside you aren't gonna just leave. But for the most part the people doing that leading, that he is looking up to, well probably didn't get there without losing people i mean for sure not without losing pokemon i mean we see an elite four lose her whole team upfront right in this chapter.

Ugh how do i rephrase that... Blue is trying to emulate one of the larger than life figures that are prominent in his society, but the people that do that are well the survivors of the much larger group of people that had many of the same aspirations that he has now, and that of the current leaders it's almost unthinkable for them not to have the ability to make the exact same decision that Red made to not commit more to a potential loss. i mean the second himself passed up multiple opportunities to help people because being able to help those few people would have potentially prevented them from being able to more people in the near future or uh triage the situation.

God i'm still not making the point i'm trying to... i might come back in a couple of hours and see if it comes out any better.
