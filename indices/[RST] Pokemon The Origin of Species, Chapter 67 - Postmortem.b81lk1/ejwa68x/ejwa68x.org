Anyway, wow! Holy shit, that was intense! I expected an argument between Blue and Red, but that got really personal really quickly. Red just immediately went for the offense, which is to be expected because I'm sure he already feels guilty. LOVED Leaf this chapter, she's really improving from the person she was just a few chapters ago.

Remember how a year ago we were all expecting Leaf and Red to be drowning or something because of the ominous chapter 55 ending of "I'm sure they're having a fun, peaceful cruise" and how surprised we were when they were /actually/ having a fun, peaceful cruise? I remember being almost a little disappointed that after a month of theorizing about what shitshow could be happening on the boat, it was all just speculation. Turns out I just had to wait about a year for said shitshow. Woohoo!

Also. Really? You name the chapter we met Aiko in "Premortem" and the one where she dies "Postmortem"? Clever, but also cruel! :'(
