The legend itself exists. And there still exists things that science fails to adequately explain yet, both in real life and in this fic. An easy one to point to in this fic is how Pressure is supposed to work, since it affects Dark humans and pokemon too (unlike other Psychic phenomenon). So I wouldn't go as far as "no room for the fantasical", or at least the initially fantastical before someone tries to figure out the mechanics.
