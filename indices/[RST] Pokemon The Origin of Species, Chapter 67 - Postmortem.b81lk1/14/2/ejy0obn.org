I'm pretty sure Red would take the utilitarian approach and answer that if there's no reasonable expectation of actually succeeding, if chasing after him would be futile, then they shouldn't throw their lives away. He didn't stay out because of cowardice; he stayed out because entering would have simply added to the body count. In doing so, he embraced the Vermillion Gym's practical approach more wholeheartedly than Jack, who threw his life away when there were still people all over the city he could have actually helped, or Blue, who spent half the attack holding himself back from seeking glory.

What's curious is that Blue has previously shown himself to be quite capable of hardening up to get the job done. That's how he caught a Shiftry. For him to rant at someone about being too pragmatic and not empathetic enough is unusual.
