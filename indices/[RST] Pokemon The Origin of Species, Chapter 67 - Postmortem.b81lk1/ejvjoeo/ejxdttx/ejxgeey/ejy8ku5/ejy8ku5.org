Well if pokemon keep their programming it should be relatively low risk to capture the newly born pokemon, especially if this universe sticks to the idea that all pokemon lay eggs, since then it would be a relatively simple matter of regular sweeps of potential nesting sites (well simple compared to having to scour the world for young looking pokemon that might not have been caught before).
