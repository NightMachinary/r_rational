I think it's more that Blue made the mistake of forgetting that Red wasn't there for the "own your mistakes" bonding exercise and thus missed the subtext of the question.

Blue wanted to know if Red could have helped them or not, even it if was only apparent in hindsight, but Red took the question at face value and Blue took Red's answer as a combination of deflecting blame from himself, disparaging Aiko's heroic sacrifice, and subverting the point of the exercise Red didn't know they were doing which pissed Blue off.
