Blue can go fuck himself. Admitting mistakes are for when you realize you could've made superior decisions, and gotten better outcomes. Not for when you realize that you could've also leapt into the burning building and died alongside with your friends like a true hero would. He's so angry that only one of his friends died instead of two.

EDIT: I do very strongly think that Blue is mainly talking out of his grief for Aiko. He's looking at the person who is both still alive and who was most closely related to her death, and blaming him for not doing enough. But it is manifesting in terms of his heroic persona, where Aiko did the definitely right thing of trying to save lives, and the cowardly Red made a mistake and didn't go in with her. It doesn't matter that the results would be worse.
