I wonder if the Bard and Tyrant are misreading Black. His major characteristics are: 1. loyal to a fault (per Scribe & Bard) 2. willing to sacrifice anything in the pursuit of victory (per Squire) 3. clarity of sight (per himself)

His enemies seem to think #1 is going to prove his primary motivating force if a Calamity dies, but we've already seen him consider turning on Malicia. It sure doesn't feel like he's told the Dread Empress that Catherine is hearing "The Girl Who Climbed the Tower." Moreover, we saw him even contemplate killing the other Calamities in the last chapter.

Granted we saw Squire's Role force her to have an unnaturally strong reaction to rebels being hanged. Maybe Bard's genre savvy will trump everything regardless.
