I'm starting to think 3 Calamities are taken off the board here (with an appropriately named chapter called Calamity III).

Captain is getting too old for this s*** and feels bad for the hero she has to kill. We also learn that she and Warlock are not fully on-board Black's meta-plans, they're just along for the ride. She gets got death-wise or conscience-wise via champion with maybe a First Prince assist.

Warlock is feeling too invincible and goes via Hedge-Wizard, Hierarch, and maybe Priestess Reborn. Feeling some Arcadia mischief in there too.

Ranger just namesaked the next generation and is offscreen "where no one else is looking". Bard and Tyrant indirectly do her in, though it may just be a crippling as others have mentioned.

I doubt a single Calamity going is enough to send Black over the deep end, but 3 ought to do it.
