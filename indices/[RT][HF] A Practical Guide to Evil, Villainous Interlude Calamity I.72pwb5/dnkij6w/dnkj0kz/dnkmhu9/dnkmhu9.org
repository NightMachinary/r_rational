  So at this point, I'm 90% sure that Ranger is already dead:

  1. The Queen of Summer is part of Cat's story. Ranger can't kill her before her big confrontation with Cat, it would be too anticlimactic. At the same time, Ranger's Name won't allow her to retreat or give up once she's set her eyes on a new target. Therefore, the only possible outcome of their battle is Ranger being killed, or somehow made unable to continue pursuing the Queen. The Queen has no reason to imprison her, and imprison someone like Ranger is an exercise in stupidity anyway, so the only other real option would be for Ranger to sustain a crippling injury.
  2. Ranger has bound herself to the Calamaties, and the Calamaties are clearly on their way out. Someone last week was speculating that the way Ranger has lived for so long is by never allowing herself to become seriously involved in a story. But then she joined the Calamaties, and now she's involved in Cat's story as well. Even someone as insanely overpowered as Ranger can be defeated if the story demands it.
  3. Building on that, Ranger is pretty stupidly overpowered. There has to be SOME limits to her power. If she can kill the Queen of Summer, then what can't she kill? She becomes a walking deus ex machina.
  4. There are some pretty damn suggestive quotes from the last couple of chapters:

  “Let me tell you a secret, my friend,” he whispered. “She's already won. The opposition was watching the wrong fire the whole time, and the intricacy of the trap is exquisite. She made the kill without them ever seeing her.”

  ...

  “Even if my pretty little mages had been untroubled, the Beast would have survived. The Healer should have too, life split in half with her sister. A touching story of sisterly love, if you care for that sort of thing. She didn't because she was a sacrifice. Her weight was stolen, because there was another use for it. With nothing you can only trade for nothing.”

  ...

  “She's going to kill him,” the diplomat said.

  “Of course not, my beauteous blooming flower,” the Tyrant tutted. “Nothing so crass. She's going to hurt him. And when the cold thing turns into a wounded animal, well, that's when he starts making mistakes.”

  And today:

  “That's the thing with invincibility. You have it until you don't.”

  Everyone thinks Sabah is going to die, but they thought that before, too. Black has been doing this for a long time, and he's really good at it. He's not going to miss obvious death flags, he knows how to avoid them. But while he's all busy paying attention to the Tyrant and Sabah, the Bard snuck off and set in motion the events which will lead to the death of the one person he never even thought was in danger.
