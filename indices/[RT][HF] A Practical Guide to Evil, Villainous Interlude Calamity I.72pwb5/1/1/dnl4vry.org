  Black's made a miscalculation in thinking that the Tyrant wants to become the Hierarch. Anaxeres is already the Hierarch so how is that going to trip up Amadeus?

The obvious issue that comes to mind - Black was expecting Tyrant to transition to Hierarch, and as such didn't worry about collateral damage in Nicae. But there's already a Hierarch, and while he's from an Evil city, he represents seven city-states that are both Good and Evil aligned.

Collateral damage in Nicae, a Good city, gives him cause to turn against Tyrant (whom he already hates for sticking him in this position and compromising his values) and Praes, and opens an avenue to reach out to Procer for reinforcements... which may also be casus belli for calling a Crusade. Exactly what Praes and the Calamities wanted to avoid - and which will likely delight Tyrant, who thrives against bigger challenges.
