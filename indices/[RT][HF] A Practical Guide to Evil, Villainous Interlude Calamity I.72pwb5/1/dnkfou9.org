Wekesa seems pretty cocky. Is this the battle where he dies?

Black's made a miscalculation in thinking that the Tyrant wants to become the Hierarch. Anaxeres is already the Hierarch so how is that going to trip up Amadeus?

Black doesn't believe the Ashen Priestess is gone for good. Will she be back?

Stay tuned for the next exciting episode where (hopefully) these questions, and more, will be answered.
