I think the biggest wrench in this hypothesis is that the Ranger doesn't have to kill. After all she has never killed the undead King and even more telling is she didn't kill the prince of winter (whose title I don't remember). All she did was steal his eye. It could be something similar with the Summer Queen where all the Ranger cares about is the thrill of the hunt and not the kill.
