The Dead King and the Prince of Nightfall are significantly weaker than Ranger, at least in terms of personal power, while the Queen is not. I don't think the Queen of Summer will fall so easily, or allow Ranger to retreat.

Plus, as others have mentioned, a lot of clues here are pointing to Hye dying. Tyrant's monologue to Hierarch about Bard killing someone they don't expect to die (which Ranger fits. Captain, Warlock, and the other active Calamities are, well, active. They're more likely to run into some hero who kills them as opposed to the neutral Ranger.), the chapter quote about how fleeting invincibility is (Hierophant reminisced about how Black and Warlock's plan for taking on Ranger was/is 'don't', which is a perceived 'she's nigh-impossible to kill.), and how Ranger's death turns Cat killing Black from suicide to something she can live through.
