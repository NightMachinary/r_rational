I generally agree that Black isn't omniscient, but maybe he knows more, at least in broad stokes, than he lets on? From Cat's internal monologue while talking to the Winter king, we know that Black's fatal flaw is that he will do /anything/ to achieve a path to victory, no matter the cost. I think it's totally in character for him to consign those he most loves, and even himself, to death if it means victory.

I have no idea if this is actually what he's doing, but it doesn't seem completely impossible. I also have to wonder what, exactly, he's doing battling the White Knight if he's already determined that he is Cat's narrative enemy? What's his game? I really don't know.

Also, Ranger is only so insanely strong so long as she doesn't get in the way of the story. The fact that she's a lone agent, randomly fighting people just cause she can, is why she is allowed to be so OP. Black should know this.
