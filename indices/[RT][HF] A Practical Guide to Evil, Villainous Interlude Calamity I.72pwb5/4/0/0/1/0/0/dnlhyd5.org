Black doesn't have that level of omniscience, he currently doesn't even know that Anaraxes is the hierarch.

For him to set up Hye's demise, a woman he claims to love (though admittedly he is the carrion lord) he would have to have foreseen Cat's entry into summer, and the fact that the summer queen would actually engage them. To add to this, he would have to do this from the location of the siege, since its only there that he learned of his imminent death.

Now he isn't actually doing something to prevent it, but from his point of view, there is nothing he can do that would actually increase her odds of survival cause she's the strongest being he knows.
