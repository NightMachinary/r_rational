There's really no bottom to that particular well, but in a nutshell:

0 - The Fool: The novice at the beginning of the journey. Inexperience and naïveté, but unlimited potential.

I - The Magician: Wielder of knowledge. Resourcefulness, willpower, creation. Reasonably strong mythological associations with Hermes.

II - The High Priestess: Keeper of more subtle arts. Intuition, mystery, sacred knowledge. Minor association with the Torah.

III - The Empress: Motherhood. Femininity, fertility, the gentler side of the natural world. Minor associations with Isis.

IX - The Hermit: Inner search for knowledge. Self-reflection, introspection, analysis.

X - Wheel of Fortune: Luck and fate. Destiny, good fortune, the inevitability of change.

XVI - The Tower: Greatness brought low. Upheaval, disaster, hubris. /Strong/ associations with the Tower of Babel.

XX - Judgement: Rebirth. Absolution, healing, aftermath of the reckoning.

Juniper (like most protagonists) is an easy fit for The Fool, but I like Juniper-as-DM for Magician and he wears that hat too. Amaryllis is tricky since her outward persona might be more associated with The Chariot or Strength, but she has that maternal side that comes out every so often when circumstances allow, which works with Empress. I'd probably give Fenn the Death card for a long list of non-obvious associations, but the overt interpretation can't help but be too ham-fisted to overlook. After that it's like a 4-way tie IMO, but Wheel of Fortune is on that list and works for me. Grak, Solace, and Valencia are obvious enough fits that I can't really comment, except maaaaybe to acknowledge that there's an alternative (mediocre) argument to give Solace The Hierophant for its bridging of the mundane and divine. Bethel for The Tower works to an unfortunate degree so far, but we'll see where that goes in the future...
