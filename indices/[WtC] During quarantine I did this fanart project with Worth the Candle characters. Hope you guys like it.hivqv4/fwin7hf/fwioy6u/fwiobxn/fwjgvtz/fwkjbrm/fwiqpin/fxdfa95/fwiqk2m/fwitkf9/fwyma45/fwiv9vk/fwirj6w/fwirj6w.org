Very cool, thank you for doing this =D

One criticism though, if you had looked at historical armor, specifically full plate which is what the story implies they wear, certainly amaryllis, very likely juniper. It would have fit better. I don't think grak's axe is double headed, mostly because double headed axes are kind of silly and were rarely if ever done historically..
