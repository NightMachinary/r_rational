Not my point.. There's an optimal way to cover the human body in metal plates that's based on our anatomy and physics. Historical armor is an easy shortcut to making armor design that makes actual sense, is functional and looks good.

Juniper on this picture for instance can't raise his shoulders, nor can't he bend his back forward. While the armor itself provides very little in way of coverage. Upper arms exposed, most of the legs, neck etc..
