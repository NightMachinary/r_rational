The Lovers' straightforward focus on interpersonal relationships - particularly romance - has some clear play, but I feel like it's ultimately a one-dimensional take on Fenn's role in the story. Ditto with how her role in the party dynamic works with The Sun's symbolism as a source of positivity and vitality.

The more I think about it though, the more I think I'm coming around on The Moon - the themes of trickery and deception fit for the self-appointed party rogue, and the internal themes of suppressed anxiety and insecurity work with her character arc before its conclusion. And the link to Celestar is blunt, but valid.
