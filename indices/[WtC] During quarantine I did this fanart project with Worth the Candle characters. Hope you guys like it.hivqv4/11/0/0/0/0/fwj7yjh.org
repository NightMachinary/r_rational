  Somewhere on Aerb there's probably entad armour in the form of an actual chainmail bikini, that people still wear because entad. The forge frenzy doesn't guarantee a result that's best-practice.

That's fine and i've no problem with it. From the description of Amaryllis armor for instance, it's at least to me clearly full plate. Sure you could design and make it look different overhaul, but if you want it to be functional there are still articulation points you have to account for.

Humans spent actual centuries figuring out and designing optimized armor and weapons on earth, they look cool, are functional, effective, light, breathable, heat resistant etc.
