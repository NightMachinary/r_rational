[[/u/Sailor_Vulcan]] posted a thread recently asking if there were any RWBY rational fics. As far as I know there aren't really, which is a shame because the world has so many interesting tropes to try and systematize.

I felt this couldn't be allowed to continue, so I'm going to take a stab at it.

EDIT: apparently I'm an idiot and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12466638/1/Broken-Blades]] already exists :P
