I'd recommend to watch the first 3 seasons of RWBY. It isn't a bit time investment, as there are ~12 episodes per season, episodes are short, especially in season 1. It's cringey at times, but very lighthearted most of the times, many characters are good, many battles are cool. I'd watch just for the fight in the Emerald Forest in the middle of the 1st season.
