I think that came across really well - especially the way you presented the way she was working through it, that made her feel extremely sympathetic. Also, Jaune just felt like a super kind, reasonable if na√Øve guy with decent interpersonal skills rather than the fladerized klutz he's often portrayed as. That's refreshing.

Also, a defense of the chestplate - for hunters, mobility is everything, and fighting grimm, most of which are giant monsters, you're going to be defending against a lot of strikes coming from the top down. In that case, it's possible that armor is really only valuable when it mitigates aura drain - and something that prevents broken ribs and damage to heart and lungs mechanically without interfering with flexibility the way a full breastplate might could actually be a valid strategy.

That said, that's just an ad hoc rationalization of a character design that is primarily aesthetic, sooo take with a grain of salt.
