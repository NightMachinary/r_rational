Hey... that's pretty good!

Ruby is, so far, simply adorable.

I wonder what happens if Ruby tries to /talk/ while under semblance. What would others hear? And speaking of semblance, I guess you are removing the rose petals effect, given that it wasn't mentioned here (and it being something that Jaune is likely to mention).

My personal favourite, so far, of RWBY fanfics is /Hazredous' Interruptions/, a cross with Nanoha. It's not really a rational fic tho, I would say that it's in the sister genre of "competence porn" fics. But I also just like fics that make the grimdark settings lighter.
