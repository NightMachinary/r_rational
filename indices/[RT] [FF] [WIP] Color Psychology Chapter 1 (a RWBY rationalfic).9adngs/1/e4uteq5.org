Nice start, I'd really like to see how is it going to continue. A few questions:

1. Is it going to be focusing only on Ruby's POV? Are other characters going to be more rational then in canon? How much will they depart from the canon?
2. Is Ruby somewhat autistic? At least that was my impression based on how much conscious effort it took for her to interpret social signs. Plus some stuff she says is a bit cringeworthy, hard to imagine her talking like that to her own sister.
