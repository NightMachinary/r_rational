Thanks!

1.a. Most of it is going to be in close third person from Ruby's point of view, with occasional interludes from the perspective of other characters. I'm still unsure whether these interludes will be in close third person like Ruby's parts, or in far third person. I'm also unsure whether they'd be better as standalone chapters or short addendums at the end of chapters.

1.b. All the characters are getting sizable upgrades to their mental skills, but not all of them are going to be more rational. (I'm not even sure I'd describe Ruby as all that rational at this point in the story.) One of the things I'm hoping to do is have different characters embody specific intellectual virtues, which Ruby will learn from and integrate into her own thinking.

2.a. She's based at least in part on several slightly-aspie engineers I've known over the years. I hope it didn't come off too strong; she's supposed to be a little oblivious to the other people in a conversation, but not necessarily outright unpleasant to talk to.
