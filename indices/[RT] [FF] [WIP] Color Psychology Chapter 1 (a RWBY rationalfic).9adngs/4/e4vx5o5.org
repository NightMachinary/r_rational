Great prose, and really nice synergy between her hyperactivity and the sort of constantly thinking mindset you want a smart character to project and her semblance. I'm not a big fan of the source material, particularly beyond the 3rd season, but if you take the danger of the world more seriously than the authors I think this could be extremely good.
