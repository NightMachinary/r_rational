Man, what the hell is up with the CSS on that page? It bombs out on both IE and Chrome, and the text fades from red to blue in an entirely too distracting way. Blegh.

I do have a more relevant complaint:

  So, Light's fundamental mistake is to kill in ways unrelated to his goal. Killing through heart attacks does not just make him visible early on, but the deaths reveals that his assassination method is supernaturally precise. L has been tipped off that Kira exists. First mistake.
#+end_quote

Unless it's been too long since I watched the anime, Light wanted his activities known, because part of his intent was to curtail future killings - which wouldn't have happened if no one knew that someone was out there killing the killers. And in fact, the anime makes a point to show that crime rates drop because people know about Kira. This wasn't a mistake, it was a calculated part of the plan (albeit spurred on by hubris and perhaps not that wise in regards to actually achieving his goal).
