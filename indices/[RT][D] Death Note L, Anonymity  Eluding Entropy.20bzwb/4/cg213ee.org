I felt the same way about Light. He was hasty and decided to kill Lind L Taylor in an act of spite against what L was forcing him to say. So unlike something you'd think a top student would do. While it's true that Light couldn't predict the unknown unknowns (L), he should've at least not reacted to L challenging him on TV. Then again, hindsight bias.
