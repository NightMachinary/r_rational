  Then again, hindsight bias.

I'm not sure you could call it hindsight bias: that's when knowledge of the outcome influences one's judgment of probability of earlier events. But one of the interesting things there was that I hadn't realized it was such a big mistake until I was writing the essay and was running the numbers - I had expected one of the later mistakes to be bigger, and was fairly surprised that the apparently harmless Lind mistake was such a serious one. Once you put the relevant population numbers in, it was pretty unmistakable.
