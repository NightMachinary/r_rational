Masego still being the Heirophant makes sense when you keep in mind that his major goal was to gain the knowledge equivalent to a God and by doing so gain the ability to manipulate Creation.

I loved how he told the Crows off in such a blunt manner. It does kind of bring up the question of what a Bad aligned priest would be in the Practical-verse. Cause we've seen healing, forcefield planes, the ability to block scyring, and the summoning of an aspect a (G?)od by the wearing of a mask. And the abilitis of the Lanterns of Dominions i think. in less direct fashion we've seen that the prayers etched into plate defends against sorcery and the summoned ethereal war beasts.

And in contrast we've seen the Gods Below acting in response to sacrifice either the Warlock spending his own life to reflect the aforementioned aspect of a God, and the mother of White Knight spilling her own lifesblood to enact a curse. We've also seen Cat using power from the Crows but nothing like the institutions of the House of Light seem to exist for the Gods Below.
