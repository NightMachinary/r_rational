Yep, its what makes him such an interesting character, he ticks a bunch of the evil sorcerer boxes, but his name isn't inherently evil by definition. A /Heirophant/ is usually a religious figure whose main purpose is to understand the Divine, its just that attempting to understand the Gods in the Guideverse is a particularly heretical thing, as they seem to want to keep to themselves.

He isn't /Warlock/ because he doesn't derive his power from external sources, the Hells in his father's case, though I'm pretty sure you could earn that name by sufficiently fucking with Arcadia.
