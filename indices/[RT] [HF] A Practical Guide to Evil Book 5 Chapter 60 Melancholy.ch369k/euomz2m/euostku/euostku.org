Y'know the "pulling the strings of Creation" trope is pretty well worn, and usually when a character ascends to that tier it's mostly a question of them maintaining a grip on their motivation and sense of meaning. For Masego, though, it really is just about the knowing, and being able to help his friends and family is just a side benefit, so being /able/ to make and unmake gods isn't really of any more consequence to him than creating the Observatory for Cat, or just... making his friends feel better by learning to be a better conversationalist.

Kinda undersells the fact that he can fucking make and unmake gods. Jesus. People have gone off the megalomaniacal deep end with faaaaar less power.
