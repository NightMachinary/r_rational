Point of note for people who have depression. I have been keeping a diary of good/bad feelings and or situations, as a means of tracking problems, having better recall to events and something to talk about with my therapist. Granted I haven't vent to therapy in a long while, but once I do i will have a lot to tell.

This was purely by accident though.

I originally started the diary to keep munchkin and rational ideas for real life and a certain fiction. Then one day I just wrote down:

13.09 - Increased desire for talking + replacement for music/introvert thinking.

Lately I have been writing down my mothers bad behavior in low stress situations. Mostly to give evidence to a special therapist we will both go and see.
