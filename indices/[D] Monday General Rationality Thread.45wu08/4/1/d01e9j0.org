From the inside, you see your reasons for acting. From the outside, you see the trends /in/ your actions. Since your actions are a noisy result of your reasons for acting, which may not be consistent, checking that outside view is helpful for observing where your actions deviate from your reasons and where your reasons conflict, fade away, or fail to be tied to realities outside yourself.
