In some regards it was similar for me (like with the anger management you've mentioned).

What I currently seem to be stuck on, however, are "disabling" \ ignoring the felling of anxiety and being able to choose long-term rewards instead of short-term ones.

The first is the simpler one, because I think learning to perceive the feeling of anxiety as just another type of "pain" (i.e. as a physiological reaction instead of a psychological one, roughly speaking) will gradually allow me to ignore it and learn to choose my decisions without fearing the fear.

The second, however, is where I don't know what to do. It's like when you haven't slept for several days, and your thoughts almost constantly revert back to the idea of going to bed and just falling asleep. Everything else seems unimportant by that point, doesn't bring /joy/, doesn't motivate your brain to be invested and stay focused on the task at hand.

So using this analogy in regards to pursuing long-term interests instead of shorter ones, it's like trying to switch from unenlightened to enlightened hedonism. As an example: factually you'd /understand/ that overusing drugs right now will fuck up your organism (eventually killing you) and make you incapable of getting pleasure out of anything else in the future. But in practice, you just can't make yourself care about this fact because your brain got used to short term gratification and will not choose delaying it for higher benefits later.

I'm not sure whether I'm expressing myself clearly enough or just rumbling. Basically it's like for a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_marshmallow_experiment][kid that usually eats their one marshmallow right away]] to be aware that waiting would be beneficial for them, to try to switch to waiting and delaying the gratification, but to continuously fail because their brain is not interested and motivated in switching.
