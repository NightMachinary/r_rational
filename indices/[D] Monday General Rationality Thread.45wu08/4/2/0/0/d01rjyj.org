The problems vary, but a quick skim through old journal entries reveals:

- Anti-akrasia: I used it to get lots of boring shit done that I would otherwise have procrastinated on.
- Productivity improvement: I spent several days writing down descriptions of my experiences each day, and picked the mental states and behaviors that correlated with high productivity. Spent some time thinking about those, and my productivity skyrocketed within a week.
- Skill building: I was playing a multiplayer shooter, which I've never done before. Since I sucked pretty badly, I just focused my thinking on how I was playing, and came up with a few tricks. After a couple of sessions of consciously practicing those, I found I didn't need to anymore -- they sorta faded into the background. Tricks that I didn't write down and pontificate about at length didn't seem to get absorbed the same way.

Generally it takes only a couple of days before it kicks in, though that probably has to do more with the size of the change than anything else.
