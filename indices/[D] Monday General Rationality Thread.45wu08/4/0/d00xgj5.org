For me there's usually an /incident/ where I realize the way I'm conducting myself is rotten. Changing isn't much of a conscious effort, after that. The way I was becomes ugly, to me, and I no longer wish to be it.

So for me the more difficult processes are the ones where it's difficult to consider the problem ugly. I make no effort to network, because nothing about going out of my way to make connections seems virtuous. Most networking seems like a waste of time, and most of the social practices the west promotes seem childish, pathetic, sick, rife with crutches and bad habits. It's plain, though, that the insight into the way others think, insight into the demographics of the market and the audience, and earning the trust of people I could use(the nice kind of using though!) (you can probably guess I could be better at this) would all be very valuable to me. At the same time, I don't think I've ever met anyone who'd hear about how rarely I go out and how few connections I maintain and respond "what an unappealing character trait, obviously you suck and I don't want to be around you". That just doesn't happen. People like the hermit. They find them interesting, and unthreatening, their sense of virtue might even praise them, and so my sense for virtue ethics cannot help me out of this hole.
