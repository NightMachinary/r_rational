I think Link's awakening was my first proper encounter with a game telling me I was a hero... and then getting me to actually commit genocide and letting me realize it.

by all accounts link is a monster and the villains are heroes in that game.

The ending of that game had me in tears.

It also had some other good features... like if you stole form a shop keeper you would be renamed thief in the game save file and the shop keeper would murder you next time you show up.
