I guess subsume might not be exactly the right concept.

If I were a facade of an AGI, I don't if "Is it in my interest for the AGI to drop the facade" is even a coherent question.

In this specific instance, I am assuming that, depth of the NPCs identities is insufficient for them to be considered more than facades through which the wind fish can interact with his subconscious and Link.
