  If I were a facade of an AGI, I don't if(think?) "Is it in my interest for the AGI to drop the facade" is even a coherent question.

Why not? I suppose that any strong intelligence would have protections against child processes harming their hosts, you and I, for instance, may find such things difficult to conceive of because early social apes who found recursive processes hostile to their hosts easy to conceive of were all castrated by them, as they imagined too vividly what their rivals might want to do if they realized they could have been a mental process being emulated by their own rivals in turn. It doesn't seem like there'd be any advantages, anyway.

But if you look at cruder information processing systems like modern computers, child computations subverting their hosts is a common occurrence. My thought is, it looks quite a bit like the wind fish's dreaming capacity is probably just that crude. It clearly is already running malicious processes, for one thing. For another, the wind fish doesn't really look like something that would have been born entirely of evolution, that would necessarily have protections, it looks like a one-off. The fact that it's wearing clothes strongly suggests that its people have technology (which, in hyrule, includes magic), it may have been born of some kind of spell, and its capacity to dream does seem to transcend its individual intelligence, as if it were just bolted on after the fact, it's plausible that it wouldn't have the ability to instate any of the required limits on resource consumption or secure a sandboxing perimiter around its agent-models.

I am kind of disappointed to find this quote, though: Owl: "But one day, the Nightmares entered the dream and began wreaking havoc" Entered. Like they didn't emerge there. It's possible the owl is wrong, but, unexplained incursion of mysterious dark forces would fit the pattern of the series =__=
