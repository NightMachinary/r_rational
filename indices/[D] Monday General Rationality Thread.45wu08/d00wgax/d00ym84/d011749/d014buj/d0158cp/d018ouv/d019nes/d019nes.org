I like that line of thought, but I think you might be overlooking something. The values of the dreamer do not need to align with those of the projections at all. If an AGI subsumes your memories and uses them how it pleases to pursue goals orthogonal or antagonistic to yours, that is not survival, it's arguably even worse than total erasure.
