I just realized The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening is prime fodder for a ratfic. Canon is Link goes to this island, finds out it's the dream of a giant fish (organic simulation), then naturally decides he has to wake up the fish, in so doing killing the many sapient inhabitants of its dream.

He doesn't think twice before doing this, because he is Link.

But I wonder how it would have gone if he had.
