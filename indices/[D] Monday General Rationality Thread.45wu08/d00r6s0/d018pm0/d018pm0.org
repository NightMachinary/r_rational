I've had similar experiences, but they've been rather hit-or-miss, in some sense. A few months ago I finally figured out how to activate this at will. Disclaimer: This might not generalize to all people, I've just found it works very well for me.

My trick is to write down the observations (e.g., in a journal) that made me realize I wanted to change something, and then to just sorta go off on various tangents exploring the idea. Half the time I have some pretty awesome insights into the situation, because I'm literally sitting down and thinking about the problem, as opposed to instantly trying to toss out a solution as people are wont to do. Note that there's no real pressure to actually /do/ anything -- it's just a nice mental excursion.

Within one or two sessions of this, the change process activates and becomes mostly automatic. I think it has to do with the act of writing and thinking deeply somehow focusing unconscious parts of your mind into action. Otherwise you wind up having System 1 and System 2 at odds, and your entire effort fails.

Interesting observation: It doesn't work if I type things, only if I write them. Not sure why this is the case. Maybe because I tend to slow down and focus on shaping the letters or something, inducing a mildly suggestive state.

There's a lot of self-improvement stuff that we can steal from various mystic and meditative traditions. The annoying thing is having to wade through all the metaphysical cruft to get to the actual meat of the ritual.
