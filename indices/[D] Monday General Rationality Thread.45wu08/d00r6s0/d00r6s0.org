So, recently I've been thinking about something. For me at least, a great deal of rationality's benefits have come from chains of self modifications only made possible by some realizations about myself. My own rationality, developed on my own starting when I was at about the age of 15, helped me see myself more clearly, and that included my various flaws. But that wasn't the most important bit, the noticing of the flaws. The important bit was getting rid of them, the long slow work I did on those flaws, from my temper, to my tendency to be uncharitable to people I disagreed with, to a hundred other things. Many of those flaws weren't something I could remedy simply by realizing they were flaws, I actually had to work at it, it wasn't just something I could snap out of. However, over time I have dealt with these things. I now no longer have an unusually bad temper, and can keep calm much better than almost everyone I interact with. I don't feel shy in social situations. I am no longer habitually uncharitable to the groups I have realized I was being habitually uncharitable to.

I'm not sure how typical this is, the ability to simply excise bits of my personality I don't like, and slowly shape who I am, to the extant that I am capable of. I have some evidence to suggest most people aren't quite as capable of changing themselves as I am, as I frequently see rationalists mention that they have a specific irrational emotional reaction to certain circumstances, or are less charitable than they should be of a particular group, and just lament that fact, instead of ending with "... and I expect to have this problem solved withing a year, at the outside." The me of five years ago is scarcely recognizable to the me of today, and as far as I can tell, I'm speeding up, not slowing down. But everybody else seems to be standing still. All the people I know are all the same as they were half a decade ago, and probably will be half a decade from now. It's not just that I'm learning new things, it's that who I am is changing, and it doesn't really seem like anyone else is.

I honestly don't know how much of this is unique to me within the rationalist community, but I suspect the answer is that it's actually rather typical, but most people don't really talk about it too much.

EDIT: Also, that type of slow effort to change who you are has been the keystone to much of my progress towards becoming the person that I am, but I don't see many characters in rationalist fiction deliberately undergoing such changes. It's all accidental, or just picked up. Nobody ever goes "Oh, I seem to have a problem where I react with strong anger to anyone who intellectually defeats me, I should deal with that." Anybody have any idea why?
