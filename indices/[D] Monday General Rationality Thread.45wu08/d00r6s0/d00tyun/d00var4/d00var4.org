Often they are custom to the situation. For example, I noticed that I had a disgust reaction when thinking of dating mtf transgender people even if they were utterly indistinguishable from someone born with a female body, and that I had some strange apparently out of nowhere negative reactions when thinking about transgender people in general. So I read some stories written by transgender people about their experiences to force myself to empathize with them more. I also tracked down some strange ideas in my head completely unconnected to reality that I didn't really verbally believe but had somehow inherited from my father and got rid of them. So introspection is definitely a part of it.

Most of the time, solving each individual problem that I find is unique, but taking the time to figure out how to solve it takes at most a week, whereas the actual solving takes longer, so it isn't really a drain on my time compared to the actual solving of the problem.
