There's a lot of good advice there, and some it is applicable to non-evil non-overlords:

#+begin_quote

  - When I employ people as advisors, I will occasionally listen to their advice.

  - I will not grow a goatee. In the old days they made you look diabolic. Now they just make you look like a disaffected member of Generation X.

  - My five-year-old child advisor will also be asked to decipher any code I am thinking of using. If he breaks the code in under 30 seconds, it will not be used. Note: this also applies to passwords.

  - I will see a competent psychiatrist and get cured of all extremely unusual phobias and bizarre compulsive habits which could prove to be a disadvantage.

  - If my advisors ask "Why are you risking everything on such a mad scheme?", I will not proceed until I have a response that satisfies them.

  - My main computers will have their own special operating system that will be completely incompatible with standard IBM and Macintosh powerbooks.

  - If a group fails miserably at a task, I will not berate them for incompetence then send the same group out to try the task again.

  - I will not turn into a snake. It never helps.
