You know how the Evil Overlord list says that you should run all Ingenious Plans past a five-year-old advisor first? The older I get, the more I realize /everything/ should be done like that. It stops bullshit ideologies, sublimated feelings of impotence and resentment, and passive acceptance of the status quo getting in the way.
