The ending had me in tears /today/. Though I don't remember it meaning much to me when I finished it when I was like 11. I guess the fact that my friend beat my copy before me might have depersonalized the experience a bit. Or maybe I just hadn't made enough sense of the world for anything to mean much to me.

The wind fish sure was happy for the dream to end. Maybe it was the monster. The utility monster, who's needs outweighed the needs of its projections. I imagine that's possible, for some variations of utilitarianism.
