Well, Link is also a foreign body (albeit a rather exceptional one), so it's clear that being in the right situation and possessed of the right power can enter the wind fish's dream.

Anyway, you have a good point. It is rather untenable that the NPCs are fully intelligent and aligned with the wind fish. Is the opposite possibility valid, though.

Perhaps the models are simple enough to not be of significant moral weight?
