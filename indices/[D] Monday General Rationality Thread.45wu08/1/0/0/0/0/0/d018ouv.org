My traditional internalization of 'the dream ends' scenarios is in the style of Nyarlathotep, in that, all the identities that are wiped out when the dreamer wakes up are, by that nature, the identity of the dreamer filtered through a particular mask. When the dreamer awakens, their memories and identities aren't lost, just subsumed into the waking ones.
