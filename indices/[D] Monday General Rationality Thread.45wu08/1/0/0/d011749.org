Hmm I could definitely see myself doing this, if I can allow myself to postpone the star wars rationalization project I was working on.˅

One of the big challenges I can see is coming up with a thoughtful link, when sociopathic Links seem to be an immutable rule of the Legendary Hero reincarnation process. Sure, their mission may be good and they're very bishi, but every one of them kills and steals like it's nothing.

˅: basically, an attempt to account for the star wars universe's defining characteristics (droids, no internet, not much science, no AI, no immortality, mixing of alien species with similar levels of development and augmentation, /all of which is totally bizarre from a futurist standpoint/), rather than the ridiculous stuff like Jedis, The Force (although there will be features comparable to that), The Evil Empire, which isn't all that interesting IMO. Though, TBH, if a reader finds those aspects of canon interesting it is probably easier than you'd think to convey that interest to me. Before proceeding to do so, please consider the weight of the problem constraints I have already taken on, any more just might break my back :p
