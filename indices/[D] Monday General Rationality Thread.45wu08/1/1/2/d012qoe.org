  he's mute

Not really. [[https://youtu.be/xmfUW9m9fuU?t=2m18s][We can tell he speaks here]] (he calls marin "zelda"), even if it isn't depicted directly.

  how is he to rant about his solutions
#+end_quote

True enough, he doesn't seem the kind of exhibitionist to go off on long monologues explaining how clever he is. But it'd be kind of interesting, and probably truer to the medium to depict his mental process directly instead, I don't think that's a problem.

  and Zelda is the "wisdom" triforce piece
#+end_quote

I think there's a difference between wisdom and wit, or general intelligence. Aside from that, problem solving skills shouldn't be seen as a special magical endowment that can't be learned.
