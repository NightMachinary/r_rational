Yeah though those are like the type of cliffhangers I can enjoy. When there's information overload and they give you all the pieces you may end up solving the mystery beforehand and it doesn't give you time to enjoy the complexity of the show.

I like that they give you a week as buffer which you can use to interpret the given data and come up with hypotheses of your own to test the next week. It helps to immerse in the story.
