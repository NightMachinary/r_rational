I'll admit the weakest part of the story to me was [[#s][Erased Spoilers up to ep 6]].

Outside of that I've enjoyed the story and I'm hoping its something along the lines of [[#s][Crazy hypotheses]].

Who do you think its the killer? Most of my friends think its [[#s][]] as most clues point towards him but I'm hoping its a red herring.
