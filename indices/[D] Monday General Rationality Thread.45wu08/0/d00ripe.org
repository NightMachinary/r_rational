If anyone has watched [[http://myanimelist.net/anime/31043/Boku_dake_ga_Inai_Machi][Boku Dake Ga Inai Machi / Erased]] anime, highly recommended. Its about a guy that's blessed/cursed with the ability to go back in time and is forced to stop bad events from happening.

He is chased by a serial killer from an unsolved crime of his past and he must travel back and figure a way to stop him. I enjoyed the protagonist as he takes a head on approach to solve the problem without falling into needless angst, the characters feel somewhat human (besides some small cases which may or may not have a reason to be) and I enjoy how the author has the protagonist gather clues and piece things together in a logical progression.

Also got some really nice music and the cinema approach to several scenes.
