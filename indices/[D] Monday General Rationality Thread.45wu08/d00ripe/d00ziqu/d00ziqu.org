it was nice, and I even mentioned it here a while ago, but the story turned on worst side. Not that it was too surprising, seeing as it was obvious where it was going. But it was still unfortunate that it ended up aiming so low. [[#s][recent episodes]]

And that is really unfortunate, because the parts where the story was actually trying it managed to convey emotions and immerse very will. But instead of going for those strong points its just going on with cheap writing tricks to produce forced tension. Which makes all the clues scattered in the series uninteresting because it is obvious the entire point is to go for twists, so the author has no reason to make it "solvable".
