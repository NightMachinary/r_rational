Sounds good. Journals are amazing way to unwind and store data that may be hogging the brain. I keep a "research journal" where I write everything I'm working on and that ended being used as a diary about thoughts and rants.

I've been thinking about making an electronic journal but find it more satisfactory to use pen and paper.
