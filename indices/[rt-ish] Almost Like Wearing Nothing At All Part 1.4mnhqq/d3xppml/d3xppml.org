The only reason we've been given to like the main character is that everyone around her is a jerk. It would be nice if she had merits of her own demonstrated other than being immune to genre conventions.

It's hard to believe the premise while simultaneously seeing the protagonist as someone with meaningful agency. I think she would have sooner gone into battle wearing leather than near nothing. If she is powerless to change the minds of the bigots around her, that is still a form of powerlessness. Why not get more violent with the blacksmith, if he is putting her life in jeopardy with that armor? Or why not pull an Alanna the Lioness, in order to trick someone into giving her armor? It feels pretty forced. She's too passive off the battlefield and too active on it. I feel like you've given her superpowers in the form of the ability to defy genre conventions, and she uses them to be a dick to random soldiers rather than anything meaningful. If there is some in universe reason in her character or past you chose to give her this pattern of behavior, you should share it near the beginning so the reader can sympathize with the heroine properly. Is she hero, antihero, conflicted, or what? Should I judge her by the traditional standards of older misogynist fantasy, or with the better newer standards? It feels like you haven't decided on that point yet, because judging by enlightened modern attitudes while I agree with her independence I am inclined to judge her negatively for cheating against such hapless mooks. It's as if she were murdering tiny soldier puppies while bragging about her street smarts. At least give me a reason to hate her enemies first. Even in rationalist fiction, the protagonist should not be the savviest person in every room. Challenges should match capabilities. But she only goes for the sure thing victories, judging by her actions so far, and this will make for boring reading.

Sorry if these sentences don't flow together well, am writing on mobile.
