So, this story is RT-ish. I will happily remove it if people don't like it, but I thought that one piece of it qualifies it for inclusion.

The world has rules, but is fairly arbitrary. The rules are solid, the reason for the rules is that those are the rules that work for this story.

Most people accept the rules, without thinking about them.

Them main character does not accept all of the rules. There is one specific rule that she has taken issue with, and now she's trying to work around it. That is the central premise of the story.

The rules are old school fantasy tropes. That's it. Everyone in the story is living in an 80's fantasy world. Women wear minimal armour, chain mail bikinis and the like. Flash sword work is common. Warriors are big and buff. Berserkers exist. Much of this world makes no sense, none at all.

Tanya Fireborn, our heroine, just wants a suit of armour that covers the majority of her body - this is the tale of her quest to make that happen. It is going to be a 4 part serial it looks like. The plan is 10K words and I'm on schedule to hit that.
