This is actually the first I've heard of the gender imbalance. Imagine my surprise when I looked at Bulbapedia, which has a page category just for [[https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Category:Pok%C3%A9mon_with_a_gender_ratio_of_seven_males_to_one_female][Pok√©mon with a 7:1 male to female ratio]]. Why is this? Is it one of the weird Gen 1 bugs that just became a fixture??

Edit: the rabbit hole of pokemon gender goes much deeper than i thought.
