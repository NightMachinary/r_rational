It's because eggs are always the same species as the mother, so having a pokemon be mostly male makes it harder to breed more. You can get a ditto of course, but dittos don't let you pass down egg moves and egg moves are a major way of getting pokemon to have good movepools in the games. (Less so in the games with lots of tutors, but there's always some good moves you can't get any other way)
