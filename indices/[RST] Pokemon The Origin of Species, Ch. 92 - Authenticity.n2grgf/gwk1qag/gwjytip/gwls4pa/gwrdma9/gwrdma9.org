I vaguely remember at least one Lass in pokemon leaf green who had like to Ivysaurs but I'm not about to go through every route's trainer encounters to check.

It's also kind of debatable whether say all of the trade exclusive pokemon from the first generation or the two gifts not including the fossils are actually native to the region considering that they aren't actually able to be encountered in the wild. That list is Far'fetched, Jynx, and Mr. Mime for in-game trade exclusives. Then the gifted pokemon which are the three starters, Hitmonlee, Hitmonchan, Eevee, and Lapras kind of counts there's only encounters for it in the Sevii islands.

That's only if you're not counting like the safari zones or the fact that most of the previous pokemon are made much more available in the Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee remakes.

The overall rarity of the starters is kind of explained by their unbalanced gender ratios, which with such an unbalanced male to female ratio with only in-game procreation would mean that the 1 female would have to not only survive and be able to reproduce, but that they'd have to do so a bunch more than a comparable species that had a fifty/fifty split or the in game 50.2/49.8 would have to. They would however probably be good for overall gene survival if there's anywhere near the in game intergenetic compatibility, but even with a fraction of it having males that pass their genes down more often than say the normal coin flip gender ratio might lead to certain populations kind of breeding themselves out of existence and into a broader expanded recessive type existence.
