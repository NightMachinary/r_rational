This was a fun chapter. I'm glad we get to deal with the Glen situation a bit since it was apparent that he'd eventually fall behind Blue, and Blue has to figure out how to tackle that situation when it occurs. Both Red and Duncan emphasizing that Blue has to learn how to lose in the public eye sometimes is an important lesson and necessary if he wants to be the best Champion.

Fun cameos from Kiyo and Koichi, both named trainers from the actual [[https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Fighting_Dojo][Dojo in the games]]. I usually head over to the Bulbapedia page whenever new character names are given to see if anybody of that name is from there and there are usually these great surprises there too.

One interesting thing for me is that you've chosen for Blue to do Fuchsia first and then Saffron rather than the other way around. Most people tend to do Saffron first since we already need to be in that city anyways.

Also Hitmonchan/lee incoming next chapter I guess, but looking at Blue's teams from HGSS it might be a Machoke as well. Either way, it's great seeing them slowly building up their in-game teams.
