All stories teach their readers what to expect from them over the course of reading them. That so many of her readers disliked the final chapter so much tells me that it probably came out of left field with no foreshadowing whatsoever, that it broke from established style and thematic patterns in the story she was writing. i haven't read the original animorphs, but that's my impression from reading the letter from its author.

It sounds kinda like what J.K. Rowling did with the Harry Potter series in reverse. Where Applegate seems to have taken her readers by surprise by pulling an unhappy ending out of thin air without sufficient in-story buildup to it, J.K. Rowling took her readers by surprise with a neat wrapped up happy ending out of thin air without sufficient in-story buildup to it.

I haven't read the original animorphs, but the fact that its author even felt the need to write this letter feels a bit damning. Unless its ideas and themes are culturally taboo, a story should be able to stand on its own without the help of clarifying author's notes to explain what the author really meant. A novel is a form of expression meaning communication. If your story's main ideas and themes require an author's note for the reader to understand, that means you failed to tell the story that you were trying to tell, that what the readers saw was very different from what you thought they were seeing. Meaning you failed at communication.
