I can't recall the series, particularly the later books, clearly enough to be sure, but this is my impression, yeah. She wrote a YA series in a time when that meant something closer to "Hardy Boys" than "Hunger Games."

It wasn't all super light hearted fluff, of course, it dealt with death and enslavement and so on, but readers got used to the characters having plot armor and the villains being beaten by a band of plucky teenagers over the course of dozens of books, such that having them suddenly face real consequences was a very abrupt change of tone.
