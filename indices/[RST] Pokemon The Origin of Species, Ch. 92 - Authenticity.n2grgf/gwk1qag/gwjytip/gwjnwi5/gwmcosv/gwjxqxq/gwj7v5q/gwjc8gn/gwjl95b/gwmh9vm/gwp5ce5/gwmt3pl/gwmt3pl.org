/shrugs/ In my experience r!animorphs does everything the original wanted to do but better, but that's not to say the original was bad. It was just clearly a YA series in a number of ways, and also clearly not written with the intention of comprehensive and consistent worldbuilding in mind, and also not written by someone trying to teach actual improved thinking or problem solving, and so on. All the things that make rational fiction good, rational/ist/ fiction good, r!animorphs accomplishes.
