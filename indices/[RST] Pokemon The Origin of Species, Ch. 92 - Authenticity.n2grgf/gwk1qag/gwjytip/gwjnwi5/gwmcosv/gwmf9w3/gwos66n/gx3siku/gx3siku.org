In that case I'll be very interested to see how he ends up with a Snorlax and a Lapras, particularly Lapras.\\
Lapras is both very rare and fairly redundant with a Blastoise, meaning he's unlikely to actually want one.\\
Snorlax is pretty rare, but it's certainly something anyone would want for the power and bulk.
