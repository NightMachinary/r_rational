Fair point. Kids assigning blame to others instead of oneself for things that are your own fault happens all the time, most famously in League of Legends matches. However, the appropriate HPMOR lesson here is [[http://www.hpmor.com/chapter/75][Heroic responsibility]], that when you do lose, everything is your fault.

Quirrell-style getting beaten up in public seems like a cure for very specific HJPEV quirks only (cannot fathom losing, keeps escalating, "intent to kill").

There's another failure of accepting the loss, which is learning to accept when you are wrong; but again the cure for this is the Litany of Tarski and not getting beaten up in public.
