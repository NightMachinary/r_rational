Needing to learn to lose isn't unique to special children. Children that lose in public don't always take away the right lesson.

It's sadly common to find adults that shift the blame onto anyone but themselves when they fail. It's an instinctive and rational defense that protects the ego.

I mean sure, Blue is a talented kid that wouldn't lose out to his peers often and therefore hasn't had the chance. But regular people can be prideful and mentally defensive too.
