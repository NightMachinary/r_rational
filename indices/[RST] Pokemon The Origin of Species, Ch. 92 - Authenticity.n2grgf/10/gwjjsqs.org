Well, that's an explicit MoR shout-out at the end if there ever was one. I assume Duncan is the cameo character, and not Koichi? It's not actually clear.

You're right about one thing, and that's that I need to get onto reading animorphs the reconing. I read as much of it as was available some time ago, but fell behind on updates after a while. As an animorphs fan I feel I owe it to myself to catch up again, especially if it's ending soon.
