Hey everyone! For those who somehow still haven't read it, the cameo in this chapter is based on the author of the Animorphs rational fiction, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5627803/chapters/12963046][Animorphs: The Reckoning]]. It's absolutely amazing in more ways than I can succinctly describe; if you like this story, you will almost certainly like that one, unless you're literally just here because it's pokemon. Even if you're not an Animorphs fan, it's definitely worth checking out, and best of all, it's in the final stretch to the ending :)
