I just got caught up on Animorphs. Seriously one of the best things I've read online. We are just about up to the climax.

I'll need to find something else to replace it...and maybe The Origin of Species is it. Yes, I'm in this comments thread despite not reading a single word of this fanfic so far. But I saw a mentioning of the reckoning so I had to drop in :P
