I see you sneakily coming up with reasons for Red and Blue to justify ending up with their canon teams. Now Pikachu is Red's emotional support animal, he has an eevee (->Espeon) from Aiko, he's getting copies of his friends' starters so he has an extra tie to them, soon you'll come up with a reason for him to be emotionally attached to a snorlax, and [[https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Red_(game)#Pok.C3.A9mon_Gold.2C_Silver.2C_and_Crystal][oh look there's an entry on this in Bulbapedia]]. In conclusion, I find this very amusing.

As for the current chapter, I feel like the new character sees through Blue a little too much, too fast, to be believable. Though the surrounding culture of the gym is believable, I've seen this exact same mentality at parkour gyms before.
