you do realize that Blue is famous in this story's universe right? Duncan probably has pretty decent social/emotional sensitivity, and he just had to look at Blue's public posturing and think something like "he feels larger than life on the screen, and real people aren't larger than life. what would I be thinking or feeling if I were in his shoes, having his particular life experiences and background, without being larger than life?"

Duncan also could have talked to other people who saw through him. there are probably a lot of psychics who are familiar enough with how human beings think and feel in general that they can read his face and body language even though they can't read his mind.
