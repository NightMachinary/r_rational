So Blue gets a perfunctory meeting with the Gym Leader, then turns around and goes to an underground +Gym+ dojo with ties to the ousted former Leader...and he's not worrying about the optics?

I see no way this could possibly backfire.

Also, loving the reasoning for Red to pickup all 3 starters despite the impracticality of it in the game. I always thought it was odd that such strong and distinctive critters were basically limited to you and your rival. It speaks to the quality of this fic that I can think of several reasons you wouldn't see them in Gyms in this universe, though!
