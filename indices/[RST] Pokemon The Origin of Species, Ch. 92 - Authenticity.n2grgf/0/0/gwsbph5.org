What's up with this in rationalist fiction? Is this a thing that people normally need to learn?

Normal children usually "lose" in public a large amount of times before they become old enough to make larger decisions. Is it because of speculation that special children like HJPEV or Blue Oak don't, and therefore need to be explicitly taught to lose?
