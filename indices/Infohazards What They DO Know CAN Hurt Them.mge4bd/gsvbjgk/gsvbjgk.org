Left out memetic hazards, which is information that IN ITSELF is dangerous to have in your mind. Temptation being the earliest form of this: if you know where the cookies are, you are in danger of eating one.

But more insidious would be something like a false belief which can lead to a bad action: You think she's cheating, you burst into her therapy session and ruin everything.

There are stories in which simply knowing the name of something calls its attention to you, and saying the name can summon it. There's an apocryphal story about the northern European name for bears being lost because in the very early mythology if you said the name you'd call them. So they were called 'brown ones' which became 'bruin' and then 'bear'. But the name still persists in 'Arctic' (the word was arktos)

Then there are the physical meme hazards like SCP where you see the picture and you die. Snow Crash did it first with the Asherah Virus. See a QR code and if you're nerdy enough to be able to process it even subconsciously, you're infected.

One of the key factors in an infohazard is who is in danger from who knowing it. Are you in danger because you know it? Are you in danger because they know it? Are you in danger because they know you know it?

And you know they know you know they know you know it.
