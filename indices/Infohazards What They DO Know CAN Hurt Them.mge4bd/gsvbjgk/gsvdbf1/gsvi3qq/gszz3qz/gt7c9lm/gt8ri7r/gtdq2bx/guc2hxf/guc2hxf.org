I did have an interesting idea that consciousness is ubiquitous and all possible subdivisions of reality are conscious but only a lucky infinith contain a pattern that mirrors the state of the whole, granting a degree of "self" awareness. We can't find the "ghost" because we don't have any absence to compare our observations to. So we will continue to aware of mostly random noise forever after we die, like we did before we were born and a virtually infinite number of people have always done and will always do.
