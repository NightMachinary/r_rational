There's an SCP about that. Can't remember the number, but it's about a foundation leader who dies and then years later is revived by a freak accident. He comes back obsessed with not dying again, because eternity after death is just pain and boredom as you keep experiencing the decay of your body and the fate of the atoms that made it up.
