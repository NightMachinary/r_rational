I was reading Scott Bakker's views on consciousness as a magic trick/sleight of hand that only exists because we don't understand it. And I was speculating about what if that was literally true: understanding the nature of consciousness causes the magic trick to disappear and person becomes a p-zombie as soon as he groks consciousness. lol.
