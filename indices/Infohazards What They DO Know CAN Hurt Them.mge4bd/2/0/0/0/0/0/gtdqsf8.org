This is part of the reason I decided not to pursue cryo-preservation which is portrayed by its proponents as a binary thing: you either hit the immortality jackpot or you don't. But there is a wide continuum of mental states between conscious vs. dead that seems plausible given how much of the fine structure gets preserved during freezing. Given that current cryo-tech is barely above quackery, ending up in a nightmarish vegetative state has a non-zero probability.
