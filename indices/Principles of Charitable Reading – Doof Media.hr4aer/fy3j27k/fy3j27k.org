Ironically, people here are not being particularly charitable to Matt. I think the point being made is quite legible - if you're going to criticize an author or story, it's immensely valuable to /have actually thought your criticism through enough to know what the hell you're talking about/. If your complaint about the work misses its point because you were too lazy to get past your first negative reaction, you haven't actually located a problem with the work; you've just been a dick. Lists of plot holes are generally worth very little because they're generally just lists of plot points the listmaker failed to understand or think through; even plot hole lists compiled by smart critics will generally let a few really dumb points slip through where the critic is being weirdly dense about something. (There's actually one particular "plot hole" that MoR makes fun of canon HP about, the Goblet Of Fire plot, where I think people including Yudkowsky badly overestimate how irrational canon is; it's extremely easy to imagine what might have been left unexplained that would make that plot make sense, if you're actually supposing that it makes sense.)
