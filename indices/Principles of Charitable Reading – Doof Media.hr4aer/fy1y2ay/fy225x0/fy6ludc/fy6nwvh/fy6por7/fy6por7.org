If you read my other comment on this section you can see my argument against that. To summarize it: Assuming the author is a genius wouldn't have helped interpret either story better. It would've only had an effect on his reading of MoR because reading any story with an uncharitable view towards it is a waste of time.

What this reads to me is as Matt deciding to be more like Scott, which is a bad outcome considering he's a million times more tolerable, even if Scott usually just leads him by the nose in any podcast that doesn't have We've Got Worm format of having him reread while Scott is only reading for the first time.

Ultimately the question is what kind of discussion podcast they want to make. I'm sure tons of fans want to listen to them tell every reason why the thing they already like is great, and maybe that's the smarter move for a podcast trying to appeal to a wide audience, but their saccharine take on Ward made me stop listening to them and I don't think they're getting better if this is what they learned.
