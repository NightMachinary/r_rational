This specifically concerns being charitable toward the creator as an artist, not as a human being. I think you're conflating a sort of Scott Alexander variety of ideological charity with a specific willingness to provisionally assume that an author or filmmaker is in control of their craft.

It's also possible that something that appears transphobic is instead commenting on transphobia. This lens would give you the space needed to explore that ambiguity. Like Robert Downey Junior's blackface in *Tropic Thunder*, it's only offensive if you don't bother to extend artistic charity to the choice; it's only offensive if you assume they either don't know what they're doing, or know what they're doing but they're bad people. So really, either kind of charity (artistic or ideological) is sufficient to make the correct answer obvious.

Anyway, I'm not really saying you need to always read things this way. I don't. I just find it vastly more rewarding when I do. I was really predisposed not to like *Puella Magi Madoka Magica*. It was really rough to get into it. But I gave it the benefit of the doubt and assumed it was doing what it was doing on purpose, and in the end it completely rewarded my charity.
