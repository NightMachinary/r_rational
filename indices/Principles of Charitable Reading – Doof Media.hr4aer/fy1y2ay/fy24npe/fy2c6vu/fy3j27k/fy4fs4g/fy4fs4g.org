Yeah, but a principle of charity /removes/ thought from the equation. if you're assuming the creator is a genius, you're not exploring the possibility space where they aren't, which is far larger.

I agree with you that lists of plot holes are worthless, but the universe of media criticism isn't a coin with one side being CinemaSins and the other being Doof Media.
