Worm spoilers throughout!

Sure, Taylor self-describes as a person who intends to make things better. However, she's also pretty seriously messed up by both her family situation and her school situation, as well as the shared environment of the setting, which includes the shard in her brain.

(For instance, contrast OG Peter Parker and Taylor Hebert. Peter /doesn't/ initially want to use his powers to oppose villains, but his failing to apprehend a robber leads to the death of his uncle. Taylor /does/ want to use her powers to oppose villains, but from the beginning her idea of "making things better" is being undermined by the shard conflict drive.)
