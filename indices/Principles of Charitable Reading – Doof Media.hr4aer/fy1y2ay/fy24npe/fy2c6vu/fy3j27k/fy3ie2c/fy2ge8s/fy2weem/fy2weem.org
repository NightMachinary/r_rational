I do not understand how the author of this doesn't realize they're defeating their own main point by bringing up the Star Wars Prequels.

Hell, RedLetterMedia often assumes the authors are hacks, /especially/ in the Plinkett reviews. If you went into the movies thinking Lucas is a genius, you'd likely miss the entire point.

Just because you can come up with two examples in which a heuristic works doesn't mean you can apply it to everything, or even make it a rule of thumb. I even disagree you need to think EY is a genius to grasp the subtleties of HPMOR, it's barely under the surface.

I'm still glad you posted this link though since it unwittingly explains why their podcasts are full of horrible, nonsensical takes on fiction and how they've spearheaded a brand new type of fanboy.

In the end, Doof Media has released a statement on why fiction analysis should behave more like theology.
