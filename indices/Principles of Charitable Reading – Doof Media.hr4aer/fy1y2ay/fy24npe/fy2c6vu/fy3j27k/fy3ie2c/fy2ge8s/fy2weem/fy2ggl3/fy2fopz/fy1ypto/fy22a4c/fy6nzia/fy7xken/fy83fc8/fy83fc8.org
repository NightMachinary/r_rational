I think you're trying to downplay what the approach described entails by the way it's written. Being charitable towards something is already the basic assumption. Matt is saying he recommends assuming the writer is a genius, which is more than being charitable.

Reading something while injecting this artificial bias of "This thing's writer is a genius" just seems like the wrong kind of mindspace to be in while reading anything. What's the goal? Squeezing more dopamine out of it? Tricking my brain into thinking I should devote myself to the work?

Why?
