Yes, there's another Arthur, who wasn't, for some reason, the Dragon or the Dragon Reborn (or at least isn't clearly presented as such), which /only raises further questions./

As I've said, it's trying to figure out stuff like this that is distracting me from actually enjoying the story that Jordan is trying to tell.

Not that I have a problem with unanswered questions, especially two books into a fifteen book series, but, with all the hints and allusions, it feels like I'm looking at a Sudoku with 80 of the 81 squares filled in, but the answer to the last square, the answer to "What role is the legend of King Arthur supposed to play in this narrative?" is somehow not obvious.
