  Yes, there's another Arthur, who wasn't, for some reason, the Dragon or the Dragon Reborn (or at least isn't clearly presented as such), which /only raises further questions./

There's more elaboration later on, but it's safe to say that the manner in which they interact precludes direct forms of reincarnation. Still, those "further questions" are essentially the core conceit of the setting.

  Not that I have a problem with unanswered questions, especially two books into a fifteen book series, but, with all the hints and allusions, it feels like I'm looking at a Sudoku with 80 of the 81 squares filled in, but the answer to the last square, the answer to "What role is the legend of King Arthur supposed to play in this narrative?" is somehow not obvious.

Two responses:

- Is "What role is the legend of King Arthur supposed to play in this narrative?" a Watsonian or a Doylist questions? They have surprisingly similar answers, but they're very different questions.

- 80 out of 81? How did you deal with all of the Norse, Welsh, Slavic, etc. mythological references? It's more of that.
