That first point, yikes, I understand how some readers can be very reactive and not give the author nearly enough credit, but going from one extreme to another? And that is without even going into the risks of pedestalizing someone like that. You think that with what is currently going on (the whole J.K Rowling situation, cancel culture, etc) it would be a time to encourage people to separate works from their authors and let their fiction speak for itself^{^{1}} , not the other way around.

I think a more apt principle would be to give authors the benefit of the doubt and then exercise critical thinking based on what you're reading. There is no need to turn this into a binary choice, not all authors write everything in a deliberate way, and even when they do they sometimes fail at properly conveying what they want to communicate or even stumble and fall flat on their faces, holding them to the absurd standard of 'genius' isn't very charitable for them and is setting yourself up for a lot of potential disappointment.

  If you really deeply adopt this framing, then arguments about whether a piece of text was “good” or “bad” become uninteresting, to the point of feeling like a category error. A movie can be “good for you” and “bad for me” and that's not only fine, it's typical. I don't need to convince you you're wrong for liking it. On the contrary, I'm interested in understanding your reading. Maybe I missed something.

Everyone has different standards and different approaches with regards to how they consume media, and while the reading will always be subjective sometimes the properties and structures that compose the fiction are not^{^{2}} . Some things don't work, or aren't properly executed, or were left unfinished, or could have been done or handled better, and there is merit to that sort of discussion as well (even enjoyment if you're the sort of individual that likes to dissect such things). I think both subjective and objective takes have their place on a discussion. Or at the very least

"(Book) got X, Y and Z wrong so it sucks."

is as bad as:

"I had fun with (Book), so your criticism isn't valid."

Since both can and are used to shut down any possible discussion.

I'll agree that if you have to choose one or another, then the principles proposed in this post are the ones that would likely lead to the most enjoyment, and perhaps it would even be the most optimal choice for people who prioritize their own entertainment over any kind of technical analysis. But I'm not quite sure how big the overlap is between people who read 'just for fun' and people who read WildBow's works and rationalist fiction. Maybe that is why I consider a nuanced and thoughtful approach to be better suited than a emotional and bias-driven one, the demographic that consumes that niche subgenre of fiction is one that likely can or could identify the problems the Star Wars Prequels had aside from Jar Jar (to use the example provided).

 

^{^{1}} Keeping in mind the context it was made and produced in.

^{^{2}} Most of the time, I'm mostly referring to grammar, plot structure, character arcs, endings, etc, where you have to either be very competent or put a lot of work into its subversion for it to not become a detriment to the story being told.
