I only know Door Media from the We've Got Ward podcast, which I've listened to about a dozen random episodes of. If anything these guys are a little /too/ charitable.

This is actually a HUGE turn-off when listening to their podcasts. They take this to such an extreme that some sections are spent just fawning over the author. Maybe some people like that kind of thing, but I find it tiresome.

I wish they did this one more! It would take the edge off of the overdoing of #1 a bit

Overall I do enjoy the podcast. I don't often agree with the interpretations of the hosts, but they have enough ideas and insights that I hadn't thought of to make it worthwhile
