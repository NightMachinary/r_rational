I think if you read listen to their Method of Rationality podcast, you get a better sense of why #1 is important even if it can occasionally be to a fault. There was enough discussion in the first 5-10 podcasts where they weren't being charitable enough to the author that it put me off as someone who knows where it's going and paid attention ahead of time.

I'd rather listen to peeps err on assuming too much positive traits.
