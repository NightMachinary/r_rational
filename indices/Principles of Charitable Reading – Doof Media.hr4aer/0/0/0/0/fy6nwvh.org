That's tricky because of the nature of how these podcasts work. One person knows the book well, and is versed in the culture of the readers, the other is new. If you've only read 2-3 chapters of a book from an author you don't know well, are you really in a position to make a that call?

It seems like an acceptable fallback to say our principle is "OK, for the focus of this podcast, then we will assume positive intent on the author the entire time" which makes for good listening because it can skip a lot of uninteresting back-and-firth banter IMO
