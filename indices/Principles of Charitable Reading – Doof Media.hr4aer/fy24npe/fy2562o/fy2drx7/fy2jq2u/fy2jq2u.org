  The Wheel of Time is a repetition of events and personalities as much as it is of names, or that's the impression I got from reading the first couple of stories.

Wait, this comes after reading books 2? At that point you'll have come across both Al'Thor and Artur, so it's obvious the author isn't pursuing a direct 1-to-1 Arthurian comparison even while there are strong elements in common between all three of the characters. If the original material hit major thematic points A-B-C-D-E-F, and Artur hit A-C-D-F in his story, that doesn't tell you much about whether Al'Thor is obligated to hit E.
