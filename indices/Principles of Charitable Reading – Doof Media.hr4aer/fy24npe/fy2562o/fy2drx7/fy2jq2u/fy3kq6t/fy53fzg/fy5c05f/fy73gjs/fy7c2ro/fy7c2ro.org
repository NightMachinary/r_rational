  Again without going into too many details, I think there's a good case to be made that Artur Paendrag makes for a better Charlemagne than Arthur.

Oooh. /That/ is a nice touch, given that, so far as I can tell, the Matter of Britain was written largely out of jealousy that Britain didn't have a cool king like Charlemagne to write /chansons de geste/ about.

  It might be that you're catching the vast majority of the Arthurian references, but they're very far from the only ones and I would say it's a mistake to be reading WoT with the expectation that they dominate

Yeah, that wouldn't surprise me. King Arthur has come up in so many fantasy series I've read that I'm probably hypersensitive to references to him; I'm much less familiar with Norse or Slavic mythos, but Greco-Roman stuff will probably be easier for me to spot. And I have been picking up on some of the Christian allusions as well (Tarmon Gai'don and Shai'tan being the least subtle of them).

That said, even taking into account my bias, the Arthurian stuff does seem particularly prevalent in the first two books.
