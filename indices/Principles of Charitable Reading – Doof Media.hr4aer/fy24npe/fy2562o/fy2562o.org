I think the a more broad approach to "Robert Jordan was a genius" would first require that we ask what he was trying to do with the reuse of Arthurian names, rather than deciding that a genius would obviously be doing an Arthurian retelling and then finding the Arthurian retelling lacking. Textually, on the Watsonian level, the Arthurian names are a symptom of each turning of the Wheel rhyming with itself, and names/meanings becoming corrupted over time. On a Doylist level, Jordan knew that we knew those names, so they caught our attention and prompted us to wonder about it in the first place.
