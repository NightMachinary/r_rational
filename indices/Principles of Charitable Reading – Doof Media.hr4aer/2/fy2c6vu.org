Number 1 is... like... straight up kind of a bad idea?

Like this is a place where people with a bizarre preoccupation of talking about media on the internet have been before. Dealing with the guy in the NGE fandom who interprets the living fuck out of every little detail that Anno threw in because he thought it was cool, or the people who get sucked into Snyder movie discourse where you defend every choice as intentional genius no matter how obviously it was driven by production factors or outright incompetence. Those kinds of fans are as much the bane of the amateur critic's existence as the super negative people. Try not to become that guy.

It also leaves you open to feeling like a dope when you're speculations about a given plot element end up falling apart because you were reading too much into it in the first place. Or say a story does something you think is messed up or hurtful, like if it does something transphobic. Then you have three choices:

*a.* Presume that the author is either clueless, ignorant, or just didn't think the implications through.

*b.* Assume there's something else coming that will justify it and make it okay in the end.

*c.* That the author was actually /intentionally being bigoted./

Despite not seeming like it, A is actually the most charitable option. The author didn't know or did a goof, someone hurt by a story may be able to recover their enjoyment of the story from that. B sets yourself up for a letdown, and C involves just accepting that the author of a story you enjoy is a big piece of shit. Both if which involving a lot of intent on part of the author, and neither of which are very fun.

While, yeah, a measure of faith in an author is a good thing, I think it really should be tempered by skepticism and a critical eye to keep your assessment of a story on an even keel. Or at the very least pick and choose what you think is genius and intentional and what you think is just the author being a dummy.

I mean, sure. This might be good for curating your ability to enjoy stories more (as opposed to just moving onto something else *^{SHE-RA SHE-RA SHE-RA}*), but for an amateur critic and/or artist I think it's way more helpful to internalize the fact that stories are products brought about by a creative process rather than being perfectly shaped from the author's mind like Athena popping out of Zeus's head. A process that can run into problems by circumstance or just the author making less than ideal choices.

A movie can run into shooting and editing issues, a writer can run into time constraints brought on by life. Video games are often made by people having their noses ground into the dirt by companies (AAA games) or by themselves (indie games). This allows you to more easily shift what you like away from what you don't and deconstruct media as things people made that can be closely analyzed on a narrative and craft level without your negativity and positivity of certain aspects of it getting in the way.
