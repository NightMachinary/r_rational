I sort of agree with your takedown, but I still think the first precept of "assume the best of the author" is good to follow so long as we caveat it with: "given that all other quality indicators prove that the author is decently skilled."

For example, many times I've seen antagonists acting mean/unfair towards the POV character with no immediately apparant reason.

- The uncharitable assumption is that the antagonist is just a flat character stereotypically making life hard for the Mary Sue protagonist.
- The charitable assumption is that the antagonists have background reasons for acting the way they do that haven't been revealed yet. (The reasons don't have to make the action justified, they just have to provide a believable motive.)

I've also seen a few occasions that tie in with your hypothetical "/a story does something you think is messed up or hurtful/". Sometimes the 'good guys' are shown doing something morally despicable, and the POV character completely fails to recognize or act on just how bad it is.

- The uncharitable assumption is that the POV character doesn't notice or act because the author doesn't think it's unforgivable, which has disturbing implications for the author's moral reasoning (your options A, B, and C).

- The /actual/ charitable assumption is that the author designed the POV character to be flawed with biases that shape his or her inability to recognize the truth, and the author intends that the 'good guys' not actually be good. For instance, they could be living in a world of [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndGrayMorality][Black-and-Gray Morality]], or the POV character might be experiencing an emotional handicap that prevents them from assigning blame correctly (such as battered person syndrome.)

Most authors signal the correct view through their presentation of the story, but picking out their intentions is more difficult when the story is written in a limited POV or has an unreliable narrator. Usually I can tell over the course of the first few chapters whether or not an author has any skill portraying characters with fleshed-out inner lives and believable motives, so /usually/ my assumptions are calibrated with those quality indicators in mind and I turn out to be right.

But even on the occasions where I turn out to be wrong, I'd rather assume the best and have a fun time reading while the good parts last rather than miss out on reading something potentially great.
