What I find ridiculous is that the two examples given are so disparate from each other and an assumption of the author's genius just would not help in either situation. The dark undertones of Worm are not /invisible./ Taylor breaks YA protagonist tropes right from the get-go. HPMoR has a bad reputation among people with bad taste, but that's your fault if you listened to them and let them color your experience, not a fact of reality that you need to work around with a heuristic/principle. Update your values and lower the weight of their opinions on your predictions for next time.

You can get the "superior reading experience" of both MoR and Worm by not being a prejudiced jackass prone to assumptions. Just letting each work speak for itself is usually enough.

If anything, the heuristic should be to stop being uncharitable, not to be maximally charitable at all times to try and squeeze dopamine out of rocks. The front-facing content of a story is not something to base your opinion off of. "Don't judge a book by its cover" is a lesson everyone hears for a reason: It cuts both ways.
