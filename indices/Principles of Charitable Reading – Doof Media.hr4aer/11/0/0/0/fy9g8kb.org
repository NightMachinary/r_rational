I think "genius" doesn't have a definitive meaning and it can mean whatever you need it to mean to flip your brain into a mode where you're expecting something interesting to happen rather than expecting the writer to screw up. I think you might be putting too much weight on that specific word and not enough on the paragraphs that follow it.
