The role is mostly allusional and referential. The Wheel of Time is not an Arthurian story; it's something else that occasionally nods in Arthur's direction.

Jordan was very into folklore, legends, and myths, which are oral traditions, and therefore have heavy borrowing and very little consistency. Consider folk music: There are [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-TgxTmglE8][many]] [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBSO5SJBzuA][ways]] to [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBBSYK20-T0][play]] a song like "The Lowlands of Holland". The tone varies a lot, the tune varies slightly, the lyrics a little more, but it's all recognizably the same song about a woman's lover who goes away to war in Holland (or New Holland) and dies. But the variety gets broader: It's related by derivation (though I don't know which way the derivation goes) to [[https://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/eng/child/ch092.htm][Bonny Bee Hom]], in which the woman gives her lover a magic ring who's stone will fade when she dies--it does, and he kills himself. And the lyrics of "Lowlands" seem to have gotten borrowed into (and then almost completely discarded from) a sea shanty about a ghostly woman appearing one night to her former lover, "Lowlands [away]" ([[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfMm7cIsb_I][this version]] is a pretty traditional rendition, despite coming from a video game). The melody to that song probably comes, somehow, from an African American dockworkers' song in New Orleans, complaining about low wages ("My dollar and a half a day"). The same thing happens to stories in oral traditions.

(Arthurian legend is itself a great example of this sort of thing that I happen to be really into, and I wrote a few paragraphs about it before I realized that you probably know most of it given what you've been saying. I'm happy to geek out about the evolution of Arthur with you if you want, though.)

Jordan makes it pretty clear he's writing this kind of story, I think:

  The Wheel of Time turns, and Ages come and pass, leaving memories that become legend. Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth comes again.

There are Gleemen working in the oral tradition, telling stories from our own age: The Cold War becomes the giants Mosk and Merc, who fought from opposite sides of the world with lances of fire, and the US Space program becomes the tale [G]Lenn and his daughter Salya, who flew to the moon in the belly of an eagle. Everywhere the Emond's Fielders go, people know different dances to similar songs with different names, and there never seems to be a canonical version of anything.

I think your confusion is pretty understandable, though. The whole centerless variation of stories and songs is foreign to most modern audiences, when stories are published word for word in books and music is reproduced as an exact replica of a single performance. The closest most of us have to a living folk tradition is fanfiction, and even that still has a canonical reference source. So it's kind of natural to see the names and assume Jordan's doing a retelling of Arthur, or at least writing a story to be read in the knowledge of the Arthurian tradition. But in this context, that's like hearing "Lowlands Away" and assuming it's written as a re-styling of "The Lowlands of Holland", and that you need to memorize the latter and read up on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Dutch_Wars][The Anglo-Dutch Wars]] to enjoy it; it's applying the right tools to the wrong object of study. Jordan is writing a story whose broad strokes are the kind of thing that Arthurian legend might become after 5 or 6 thousand years of further mutation. Or equivalently, the kind of thing that might, after millennia, become something broadly similar to our stories of Arthur. Or perhaps neither, given that the Heroes of the Horn don't live out exactly the same stories in every lifetime. With that kind of change, characters, events, and plots are altered, split, fused, borrowed, made up out of whole cloth, and recombined into something new. In any case, our memory of Arthur has long since passed through legend and into myth; even if he were a reincarnation of The Dragon or Artur Hawking, we're too distant from the man himself to say, and our stories belong to our age, not theirs.

And it's not just Arthur that The Wheel of Time does this with, either. Jordan incorporates stuff from all over, though mostly Northern Europe. For example the beings known as elves, fairies, or the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aos_S%C3%AD][aes sidhe]] are clearly referenced in the Aes Sedai--dangerous and magical people who will try to mislead you but never outright lie--and also in the people you meet in book 4, the foxlike and snakelike people beyond the stone doorway ter'angreal, who abide cruelly by the strict letter of mysterious bargains, and fear cold iron, in a world where time and space work a bit differently. Which ones are "really" supposed to be the fairies? That's a wrong question, like asking which is the real "Lowlands" and which are references. Knowing the material he draws from can give another layer of depth or pleasure to a reader, just like knowing lots of folk music can can provide another layer of appreciation to a listener when a song references or borrows from another. But this isn't a remake, or a remix, or a retelling, or even a pastiche. It's just a story that borrows names and mythemes in the way all stories used to.
