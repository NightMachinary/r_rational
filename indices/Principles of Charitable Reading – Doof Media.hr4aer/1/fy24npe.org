I think that #1 might be worse for the reading of a story than doing otherwise; something might be better as a surface detail than otherwise.

For example, in Harry Potter, the Chronicles of Amber, etc., the name "Merlin" is used to basically imply "really powerful wizard" but not much else. If you try to read further into Arthurian legend, you're not going to get much benefit out of it. And this, I think, is part of my problem getting immersed in Wheel of Time; there are so many names that are references to Arthurian legend that I am expecting someone named Lannot (or something similar) to show up any time now to try to woo Egwene away from Al'Thor (that, or Nynaeve delivering Al'Thor a sword). And reading this as a retelling of Arthur's story is /killing/ my immersion, because, like the Fionavar Tapestry, it just /doesn't work/ as a re-telling of the Arthur myth (so far, at least). If I could step back and say, "these names are just references," instead of, "surely, this person is a genius who knows what they're doing," I would be able to better evaluate the text on its own merits.
