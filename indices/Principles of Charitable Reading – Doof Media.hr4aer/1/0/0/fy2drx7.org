The Wheel of Time is a repetition of events and personalities as much as it is of names, or that's the impression I got from reading the first couple of stories. There's some variation between repetitions, but the general pattern remains the same. So, if the names are repeating, then the events should /also/ be a variation on the Arthur myth. And, again, the events (to the point I've read) don't really /work/ in that light.

To go back to the essay, when Yudkowsky breaks immersion through Harry not behaving like an eleven-year-old, he's presenting the reader with a mystery to solve. When Wildbow presents Taylor doing villainous things, they're breaking immersion in an attempt to get people to consider questions of morality.

If I subscribe to the "genius" technique of reading, I need to try to determine why the author thought it was important to break my immersion by naming a character "Egwene al'Vere," to find some sort of important meaning behind that name before I continue reading. As you put it, I need to spend time and effort /asking what he is trying to do by using these names/. And the answer, "just the name is being repeated but nothing else is" isn't a satisfying answer to that question, so I go through the story trying to pull it apart and figure out "Exactly in what way is this character supposed to be Guinevere? Who is Lancelot? How is Lancelot going to come between them when they're not destined to marry?" and so on.

If, on the other hand, I give Jordan /less/ credit for genius, I can do what you say, and think, "Wow, he really didn't consider how much this would break the immersion of someone who recognizes the name. I'll just set that aside and try to let the story carry me along." Which, if I could actually accomplish it (/so/ much immersion-breaking in WoT so far), would make it a much more enjoyable read. In my opinion, of course.
