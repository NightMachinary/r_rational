I haven't concluded that the author doesn't know what he's doing. I've concluded that /I/ have no idea what the author is trying to do. The only thing that I've been able to conclude is that the author is trying to make his series /somehow/ related to Arthurian legend. And I have two choices, whenever something Arthur-related comes up: I can assume the author is a genius, and that this is a mystery placed in my path to figure out, which consumes the attention which should be spent getting me emotionally involved in the plight of the characters, or I can close my eyes, take a breath, and recommit myself to reading the story that is presented to me and judging it on its own merits.

I'm saying, knowing that I have no idea what Jordan was trying to accomplish with these references and therefore no idea how well he's doing at it, that I find these references immersion-breaking, and that I find having to constantly fight to keep myself emotionally invested in /these/ characters to be *incredibly frustrating*.

On the other hand, if I /had/ concluded that the author didn't know what he was doing, that this would never go beyond a shallow allusion to the originating myth, as the Merlin of JK Rowling's Harry Potter or of Roger Zelazny's Amber never did, I'd probably find reading it more enjoyable, because then I could read it without expectations.
