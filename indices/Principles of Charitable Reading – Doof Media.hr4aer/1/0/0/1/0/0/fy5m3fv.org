I honestly think you make a good argument. I think the principle of charity is fine as far as it goes, but, like Occam's Razor, you're meant to discard it when you have actual evidence, which it feels like you do. It's good to keep that door open to be surprised, but it's fine to shift your priors to include a strong possibility that the author didn't full think out that side of things. A really strong author would provide some nods and winks if the Arthurian parallel were really going to pay off. Though some in this thread seem to disagree, and while there continue to be some light parallels, my feeling from reading all these books years ago is that it doesn't.
