Since, as Versac points out, the story does ultimately make the parallels to Arthurian (and Norse) legend a lot more directly, I have to ask: Do you think it's possible that if you hadn't concluded after 2 books of a 15 book series that you knew the author /didn't/ know what he was doing, maybe your reading experience would have been more enjoyable, as the article suggests?
