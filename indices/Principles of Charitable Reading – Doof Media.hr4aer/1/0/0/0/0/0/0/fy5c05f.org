Doylist. I'm perfectly fine with letting the connection to the in-story Arthur develop as the narrative continues; I'm confused about why the /author/ would be using the Arthurian characters to tell his story, but not /actually/ using those characters, just ones with names that are specifically chosen to reflect them. Why is Lancelot a bodyguard to - is Moiraine supposed to be Merlin or Morgan Le Fay, or some amalgam? Why is Lancelot falling in love with Nimuë? I mean, I'm happy to see more focus on Nimuë, who has always been more of a plot device (to deliver a sword and/or take Merlin out of the story) than a character, but /Lancelot/?! And why is he a /king/, of all things? It's hard enough to read /one/ fifteen-book story, let alone to simultaneously read two of them superimposed on each other.

"80 out of 81" was a misstatement. I feel like I'm more at that point with about 33 numbers left to fill in, where you know that just /one more/ is going to make filling the rest of the grid in trivial, and yet that one piece is eluding me. That I've been given so much information that it /should/ be enough to piece this together, but nothing is presenting itself. My conclusion this far is that I'm probably reading way too much into the connection between this story and King Arthur's, that this should probably be readable and enjoyable by someone completely unfamiliar with the Arthur story. But when Arthur keeps getting referenced, it feels more and more like something to /solve/, and I *can't", and that frustration is really taking me out of the story.

I've /noticed/ some of the other references (like the names of the Trolloc tribes), but I'm not as familiar with them, and they're not as much in my face as the Arthur references, so, other than an eyeroll when I read the glossary entry for Trolloc, I've been mostly able to gloss over them. Even "Trolloc" and "Ogier" have just about stopped grating at my ears at this point.
