The short version is that in service to the overall literary theme of cyclic rebirth, a vast number of literary references are sewn throughout the series both in initial names and characterization and in wider character arcs and final role in the story. But these references are rarely one-to-one in /either/ direction for any significant characters.

Start with Rand: there's an easy Arthur parallel there, both with the name and the dragon symbolism and the obviously significant mysterious parentage and that the reader is quite explicitly told he'll eventually be the destined wielder of +ex+Callandor (even if it might take some time to snag the dang thing) and so on. But with some care about spoilers, there are also nearly-as-obvious links to both Tyr and Jesus, and it doesn't take much effort to throw Zeus in there as well.

Circling around with the Arthur reference, there's also Hawkwing muddying things. The metaphysics of the setting make it explicit that he's not meant to fill the same role as Rand, and while he might pull off a good conquering/returning king act he's using [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joyeuse][the wrong sword]]. Again without going into too many details, I think there's a good case to be made that Artur Paendrag makes for a better Charlemagne than Arthur.

Thomdril Merrilin seems like a clean Merlin expy for a while, but the thoroughly non-magical bent suggests an older version such as Myrddin. But wait! Blink and you'll miss it, but the prologue to WoT references the character of Tamyrlin, the legendary first discoverer of magic (and in-universe etymology of "Amyrlin"). A historical character with mixed characterization gets split down the middle, with arguably the more distinctive half barely counting as a cameo.

Going to Lan, there are indeed some Lancelot du Lac parallels in the early books. But the wider out of the Borderlands into a mash-up of the classical near east and Japan points in the direction of the satraps, where there's a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andragoras_(Seleucid_satrap)][suggestive name]] in the list.

That's a quick skim to be sure, but the main cast is jam packed - both [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Math_fab_Mathonwy][Mat]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perun][Perrin]] are bluntly named for one of their respective primary ingredients, but the later trends towards the Scandinavian are maybe even more overt, given the greater recognizability. (You're not fooling anyone with a hammer named Mah'alleinir, though the Sleipnir reference was nicely subtle.) It might be that you're catching the vast majority of the Arthurian references, but they're very far from the only ones and I would say it's a mistake to be reading WoT with the expectation that they dominate - I don't know what flavor of "playing with" TvTropes would call it, but on the Doylist level I'd say meta-lampshading.
