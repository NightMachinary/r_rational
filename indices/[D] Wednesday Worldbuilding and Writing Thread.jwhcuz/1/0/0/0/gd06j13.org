Thanks. I have a friend from Libya and we were just talking about how even though his family and friends are all ethnic berbers, they just think they're Arab. Most don't even know or can explain what the distinction is. And the Berbers were no joke, they were a prolific people over a prolonged period of time. That's an incredibly successful instance of cultural subsumation, you've got to admire it.
