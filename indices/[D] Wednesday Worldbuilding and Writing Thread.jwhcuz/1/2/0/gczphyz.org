I should rephrase. Talking about ecclesiology in enough detail to minimize the chances of future debate resulting in schism, dissolution, and/or widespread confusion. Not necessarily codifying the specifics of polity or day-to-day operation, but outlining where the church stands in relation to its theology, adherents, non-adherents, and how discrepancies about these issues should be approached.

Making a satisfactory outline would be highly difficult, but at the very least we could avoid the basic questions that have led other faiths to split, such as who is in charge after the signature prophet dies.
