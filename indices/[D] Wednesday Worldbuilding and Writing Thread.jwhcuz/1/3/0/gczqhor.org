This is a fascinating idea. Of course it leaves a lot to its followers at various points in time, disproportionately gives power over doctrine to those who are the most literate, and over time the faith could split in multiple directions, effectively becoming a category of reflection-based faiths rather than a unifying worldview.

Religion as a system of beliefs is highly sensitive to initial conditions. There was a lot of passionate debate in early Christian history about the exact nature of the Trinity and Jesus.

Even doctrines with superficially minor differences in otherwise identical sects caused significant divergence in other beliefs and practices as time went on due to the larger philosophical implications.
