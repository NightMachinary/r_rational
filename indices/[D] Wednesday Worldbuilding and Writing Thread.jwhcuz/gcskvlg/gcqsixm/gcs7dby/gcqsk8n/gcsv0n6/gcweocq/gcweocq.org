Make a religion that explicit forbids detailed communication about specific doctrine. The only way to transmit doctrine is a physical recording without verbal communication (ie. A book). The only exception is to inform someone that the physical form of the doctrine is vulnerable to corruption, and thus the reader's judgement in determining what is true is inherently required and considered a "holy duty."

What does the doctrine say? Doesn't matter. You've made careful consideration an act of worship, and promotion of literacy and communication beyond a face-to-face speech religiously significant. Sooner or later someone will interpret these conditions as allowing some degree of editing, and you've got people updating scriptures as time goes on, keeping the promotion of the core religious ideals present as time goes on as the nuance fits the time period.
