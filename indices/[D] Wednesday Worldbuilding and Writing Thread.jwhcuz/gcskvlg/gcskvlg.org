I'm having a moderate blast doing NaNo with my "urban fantasy with wizards who are irrelevant" thing. (It started off with the question: if wizards are real, why don't they do something? answer, at least here: because trying to do things means you die/get erased, so.)

Probably the single most annoying thing about writing it set "right now" (aka November 2020) is the general state of lockdown. I mean, it's the literally perfect setting for a coffee shop run by a cheerful millenium-old demihuman and her fairy goddaughter, but the coffee shop is closed! And suchlike and so forth.

Anyway, the main character is a total nerd, he'd fit in here pretty well, so I thought I'd ask: if you, say, had an undeniable magic experience (ran into a dragon and helped it shape itself into a human form) while moving into your new group house which turns out to be full of wizards, what questions would you ask?

(The first question he asks is about whether he'll owe anything for answers. The second question he asks is whether the soul exists / whether the self continues after death. The third question he asks is whether he has magic, and the answer is "the Sight, but no ability to otherwise wield magic or enact changes in the world".)
