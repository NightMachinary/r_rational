That's a good question! It's especially a fun one because nobody (or at least nobody who's talking about it) knows why in a fundamental sense, rather than in an immediate sense.

(the immediate reason why magic is secret is that attempts to be unsecretive about magic, change the world, etc, uniformly fail, often in lethal-to-the-wizard ways. You can't solve COVID with magic because trying to do so kills you. You can't collect the millions of dollars in prize money for having magic because your magic will fail you.)
