The idea of founding an uplift religion focused on high utility is an interesting one that I've thought a lot about. There's a line from a poem by Emily Dickinson that I think is really relevant in that context:

=The Truth must dazzle gradually=\\
=Or every man be blind â€”=

"Truth" has no innate utility, its only value is in the utility that it confers. How useful would enlightenment values be in Judea 2000 years ago, or Arabia 1300 years ago? Not very. They would not be very well received. And if you include it anyway for future use, what's to prevent something like a council of Nicaea from dropping it because they don't like it, or because it makes no sense to a 3rd century fanatic? You can see that enlightenment ideals are not particularly compelling, in that despite leading to(or, more importantly, being attributed to such) the modernization of our society, they have no special hold over people as a whole. It has relevance because of its utility, but is not particularly memetic.

I think one commonality between all successful religions is that they have utility for rulers. Without Constantine and the Roman Empire, Christianity would likely just be another fringe, near-extinct belief like Tengrism, or a cultural relic with marginal influence, like shinto or taoism. Instead they saw its value as a tool and made it a fixture of the state, took the reins so it would not be used against them. Mohamed took that concept and ran with it, to the point where he enshrined his language, his country, and his culture (and even incorporated an existing competitor, the pagans in meccah, and made them a stakeholder!). Actually, Mohamed is the only prophet who had success /within his lifetime/, which is notable.

So Christianity was successful because it was highly transmissible in the lower classes(iirc it was commonly referred to as a "slave cult" by the romans), and was able to exist at the bottom of a hostile power structure and to separate the spiritual from the political. It was explicitly not a revolutionary ideology.

Islam was successful because it was a near-perfect tool of arab colonization and cultural supremacy. In contrast to Christianity, Islam scripturally incorporated ways of ruling over people of other religions, rather than being ruled by them.

Tengrism is actually a very interesting case study. It was the religion of many highly successful steppe cultures, foremost among them the mongols and the gokturks, but rather than spread their religion at the point of the sword like Islam and Christianity, they themselves converted within one or two generations, time and time again.

A final thought: of all religions, the one most likely to have been invented by a time traveler is probably confucionism. It is above all else supremely pragmatic, making allowances for the fallibility of man and state, and providing advice on how to survive while serving the corrupt and the incompetent. A lot of its precepts still have a lot of utility to this day, like the emphasis on education, which has served east asia well.

The second most likely is Jainism, because it's simultaneously massively impractical and supremely moral.
