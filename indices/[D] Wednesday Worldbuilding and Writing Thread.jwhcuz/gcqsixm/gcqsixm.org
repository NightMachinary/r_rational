I've had an idea rolling around in my head for a while that basically boils down to, "What if Buddha/Zoroaster/Abraham/Jesus/Mani/Muhammad/Nanak/etc. was a rationalist and/or had additional knowledge of science/history?"

In other words, an alternate history where a fundamentally improved or even ideal religion is founded and spread, not falling into its OTL pitfalls. One could argue that this has been attempted in real life, that at least a solid chunk of historical prophets thought that [[https://xkcd.com/927/][this time]] they'd get it right.

Some would argue that religion itself is fundamentally incompatible with the goals of rationalism and will always be hijacked by bad-faith actors.

I still think it'd be interesting to explore a religion that would maximize the good aspects and minimize the bad ones. The assumption that religion can be good, it's just a matter of designing a sufficiently good one.

It's a challenging prompt, especially if you're not going to completely make it a wank-y/[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_space_bats][ASB]] setting. Assuming one wants to go in-depth and realistic, there are a lot of butterflies to consider even with a PoD going back a couple centuries.

I have two main settings so far rolling around in my head:

- Modern alt-history. The ideal religion is born in the late 80s from early internet culture and as the internet grows, it spills out into meatspace, grows rapidly. One issue that comes up is that, even if it seems a bit cynical, any such movement would either by suppressed or co-opted by corporate and state actors whose power would be threatened by a widespread spiritual shift in the same way that Christianization and Islamization disrupted the livelihoods of powerful people in their time.

- Designing the religion first, then the actual setting, perhaps even not even having it take place on Earth at all, designing a setting from scratch. One idea I had was essentially a system of theology, ecclesiology, and ethics that would be built to be universally compatible whether you're evangelizing to bipedal hominids, a planet dominated by a fungal consciousness, big-brained cuttlefish, etc. Still maybe starting the religion around humanoids, having them be the evangelizers.

In both cases the actual details of the religion itself I haven't decided on yet. Assuming I'm doing it from scratch, I'd avoid merely syncretizing or tweaking something that already exists. Obviously it'd be borderline impossible not to borrow /anything/ from a preexisting faith.

So far I'm thinking a henotheistic religion (I have the placeholder name Halqam) whose scripture is basically a compilation of texts that each cater to a specific aspect. One of the books is a Pilgrim's Progress style narrative, except for the views of Halqam. Another is similar to the Old Testament, a mytho-historical account that depicts a dialogue between the Halqam god and their followers. Another talks about ecclesiology in great detail, leaving little to nothing up for future debate if at all possible. Another is essentially a discourse on morality on the scale of individuals. Another is a discourse on ethical governance/foreign policy.

So on and so forth.

The god of Halqam is the chief god, deserving of the highest worship, but emphasis on them not being the strongest god, but rather the one who has humanity's interests best at heart and who is the wisest. Rather than promising a blissful afterlife, Halqam believes in perpetual reincarnation, except there's no way to escape samsara, the world itself isn't something to escape, the goal of spirituality in Halqam isn't liberation, but exploration and sanctification of what exists.

This is my train of thought so far. These kinds of ideas seem applicable to an alternate Muhammad, I even got the name from an Arabic word which refers to a ring of people.

I'm open to hearing thoughts and questions.
