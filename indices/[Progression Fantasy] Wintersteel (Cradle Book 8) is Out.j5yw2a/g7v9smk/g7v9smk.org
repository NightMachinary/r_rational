I'll second this rec. I tried the Cradle series just a couple months ago, and liked them enough that I finished them all within the week. If the previous books are free right now, I'd highly recommend giving them a go.

For reference, I haven't been particularly taken with any other Xianxia series in the past. They're mostly not well written enough or too sloppy to keep my interest. Cradle is both well written and with solid enough world-building to keep my interest throughout.
