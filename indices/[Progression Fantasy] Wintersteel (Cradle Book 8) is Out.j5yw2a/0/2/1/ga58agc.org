The author has said the story will finish after ~12 volumes and they're 8 volumes in.

Each set of three volumes is a decent stopping point and the books have been put in bundles that way post-release. There are still cliffhangers at the end of Book 3 and at the end of Book 6, but they hit good stopping points. I'd say the same for Wintersteel (book 8) being a good stopping point, since it does wrap up a ton of plot threads, but that might be out too recently to really say.
