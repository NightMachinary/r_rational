  I think it's an increasingly shallow experience. The worldbuilding, the characterization, even the magic system are all left unexplored in favour of keeping a tight pacing.

Hmm, I see where you're coming with that. The author does really cut the writing to the bone. Personally, I kind of like how pared down it is, but I can see feeling it goes too far.

  Even when we're shown a precious moment of intimacy and connection between characters the author will write something like "they then talked about the tournament and training for the rest of the evening while holding hands"

I agree this scene really should have been where more actual emotional intimacy was explored. It was a bit odd that it just kind of... ended when they had dinner.

  Why do they give a single shit about the Blackflame Empire?

I will say that for Lindon at least, it's extremely clear why he cares. It's been made clear over and over that his motivation is to try to save his home and family from being completely wiped out by the Dreadgods. It was the spark that drove him to leave Sacred Valley in the first place. Yerin, for her part, seems clear that she cares about advancement, Lindon, living up to her memory of her former master, and nothing else.
