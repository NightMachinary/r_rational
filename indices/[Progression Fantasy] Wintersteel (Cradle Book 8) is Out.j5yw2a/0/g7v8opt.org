A lot of folks here seem to enjoy the Cradle series, so here's me letting you know about the latest book in the series being released.

Just a shill for those who haven't heard of the [[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0753FP6SP?ref_=dbs_p_mng_rwt_ser_shvlr&storeType=ebooks][series]] before:

A lot of people here don't really like the Xianxia genre and I agree with their criticisms of how many main characters are very villainous, under-developed enemies and female characters, the economies of cultivation aren't logical, the poor scaling in conflict as you go from one city to interstellar in scope, and awkward prose. But I bring up all of these flaws to say that the Cradle series completely avoids all of the typical flaws in Xianxia and has a very smart character who sets out to cultivate smartly instead of bullheadedly.

Lindon is well-developed with empathy instead of being a sociopath. There are multiple strong female leads who aren't merely romantic interests (ex. Yerin and Mercy). The power levels are well-defined and we see the top most tiers of power early on who are relevant instead of emerging as needed as the protagonist grows in strength. The scale in scope from one place to interstellar stays meaningful and coherent.

This series alone rescues the Xianxia genre and makes the setting's tropes enjoyable again.
