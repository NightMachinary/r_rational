I enjoyed it.

I mean... the entire thing is essentially just The Legend of the Gutsy Ninja, retold. But that's a good story. As I get older I see less and less point in criticizing stories for being unoriginal since you eventually realise that almost nothing is original and really its just minor variations of the same story beats, promises and payoffs retold again and again with slightly different coats of paint.
