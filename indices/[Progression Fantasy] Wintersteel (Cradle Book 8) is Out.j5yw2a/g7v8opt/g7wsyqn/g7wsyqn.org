Since this seems to be a long-runner, is there a convenient place (after a certain volume or such) where it'd make sense to stop, or is it a continuous spiral of escalation? (Worm burned me there)

Basically, I like to finish stuff, but that's hard to do with an ongoing series, and aborting a series or leaving it hanging kinda feels like having a tab with barely audible music open, which you can ignore, but is o so satisfying to close.
