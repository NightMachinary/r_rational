I wouldn't say it's a continuous spiral, in that it seems like the "ultimate power level" is a fixed point that the author has planned out from the start. There are characters introduced in the first book that are already at that ultimate level, and those characters aren't getting any stronger. There's /seemingly/ a defined end-point. The MC even found a box of cute little power-level badges, that seemingly has a badge for every possible power-level. (Or at least all the ones that anyone ever held on their homeworld.)

The MC seems to be about... half-way to reaching that ultimate power level?
