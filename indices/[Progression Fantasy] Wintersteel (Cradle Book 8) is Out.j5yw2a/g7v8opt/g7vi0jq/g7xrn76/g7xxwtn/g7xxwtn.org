Scope bloom can be partially dealt with using real-life levels of decay. The more things which are gained, assembled, or achieved, the more things there are to decay, wither, fossilize, or go out of control.

Look at politicians, who regularly go from one political crisis (or at least problem) to the next, usually juggling multiple ones at any given moment, only to see the same ones rise again in a slightly different form later - not even necessarily stronger, but having to be dealt with all the same. Maybe even with political tools which have gotten rusty or underfunded or the people originally in charge have moved on and the new ones are unknowns.

Of course, that means a series either stays at the same level of action, or levels off, which doesn't really fit the 'continual progression' aspect.
