I think it's an increasingly shallow experience. The worldbuilding, the characterization, even the magic system are all left unexplored in favour of keeping a tight pacing.

Even when we're shown a precious moment of intimacy and connection between characters the author will write something like "they then talked about the tournament and training for the rest of the evening while holding hands"(<--paraphrased from an actual scene in Wintersteel, btw) rather than, you know, actually show them having a conversation.

I'm reading the latest book right now and you have Mercy and Lindon showing all this concern for civilians and all I can think of is that they haven't had a single line of dialog with anyone that wasn't moving the plot forward in some way. Why do they give a single shit about the Blackflame Empire? We know nothing about it, met only a few random cultivators from there(all discarded as characters by now), in the end it's just a place they trained in for a few arcs.

I'm aware that a lot of people are fine with the story as it is, and that's fine, but I'm not. The funny thing is, I read Unsouled on release day, and I'm pretty sure I was the first person to recommend this story here, and a few other subs. I thought it showed a lot of promise.
