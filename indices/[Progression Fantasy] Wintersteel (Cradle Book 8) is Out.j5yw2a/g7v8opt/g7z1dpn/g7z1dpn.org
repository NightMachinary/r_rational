God bless Will wight as well as Travis Bauldry (audiobook narrator).

To everyone unhappy about the past book or similar: I do agree the books aren't 100% perfect, but I am here to see Lindon kick ass, while occasionally meeting cool new people. Sure we could get as much detail and character building as stormlight archive or some such, but this isn't that kind of story and I don't think I'd want it to be. We get basically 0 boring downtime. It's almost always action, and it's definitely always awesome. If I wanted every rock described I'd go pick the wheel of time up from where I stopped reading because it got too slow.

Don't mean to come off mean. Basically just wanted to say that this series delivers what I want in a good package, and i think it's awesome!
