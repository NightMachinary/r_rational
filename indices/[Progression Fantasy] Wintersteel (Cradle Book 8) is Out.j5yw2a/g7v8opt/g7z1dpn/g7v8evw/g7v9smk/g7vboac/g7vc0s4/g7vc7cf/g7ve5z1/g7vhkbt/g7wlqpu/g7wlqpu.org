I never read past the first book. The author was pushing a noble vs. commoner underdog story, which didn't really make sense to me with cultivation being added to the equation that should have been a huge equalizer. If I'm remembering correctly, it was the nobility from the mortal world that was being overbearing, which seems like they would lose power once entering a cultivation sect based on talent. Please correct me if I'm remembering it wrong.
