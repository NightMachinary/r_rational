I read the first book and part of the second. It was fine, but ultimately not that compelling to me. It subverted some of the tropes, sure, but mostly it didn't really go anywhere. After a book and a half, there didn't seem to be any over-arching plot of any real meaning. Building up to beating the bad guy in a big fight is fine as far as it goes, but it's kind of a weak hook to just keep using over and over in a series. There wasn't really... anything more that it seemed to be building to.

Also, I found the fights to be incredibly repetitive.
