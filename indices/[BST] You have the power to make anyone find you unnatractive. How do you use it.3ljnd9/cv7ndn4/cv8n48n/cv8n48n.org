I think this is the best answer so far, and also the explanation for why "can't you do that anyway by doing something gross" isn't an answer. The difference between making yourself unattractive this way and just doing something gross is that someone who finds you unattractive because of this power can't communicate why they find you unattractive; as far as everyone else is concerned, you are just being victimized for no reason. And appearing to be an unjustified victim can be useful.
