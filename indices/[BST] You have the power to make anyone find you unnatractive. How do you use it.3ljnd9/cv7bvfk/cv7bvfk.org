I would use it to power a civilization of infinitely immortal beings!

The human brain is a mesh of neurons and synapses firing, right? If someone's opinion changes, that must entail some sort of new pattern of neurons and synapses firing. The prompt implies that no outside stimulus changes, so the only way I can see this working is if I caused a neuron (or neurons) to fire that wouldn't have otherwise. Which I believe implies I created energy out of nowhere.

So how do I power an entire civilization for eternity? Because I consider a "person" to simply be an information process. If that information process runs on a silicon computer (or some furuistic-y replacement) instead of a mushy carbon one, I still consider it a person. Soooo, if that mind happens to run on a computer that ran on a bajillon (Totally Scientific ^{TM} ) Gigawatts, that would mean the virtual neuron I caused to fire would produce a massive amount of energy.

BAM, true immortality via the (literal) power of our feelings!
