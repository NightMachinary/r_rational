I think most rapists are actually people known to the victim, and it's believed they're usually motivated by power dynamics - putting someone in their place and all that - although it's certainly not /always/ the case.

It would certainly prevent /unwanted romantic attention/, from someone you don't like who won't stop hitting on you to someone who keeps trying to cop a feel. Assuming they're not trying to put on some sort of show to prove how libidinous they are to the crowd, which happens.
