Well yes, that's the point. You invent a percentage number and then I say "well that's 37% of rapes you could get out of by confusing your attacker by suddenly turning ugly." The exercise is intended to make you realise that a thing doesn't have to work in 100% of cases to be useful.

You're not betraying the party line by admitting that some people rape for power reasons reasons and other people rape because they want to fuck pretty people.
