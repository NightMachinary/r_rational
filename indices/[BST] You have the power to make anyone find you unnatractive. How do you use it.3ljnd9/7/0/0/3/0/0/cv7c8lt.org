It only has to work once anyway so I'm never going to say that in a situation of imminent rape you shouldn't try it, however I wonder if the shock of flipping their mind view of you could make you a more appealing target. It seems to depend on how rapists target but I could imagine if it was a power thing that something strange would be more desirable to control (or whatever).
