Okay. So first of all - I assume that by default the person is attractive, otherwise it's not a power, just an unfortunate situation.

Another point - if you can use this power on everybody around you all the time, that means you can be unattractive and suddenly become attractive.

Where switching between attractive/unattractive modes could be useful?

- Obvious one, you could prevent yourself from being raped.
- You could make people underestimate you, and when necessary - suddenly become attractive. (can't think of an example where it could be useful)
- Does unattractiveness work by magic feromones, or by changing your appearance? If it changes your appearance - you could have a great disguise, like a second body. For example you could commit a crime as an ugly person, and evade police as long as you want as an attractive one.

That's all I've got for now....
