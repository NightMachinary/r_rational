Rape is more about power than attraction. That's a fact. That being said, serial rapists who rape randomly, should, logically speaking, choose to rape attractive targets over unattractive targets. There has to be something about you that makes them want to rape you. I don't think any serial rapist wants to rape someone ugly. On /average/. People that commit rape do so for a variety of reasons, so it's hard to say that for every single rapist. But, in general, it seems logical to assume rapists would go for attractive vs. non-attractive. Especially if this power worked very well.
