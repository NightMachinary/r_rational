Could be a variant on "Plateau Eyes" in Niven's "A Gift From Earth". Basically, it was a psychic power that made people lose interest in you. They forgot you were there. This one is like a weaker version.

Niven came up with a kind of hokey superficially plausible mechanism for it, involving contracting the target's pupil triggering a conditioned response because when you are less interested in something your pupil contracts. The logic doesn't really work, but the character in the book who came up with it wasn't a scientist.

Anyway, it was purely line of sight. People had to see you to lose interest in you. That would be a cromulent mechanism for this.
