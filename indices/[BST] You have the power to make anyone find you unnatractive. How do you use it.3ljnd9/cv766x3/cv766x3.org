Assuming that it doesn't change your appearance in any way, and simply changes how people react to your appearance...

You could use it to:

- avoid unwanted social interaction

Aaand that's about it. I'm not making any assumptions about default appearance, only that this power just makes people find you less attractive than they normally would.

Being ugly doesn't affect the world in any real way, except one thing: it makes a lot of other people instinctively want to avoid interacting with you. If they're polite enough, there isn't even that much of a difference; and if you can do something really well, the respect they gain for you makes up for being unattractive, for a lot of people.

This means you can only exploit it if you /want/ to avoid social interaction with people.

However, this has applications.

See, if you do something annoying or infuriating, being ugly makes people react that much worse to you.

So what you can do is associate yourself with something or someone you dislike, but others don't; then, you can do mildly annoying and/or infuriating things to turn people against you, and them by extension.

You can use this to get out of being raped. You can use this to make people leave you alone.

You can even use this to attract attention, depending on how unattractive you can make yourself seem. Especially unattractive people draw attention to themselves.

Really, that's about it. That's all I got.
