I dunno. Doesn't Chrome come with its own Flash player embedded, or did they discontinue that...?

Anyway, yeah, I guess there's also two dimensions to this - one is rationality of gameplay, and the other is rationality of the narrative (if there is one). Agree on roguelikes, especially the traditional 'hard' ones (TOME, Stone Soup, Nethack, etc.). Most strategy games would qualify too, at least at some levels of difficulty. And of course puzzles, but that's kind of cheating - I especially enjoy the Zachtronics ones, recently.
