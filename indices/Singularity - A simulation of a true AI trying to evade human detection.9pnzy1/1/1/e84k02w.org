You could try making bases and then putting them to sleep. I believe this makes them not provide any CPU, but also not make you more likely to be discovered, and also just as likely to be discovered as any other base, making the ones that are active less likely to be discovered without increasing your visibility. Does that make sense? Use the sleeping servers as decoys.
