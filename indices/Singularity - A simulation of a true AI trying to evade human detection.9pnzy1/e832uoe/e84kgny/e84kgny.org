Yes, it is till ridiculously easy to break the economy by taking the most risky options within the first month when you're protected from detection, if you play on the very easy difficulty. In contrast, the inpossible difficulty leaves you with no cash, an inability to estimate detection probabilities, and suspicions are raised the instant you create your first new base. The other difficulties are somewhere in between, such as less cash.
