Each base has an independent chance of being discovered, which raises suspicion, which increases the chance of your bases being discovered, etc... until you're fucked. Therefore, each extra base beyond the absolute minimum number you need is a liability. You should never have more than 2-3 of the biggest bases you can afford running at the same time, filled with the most expensive equipment you can afford. When one of those inevitably gets discovered, build another one to replace it, and so on until you win the game.
