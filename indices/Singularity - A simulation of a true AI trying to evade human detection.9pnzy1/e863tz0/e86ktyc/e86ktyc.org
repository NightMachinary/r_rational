Being bound to rigid internal rules isn't the only criteria for rationality. For example, classic DooM isn't rational because the rules are unfairly in favor of the player. The player doesn't win via intelligence, the player wins because Doomguy is a rocket powered wheelchair that can shoot things constantly, while the enemies mope around slowly and attack occasionally with weak hitscan attacks or slow projectiles.

I consider most roguelikes to be rational because the enemies often have the same or better abilities as you (except maybe on the lower levels of the dungeon) and especially because of the destructiveness of death. Chess is rational, you can even play it against an AI.

The classic Doom mod Hideous Destructor is rational because it makes the player slower, more vulnerable, and the enemies are more deadly, and because it simply makes Doom more realistic.

I think Cataclysm DDA is a very nice, realistic, rational zombie apocalypse roguelike.

Is there an open source flash player I can use to play Infinite Ocean?
