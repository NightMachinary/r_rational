This actually reminds me that something we don't talk much about here and I'd be curious about is what you consider rational fiction in /games/. This certainly qualifies, but I'd say there are a few more examples - for example Plague Inc., Stellaris, or the beautiful [[http://www.jonas-kyratzes.net/games/the-infinite-ocean/][The Infinite Ocean]]. Any others? Or general criteria you'd apply (since to some extent, due to being bound to rigid internal rules, /all/ games are somewhat forced to be rational)?
