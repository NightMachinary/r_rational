It's like all the really unusual and nonstandard stories are all starting back up again!

It's good to have an update to this after so long. I restate that I enjoy how /both/ Lotus organizations exist and are very pervasive in the world, instead of the Reds just being made up several seasons later for a quick plot point. Still, there are a couple of issues that are tugging at my brain.

The entire last sequence (after the line break) seems rather... rushed? The pace was fairly slow and detailed all the way up to that point, then everything was just summed up rather quickly. I know that most people will only read it if they know the source material, but the entire flight of Aang and later his going into Avatar mode was just done very quickly. Aside from little descriptive detail, which I assume I just assumed that people will remember the show, this seems like a *very* important moment for our main character, who is still going through identity issues and trying to understand how the world works. I hope we get to see this perspective shift and his thoughts on it in the next update!

The "World is a Matrix" thing still irritates me. It seems to be a common thing in many Rat stories, but its particularly unusual in this one, especially given that the main character remembers the Avatar world from before he remembers 'normal' Earth. I rather hope that the Avatar world is itself not a simulation, but I guess I will have to wait and see.
