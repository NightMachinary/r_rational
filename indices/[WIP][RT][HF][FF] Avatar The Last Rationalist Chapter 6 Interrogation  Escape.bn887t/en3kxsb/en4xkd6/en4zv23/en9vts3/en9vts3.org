  Finally I hate the idea of the "world is a matrix" as well. Never did like how it meant nothing of consequence happened. This story isn't a matrix one or a parallel universe but something else.

IMO, it only means "nothing of consequence happened" if they eventually leave the simulation and it stops existing. I mean, I think most of us on this sub can agree that a sufficiently detailed and accurate simulation of a person IS a person. Worth the Candle seems to be firmly in the "very very likely to be a simulation" camp, but personally that doesn't make any of it seem pointless to me.

Not saying yours should be one or trying to convince you of anything, mind you, just putting in my two cents on the subject.
