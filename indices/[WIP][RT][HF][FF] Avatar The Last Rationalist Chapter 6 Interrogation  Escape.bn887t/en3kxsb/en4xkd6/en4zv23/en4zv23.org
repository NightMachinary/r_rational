Thanks for the feedback. You're right in that the last bit felt rushed. It felt rushed for me too. I'll revamp it at a later time. Thing is I just really wanted to get out of the South Pole because it has been six months or longer since I started the story and I was still stuck there. I'll come back to it soon and add more descriptive detail. Very slight spoilers ahead. Finally I hate the idea of the "world is a matrix" as well. Never did like how it meant nothing of consequence happened. This story isn't a matrix one or a parallel universe but something else. Thanks again.
