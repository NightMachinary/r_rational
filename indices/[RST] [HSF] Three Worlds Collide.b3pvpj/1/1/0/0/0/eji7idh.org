Might I suggest you branch out and read different fiction? What you're describing seems (to me) fairly old hat. The earliest I can think of from my own experience is Jalil from Everworld (the second series by the woman who wrote animorphs). But characters like that show up frequently in sci-fi and fantasy - you don't have to try to break the world to be an intelligent character. Raistlin, Ian Cormac, and pretty much anyone from Brandon Sanderson easily qualify.

Writing intelligent characters isn't novel. What made that book novel was the writing of a character with a working understanding of cognitive biases. It was interesting and I welcome more of it, but that's all I can really say.

I guess, given how common Harry Potter fanfics are, it makes sense for a person who wrote one of the better ones to get an internet fiefdom? But that doesn't make it any less silly.
