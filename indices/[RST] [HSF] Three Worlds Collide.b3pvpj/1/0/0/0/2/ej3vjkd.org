Imagine that assault, battery and threatening someone's life are all still highly illegal. Imagine on top of that that there is no special social taboo of any form attached to sex. Imagine that unwanted children and STDs aren't a thing. Imagine that psychology and psychiatry are highly advanced to the point where practitioners actually know exactly what they are doing and how to cure something without trial and error. Imagine that education is highly advanced as well, uses aforementioned advancements in psychology, and creates graduates that aren't only actually prepared for the adult job market and economy, but also for all the other perils that adult life in that age routinely throws at them.

Given all that I can imagine a world where consent is less important. And given a society that is both much more ethical (as in people actually follow and trust the local moral code), but also much more sheltered (in the story it seems that most characters never even saw accurate video depictions of the horrors of previous ages) I can imagine that the generation of that age equates the word "rape" with sex that lacks consent, devoid of all the horrific mental images that you or I would connect to it.

Of course I never was raped, never had a real life conversation about rape with someone who lived through it and don't even have people in my circle of friends and family of which I know that they were raped. So maybe I am wrong.
