  At the very least the bay area 'rationalists' prioritized

Maybe try painting with a less broad brush next time? I know a lot of people involved with rationalist groups and events in SF, and none of them have ever seen the behavior described in that twitter/reddit blowup last year.

It sounds like there's a single group/meetup/whatever populated by the people in question, and some random woman was unlucky enough to end up attending it.
