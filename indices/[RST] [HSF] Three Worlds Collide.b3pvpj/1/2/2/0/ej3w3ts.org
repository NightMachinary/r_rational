I am not saying that EY abused anyone. In fact I find the unfounded accusations [[/u/major_fox_pass]] throws around to be harmful and inexcusable. But I want to say that none of the things you say somehow make it impossible for EY or any other high status member of the Bay Area rational community to get away with sexual abuse without even tarnishing their reputation. All it would require is a careful selection of victims. And if Ozy is nowhere near said victims, their own history doesn't guarantee that they would always take the side of any accuser.
