I'd never heard this before, but I tend to think back on when Draco said he was going to rape Luna Lovegood at the beginning of HPMOR whenever TWC comes up.

I don't worship the ground the man walks on the way I feel some do, but man is that still discouraging.

Edit: I did some quick googling and couldn't find anything to verify your claims at all. Do you mind posting a source that Yudowsky was accused of anything?
