Following the edited comment's guidance, I was able to locate one particular individual reporting about what appears to be actual abuse done to them while within the LessWrong / EffectiveAltruism community (though not by EY himself), and this complaint also included unsourced claims of abuse performed by EY from 'two women who won't come forward', alongside a description of activity which, removing unconfirmed abusive elements (forced druggings, emotional manipulation -- currently heresay), merely sounds kinky. Barring firsthand accounts, at this time, I'm still chaulking things up as 'nothing to be acted upon with regards to public shaming'.
