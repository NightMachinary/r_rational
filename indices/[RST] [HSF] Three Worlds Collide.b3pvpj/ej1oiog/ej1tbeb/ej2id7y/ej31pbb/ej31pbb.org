I read all the posts on this page and spent about thirty minutes googling and reading, and I'm not super interested in trying to establish whether anyone definitely has been engaging in sexual abuse based on internet hearsay.

I am interested in whether we have consensus to the general atmosphere of the bay area rationalist community. Everything I've read with this conversation as a jumping point has consistently portrayed the bay area rationalist scene as toxic and unpleasent, and without any evidence to the contrary I am going to accept that opinion; it gels with my experience living in the bay and the 'rationalist' people I have met.
