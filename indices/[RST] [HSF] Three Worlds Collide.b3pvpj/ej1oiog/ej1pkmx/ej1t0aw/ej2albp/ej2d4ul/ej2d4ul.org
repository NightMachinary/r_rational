You're reading it differently to me. The claim “people there generally have a higher grade of ethics and are less likely to abuse things” implies to me that the society doesn't generally have an issue with sexual assault. That is, when the population is near-universally trustworthy (‘have a higher grade of ethics'), and the consequences of getting things wrong are minor, the protocols for opting in to sex might change with it.

An extreme example might be hugs; it is still not OK to hug someone if they say no, and the law will still protect you if this is violated, but there is no law specifically against nonconsentual hugging, no rule that makes it explicitly opt in in the way we rightly think we need sexual activities to be today. A sufficiently advanced (and alien) society could, with both unusual levels of trust and unusual levels of mental security, in theory, reduce the worries of society about sex in a similar way. It would not be that they consider it right or reasonable to force someone else to engage in sex, but that the topic becomes sufficiently low risk that our social and legal protocols seem unnecessary and inhibiting in the same way a nonconsensual hug law might seem to us.

That's my reading, anyway.

(FWIW my mind is pinging déjà vu on the hug analogy, so I might have stolen it.)
