the implication I think is that it's not illegal, but people *wouldn't do awful things* just because it's legal, they have higher moral standards *culturally*.

So imagine a society where consent is understood really well by everyone, and no one would intentionally harm other people.

In such a society, you could have temporary suspensions of self-sovereignty, much like in the BDSM community today.

That is, to people who understand power dynamics and consent really well, you can play at the boundaries of consent/control more readily, in ways some people find attractive.

When the character in the story talks about it, he references flirting with and leading on a woman, knowing that there is a risk she could bid for your sexual consent on a market and then force herself on you. This is a very nuanced scenario that implies a lot of things that are different in their society, it's not just "rape is legal."
