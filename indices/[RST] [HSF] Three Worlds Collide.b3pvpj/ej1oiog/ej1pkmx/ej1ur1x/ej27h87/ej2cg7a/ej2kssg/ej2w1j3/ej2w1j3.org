No. I was never arguing that it is impossible to imagine such a world. I'm sure both of us could crank out a half dozen in no time.

I hold the author accountable for his use of a term that, while it is certainly possible to construct a world that might have a legal framework condoning it, nevertheless creates a visceral impression in most readers that alienates his intended audience.

The author chose to take a weird stand for the sake of making a point that could have been conveyed in dozens of other ways. I thought the story, as a whole, was fine. It pretty much just took the themes from Speaker for the Dead and presented a new take on them (more ham-handed, but that's to be expected from short stories). But the story wont ever get widespread appeal due to a single foolish mistake by the author.
