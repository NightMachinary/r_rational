Pretty sure some people would want to make it illegal now... dunno, I guess I don't get how people could be /that/ disconnected from their past? We're almost all intimately familiar with the fact that people were burned to death for either arguing the finer points of Christian theology or just being suspected of being /witches/. It's sad, but not shocking. Where do you go from there? By comparison, knowing that something we now consider wrong but not illegal was punished is far less surprising.
