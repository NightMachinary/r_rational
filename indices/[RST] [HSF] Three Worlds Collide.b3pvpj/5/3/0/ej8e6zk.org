  The babyeaters don't eat their own individual babies. They eat other babyeaters' babies, while hoping their own go uneaten.

No, the whole point of the morality of it is that you are doing a noble sacrifice by eating your own babies - hence eating babies being good. It's made very clear in the story that t hey even love the children that they eat. I remember a quote along the line of "if someone was easier on their own children in the winnowing they would be shunned".
