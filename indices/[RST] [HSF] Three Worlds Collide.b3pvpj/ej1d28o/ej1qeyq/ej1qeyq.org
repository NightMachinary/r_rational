The babyeaters is based on real life insects. Back when people thought that evolution was still benign they made an experiment in which they locked insects in a cage and limited their food supply. The thought were that the insects themselves would reproduce less such that everyone would get food but instead they started eating the larva of the other insects. A little how chicks are accidentally breed to be aggressive instead of making more eggs.
