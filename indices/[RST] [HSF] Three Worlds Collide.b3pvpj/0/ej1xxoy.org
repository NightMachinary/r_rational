An interesting thought experiment.

I'm surprised that (beyond the "nonconsensual sex" discussion, and the fate of most of humanity in the Normal Ending), that more time wasn't given to the subject of choice.

That's what I found truly horrific about the baby-eaters: not that they ate their young, but that the young were old enough to comprehend that, and to choose not to die. Compare, say, the waiter from /The Restaurant at the End of the Universe/, which is a sentient being who /chooses/ to be eaten. Or any non-fictional animal raised to be part of the human diet, which can't really comprehend how and why its life is scheduled to end.

Had the offer to humanity been subject to individual choice, if people could have chosen to join with the Super-happies, rather than having been forced into it willy-nilly, the Normal Ending wouldn't have been nearly so bad.

Maybe that's why the rape conversation is in there? Deliberately, as an indication that humanity doesn't value an individual's choice so much any more? If that's the case, I see why humanity wouldn't present it as a counteroffer, but not why it's not a more common topic in the comments.
