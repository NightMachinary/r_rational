I think rape was chosen because yudkowsky is both engaged in non-standard plural relationships and he lives in the Bay Area, an area wherein my experience there is a very vibrant culture of sexual exploration; considering the amount of theory he pumps into his fictional writing I assumed he was explicitly aware of conversations about rape outside of the context in which it is generally understood.
