  "not illegal" is not the same as "acceptable".

Hm, yes, but would it be then /shocking/ to hear that something that you consider unacceptable while not illegal used to be? You could relate to the thinking, even if you thought it'd be a bit excessive. Like I can understand why you'd want to make certain speech illegal even if I think that freedom of speech as a general principle is more important.
