I reject your false dichotomy.

The salem witch trials were relatively recently in our civilization's history. How many people today are aware of the various specific laws and atrocities committed by, say, the early Nile cultures? Being ignorant of that doesn't make you an idiot, or ignorant on the level of someone who doesn't know about the witch trials.
