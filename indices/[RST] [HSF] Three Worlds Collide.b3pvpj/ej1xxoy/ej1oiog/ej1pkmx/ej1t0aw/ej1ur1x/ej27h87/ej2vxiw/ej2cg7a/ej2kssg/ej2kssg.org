"but if you were to see the story set in this [other] world, you would see that it develops out of a much more organic thing in which, say, dueling, theft, non-consensual sex, all of these things are governed by tradition rather by than by law and they certainly aren't prohibited outright." - author

Separately: Imagine a world where civil court had no barriers to entry, and no barriers preventing collection of judgments; where transgressions by one party against another were always resolved swiftly and accurately. The nature of "markets" and "contracts" in this story strongly suggest such a world. In such a world, many things that are crimes in our society could be torts instead.
