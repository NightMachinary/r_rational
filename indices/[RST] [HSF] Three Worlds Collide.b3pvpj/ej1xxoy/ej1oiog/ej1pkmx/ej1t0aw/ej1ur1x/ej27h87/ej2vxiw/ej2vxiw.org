  The Confessor held up a hand. ''I /mean/ it, my lord Akon. It is not polite idealism. We ancients /can't/ steer. We remember too much disaster. We're too /cautious/ to dare the bold path forward. Do you know there was a time when nonconsensual sex was illegal?''

  Akon wasn't sure whether to smile or grimace. ''The Prohibition, right? During the first century pre-Net? I expect everyone was glad to have /that/ law taken off the books. I can't imagine how boring your sex lives must have been up until then -- flirting with a woman, teasing her, leading her on, /knowing/ the whole time that you were perfectly safe because she /couldn't/ take matters into her own hands if you went a little too far -''

  ''You need a history refresher, my Lord Administrator. At some suitably abstract level. What I'm trying to tell you -- and this is /not/ public knowledge -- is that we nearly tried to overthrow your government.''

  /''What?''/ said Akon. ''The /Confessors?/''

  ''No, /us./ The ones who remembered the ancient world. Back then we still had our hands on a large share of the capital and tremendous influence in the grant committees. When our children legalized rape, we thought that the Future had gone wrong.''

  Akon's mouth hung open. ''You were /that/ prude?''
