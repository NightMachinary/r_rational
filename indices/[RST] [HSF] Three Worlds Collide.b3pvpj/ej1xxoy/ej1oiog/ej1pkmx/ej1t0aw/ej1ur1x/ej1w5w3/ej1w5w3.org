While that might not be what the author intended, I thought it worked quite well when one simply assumes that it's not moral (in our sense). The effect is that it's not our morals vs two other alien morals, but actually three alien moral systems. It drives home the point that there are no objective moral values, which is why we need to protect our set of values lest they be superseded by another one, which might for example allow rape.
