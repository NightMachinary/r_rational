What the fuck. I had always assumed the whole point of the decision was to show the future society was equally alien to us, three alien worlds colliding instead of our world and two others (after writing this I realize other people have already said the same better).

Is EY actually saying rape being equivalent to other types of mild violence is "more ethical", or am I really misinterpreting this?
