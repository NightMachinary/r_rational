The story starts out kinda silly and not that well written. It starts getting much better after chapter 10.

As for the novel things it does, it has intelligent characters that genuinely think and act in intelligent ways instead of being the standard idiot spock nerd who tries to be cold and unemotional, makes wildly uncalibrated predictions with way too many significant digits, always knows exactly what the plot requires him to know and can spout technobabble that doesnt make any sense. The standard idiot spock nerd is the archetype of intelligence in almost all fiction, and he isnt at all relatable to real life nerdy intellectuals. But in HPMOR, a genuinely intelligent intellectual character is the hero of the story, where in conventional tales the closest analogue of him would almost always be the sidekick or the villain, and those sidekicks or villains generally do not pass the ideological turning test.

That is a large part of what was so novel about HPMOR.
