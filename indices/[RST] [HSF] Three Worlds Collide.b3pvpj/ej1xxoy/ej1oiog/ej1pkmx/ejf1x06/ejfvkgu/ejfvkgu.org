I'd like you to reread your middle paragraph, but imagine it's being said by another person trying to convince you of (for example) the healing power of crystals.

I think the cultish feeling is more insidious than you think. It comes in part from the thought that somehow the great harry-potter-fanfic-writer is giving deep knowledge. I don't get it. It a poorly written fanfic that displays a surface-level understanding of cognitive biases and heuristics. I'm perhaps biased (I work in psychological research), but I didn't think there was much that really seemed all too novel other than the combination of the concepts with a fictional world.

I can't help but feel that if my mentality were more common, then this community wouldn't feel so cultish. "Writing utilitarian characters with a modern understanding of cognitive function is a nifty trend, and I'm happy to read those stories. Like all fiction, it influences those who read it - and that's probably a net benefit to both the readers and society at large." Why is that so hard?
