I think I agree with you. I think the rape reoccurance is most likely a weakness with regards to writing, versus any sort of morality Yud may or may not possess (especially as I don't view interests in BDSM/polyamory as moral failings.)

I made an instant, gut reaction when I saw the accusation of accusations. I did my googling to try and have a more reasoned response, though. Thank you for the response and new information.
