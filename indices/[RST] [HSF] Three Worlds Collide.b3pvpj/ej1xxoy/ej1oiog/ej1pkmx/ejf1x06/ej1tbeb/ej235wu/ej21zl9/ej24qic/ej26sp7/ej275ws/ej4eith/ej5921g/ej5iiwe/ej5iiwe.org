I should reign in my discourse, this subject gas been curdling in my stomach all day, and I typed that up while taking a break from building ductwork, I apologise for not qualifying my statements.

I may have been assuming? That this was the Meetup eliezer attends, because the BDSM stuff meshes with what we know of him. In that case it wouldn't be a single meet up, it would be the Meetup attended by the father of the LessWrong community, which is significant.

Beyond that she was not some random woman, and neither are the other people who've attached their identities to these claims, they are individuals with a documented long history of interaction with the ratio alist, LW, and EA communities, who have experiences spanning years with these individuals and communities.

For my part, I find your usage of 'some random woman' to be infuriating and offensive, but it's not clear to me whether that is pushback against you or actually indicative of a problem.
