BDSM is fine, for several years I had an open relationship with a gal who worked in a dungeon.

But if I started a book group and people complained that me and my buddies shouldn't have women on leashes while we debate, well, I'd decide that wasn't the proper venue.

Edit: or i'd change the name to 'pretentious Dom/silent sub book club.'

At the very least the bay area 'rationalists' prioritized their kink practice over an environment that facilitated free and comfortable discourse. What is actually described is much less pleasent.
