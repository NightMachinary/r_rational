@AHaskins, yeah it's that story. Frankly I think EY would have been more advised to extrapolate from moral values that human beings have currently to predict where they might lead, rather than just going for the shock value of RAPE. He is a smart and creative guy, he could have picked consensual incest or something. But I suspect he ended up going the route he did because he was only trying to appeal to a narrow range of readers who would already be likely to agree with him on such a thing, and it was THEM he was trying to shock, not a broader and less ethically wise audience. And I also suspect that things like this are what contributes a lot to why rationalists aren't as well respected as they could be and why there are so few rationalists. Besides TWC, the main alternative route for getting someone interested in rationality is HPMOR, which is freaking long and not at all friendly to non-technical audiences. In other words, HPMOR is written as if it assumes that its audience already has some measure of rationality skills from the moment they start reading it--the very same sort of skills that it is meant to help teach!

And don't get me started on rationalists' deep-seated irrational fear of being seen as cultish if they try to effectively teach their REAL, GENUINELY USEFUL SKILLS to the larger public. You know what makes people look cultish? Isolating themselves from the rest of society in a community of hermit gurus. The fact that in this case the gurus' wisdom is actually CORRECT doesn't matter because they're hoarding their wisdom to themselves, hiding it behind mountains of opaque, jargon-filled text where no outsider will be able to reach it and understand it. And if outsiders do not know what one's wisdom entails, then it could be harmful gibberish for all they know. How are they to know, when the one is hiding their wisdom?

And even if I say this, I doubt most rationalists will actually listen to me and understand. If I say "Presentation is important dammit! How other human beings perceive you matters dammit!" they will likely hear "we should focus on improving our self image at the expense of perfect blunt honesty and accuracy of what we say." NO. NO NO NO. That is not what I'm saying. But unfortunately, inferential distances don't just apply to mere epistemology but to skills in general, and there is a big inferential distance to cross to get rationalists to not only communicate effectively with outsiders, but to actually know why it is important to do so and to care about how outsiders think and feel about them and their work.

It's infuriatingly frustrating as all hell, and the legalization of rape thing in TWC is just a symptom of this whole mess.
