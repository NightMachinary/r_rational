Wait - isn't this the great story that (halfway through) decided to destroy any ability for me to recommend it to friends by having an ill-advised reference to the legality of rape?

"What? I can't believe there was ever a world where rape was illegal."

And yeah, I get that it has a thematic purpose - and you can construct a hypothetical chain of reasoning that makes it a rational idea assuming the right technological environment. But it was so entirely out of place that it ruined the story for me. And more importantly, the concept's inclusion made the story impossible to recommend.
