I'm surprised the "destroy the sun" ending is considered the True or Good ending. The story sets up that humanity broadly believes in utilitarian principles (the rationality community's "shut up an multiply" is said by a few characters) and considers the plight of the babyeaters to be of moral concern, with babyeater children compared to human children in moral value. So the calculus looks like:

- 10 billion humans die + humans continue to have the capacity to suffer + babyeater children continue to suffer, BUT humanity remains human and able to determine their own destiny or evolution
- VS:
- Every babyeater, human and superhappy is modified into a morally superior (from both human and superhappy perspective) form, and suffering is eliminated

It's not clear to me that the superhappy manner of existence is any worse than ours. They still clearly have science - they have spaceships after all. In fact their commitment to truth is stronger than the future humans of the story: humanity had to lie to themselves about a physical constant of the universe to avoid people maliciously causing supernovas - both superhappies and babyeaters have biology or cultures that eliminated that possibility. As a rationalist concerned with the truth of the universe, I would think any modifications to humanity that increased our capacity to seek truth would be a /good/ thing.

Plus, in the True Ending, the Confessor/Kiritsugu mentions that he had fetal alcohol syndrome and was a murderer before being saved and "fixed." It's possible that all the improvements to him were made with his consent, but the way he talks about it I have my doubts. So future humanity is clearly okay with modifying an individual, possibly against their will, in order to improve life for the individual. If that's the case, they should have no objections when they are the defective individuals with the equivalent of Fetal Alcohol Sydrom that are being rescued.
