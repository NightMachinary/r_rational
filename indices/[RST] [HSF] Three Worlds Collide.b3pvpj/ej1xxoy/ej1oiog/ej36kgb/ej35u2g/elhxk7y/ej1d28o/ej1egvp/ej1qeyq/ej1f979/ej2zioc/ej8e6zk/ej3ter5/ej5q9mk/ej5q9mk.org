...well, yes. That is the point: humans are actually decent at switching away from suboptimal Nash equilibria (in the Pareto sense). This, however, is a fact about humans, not about economics in general, and it is perfectly coherent to imagine a civilization with minds structured differently.

(Also, when I say humans are "decent" at switching away from suboptimal Nash equilibria, what I really mean is that they /occasionally/ manage it. In the vast majority of cases, humans get stuck in suboptimal Nash equilibria just like economics predicts they should--which is why pretty much all existing institutions are dominated by perverse incentives.)
