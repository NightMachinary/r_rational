While I agree with your conclusion, your last paragraph makes little sense. Non baby-eater groups would rapidly expand and outgrow the baby-eaters whereas celibate humans wouldn't for obvious reasons.

The real argument is that non baby-eaters would be ravished by famine. By the time technology can feed an insane rate of expansion, the culture and society grown from seeing non baby-eating groups bring death and devastation to their societies will have made everyone too resistant.
