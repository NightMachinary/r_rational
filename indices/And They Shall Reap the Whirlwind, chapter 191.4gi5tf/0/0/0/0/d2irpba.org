I just decided to stop posting it here since [[/r/rational]] isn't that interested in alternate history, or maybe this one is somehow poor quality.

Anyway, it only recently got zero votes or below. I suspect a few users here decided that they actively don't like that kind of stuff.

OK.

I'll submit other content that I think that people will like here.
