I think over-saturation is also a culprit. I'm quite sure if you were to post after a few chapters have accumulated, you'd get a better reception.

I, for one, am happy to be informed of new fiction and don't mind being reminded every now and then that new chapters have come out, but posting the same story every few days can be a tiny bit annoying.
