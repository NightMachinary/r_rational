Both of Magneto's children are over-powered. To the point where both of them break the setting entirely.

Quicksilver is actually much weaker than his sister Scarlet Witch. Who has the ability to control probability, in such a way that it is always beneficial to her. Even if she doesn't consciously think about how to make it beneficial. She can make this effect even more powerful by concentrating, to the point where she can even use it to resurrect the dead by making it unlikely that they're dead.

Never mind the fact that she re-wrote all of reality to her whims one time. Yes, really.
