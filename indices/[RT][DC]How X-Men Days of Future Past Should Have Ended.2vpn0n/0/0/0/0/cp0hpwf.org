While this isn't true for the comics, what I'd write as a balancing act would be that while their reflexes (kinesthetic ability) keeps up with their speeds, the rest of their aptitude is only above average for humans and only occurs slightly faster than a normal human being at an average time scale - or, they'd have to acknowledge that logical flaw eventually.
