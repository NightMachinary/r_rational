Also, some collected photos from my recent trip to the east - this time, it wasn't for work, my husband took me on a "surprise" trip for our anniversary (I knew about the trip, but he didn't tell me where we were going). We saw [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_Rock][Wave Rock]], which is one of our major tourist attractions, though it IS kind of in the middle of nowhere. Lesser known, we saw [[http://museum.wa.gov.au/research/records-supplements/records/mulkas-cave-aboriginal-rock-art-site-its-context-and-content][Mulka's Cave]], which has aboriginal art (hand prints) and was honestly a far cooler experience because I have seen lots of cool rocks but I've never seen /ancient cave art/ before!
