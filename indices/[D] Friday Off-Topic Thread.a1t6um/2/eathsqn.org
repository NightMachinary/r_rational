I don't know /how/ I got there, but I ended up reading a few articles about the Catholic tradition of praying the rosary. I knew about it in broad strokes - you recite sets of prayers for 15 minutes to an hour, depending on how hard core you are being - and for each prayer, there's a "mystery" you're meant to contemplate (basically, parts of the Jesus story), which are grouped into thematic groups.

When I was reading it, something woke inside me. Not in a "I am saved" way, but in a, "I was raised Catholic and thus have a cultural connection to this practise, and it reminds me of my unsuccessful attempts to meditate" - and I had a quick look around the internet and it seems there's no real attempts at making the rosary habit secular the same way the buddhist meditation traditions are secular. Not that I'm sure that even if I did rosary practise instead of meditation practise it would have gone better - maybe it would have, as reciting the words might have stopped my mind wandering? idk.

I don't really know what I want to say here: I was half-expecting an atheist blog circa 2009 having a secular rosary that included 20 "mysteries" like "Charles Darwin looking at finches" and "Neil Degrasse Tyson pwning noobs on twitter", which is totally not what I'm really wanting. Probably "mysteries" more on the line of, "what made me happy today", "who needs my help?", "what should i try and do better", "was i wrong about anything today?" - you know, kind of useful, generic, gratitude journal/self-help stuff. And I'm not even sure I really want it. Or would use it. Or would benefit from it.

But damnit I kind of want to pray through a whole damn rosary just for fun even though I know one hail mary in I'll be feeling super embarrassed even if I'm doing it alone and silently, not to mention bored. And like, what would even be the point? It's just a kind of interesting tradition that I never partook in.

Plus, I'm a person who doesn't participate in the group "ohm" at my yoga class because its origins are as a worship word and that makes me uncomfortable - and here I am wondering if I should spend an hour praying in a language I know from a tradition I'm familiar with?!

Anyway, hopefully by writing it out, it's out of my head and onto the page, and I'll never have to think of it again.
