What precisely are you trying to achieve by saying they should just get over their mental illness? They either falsely believe they have a mental illness, in which case your comment comes off as extremely rude and dismissive, or they correctly believe they have a mental illness, in which case your comment comes off as extremely rude and dismissive.

I understand the point that I think you're making, that self diagnosis is a method of glorifying mental illness because it's currently trendy, and that self diagnosis should be at most a heurstic in lieu of an actual medical diagnosis, but you're going about this in just about the worst way conceivable.

If you want to feel better about yourself or something, you can be absolutely, 100% correct about something and still be an asshole because of the way you treat people on the way to making your point. Whether or not you're actually correct is honestly a separate thing to argue about, although you certainly won't look any better if you aren't correct.
