How do you know that it's the only way, or that what you are doing is working at all? Being extremely rude during a debate is very likely to have people dismiss everything you say, regardless of validity, because of your attitude. This honestly comes off more as you getting catharsis from yelling at people on subjects you're angry about, and then justifying it as the only effective debate tactic.
