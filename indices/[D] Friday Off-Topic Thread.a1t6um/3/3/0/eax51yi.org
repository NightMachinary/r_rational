The Gilets Jaunes (Yellow Vests, for the vests that you wear on the road that every single French driver is required to have in their car) is a protest movement, that began with a petition posted in May 2018, but really gained visibility with country-wide protests on November 17, two weeks ago.

The protests are ostensibly in reaction to the planned raised in gas taxes, which itself was a campaign promise of most 2017 presidential candidates, and is required by European accords on CO2 emissions, but everyone agrees that it's mostly a "straw that broke the camel's back" thing. The protests rally thousands of people, especially from the countryside, who are in dire economic situations and feel that the government is letting them rot to line the pockets of the super-rich. The protest is essentially motivated by the same factors that got Trump elected, if I'm being uncharitable (and I am, screw these people).

Part of the problem is Emmanuel Macron's actions and reforms have given him a strong identity, for some people, as the champion of the super-rich establishment, and as an elitist proto-king that thinks himself above the lower classes. Some of these actions include:

- Replacing the ISF by the ISI, both of which are wealth taxes, which is often described by the opposition as "removing the ISF", because why be accurate when you can slander politicians you don't like?

- Telling an unemployed young man that he should try to work in a restaurant (the guy had a horticulture diploma), saying "There's a lot of demand, I could cross the street and find you a job", which was about as well-received by the public as you'd expect.

- The Benalla case, where a cabinet aide tasked with logistical planning for Presidential events was accused of getting undeserved privileges, including the right to bear a weapon, highest-level access to the National Assembly, a police car and uniform, a diplomatic passport and a 300mÂ² apartment (personally, I think the affair was way overblown, many of the claims made against him turned out to be false or made without understanding of presidential organization, and the actual violations were either minor or bureaucratic in nature). During the scandal, Macron made a semi-private speech where he denounced the "republic of fuses" (as in, patsies), and said "I'm the only responsible, let them fetch me!", which was taken as an insult and a mockery given the constitutionally unassailable nature of the president.

- Various other tax increases, I'm not going to go over them all.

- Also, he was elected with a fairly narrow First-Turn margin: 24% against Marine Le Pen's 20% (for comparison, Hollande had 28% to Sarkozy's 27% and Le Pen's 17% on the First Turn), which means a lot of people feel he was elected by default.

The protests last week-end were mostly peaceful, with Macron making a speech where he said he wouldn't "confuse the vandals with the legitimately angry people", and promising the organization of an open dialogue for three months between delegates of the Gilets Jaunes and regional and national administrations.

The dialogue has been unsuccessful so far, because the decentralized nature of the movement, and it being built on a distrust of authorities, means that the Gilets Jaunes have been unable to agree on representatives, and the people who did designate themselves as representatives received threats and ultimately didn't show up.

This week-end's protests were worse, with a severe country-wide increase in vandalism, thefts and violence, despite better police preparation. Also, people were pissed that Macron went to the G20 in Argentina instead of staying in France, because who cares about international politics anyway? It's not like taking care of these is the job of the president or anything.

--------------

Anyway, my personal takeaway is that, while I'm sympathetic to the protestors' plight, their movement represents everything awful about the opposition to Macron; most of the protestors seem to think that a second French Revolution will somehow fix all the economic problems the country is in right now, that the President should somehow negotiate with them without them ever designating a representative (because presidents /love/ basing their economic decisions on chats with angry mobs!), and that Macron will always be a corrupt autocrat no matter what he does or says, even when he gives them attention, legitimacy and consulting power beyond what any other president before him would have done.

tl;dr: Everything about this is awful, and this situation represents the most destructive, toxic, intellectually dishonest aspects of national politics. I kinda get what alexanderwales was pissed about now.

Yeah, French politics piss me off now.
