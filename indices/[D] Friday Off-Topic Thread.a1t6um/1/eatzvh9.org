Just want to throw this into the void: I wish English had a formal gender neutral noun for people. I wish I didn't have to guess the gender of someone to be polite by calling them sir/ma'am, or to even refer to him or her without calling them "it" which implies non-person to me.

I haven't been corrected on my guesses yet, but I do realize the people I guess wrong on are likely to have many others guess incorrectly also which is depressing.
