Maybe try to emulate the things you think are valuable about praying a rosary without doing the any of the mystical parts that you don't believe to be as significant. I've often heard writing a journal every day is a good chance for self reflection, and can provide a useful log of things happening in your life that you might want to look at later in life. The thought processes of meditation don't necessarily need to be accompanied by mysticism or special poses, it could just be a few minutes you set aside every day to think over a list of topics you want to cover, and writing those out is a fairly simple extension that allows you to also write about more mundane things going on in your life.

Alternatively, you could emulate the yoga tradition more, and spend half an hour on a treadmill doing the self reflection thing. Good for your body similar to yoga, a good habit to get in even divorced from any self reflection, and the rhythm might aid in the meditation portion.
