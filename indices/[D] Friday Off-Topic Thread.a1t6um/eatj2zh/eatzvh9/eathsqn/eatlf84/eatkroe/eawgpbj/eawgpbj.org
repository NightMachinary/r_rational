  Probably "mysteries" more on the line of, "what made me happy today", "who needs my help?", "what should i try and do better", "was i wrong about anything today?" - you know, kind of useful, generic, gratitude journal/self-help stuff. And I'm not even sure I really want it. Or would use it. Or would benefit from it.

Don't pray/mediate on stuff like that!

Meditation (or at least the way I do it) is meant to help with working through personal issues. Think about what sort of pressing stuff you have to do, your goals and dreams for the future, or something that you find very easy to spend a lot of time thinking about without making much progress.

For example, I found deciding on a new job to be stressful, so I meditated on what I was looking for and how I wanted to do it.

People seem to think that meditation has to be used for deep and profound things like philosophy or spirituality. But meditation is a tool to help you work through personal issues and mental tangles.

I find meditation works best with a dash of self-centeredness.
