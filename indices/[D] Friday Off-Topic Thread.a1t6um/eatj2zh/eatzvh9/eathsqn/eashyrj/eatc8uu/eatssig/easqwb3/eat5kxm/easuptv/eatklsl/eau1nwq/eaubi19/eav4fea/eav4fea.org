First of all, thank you for this non-judgmental comment! I don't mind sharing at all.

The first incident was when a buddy of mine started taking really dubious pills to increase his height. He wouldn't listen to family or other friends, even when literally everyone was against him taking the pills. He was completely fooled by the quack who sold him the pills (350$ for a month's dose) who had successfully convinced him that people who were telling him to stop were out to get him. Once I found out though, I started taking cheap potshots at the lack of the pill's effectiveness and how he might as well pay me 350$ for nothing. It was basically a constant bombardment from my side every single time we hung out. And after a few weeks it worked!! Although he told only me that he'd stopped and he was too embarrassed to admit it to anyone else.

The second one, I can't fully call a success although being rude to the person (self-diagnosed ADHD, taking pills) and making the MLM comparison in my parent comment got him to really open his eyes for a minute. I could see him processing the thought, 'Wait a minute, I think he's right'. I still remember the look on his face when he stopped for about 3 seconds after making the connection to MLM. Unfortunately, he blocked the thought out I guess and isn't willing to accept that he doesn't have ADHD. Also this only worked because a mutual friend got hamstrung really badly by an Amway like company and she still continues to peddle their product. I will continue trying and probably use rudeness+humor to pry him loose.

I'm not surprised that people find this behavior assholic and I'm actually glad they perceive it that way. It always invigorates me to take up a position not commonly held.
