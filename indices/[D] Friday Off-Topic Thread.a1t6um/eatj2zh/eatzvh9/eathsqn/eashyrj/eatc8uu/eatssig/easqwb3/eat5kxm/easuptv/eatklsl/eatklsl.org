Just let people be and spend less time with people that annoy you. You can be rude to them sure, but that's just detrimental to yourself. Just be chill, nod and hmm when they say things you feel are incorrect.

You can't really argue with religious people. This is a similar thing, it's a belief, if it's accurate or not I can't tell, but you're very unlikely to change their beliefs by arguing with them, and even less likely by being blunt / rude.
