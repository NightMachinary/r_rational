I don't know how I've gone all these years without knowing this. I was super into the Matrix movies when I was 13/14, and I've been aware of the existence of the band Röyksopp for at least 6 years (never listened to a full album of theirs until last night, but had a few of their songs on rotation on my iPod at various points over the last few years).

Y'know how Don Davis did the music for the first Matrix, and then for the sequels they switched it up and the music was made by Don Davis and Juno Reactor in collaboration? Juno Reactor's job was originally offered to Röyksopp. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmatItacEvM&list=PLG5oQ5ad8TJlY0uIyjEsYN6IhNJ1eJYuG&index=1][They'd only released their first album at that point]], so the sound of that album has to have been what the Wachowskis originally wanted to go for with the score of those movies. It's a strikingly different sound than the videogameish club music sound that ended up in the final soundtrack.

So, I'm wondering if anyone thinks their impressions of the Matrix sequels might've been different if the score had sounded more surreal with Don Davis / Röyksopp instead of sounding like a dance club with Don Davis / Juno Reactor.
