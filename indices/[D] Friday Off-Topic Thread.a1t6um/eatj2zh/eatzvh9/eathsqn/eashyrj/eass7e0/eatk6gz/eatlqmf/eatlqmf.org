I mostly expected the government to ignore the protests and to write them off as civil trouble (and so did the protesters), and I was pretty damn surprised when the president explicitly addressed them, and announced a 3-months period of public debate. More evidence for Macron being awesome, I guess.

Overall, I agree that there's a part of the population who will just hate Macron as a representation of the system, and will find evil subterfuges in anything he does, and giving these types of people an inch is definitely never a good idea.

On the other hand, I have a lot of hope for the planned consultations with the Gilets Jaunes. Some of the few dialogues they've had with the government so far were described as "productive", and including popular feedback in political processes is definitely something I want to see more of, especially if it tries to leverage modern communication technologies.
