Something similar happened in brazil this year. Truck drivers blocked every road and interstate because they didn't like fuel prices. The government just waited them out while people in the interior went without gas and fuel, in the end the protesters gave up.

​

Here it wasn't a tax increase people were angry at though, just the free market and high inflation, they wanted the government to subsidize fuel to make it cheaper.

​

If I was the french gov I'd just let them burn themselves out. It's either that or increasing salaries, inflation and damaging the euro, which seems unlikely to happen because of the protest. It should happen, but if they do it as an answer to the protest people will begin to exploit it, which is a bad idea for the gov.
