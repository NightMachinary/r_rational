In my experience, being (successfully) nice to people prevents them from raising their mental defenses. I've also seen a lot of cult-like behaviour geared around "If people are telling you you're wrong, then they're manipulating you" (like Trumps calls of 'Fake News'), which means that being (unsuccessfully) rude to them will entrench them further into their belief.

I don't know of any studies exploring different approaches, and only have anecdotal evidence (which is certainly biased). One such: I was having a discussion with someone on this sub earlier where we disagreed on whether to respect someone who we know nothing about other than that they identified with an idea/cause/movement. The KKK came up, and I doubted to myself whether I would treat them with respect. Then I saw someone [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORp3q1Oaezw][do exactly that]] to great success. In this scenario, there's little doubt that if he attempted to be rude then he would've failed spectacularly.

I am really interested if you know evidence supporting rudeness as an effective tactic since within my bubble I'll be unlikely to see it pop up. You mentioned it working for you; was that you being rude to someone else, or someone being rude to you? I'd like to know more about these situations if you are willing to share, so I can make informed opinions.
