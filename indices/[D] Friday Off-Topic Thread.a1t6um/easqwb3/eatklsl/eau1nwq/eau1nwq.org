Yeah, I wish I could disengage, but some people in your circle you just cannot. Also it is possible to get people to change their beliefs by being rude to them. It's probably the first time that someone's told them something that doesn't confirm their existing beliefs. I can actually confirm that it's worked for me at least twice.
