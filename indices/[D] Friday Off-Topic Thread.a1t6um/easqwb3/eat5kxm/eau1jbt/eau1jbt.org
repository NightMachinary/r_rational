I honestly don't give a shit how I look making a point. Rudeness gets to people when nothing else does. My problem is not that people perceive me as an asshole, I can confirm that myself. My problem is that people refuse to see the truth and the only way I can get them to do that is by being rude. If that makes me an asshole, then so be it.
