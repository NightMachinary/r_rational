That's criminal. You should watch it, [[https://www.nbc.com/house][apparently every episode is free to watch on NBC's website]].

Sure, House himself is exactly what Yudkowsky describes as a Hollywood genius who operates "by magically finding the right clues and carrying out magically correct complicated chains of deduction," but the characters and the drama are worth watching it for. Especially season 3 and onward, once the show got popular enough that Fox let them do their show without meddling and insisting on having a "bad guy / antagonist" every season.
