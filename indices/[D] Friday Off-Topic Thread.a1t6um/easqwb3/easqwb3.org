Here's what people trapped peddling MLM and people who self-diagnose mental conditions have in common. They don't listen to *anyone.* They're unbelievably entrenched in the idea that there's a conspiracy against them and that everyone else should just accept their worldview ('Oh, if only mental illness was accepted; everyone has them anyway!!'). Both express cult-like behavior. God save me if I point this out to someone who has (self-diagnosed) ADHD. God save me when I tell someone to just get over it. Or to stop making excuses. Apparently all this is considered trite and I'm being an asshole. Sorry but it looks to me like you're subscribing to cult-like mentality.
