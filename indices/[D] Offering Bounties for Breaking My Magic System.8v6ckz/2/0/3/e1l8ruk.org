The way I would fix this problem is to make it the holy grail of warfare that scientists think should be possible in principle, but haven't found a suitable animal due to the large difference in genes and size between people and bugs. This would make functional venom glands hard to replicate to a level of precision that actually works, with most attempts resulting in the venom leaking into the mage's bloodstream before the injection mechanism forms, with unpredictable variance in the effects. If it's ever done, it'd be difficult to replicate.
