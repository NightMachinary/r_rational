I'm confused about the mana cost of Energy Burst, is it supposed to be arbitrary? Because that wording makes it sound like putting in 1.2 joules of energy could cost 5 billion MP, putting in 1.21 could cost a few MP and putting in enough energy to create black hole could cost 73 MP (74 on Mondays!).
