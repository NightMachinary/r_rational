No.

E: Apologies for being blunt here, but it's costly to reply to things like this. This post is much more "fanciful R.A.W. munchkinry" than what I am trying to incentivize. My intention, and why I've spent so much time answering/reanswering questions, is for people to try and reason from the information I've given to understand what the magic system is "supposed" to be doing and how it's "supposed" to work, as I intend it and not necessarily as the words I've written might imply on a strict reading. From there, I am happy to award bounties if people give me useful/fun ideas or point out setting-breaking issues.
