Well my main objection is that chemical/thermal energy is a tiny tiny fraction of the mass-energy of an object (for everyday objects). So that means creating a super heated plasma (or high explosive, but there's issues with tech level and this only applies to prismatic mages) requires just about as much MP as a normal form. So if you can create normal everyday objects then you are also a one-mage fusion reactor and possessor of incredible destructive power. That's why I was tempted to just say special/general relativity (and therefore E=mc^{2)} isn't a thing in-universe and just making mass a separate cost (but then there were other issues).
