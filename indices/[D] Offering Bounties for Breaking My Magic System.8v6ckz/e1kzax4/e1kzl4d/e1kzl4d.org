  The user concentrates on a form, and then charges and releases a burst of energy which fills that form. The energy can be in whatever form the user imagines (with restrictions on color of magic used; blue=water/ice-based, red=fire-based, green=electric, air, or nature-based, prismatic=no restriction). The energy released (heat change or kinetic energy imparted in terms of Joules) *is limited to 100J change in physical energy per MP spent*. The forms created in this manner are temporary; the ability is not known to create permanent objects.
