I know you are no longer rewarding points about transformation but I have some questions about how you are modeling the effect from a nurobialogical level.

I am assuming it is intended for the brain to at least vaguely cross over after a transition, IE they keep memories, habits, and skills. I also assume that you intend for things to change from one not-elf to mouse or most other biological transformations as long as you have the mana.

I am wondering how you keep the complexity of a sientinent brain working when condensed at such small levels. Human brains are already very efficient and without offloading the processing I don't know how a mouse can run human software. I am also worried about how it is even paserving the very complex patterns that make up memories.

I know you had a disclaimer about size working in weird ways, but I have fiddled with scientific transformations and have been unable to find a method I liked. So if you have found an eligant solution I would like to hear it. Ps: this was a lot longer then I ment it and was typed on my phone so please ignore the typos.
