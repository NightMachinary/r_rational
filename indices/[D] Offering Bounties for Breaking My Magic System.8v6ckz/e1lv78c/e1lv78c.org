Can you hack foretelling by foretelling something you commit to doing in response to events? Draw a line a hundred meters long, and place a pebble in the middle of it. Ask yourself some question about the future, like will the army win the battle? Commit to casting foretelling every day for a hundred days. At the end of the time, place the pebble at the far left for victory and the far right for defeat. Use foretelling each day to check where you will have moved the pebble tomorrow.

If I understand this correctly, on the first day the pebble should immediately jump a large amount to the left or right due to averaging.
