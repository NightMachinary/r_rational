  Clever, but this would actually undo the damage caused by exercise, rendering it ineffectual.

True for building muscle, but not true for muscle memory. Seems like they could become pretty intensely good fighters this way, with a year tacked on the end to help build up any muscle strength they need that they didn't get because of the healing.

Alternately, it would be interesting if healing helped reduce the need for sleep due to resetting the body back to a point when it was rested. Could have long training sessions back to back with healing in between, for really any subject you wanted someone trained up quickly in.
