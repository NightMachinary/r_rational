Transformation permits mass changes. Given a system of gravity that resembles human-observed behaviour, this can be used to generate arbitrary amounts of energy, because it's no more expensive to change mass from greater heights.

For a worked example, a magic-to-rotation engine design would be a vertical conveyor belt with a set of baskets attached. In each basket, we place one mouse. At the top of the belt stands a magician, who transforms mice into cows as they pass. At the bottom of the belt stands another magician, who transforms cows into mice. The weight of the cows turns the belt and carries the mice back to the top. The energy produced is proportional to the height of the belt, so you can make an arbitrarily large amount of energy from a fixed amount of MP.

If you don't want this class of exploits to be possible, you're going to need conservation of mass.
