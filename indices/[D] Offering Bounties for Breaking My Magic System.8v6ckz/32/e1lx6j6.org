Would Luck help in a brainstorming session on magic exploits?

Candidate law of magic: /Luck isn't self-aware./ Luck exactly can't influence events its existence caused, because it doesn't see them coming. If someone notices that Luck prevents bodily harm more strongly than events the target doesn't like, he may cast Luck on a bauble to crush it if events don't turn out to his liking. He will find that Luck doesn't know to satisfy him, because it can't figure out that he might crush it, because he only does that because Luck exists.

In a /Too clever for their own good/ scenario, an archmage may wander the countryside to seek an ignorant dabbler who tries to rediscover Magic on his own. The dabbler must never notice or be influenced by the archmage, for he set out on his quest because Luck exists. If the dabbler ever imagines a Fortune spell /without/ the self-ignorance complication and tries to improvise a casting (achieving no more than waving his arms), the archmage would surreptitiously cast Luck on the dabbler. The outcome of the dabbler's experiments would then reveal to the archmage whether Luck's blind spot also covers nearby concepts such as the hypothetical Fortune spell. If it doesn't, he will discover just /why/ the Atlanteans built a self-ignorance clause into their Wish spell.

Are some future events easier to Foretell than others? I imagine a great beacon constructed for visibility to past Beacon Foretellers. Light it when the Goblins unite under a general once more to warn Elven civilization decades back to raise a generation of soldiers. Depending on how your time loops work, a yet more ambituous project could iterate through policies: If the policies you received work, send them back again. If they don't, vary them using what you learned. Beware that the time loop may resolve to a Goblin general, rebelling noble or third party sending back that which allowed him to conquer the Elves. Instructions may include magic exploits such as how to construct a better temporal telegraph.
