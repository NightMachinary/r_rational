    A force of soldiers transformed in this way would be most effectively placed as border patrollers, or they could be used to make inroads into the fertile plains. Could they transform into, say, venomous snakes that weigh as much as a not-elf? Would the venom injected into other creatures persist if the transformation was undone?

  You could transform into a snake with all of the abilities of a snake, yes

So, it seems to me that you could easily wipe out your enemies just by converting your soldiers into something like Inland Taipan snakes, and send them out in groups of 5-10 per enemy leader. 5-10 human intelligence super venomous snakes seem like they would be a pretty unstoppable assassination team. Hell, do a team of 5-10 where every member is a different small deadly venomous animal so you have more flexibility, that way your whole plan isn't stymied by the victims pet mongoose.

I can't imagine trying to keep my environment free of ALL spiders, snakes, scorpions, frogs, etc, ALL the time, when those creatures have human intelligence and an interest in my death.
