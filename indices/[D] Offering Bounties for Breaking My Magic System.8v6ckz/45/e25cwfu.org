With a frequency rate of 1 in 10 to 1 in 20, it ought to have a very significant impact on Elf culture, contradicting your statement about magical impact. For comparison, about 2% of people have green eyes, and 1-2% have red hair, which is far more rare, and yet is considered reasonably normal. Even for the rarer race distribution, 1/100 would be enough that almost everyone would personally know someone who could do magic.

Scry: Would suggest changing the double negative to "Only works under an open sky". Not really an error, just a clarity thing, sorry for picking nits.

Siphon seems ineffective if there is, as appears, a 1:1 correlation. It would allow type-shifting of mana, but does not seem to be good at gaining mana overall, and thus seems a fairly poor thing to practice, given that learning seems to naturally increase mana reserves anyways, which would usually be far more valuable.

The time-cost for transformations would seem to be largely irrelevant. Anyone who focused on transformation would presumably, after learning a form, do it repeatedly until hitting the minimum shifting time. This would seem to be a particularly advantageous form of magic practice, as it provides an explicit benefit beyond normal training.

Rejuvenate: There appears to be no rules regarding stacking effects. Therefore, repeatedly casting Rejuvenate on oneself shortly before one has recovered all mana ought to stack ever higher levels of rejuvenation. I believe you'll either want to clange this to only work on health rather than all abilities, or set some other limits. This is probably the most important note, as it can be comboed with essentially anything else for nigh-arbitrary power.
