  There is some ambiguity in your listed MP amounts for various levels of magician experience. Do more-experienced magicians accumulate MP faster, so that the quoted amounts are per day? Or are the quoted amounts caps on how much MP a magician has the capacity to store, as they accumulate MP over a long time at a fixed rate?

It's a cap. Read other answers for details on recharging -- pretty sure I answered this somewhere.

  If MP accumulation is relatively fast, we can do this:

  If 1 in 15 not-elves are magic-sensitive, 10% of these have potential to be useful, and about 1/3 of these are sensitive to red magic, that's about one useful red magician per 450 individuals, so they're common enough that any reasonably-sized settlement should have one.

  Every morning, the town's red magician spends one day's worth of MP accumulation to invigorate the strongest man in town. It only lasts for a minute, but he spends that minute pulling on a chain. The chain quickly lifts a very heavy object to a great height, from which it is slowly lowered over the course of the day to drive machinery.

  (As many others have suggested, this could be supplemented by using siphon to concentrate MP from the larger number of "not enough potential to be useful" red sensitives)

That's a neat idea, but I don't think it would be the best use of the mage's time, or even just the magic if you just wanted to use it to create energy.
