So I might or might not be braking your setting exactly, but arbitrary tf magic will do terrible, terrible things to your cultures.

The first thing you need to understand is that the earliest evidence we have for a humans capacity for imagination is [a furry](). Every cultures first religion is based around anthropomorphised concepts. Every culture that has ever existed has extensively used anthro characters in their art, religion, and myth. Significant fractions of your not-elves are going to not be not-elves.

"Oh, well, people into that stuff in our world aren't common, so that means people into that stuff in my world would be the same." Except the people historically into that have been the cultural and religious leaders, people like actors, shamans, artists, priests, etc. Which means that their culture is going to have a strong culture of exploring that.

Species swaps are going to be a huge thing, since rock eaters have at least one form that they are familiar with: their own, and mages specializing in transformation are going to be spending a lot of time swapping around forms so they can familiarize themselves. Are the rock eaters better miners? Expect a lot of miners to voluntarily become not-elf/rock eater hybrids. I expect that not-elves actually come from using transformation magic to optimize their stat-builds, which would happen anyways.

Referencing the above, body mods like horns, weird skin, double eyes, etc. etc are going to be made and passed down, accumulating in the gene pool.

Birth would be a cake walk for
