You raise interesting ideas and make good points, but there are a number of issues with your interpretation of Transformation; also I will be reworking this to hopefully avoid a lot of the worst offenders, and thus am no longer awarding bounties for setting-breaking consequences of the ability (see note at bottom of main post).

  Referencing the above, body mods like horns, weird skin, double eyes, etc. etc are going to be made

I really like this detail though and am willing to award it a bounty. With that, I won't be awarding any additional bounties for Transformation.

If you'd like, PM me payment details, or let me know if you'd prefer Gold.
