  What does open sky mean for scrying? Can you block scrying by cloud cover? Mist? A massive umbrella pavilion? Kicking up a dust cloud? Carryign rock sheets?
#+end_quote

You can block it with an umbrella -- the person would just see the umbrella. Clouds, mist, fog, or dust could would obscure vision but not prevent the effect. If you're inside a cave and attempt to scry out of the cave (or from the outside into the cave) this won't work.
