"You can block it with an umbrella -- the person would just see the umbrella. Clouds, mist, fog, or dust could would obscure vision but not prevent the effect. If you're inside a cave and attempt to scry out of the cave (or from the outside into the cave) this won't work."

Iiinteresting. One neat thing I could see happening is armies having a set of "pole-and-cloth" apparatus to carry over their army's heads, much like a circus tent or whatever, made to look like the terain to block random burst scrying to find them; I would expect this to be more common around encampments, but a suitably ambitious general could do it on the march too if they're willing to sacrifice speed for security. You couldn't just carry it in a straight march, because then the movement would give it away, but you could have it in parts with the back end being pulled down and carries to the front which if your dye skills are good enough would allow a full army core to operate as though under camouflage. Not setting breaking, but might be a neat past exploit, and if it was successful at some point in the past would probably lead to any cores of scrying mages being trained in a wide variety of geographies so they could identify these constructs.

I would expect mages to be split into trios under almost all circumstances, unless it is certain that only 1 form of magic is needed at a location; with prismatic magic, they can shuffle their magic between different disciplines (ie three red , or 2 blue and 1 green, or 1 of each like normal, or almost arbitrary fractions of each; you would also expect these to be of a approximately equal skill level since that way there's no 'wasted" mana, which would probably lead to three man magic squads being a common theme in literature and in magic training; you'd here legends about sam, jack, and jane, who did x heroic thing in the past, but also john, james, and arthur, the professional magic casters who work together in the nearby city.

Possibly intended, but a red mage seems far more useful for large organizations, green for isolated locales, and blue for administrative work; I'd expect a cultural association with those positions after this long, although this would be somewhat counteracted by trios and the greater personal freedom they might have with their greater than average rarity and therefore disproportionate inluence.
