If I understood Energy Burst properly, a Prismatic mage should be able to make solid objects which disintegrate when forced or dismissed by essentially creating kinetic energy force fields in whatever shape they want. Such objects would be mostly useless for all direct purposes, of course. [[http://www.science.ca/askascientist/viewquestion.php?qID=821][An average punch]] contains around 150 joules, so making armor or weapons will rapidly exhaust the mage's mana supplies and render them ordinary not-elves again.

However, using such objects as industrial molds should be trivial. The force field only cares about repelling whatever material you pour into it, so molten metals can be contained as easily as any other liquid of similar density. A rank novice with a 20 MP cap can create a mold which will withstand 2,000 J of force before shattering, which is quite a lot when all you need to do is keep an otherwise stationary fluid in place until it cools enough to be self-supporting. This allows Prismatic mages to create arbitrary objects out of any metal this civilization has the capacity to melt, limited only by their capacity to hold the details of these objects in mind while creating the form.

Assuming mundane mathematics exists in this world, much of the limitation in imagination can be mitigated by meditating on the set of equations which define your object, rather than mentally simulating the object directly. However, that isn't the really important bit. The hardest part of setting up heavy industry isn't having the idea of an automated loom, it's having the technology to create sturdy enough parts to create such a machine which will hold up to wear. DaVinci had sketches of bicycles, but the first ones weren't created until the 19th century. This is because we couldn't translate the parts DaVinci imagined into reality with enough fidelity to make a bike which actually worked, and because we didn't have enough good steel lying around to make the idea practical until then.

With Prismatic Energy Burst Forging, the imagination-to-reality gap is gone. Precision forging of small, detailed pieces for intricate machines becomes easy the moment you have a machine-worthy alloy. In fact, smaller pieces are even easier to create than larger ones, as the metal involved will require less force to shape into the required form. The only hard limitation on the intricacy of machines is the intricacy of the most complicated part, and once someone has the idea to start mass-producing screws and other fasteners, even that goes by the wayside. Any part which could be broken down into simpler parts becomes easy to produce. The only limitations on the development of industry become metallurgy and the number of Prismatic mages available. That sounds like a real limit, until the first Prismatic mage starts making precision tools to replicate what they can do with force field molds. Precise lathes and other metal-shaping devices would allow normals to start creating replacement parts for machines, and once you have that, you have a full-on industrial revolution.

This trick also applies to the handling of any other fluid which humans don't want to handle directly. Glassblowing can be revolutionized by blowing the glass into a perfectly shaped mold which vanishes the moment the glass hardens. Poisonous gasses can be transferred between containers in perfect security by containing them in force field jars in the interim. Prismatic surgeons could make arbitrarily sharp scalpels and easily ligate bleeders all on their own, as it takes a relatively tiny amount of force to keep even a major artery closed.

Now that I think of it, the fact that no diseases exist means that trauma surgery should be far more advanced in this world than it would be in ours under the same circumstances, as you don't need to worry about the waste of resources involved in a "saved" patient dying of sepsis. Their wars against not-goblins should not leave thousands of crippled casualties behind, as civil-war-and-earlier battlefield amputations were overwhelmingly done to prevent infection, rather than to stop bleeding. Anyone who doesn't bleed to death should survive any battle wound, in the long run.

Just in general, a world with no disease will be so astoundingly different from our own that I'm not sure you can be reasonably expected to simulate it well enough to write a story with no plot holes, whether obvious or not. Food will either keep indefinitely or just become less nutritious over time as it breaks down, but you will always be able to eat it safely as long as no foodborne pathogens exist. Everyone should be drinking directly from rivers and streams, as without cholera and other waterborne pathogens, the impetus to create safer drinks like beer will not exist. Overpopulation will be solvable only through advances in technology increasing the amount of people you can feed with a given amount of land, war, or autocratic policies directly limiting the reproduction of the masses. In fact, this might be the major impetus behind repeated, failed campaigns against the not-goblins. Win or lose, a ton of peasants you couldn't feed are now dead. Insert conspiracy to repeatedly fail in conquering the ancestral homelands and/or prop up the occasional smart not-goblin warlord as long as possible to serve this purpose.

Screw the magic system, actually. No diseases is way more interesting.
