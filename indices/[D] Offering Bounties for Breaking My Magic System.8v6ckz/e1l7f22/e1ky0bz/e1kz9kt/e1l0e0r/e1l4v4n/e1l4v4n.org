  If you can offer an analysis with reasonable numerical assumptions on Energy Burst that convinces me this is setting-breaking, it is worth $20 (extra because there's an easy fix).

Reading through the rest of your posts, I don't think that I can make a siege weapon anymore, the individual spells are too weak to pay for the overhead of imbuing an item. A handgun bullet, falling three feet, 1 cm^{2} of third-degree burns, or a defibrillator charge is about 500 J, and a cannonball is about 1,250,000 J (2500x as much energy as a normal attack).

That being said, a magical [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hwacha][Hwacha]] could serve as an expensive but deadly force-multiplier if loaded up with energy-projection wands.

  This is a really neat idea and easily worth $5. :D [...] PM me details for payment.

I'll just go with a month of Gold, if that works for you.
