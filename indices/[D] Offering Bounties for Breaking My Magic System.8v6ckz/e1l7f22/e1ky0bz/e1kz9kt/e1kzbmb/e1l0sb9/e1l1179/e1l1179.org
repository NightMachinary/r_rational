  Well now you're just adding more exploitability. You could create secure currency that can't be counterfeited, or secure containers for important messages by using imbue object on it just to say “this has been imbued with the Royal Seal”. The fact that it was imbued is proof enough, it wouldn't matter if the imbued object had any other abilities. Possibly not practical except for very large transactions or very important transmissions, but without a way to hack imbue object after it's been placed there is a lot to work with.

This wouldn't work because it would be trivial for anyone with enough magic to counterfeit. Imbue object must give it an ability plus some amount of magic, and there are only so many of those.
