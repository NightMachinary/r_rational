  Imbue Object seems ripe for abuse.

  Can a mage Imbue an object with enough power that it recharges itself in ~1 month, and has the ability to cast 'Imbue Object', passing on a lesser form of its abilities?
#+end_quote

- It is theoretically possible (not known to be impossible) for a mage to imbue an object with enough power that it recharges itself in ~1 month, but this would take a staggering amount of magic
- Imbued objects can cast imbue object on other objects, but because of the minimum cost, you will lose efficiency with each step.

  Is mana or time the main bottleneck for imbuing objects? If it's mana, then Siphon on captured enemies, willing apprentices (who would be useful even if they never get trained), or other self-charging objects (if they are a valid target) could speed up the creation process enough to unbalance things.

  What are the limits on mana capacity for imbued objects? Can a mage spend five years pouring power into an object imbued with Energy Burst, then release it all at once to destroy a castle in a single blow?
#+end_quote

Time and mana are both important, but we're talking order minutes for an expert mage to put all of their capacity into an object. I suppose Siphon could be used on someone using the Imbue Object ability, so there is definitely the possibility of gathering magic from enough sources via Siphon to put much greater magic into something than is otherwise possible. It isn't physically possible for someone to concentrate for 5 years, but...

If you can offer an analysis with reasonable numerical assumptions on Energy Burst that convinces me this is setting-breaking, it is worth $20 (extra because there's an easy fix).

  Transformation is permanent (unless countered with Heal)? I see two strategies that make logistics easier for an army.

  First, transform every soldier into a "normal" form, so that all equipment (armor, boots, etc.) is perfectly interchangeable. This can also replace physical conditioning if the mages are precise enough.

  Second, if animals are a valid target, transform a cow into a mouse (spending ~1 hour to shrink it), carry it where you're going (and feed it over time), de-transform it, then eat it. Depending on how hard it is to do, this may only be useful for Special Forces.
#+end_quote

This is a really neat idea and easily worth $5. :D

In general, mages this talented won't be abundant enough to make "normal form soldiery" standard practice.

Shrinking livestock for transport (or maybe to store in fortified locations overnight?) is really cool.

PM me details for payment.

  This is probably just an artifact of your summary, but one joule of electricity is far deadlier than one joule of fire or water jets.
#+end_quote

One joule of energy imparted. Even if it looks different, it's normalized.

  Telepathy can be heavily optimized through the use of code, although your familiarity/complexity costs may cover that already. "3-7" sounds simpler than "A force of approximately 100 goblin-things are currently traversing the North-East pass", but it conveys the same information.
#+end_quote

Yep. To speak more to complexity, it is measured by the relative frequency of words in the language you are using to communicate with the target. This means that using codes for cheaper transmission is indeed clever and effective, but not an idea I didn't already have.
