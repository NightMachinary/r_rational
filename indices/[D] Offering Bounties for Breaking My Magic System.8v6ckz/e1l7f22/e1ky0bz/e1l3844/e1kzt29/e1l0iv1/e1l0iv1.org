  The immediate idea for a possible exploit that could break the setting comes from the use of Transformation ~~~
#+end_quote

Transformation does not allow fine-grained control of the target form, and does not allow for any changes except for mass or volume (including age). It cannot be used reliably for infiltration. You could transform into a goblin-thing or a not-elf or vice versa, but the details wouldn't be exact and your mannerisms would give you away.
