If you just want to transform into a generic goblin-thing, does the imprecise essence impact this or does it mean that all that anyone can transform into is golem-like shapes without facial features or fingers or any smaller details like that?

Are goblin-things clever enough to collectively figure out that the powerful goblin-thing ordering them about on pain of magical death and surprisingly successful raids on not-elves is secretly not a goblin-thing, and would they care given that they have no culture and the strange goblin-thing with more magic than any five other mages is making their tribe more successful than any others in living memory?

Could this work repeatedly on a cyclical basis if the goblins only have word-of-mouth to pass down their tribe's history, or is word-of-mouth retelling more culture than they can manage?
