I'm not worried about bounties :)

  Transform one's body, or the body of a willing or subdued target to that of another form. The form must be based off of one's experience of living creatures, and must be vaguely organic in nature. The caster does not have fine-grained control of the target form, but can reliably produce the same form. The cost to reverse the transformation is negligible. One may "master" one form with a great deal of practice. Every successful transformation reduces the time it takes to complete the transformation by up to a few seconds, to a minimum of 3 seconds. A mastered form may be replaced by spending an entire day in another form (that form does not become mastered).

Convert elephants to mice, launch sacks of mice from catapults, convert back to elephants in the 3 seconds they are in flight, it's now raining elephants on your enemies?

Convert mice to elephant, butcher elephant and feed whole town/all your troops? (Or cows, if you want to be inefficient.) I know someone already mentioned doing this to transport cows, but why bother? Just transport (or catch) mice and have a mage who can turn mice into cows.

One question, you mentioned in one of your comments that transformed creatures wouldn't be able to breed. Would a transformed chicken still be able to produce unfertilized eggs?
