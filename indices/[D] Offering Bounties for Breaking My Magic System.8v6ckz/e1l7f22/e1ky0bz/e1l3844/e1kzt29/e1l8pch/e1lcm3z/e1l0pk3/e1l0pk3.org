Hmm, one of the things I see is implementing a tax break (or reward, or whatever) for people who are sensitive to magic, but not strong enough to be actual mages to let you siphon off their mana. That way, you don't have to worry so much about exhausting your apprentices doing the siphoning to them.

Next, implement a telepathy based post office. The telepaths can work in shifts, and while they are on shift, they'll be 'in the post office' meaning you don't have to worry too much about where they are to send stuff to them.

You can also implement a scrying based message passing system: use writing or a sand table or whatever to draw your message and have someone scry it. This would seem to get around the complexity limits of telepathic messages.

Could you make a device that could recreate the scried image/drawing/letter? Then you have magic fax machines. You also have a magic printing press. (Example of how this could be done: energy burst fire in the form of letters, to simply burn them into your paper/parchment/whatever. Or energy burst an ice block with your letters sticking out and then just ink them and press.)

Write a 'code book' for telepathic messages. Take a page from ye olde maratime radio codes, and reduce 'common' message to collections of 3 letters (or whatever).

The post office lets yo gain all sorts of advantages from real time communication. Example: weather tracking, if a big storm is coming in, your telepaths can tell the post office in the port city (or whatever) about it, so they don't send out their fishing fleet (or whatever). I know ground based weather tracking stations were used with the advent of radio.

In addition, the post office allows for much more centralized government. You don't need to delegate decision making power to some baron if the village mayor (or whatever) can just ask the central government for what they want done.

If you can scry on some object high above, you can do things like send a kite up over your army, scry the kite, and get a birds eye view of what your army (and the other army) is doing. In fact, scrying on a kite for general recon should work all the time.

If you can revoke transforms at a distance, you can fire blue whales (or whatever) at people, by making the blue whale smaller, getting it over them, and then letting the transform go.

Telepathy also means you have a method of determining longitude while at sea. At local noon (or whenever) on the ship, you talk to/scry the post office in your capitol to find out what time it is there, which lets you compare the times and find what your longitude is. This is a pretty big deal in long range ship navigation.

You can probably use energy burst to mimic explosives. (Example, use a fire or electrical burst to flash a little bit of water to steam in a confined space). This lets you do things like cut roadways, fire cannons, quarry stone, etc much easier than ye olde pick and chisel method. If this works, you end up with star forts instead of castles, since castle walls don't resist cannon fire. This also lets you do things like have large stone blocks pre-prepared to block roads in the case of invasion, and when the invasion comes, you just drop the rocks. (IRL, South Korea has several pre-prepared big blocks of concrete to block roadways, etc in the case of invasion.)

You can do much more intensive training on people if you can heal all the 'minor' joint, ligament, bone, and muscle damage to the trainees. Train until your muscles are tearing off your bones, get healed, do it all again tomorrow. You can't do this this IRL because of long recovery times and the build up of incremental damage, but if you can heal all that, go wild.

You can probably get 'canned' food by using energy burst to sterilize food in an airtight container (e.g. a glazed piece of pottery).
