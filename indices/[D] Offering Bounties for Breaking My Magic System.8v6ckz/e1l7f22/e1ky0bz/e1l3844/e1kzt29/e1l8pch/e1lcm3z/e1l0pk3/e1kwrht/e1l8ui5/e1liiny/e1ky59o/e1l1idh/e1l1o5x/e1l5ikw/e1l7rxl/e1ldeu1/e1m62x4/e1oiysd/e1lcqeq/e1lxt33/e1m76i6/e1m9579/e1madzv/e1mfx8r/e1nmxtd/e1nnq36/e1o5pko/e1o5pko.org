  An entirely plausible hypothesis. My point isn't that these are likely scenarios, my point is that you don't know. And, unfortunately for someone trying to deduce it, nobody has run any experiments for us to look at. Presumably nobody has ever even made a coiled wire with a current through it!

Well, my point is that for some of these things, we don't have to run experiments. We can exclude them a priori due to certain mathematical theorems, e.g. calculus. I don't have to run an experiment to know that calculus is true. Similarly, I don't have to run an experiment to know that a vector field is going to fulfill stokes theorem if it is continuous and doesn't contain a singularity. Much of what physics today consists of is just math that will always stay applicable, no matter how the details actually work out. In a similar fashion, any mathematical theorem true in our universe, will also be true in theirs, no matter how the underlying physics actually work.
