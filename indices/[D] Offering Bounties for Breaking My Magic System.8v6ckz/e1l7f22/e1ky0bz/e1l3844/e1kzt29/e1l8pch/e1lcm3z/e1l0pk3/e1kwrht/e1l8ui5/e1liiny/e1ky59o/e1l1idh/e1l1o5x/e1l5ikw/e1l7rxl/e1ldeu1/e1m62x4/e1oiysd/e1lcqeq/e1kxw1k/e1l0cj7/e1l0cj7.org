  Does hunger/thirst count as damage for rejuvenate and can it heal mental illness? What can't it heal? Can rejuvenate revive dead people?
#+end_quote

Extreme hunger/thirst can count as damage for breaking the effect, but it doesn't make you not hungry or not thirsty. It cannot heal mental illness or revive dead people.
