He probably doesn't mean that anyone who thinks too hard about it dies which is what an infohazard basically is, but probably more like using magic (as they don't have the reliable technology) to peek into quantum forces is dangerous for the user. It's probably like playing with fire and getting burned but on a more deadlier scale, as I guess the magic must be interacting with particles/waves whatever.
