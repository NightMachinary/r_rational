  Surgical transplants, no. Iterative transformations do not work.

Aw.

  It is delta from base form.

Hmm... but what is the base form? Fats and muscles count right? What about hair? Can you grow out your hair to ridiculous lengths? What about cancer? Can you expose yourself to radiation and grow massive tumors to increase your weight/volume?

And what about reproduction while in a transformed state? Say two people invest large amounts of mana to transform themselves into large fertile creatures of the opposite sex. For simplicity suppose they just transform into larger versions of themselves. They then reproduce. Would the base form of their children then be a larger version of their species? Can they iteratively increase in weight/volume over the generations?

Or perhaps an even faster method: asexual reproduction. Can you transform yourself into something like a giant amoeba, and then undergo mitosis to create two copies of yourself? Actually you wouldn't even need to be giant in this case, you can just rapidly reproduce to get a large numerical advantage in war.
