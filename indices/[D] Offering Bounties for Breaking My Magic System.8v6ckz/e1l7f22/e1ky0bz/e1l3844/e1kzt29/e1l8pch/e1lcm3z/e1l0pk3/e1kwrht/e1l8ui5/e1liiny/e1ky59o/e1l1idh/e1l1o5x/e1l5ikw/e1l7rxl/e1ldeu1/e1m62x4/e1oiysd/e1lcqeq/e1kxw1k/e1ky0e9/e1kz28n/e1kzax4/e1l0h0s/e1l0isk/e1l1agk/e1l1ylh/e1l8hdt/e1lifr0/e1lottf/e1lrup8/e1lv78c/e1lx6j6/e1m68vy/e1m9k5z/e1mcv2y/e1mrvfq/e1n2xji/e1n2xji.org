Why do you have to nerf things at all though? Part of the fun of hard fantasy is that the magic *changes* things. All the various practical applications of transformation sound Fun to me. (And if a hard fantasy story isn't the story you're trying to tell...well, in that case it doesn't really matter if it's not logically consistent right?)
