  Telepathically communicate with the target individual. Complexity is bounded by one's understanding of the target's language. Distance is soft-bounded by needing to know roughly where the target is in relation to the user. This limit can be mitigated with use of scrying, and also with practice over time.

If I'm reading this right, you can break this to create long distance military communications. Is the only Mp limit message complexity ? How do you define complexity ?

Write a code in which each command or information is keyed to one or two phonemes. Like, the TH sound in "The" is enemy and the TH sound in "fourth" is ally. Since there are languages in the real world with upwards of 140 phonemes, it should be fairly easy to convey any complex orders using at most 5~6 phonemes for trivial MP costs. Think morse code, except instead of binary you are working with base 140. Prefer using very common phonemes, and leave the rarer phonemes for weirder words.

Nail down a chair and train all communication officers (blue mages) to keep track of where the chair is in relation to them. Teach officers to end communications with a indication of location so the mage in the chair can relay back messages. Congratulations, you just created a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_exchange][Telephone Exchange]] that can relay orders in real time, instantly, at all moments for little to no cost, directly to the receiver's brain. Even modern day military would kill for this kind of security.

Now put a Scryer just beside that chair for the duration of pitched battles. You now have both instant communications and the magical equivalent of satellite surveillance while your enemies are using scouts. You see where i am going with this.

Communications is the most broken thing in warfare that I know of. And these guys have communications that are impossible to intercept.

OH MY GOD. Cellphones. Or at the very least portable telegraph machines. Mass produce Telepaty-imbued pebbles and you get /texting!/

Edit2: Aaaaaaaand I just noticed that this is a day old thread and lots of people alrealdy pointed out the power of blue magic. Well, I'mma go back to my corner and skulk about the fact that I never arrive in time for these things.
