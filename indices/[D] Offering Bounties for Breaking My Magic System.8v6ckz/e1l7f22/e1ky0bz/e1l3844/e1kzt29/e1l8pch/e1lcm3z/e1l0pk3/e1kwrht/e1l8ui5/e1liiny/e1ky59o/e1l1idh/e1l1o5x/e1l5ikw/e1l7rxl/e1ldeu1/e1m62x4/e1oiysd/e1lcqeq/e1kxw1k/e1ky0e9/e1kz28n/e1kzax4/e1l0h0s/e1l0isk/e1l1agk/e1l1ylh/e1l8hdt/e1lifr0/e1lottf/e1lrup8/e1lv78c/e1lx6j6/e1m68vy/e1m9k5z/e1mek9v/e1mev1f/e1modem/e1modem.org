It's somewhat interesting to me that you can use Healing in order to farm up arbitrarily large amounts of biological matter. In fact, given that it is not specified in the text, can you use heal or rejuvenate on nonorganic materials? If so, you can farm up arbitrarily large amounts of everything. Even ignoring that, the world would be pretty bizarre if it was semi-trivial to farm organic material. I suppose it depends on how fast mana regenerates and how expensive it is to use Heal and Rejuvenate.
