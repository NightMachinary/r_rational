Hmm, it occurs to me that this tactic would give the goblin-things a huge advantage over the not-elves. After all, the not-elves rely heavily on coordination to beat the goblin-things, coordination which probably heavily relies on telepathy. Meanwhile the goblin-things can win wars just fine without any coordination, and have tons of novice mages that have no issue casting the (probably) cheap telepathy spell.

One way to patch this, and even improve the not-elves coordination, would be to allow weighted telepathic messages: make it so casters can expend more mana on the telepathy spell to give their messages more weight, and make it so that all messages received by a target are queued up in order of weight and played one by one. This way the goblin-thing novice mages can only cast low-weight telepathic messages, while the not-elves powerful mages can send out high-weight telepathic messages. The not-elves can even weight their messages according to their command rank, so important strategic messages from central headquarters are queued up before messages from low-ranking field officers.
