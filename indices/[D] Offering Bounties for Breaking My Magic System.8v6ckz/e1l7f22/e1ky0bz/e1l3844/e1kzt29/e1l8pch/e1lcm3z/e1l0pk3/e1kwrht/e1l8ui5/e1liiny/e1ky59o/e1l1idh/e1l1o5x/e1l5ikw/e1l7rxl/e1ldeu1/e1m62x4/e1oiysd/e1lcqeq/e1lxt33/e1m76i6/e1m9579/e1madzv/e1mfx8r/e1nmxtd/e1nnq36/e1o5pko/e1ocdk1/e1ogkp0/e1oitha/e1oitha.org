  You can't reasonably construct a universe where velocity, acceleration, position, and time are not linked in this way at human scales without making it unihabitable by humans.
#+end_quote

Proof? Assume "humans" only have to be humanlike at humanlike scales.

#+begin_quote
  Wave phenomena being linked to disturbance with a finite speed of propagation is one of them; any conservative field having a curl of 0 everywhere applies as well.
#+end_quote

I think you have this the wrong way around; the latter implies the former, not vice-versa.

#+begin_quote
  Similarly, you break lenses if light does not have a finite speed of propagation. Meaning no human eyes, and no glasses.
#+end_quote

Because no renderers have ever modelled refraction without time-discretized models of light...

  Thermodynamics will also knock on your door if you fiddle with absorption or emission coefficients because them not being equal allows you to heat or cool something indefinitely. Heating an object infinitely is rather problematic and actually has universe-breaking applications.
#+end_quote

Proof? Surely you cannot think that our universe is the /only/ possible universe with conservation of energy? Do you really think that any violation of conservation of energy implies boundary conditions are reachable?
