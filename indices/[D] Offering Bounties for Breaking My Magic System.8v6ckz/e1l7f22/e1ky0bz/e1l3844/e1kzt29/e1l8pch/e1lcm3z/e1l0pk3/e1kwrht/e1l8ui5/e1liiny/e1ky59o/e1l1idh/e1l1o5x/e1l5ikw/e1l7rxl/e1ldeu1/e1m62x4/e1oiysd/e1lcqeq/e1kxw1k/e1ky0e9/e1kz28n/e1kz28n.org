Telepathy seems like it could be incredibly powerful in combat. Just make the "message" into a loud shrieking sound to distract the enemies. And since a shriek is not that complex at all, it'll be relatively cheap. For instance, in a battle between armies, one could prepare large amounts of cheap imbued telepathic items just to mindblast the enemies making them effectively confused.
