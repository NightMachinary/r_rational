  I think the ability of some people to transform into birds has a rather large number of important implications.

I actually knew Transformation was insanely broken going into this, despite my attempts to limit it or patch it beforehand. I still included it because I wanted to find novel ways to break it and was happy to pay people to do the work for me. It's a really cool ability, but also really hard to keep it from destroying everything. It's going to take a lot more work if I do decide to keep it in some heavily restricted form.
