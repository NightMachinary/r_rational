The first thing I'd do in this setting is to imbue a /lot/ of rings with Heal, Rejuvenate and Luck. 50+ rings and you'd be very, very hard to kill. Why isn't everyone doing this? It may be too expensive, but it should at least factor into any fight to some degree.

You may want to put a limit on the number of imbued objects you can wear. /The Wandering Inn/ handles this by saying that the magic in enchanted objects interfere with each other, so you can only wear 3-4 pieces at once, unless they are very carefully crafted (and thus expensive). How many imbued objects can you wear? If there is a limit, why?
