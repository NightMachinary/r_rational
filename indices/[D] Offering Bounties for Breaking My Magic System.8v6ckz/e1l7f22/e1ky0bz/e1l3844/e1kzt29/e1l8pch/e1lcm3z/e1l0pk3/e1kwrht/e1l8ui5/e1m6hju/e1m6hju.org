  If it dissipates or is capped then you would have people absorbing as much as possible, then putting it into objects and stockpiling those. (They effectively become mana storage batteries, but with a specific use.) Which ends up with a similar dynamic, but items are potentially easier to steal, deny access to, or buy and sell.

  ...

  Another way to nerf the imbued magic items would be to have them also slowly lose magic over time, or only be usable by the the original maker.

You have convinced me that Imbued Objects should decay over time to prevent stockpiling. I will award this a bounty. PM me with payment details or let me know if you prefer gold.

E: Donated to charity.

  Scrying can also be used as an equivalent of telepathy, if you have someone write information in a pre specified location a scryer can read the messages. Which might allow you to get around some of telepathy's restrictions, in exchange for the added restriction that its one way. E.g. a soldier i the field can write out a page long report and leave it on top of a predeignated rock, bypassing the information restrictions on telepaths,

This is clever and is indeed possible, although scrying itself has nontrivial costs to maintain. It is not an idea I haven't considered.

There are a few issues with your interpretation on other points, and I will not be speaking to issues regarding the setting, but thanks for your suggestions there.
