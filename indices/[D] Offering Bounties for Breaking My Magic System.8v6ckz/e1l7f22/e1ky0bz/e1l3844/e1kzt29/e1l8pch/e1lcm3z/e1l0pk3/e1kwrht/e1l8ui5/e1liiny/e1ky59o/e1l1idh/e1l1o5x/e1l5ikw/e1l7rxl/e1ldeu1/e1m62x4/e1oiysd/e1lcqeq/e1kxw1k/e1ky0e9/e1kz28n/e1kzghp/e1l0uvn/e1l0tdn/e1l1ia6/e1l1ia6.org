How loud are those words when received?(Loudness as in how much attention do they draw?)

If the caster can't alter that (the attention drawn by telepathic words), then what properties /can/ they alter? If they can't alter any properties then it would sound like a monotone computer voice and couldn't be distinguished. (and therefore also open to abuse faking commands/impersonation?)

Also, what stops a person from inventing a loud distracting word in an obscure language and transmitting that?
