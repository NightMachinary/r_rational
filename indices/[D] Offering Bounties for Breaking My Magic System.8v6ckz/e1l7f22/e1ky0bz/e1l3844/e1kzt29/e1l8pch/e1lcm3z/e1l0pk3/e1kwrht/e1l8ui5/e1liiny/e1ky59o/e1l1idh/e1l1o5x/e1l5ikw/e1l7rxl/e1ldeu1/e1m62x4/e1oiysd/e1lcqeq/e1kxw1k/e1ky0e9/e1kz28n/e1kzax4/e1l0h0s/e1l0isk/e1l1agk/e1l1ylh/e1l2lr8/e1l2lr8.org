  Energy burst seems exploitable, even with a 100J limit.

  If the definition of 'form' allows imparting energy within living beings then applying 100J of kinetic energy to someone's brainstem is going to instantly kill them. Localized heating would do the same if the total volume is small (e.g. heat a plane of brain tissue).

It's 100J per MP spent. The energy travels via some illusory medium from the caster to the target. This cannot be used to directly affect a small area inside of someone's body.
