"Further, Prismatic energy does not naturally occur, but Blue, Red and Green energies may be combined in equal parts to form Prismatic energy, with all due implications."

If I have 1 Red, 1 blue, and 1 green, does that make 1 prismatic or 3?

'For theory-crafting purposes, assume that a novice Magician will have ~20-50 MP, adept Magicians will have ~50-100, and experts will have ~100-250. " How long does it take to reach novice (do they start at that?), and is there any change in efficacy, casting speed, or regeneration rate or just in storage // Is increased storage correlated to spell pool / efficacy / casting rate, and if so how strongly?

What does open sky mean for scrying? Can you block scrying by cloud cover? Mist? A massive umbrella pavilion? Kicking up a dust cloud? Carryign rock sheets?

Is prismatic a separate attunation from the standard three, or is having 1 enough?

"The form must be based off of one's experience of living creatures, and must be vaguely organic in nature."

Is Transformation permanent? If so, then depending on what vaguely organic in nature covers, expect things like spider silk, some metallic bacteria; I might also expect that mages would look into heavy metal poisoning of animals, then turn stock animals into these sickly, metal-laden animals in order to turn magic into rare materials, which would make the price of materials equal to the price of that mage's time and magic. This isn't neccesarily setting breaking, but should have big impacts ont he ecomonics of precious materials.

Can you use luck to get a favorable result ona psuedorandom outcome, like blindly throwing darts? If so, can you use it as a discount scrying for throwing darts at a map to identify locations or the like?

Healing can't effect aging, but can it affect side effects of aging, like wrinkles or memory loss or hair whitening?
