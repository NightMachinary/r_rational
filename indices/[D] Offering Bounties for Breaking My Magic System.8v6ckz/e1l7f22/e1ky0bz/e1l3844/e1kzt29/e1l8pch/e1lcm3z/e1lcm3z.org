Firstly, this is a great idea! I hope all the responses aren't overwhelming you. With that in mind, here are some thoughts I've had:

- You've commented that Energy Burst travels via some illusory medium. Depending on what blocks it, that could lead to those fearing such attacks wearing protection like wide-brimmed hats with long veils. These wouldn't absorb energy but instead block the illusory medium. Of course, it could easily be that you can just target the hat and the ice spike will continue on through.

- It's possible to make lenses out of ice. Energy Burst with blue mana could create such lenses temporarily, for a cost of only 1MP. This might be more economical than scrying over long distances when line of sight is available. Archimedes-style solar weapons using giant lenses probably aren't possible, though.

- When making kinetic attacks with Energy Burst, is kinetic energy measured in the caster's frame of reference or in the frame of the planet? If it's the caster's frame, you could see magical jousts where casters launch their attacks from the backs of galloping horses so that the kinetic energy of the attack is higher in the frame of a target they're charging towards. If it's measured from a particular part of the caster, like the hand, Transformation could be used to put that part on a long, flexible limb, so that the spell can be released as that part is being whipped towards the enemy.

- In a similar manner to the Transformation for venom, could Energy Burst with green mana be used to produce a burst of nature-based energy in the form of poison or acid? That could cause more harm than might otherwise be possible, as minimal physical energy would need to be imparted. Of course, the substance would have to be fast-acting enough to cause harm before it vanishes.

- Is the time horizon of Luck distinct from its duration? If you've narrowed a battle plan down to two options, would it help to cast Luck then toss a coin to choose between them? If a personal stake is required, you could also bet on the outcome of the battle. From the sound of it, it would be hard to tell whether this works or not - it might be a sort of superstition that some generals have. It probably counts as relying on Luck, too

- You've mentioned magical backlash as a possibility that is more likely when Siphon is used. Would Luck help to avoid this? Also, could this be used to counterspell by sending mana (ideally of a kind useless to both sender and receiver) to a caster as they're casting?

- Would the magic present in the environment ever be a limiting factor? Depending on how quickly it's replenished, you could have the elves pursue a scorched earth policy of sending patrols through an area using mana, perhaps literally scorching the earth with it, in order to create buffer zones that lack enough ambient magic for the goblin casters to recover. This is partially inspired by Trudi Canavan's Magicians series, in which I think magic items are used with a similar purpose at one point.

- This is a little morbid, but without disease, famine would presumably be the main nonviolent form of disaster. However, no disease also means that amputating limbs to eat would be less risky, and the availability of healing magic could perhaps allow those limbs to be restored in times of plenty.

- It sounds like the default unit of organisation for mages should be a trio containing one with an affinity for each type of mana, one of whom knows siphon, so that each can benefit from the unusable mana reserves of the others.

- I'm aware that you're no longer offering transformation bounties, but two options that I don't think have been ruled out are transforming for superior eyesight and other senses, and transforming into a form that can fly. Both of these would be great boons for recon and guerilla warfare by the elves.

- How distinct are the mind and the brain? I'm assuming that Transforming an elf into an ox wouldn't diminish their intelligence, but what about transforming an ox into an elf? Could that make animal training easier?

- On a similar note, it might be possible for the elves to train large docile animals and Transform them into more dangerous forms for combat, but I expect it would be a challenge to have the Transformed animal fight effectively.

- Lastly, I know you're not looking for setting information but I'm curious why the elves launch attacks on the goblins rather than clearing out the wilderness in their territory, since that's a major cause of deaths and having more farmland would increase the elven population
