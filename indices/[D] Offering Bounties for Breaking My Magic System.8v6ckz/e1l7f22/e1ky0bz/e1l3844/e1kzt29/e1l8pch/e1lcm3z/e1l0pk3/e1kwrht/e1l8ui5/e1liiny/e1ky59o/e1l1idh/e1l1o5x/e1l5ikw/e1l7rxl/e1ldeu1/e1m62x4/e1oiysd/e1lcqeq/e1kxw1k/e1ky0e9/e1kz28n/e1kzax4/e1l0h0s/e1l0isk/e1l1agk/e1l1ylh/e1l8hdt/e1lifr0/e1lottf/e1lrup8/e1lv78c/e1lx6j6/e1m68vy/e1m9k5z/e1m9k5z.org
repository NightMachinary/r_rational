I think the ability of some people to transform into birds has a rather large number of important implications. For instance:

> The goblin-things still hold the fertile plains

If your enemy can ambush you and slaughter you in large numbers with basically zero casualties, *and* has a birds eye view of the landscape, are the goblins really going to be holding *plains*? The goblins should be underground, or in a dense forest, or somewhere similarly dense with cover where the enemy can't simply be dropping exploding rocks from the sky on them with total impunity.

> people live in walled communities and typically only travel via caravan

Are you *sure* it's not easier, safer, faster, cheaper to go to your local travel-and-post-office, staffed by a red mage who will turn you into a rat for an hour and then put you into a little sack, to be carried by people who have mastered bird form whose job it is to constantly be making trips between villages, gizzard filled with lucky healing rocks, mail, and a sack of people-transformed-into-small-animals in their talons? Or if you can automatically learn to fly upon becoming a bird, have them make you into a bird directly and pay for your trip by carrying letters and stuff for other people.

This gets all the more powerful once you get to large cities, which presumably have a couple Magic-Pillars-Of-Turning-Into-A-Bird or disposable Stamps of Knowing Telepathy at the post and travel office or something.

P.S. I think transformations to something of identical volume and mass are cost-less under this system? I don't think you want people turning into teenage dragons or something at no mana cost.

P.P.S. Psychiatrists are definitely going to be spamming Soothe all the time, surgery is really easy now because you can heal afterwards, if telepathy doesn't care about distance then this is probably a primary form of distance communication (use codexes and pre-agreed upon shorthands to increase privacy and decrease message complexity),
