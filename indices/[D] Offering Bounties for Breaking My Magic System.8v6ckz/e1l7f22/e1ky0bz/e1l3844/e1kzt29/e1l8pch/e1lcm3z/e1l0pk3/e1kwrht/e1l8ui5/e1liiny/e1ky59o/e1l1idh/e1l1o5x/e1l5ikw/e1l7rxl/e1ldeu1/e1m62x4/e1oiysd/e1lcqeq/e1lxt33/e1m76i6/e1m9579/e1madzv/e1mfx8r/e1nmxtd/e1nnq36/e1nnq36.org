  I can't model this properly, can you clarify? Are you implying some kind of ray tracing or are you trying to say that nothing blocks light?
#+end_quote

Like the radiosity algorithm.

  Congratulations, everything is a perfect mirror.

I didn't mean to imply that light was never absorbed, or that surfaces were perfectly flat.

  Alright, so I can have a flashlight with kilometres of range? Or I have a camp fire enemies can't see?

Presumably the distance of a filament would be proportional to the energy consumption of the illuminating source.

  So it's magic. Not related to electricity then. No electromagnets.

An entirely plausible hypothesis. My point isn't that these are likely scenarios, my point is that /you don't know/. And, unfortunately for someone trying to deduce it, nobody has run any experiments for us to look at. Presumably nobody has ever even made a coiled wire with a current through it!
