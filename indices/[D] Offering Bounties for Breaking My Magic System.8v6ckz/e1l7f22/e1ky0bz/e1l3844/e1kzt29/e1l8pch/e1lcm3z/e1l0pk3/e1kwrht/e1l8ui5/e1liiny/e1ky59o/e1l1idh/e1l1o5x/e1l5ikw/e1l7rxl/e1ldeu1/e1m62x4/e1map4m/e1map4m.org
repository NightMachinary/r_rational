  When things disappear, what happens to the space they used to occupy?

As the form materializes and travels, it pushes air out of the way. The energy required to do so is accounted for in the 100J delta-energy per MP limit, but is generally negligible. This does mean that attempting to use it in water or some medium denser than air is going to be less effective. When the effect fades, it does so gradually (you can imagine it continuously shrinking away into nothing), and whatever medium it traveled through will flow back to occupy the space.
