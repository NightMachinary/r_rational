Your change to the transformation system moves the level of exploitation I can think of from "obviously broken" to "this could make a 'fun' and horrifying plot twist." There could be a government kidnapping/breeding program that disappears people with forms that could be useful for medicine or arms manufacturing, and uses them with the method of the infamous Dwarf Fortress mermaid thread. Or even just noble houses inbreeding to create war beasts, escalating to a similar scenario.
