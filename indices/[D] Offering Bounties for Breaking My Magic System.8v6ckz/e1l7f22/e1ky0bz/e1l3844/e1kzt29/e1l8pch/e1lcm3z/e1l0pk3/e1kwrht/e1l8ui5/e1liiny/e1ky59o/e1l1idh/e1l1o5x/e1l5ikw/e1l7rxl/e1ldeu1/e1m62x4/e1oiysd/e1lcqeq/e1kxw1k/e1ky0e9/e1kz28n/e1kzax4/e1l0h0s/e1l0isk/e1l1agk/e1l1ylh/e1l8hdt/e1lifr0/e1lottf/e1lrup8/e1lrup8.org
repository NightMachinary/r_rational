Is Scry limited to a few metres above /the ground/, or a few metres above any point under open sky? I can't see why it would be the former, but the latter would be incredibly useful for seeing whole battlefields and scouting. In fact, it would make sense to have some not-elves on watch for the not-goblin hordes suddenly gaining a vague sense of cohesion, which would give advance warning that there's a thinker in there - and then seeing where they go, and thus what areas need to be reinforced.

+Imbue Object and Siphon seem like they should be combinable to make storing MP possible - Imbue an object with whatever enchantment stores the most magic (an enchantment designed to do exactly that would be ideal) and let it recharge over time, and repeat this process. When a storing-magic-item is fully recharged, Siphon it and use that magic to create more magic items, accelerating the creation of them. Eventually you will have enough magic recharging that your civilisation will be recharging magic faster than it can cast it. It might take a while, but as a nationwide project this should be doable.+ Nevermind, someone else got there first.

Transformation says nothing about the mind of the user - is this preserved? If not, transforming into any different species (animals etc.) is suicide, as is any transformation where you aren't specifying "but with the same brain". Also, is it possible to transform into "myself, but smarter"?
