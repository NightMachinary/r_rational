  I only have a high school education of physics, but this doesn't really makes sense to me. If you're releasing water/ice as energy, because of e=MC

  2,

  it's going to take a ton of joules to produce a little energy. And fire is a chemical reaction, if you're getting detailed what exactly is "fire" energy? Is it just a release of heat and light and sound, or is there any chemical reactions being produced?

Apologies, I updated this one after posting to provide more detail as it was definitely too vague. The energy is only the difference in heat, or the kinetic energy imparted. The products of the ability dissipate mere moments after use.

Regarding "fire" or "ice" -- this is a weird thing that nobody really understands, but for some reason, Blue magic lets you create ice-based forms and Red lets you create fire-based forms.
