#+begin_quote
  Do users without magic sensitivity still have the ability to generate and store mana?
#+end_quote

Unknown, but that is a reasonable guess. If so, it isn't in enough quantities to be useful.

#+begin_quote
  ... would you get better/more efficient storage out of imbue item or energy burst (mana crystal form?) and just dumping pure mana into it?
#+end_quote

Imbued objects are not valid targets for Siphon. Energy burst is not known to allow for permanent objects to be created.

#+begin_quote
  ... can you siphon over mana of types you aren't sensitive to to a teammate who is?
#+end_quote

Yes.

#+begin_quote
  Do you need line of sight to use telepathy?
#+end_quote

Nope, but you need to know roughly where the target is in relation to you. This naturally decreases the effectiveness of the ability at large distances without a good deal of practice or use of scrying. I forgot to add that detail.

#+begin_quote
  Would scry count as line of sight for use of telepathy? Would using scry in tandem with telepathy be more mana efficient for a far away target than just using telepathy directly?
#+end_quote

See above. Also, telepathy cost doesn't scale with distance.

#+begin_quote
  Similarly would using luck + foretelling give you a better vision for your mana cost than just using a stronger foretelling?
#+end_quote

To magic cost: it will not. To effect: people have tried this and it is unknown if it actually does anything.

#+begin_quote
  If it is possible for a non-royal-family-member to be sensitive to all three major mana types, does that not count as the same ability?
#+end_quote

It is possible, though there are not any verified accounts of such.

#+begin_quote
  Would soothe be able to make a target more receptive to siphoning, or even willing such that it was a guaranteed thing?
#+end_quote

Possible, though unpredictable, as soothe is a dampening of emotions and it isn't well understood how this works. It would take a lot of magic.
