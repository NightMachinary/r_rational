Can I put in 0 joules? Because it says time to cast is proportional to energy and so is MP. So if I put 0 joules into the object it will be instant and take no MP. With prismatic energy form I can create an infinite array of whatever objects I want and the only restriction is that they aren't permanent. For example, I could create a bajillion copies of a barrel of black powder with a fuse about to go off, and place its form across the entire plains of the goblins (there's also no stated restriction on the location of the forms object). Insta-victory!

Putting MP restrictions on creating the form of the object is a little bit complicated. You could create a cost to create the form based on its mass-energy but then the "putting energy in to it" doesn't make much sense anymore with Earth physics (creating a kilogram of water is about the same as creating a kilogram of super heated hydrogen/oxygen plasma). You'd be fine ignoring General relativity, charging some MP per unit mass, and per unit thermal/kinetic/chemical energy.

But then there's an issue with kinetic energy and Imbue Object. Kinetic Energy has to be defined with respect to something, and if its the caster then you can create an arbitrarily tiny mass object so that a tiny amount of kinetic energy makes it still go arbitrarily fast, imbue object on it to give it the ability to cast Energy Burst and then that object can create other objects going the same speed as it (so 0 kinetic energy from its perspective). Then you have a normal size object moving arbitrarily fast. [[https://what-if.xkcd.com/1/][Ouch]].

In addition to all this you make fraud an irritating concern for anyone with known prismatic abilities because with arbitrary form creation you can create any object (like say an official seal or a bar of gold) and as long as the con happens before it dissipates you're solid.

Here's how I would solve it in a way that retains as many of the original characteristics as possible. I would say: 1) You can place a magical marker on an arbitrarily amount of objects. 2) The process of placing the marker is fragile, super easy to break with access to the object, takes a long time, etc. (so placing it on goblin brains isn't a thing). 3) The object will teleport in front of the mage, paying a cost for any differences in speed/altitude (between the caster and the object) (this is to pay for kinetic energy/gravitational potential energy), and then energy can be put into it.

This way, the mages just prepare by marking a bunch of water/air/arbitrary object and then everything after is basically the same. The red colour mages would have to change from fire to combustibles. Also, there's annoyance because the Earth rotates so if you walk away from the object far enough you start paying some kinetic energy cost (if its on the other side of the equator and its like earth you have to change its speed by 1700 km/hr), but you can just assume that the planet is big enough with respect to the mountains/plains that it wouldn't make much difference in a military campaign.

Also I have to go now so I didn't get time to do my typical proofreading/seeing if other comments came up which make this duplicated, sorry about that.
