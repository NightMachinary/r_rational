  Why do you have to nerf things at all though? Part of the fun of hard fantasy is that the magic *changes* things. All the various practical applications of transformation sound Fun to me. (And if a hard fantasy story isn't the story you're trying to tell...well, in that case it doesn't really matter if it's not logically consistent right?)

Without giving too much away, the magic presented here is kind of auxiliary to other things that are much more influential. But it's still important to get the magic right, and make sure that it doesn't have implications which would make the setting inconsistent, given I also care about making it rational and simulationist.
