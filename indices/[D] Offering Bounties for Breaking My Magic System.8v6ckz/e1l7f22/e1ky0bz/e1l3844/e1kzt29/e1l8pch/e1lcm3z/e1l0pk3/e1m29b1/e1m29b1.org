Hulloes, apologies it took me so long to get to this one. Overall, clever ideas, but for most of these there are issues with your interpretation of the abilities, or they are not ideas I haven't yet considered. However:

  Telepathy also means you have a method of determining longitude while at sea. At local noon (or whenever) on the ship, you talk to/scry the post office in your capitol to find out what time it is there, which lets you compare the times and find what your longitude is. This is a pretty big deal in long range ship navigation.

This is a really neat idea and I will be stealing this. PM me for details on payment, or let me know if you prefer gold.

  You can do much more intensive training on people if you can heal all the 'minor' joint, ligament, bone, and muscle damage to the trainees. Train until your muscles are tearing off your bones, get healed, do it all again tomorrow. You can't do this this IRL because of long recovery times and the build up of incremental damage, but if you can heal all that, go wild.

Clever, but this would actually undo the damage caused by exercise, rendering it ineffectual.
