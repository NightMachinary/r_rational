- Does /Rejuvinate/ apply to MP recovery? If so, then the effects of /Rejuvenate/ persist until your MP has completely recovered. In that case would mana loss to siphon be construed as "damage"? What about mana loss from spell-casting?

- Are sapients the only beings with magic sensitivity or can, say, plants naturally accumulate Green magic? If not, could using /Invigorate/ to increase sapience (reason? wisdom?) expose a latent sensitivity in plants or animals?

- Can you use /Imbue Object/ on a person? If so, do the imbued spells drain from their MP or does the Imbue create a second Prismatic pool? If it creates a prismatic pool can the target access it if they're already sensitive to a color?

- /Energy Burst/ fills a "form" with energy and prismatic energy has no restrictions on what that form is. It's stated that *matter* created with the form is temporary, but the implication is that /energy/ is permanent. That is to say, if you burn something with a Red Energy Burst it doesn't "un burn" a little while later. In that case, you should be able to use a Prismatic energy burst to channel MP directly into a target without siphon by treating the target as the "form". If so, this WOULD allow for mana batteries. They're Imbued Objects with huge base charges that can prismatic burst mana directly into their user.
