Posted this in another comment: The energy travels via some illusory medium from the caster to the target. This cannot be used to directly affect a small area inside of someone's body.

You could maybe aim it very carefully to shoot an icicle through someone's eye or the like. This is completely fine and is adequately modeled by the game systems.
