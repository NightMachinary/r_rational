  I've got a bunch of questions though I'm sure you'll answer them in the way that doesn't clearly break the system.

So the thing is, I have intuitive/explicit models of how the magic /should work/ that are far more defined than pithy descriptions allow me to easily convey without prohibitive effort. Also, a lot of it is intentionally vague so as not to give away more information than I would prefer to. And simple illusion of transparency means that there are going to be numerous cases where I fail to adequately convey those intuitions even after attempting to answer clarification questions.

It isn't the case that the uncertainty in your mind created by lack of adequate description on my part can resolve to literally any interpretation. Indeed, a lot of the finer points are mostly already defined by the elements I have intuitively pinned down, even if I haven't actually considered them yet in that amount of detail.

TBH the whole process is immensely taxing and I'm going to have to take a break for a couple hours at least. I would appreciate though if you could not imply that I'm trying to cheat on answers, though -- this is just really hard to do for one person.
