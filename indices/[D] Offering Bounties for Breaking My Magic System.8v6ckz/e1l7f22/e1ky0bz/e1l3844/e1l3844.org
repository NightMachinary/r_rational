The first thing that comes to mind is transforming into a creature that contains valuable polymers or chemicals that are just a difficult to manufacture configuration of common elements. For direct combat application, grow glands that produce incredibly potent venom from rare, very small animals that wouldn't be a feasible source of poison ordinarily. Then extract the venom and put it in toxic gas, giving the not-elves chemical weapons at at least a WWI level that should wipe out any group of goblin-things too stupid to be wearing gas masks. Which is most of them.
