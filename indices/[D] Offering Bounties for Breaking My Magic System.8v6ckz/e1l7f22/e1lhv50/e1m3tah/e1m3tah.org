[[/u/Frommerman][u/Frommerman]]: Regarding your points about molds, I had to consult with my ex-physics professor co-QM about this one. He brought to my attention that the limits I specified on the ability was problematic. It is in fact total energy change to the environment that should be the limiter, so if you attempted to use Energy Burst to create molds in this way, they would be broken by the heat of the metals. Also, the forms don't last very long, and certainly not long enough to allow forging.

Thanks for your suggestion though, and I'll award a bounty to this for pointing out an issue that needed refinement. PM me with details or let me know if you prefer gold. (E: Donation.)

Regarding the disease stuff, this falls under setting-specific, so I won't be speaking to that.
