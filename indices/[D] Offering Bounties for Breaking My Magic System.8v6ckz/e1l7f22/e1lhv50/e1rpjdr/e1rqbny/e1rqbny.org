Yep, joules can measure both work and energy while watts measure power (the rate at which work is done / energy is transferred).

The way energy burst is specified joules are used as a unit of work ("100J change in physical energy per MP spent"). I.e. up to 100J can be magically transferred to the physical environment per MP. In a comment somewhere in this thread the OP mentions phrasing it that way after a discussion with their physics professor so presumably it's a deliberate choice.
