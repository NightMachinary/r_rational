  A rank novice with a 20 MP cap can create a mold which will withstand 2,000 J of force before shattering
#+end_quote

Since joules measure work rather than force the mold can actually be infinitely strong provided it doesn't do any work - i.e. if it doesn't change shape / move around while full, or otherwise create energy from nothing.

This is /definitely/ exploitable with the right physics, for example making diamonds from graphite with an externally powered magical vise.
