If the Luck spell fades when someone consciously tries to make use of it, this could be avoided by using Imbue Object to give Luck to an object, then giving the object to someone without telling them that it is magical, thus allowing them to use it for its full duration without triggering the condition to prematurely end the magic. This would work even better on people who believe they are lucky, as they'll be more likely to be in situation where they can unconsciously receive the benefit of the spell.
