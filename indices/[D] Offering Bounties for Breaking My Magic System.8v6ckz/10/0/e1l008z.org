  1: Can someone cast an ability with massive MP if magic is being siphoned to them as they cast?
#+end_quote

Heal, Rejuvenate, and Imbue Object would currently allow for this. Other abilities require the magic to be gathered up-front. I don't really want to have to model Siphon being used inside of a cast-time for other abilities, so lets just say that it works, but is very dangerous and is more likely to cause a magical backlash than to increase the effect. (This is actually a mechanic I intend to model)

  2: Can you imbue objects with the ability Siphon?
#+end_quote

Yes, but the magic would go to the person invoking the object, not to the object.

  3: If yes to 1&2, can you use objects imbued with Siphon to support someone casting an ability with massive MP?
#+end_quote

The person casting the ability wouldn't be able to also invoke the object at the same time; too much concentration is necessary.

  4: If yes to 1, can you it to cast Imbue Object with massive MP to create powerful magical objects which recharge?
#+end_quote

Currently, yes, but it may change. There is currently an outstanding bounty in another post to demonstrate to me that this is setting breaking.

  5: If yes to 3&4, can you create a bunch of powerful rechargeable magical objects with Siphon, using the ones that you have already created to aid in the creation of more? And then also create a bunch of other powerful rechargeable magical objects, with whatever other abilities you have?
#+end_quote

The objects created in this way would be limited to the caster's capacity plus the rate that you could use Siphon to transfer magic to the person casting Imbued Object.
