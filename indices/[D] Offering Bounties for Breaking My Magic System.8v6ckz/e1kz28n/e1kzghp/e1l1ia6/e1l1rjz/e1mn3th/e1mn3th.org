You say above that 'words' are conveyed rather than 'sounds'. Might this not imply that 'ideas' are conveyed rather than sound? And they are understood as words because that's how people convey ideas (fitting with the need to be understood by the receiving party.

This would make the issue of volume moot, but raises questions about intonation.\\
Perhaps receivers can also mentally add perceived 'intonation' to messages based on their knowledge of the sender and the specifics of the 'idea' conveyed? (But this intonation would be open to misunderstanding, and also leaves open how intonation is perceived for persons not known by the receiver.)

Also, in line with questions asked above - which properties Are transmitted?

- Is the 'sender' automatically transmitted/known? Can this be faked?\\
- Does one have to be willing to receive messages? (the spamming above suggests not) If yes, can this be selective or is it all or nothing?
