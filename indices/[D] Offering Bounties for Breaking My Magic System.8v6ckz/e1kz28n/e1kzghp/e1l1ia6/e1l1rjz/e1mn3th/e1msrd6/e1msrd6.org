More or less, you sub-vocalize some string of words to yourself, and then that gets transmitted when you use the ability (with some weird bits in the middle handled by the magic). This allows for shifts in intonation related to speech but not for volume changes.

  - Is the 'sender' automatically transmitted/known? Can this be faked?
#+end_quote

The sender is automatically known if the recipient knows them. Otherwise they just hear a voice.

(Just to head this off, I've covered a lot of ground myself on this topic. Don't be surprised if I've already thought of ideas.)
