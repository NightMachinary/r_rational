I've got a bunch of questions though I'm sure you'll answer them in the way that doesn't clearly break the system.

For Imbue object:

How does the Magic Ability get triggered after the caster has imbued an object? Can these Magic Abilities be triggered without a person to use them? E.g. Could I imbue a rock with energy burst to keep hammering the same spot over a long period of time?

How is the Magic Power of the imbued object determined?

Could you imbue a single marble in a bag of marbles with Imbue Object so that it imbues another marble with Imbue Object? And then later both of those marbles imbue two other marbles with Imbue Object? And so on until you had a bag of marbles with a lot of MP?

What happens if a caster tries to imbue an object that has already been imbued (but isn't yet inert)?

What counts as an object? Could a caster imbue a building with Soothe?

For energy burst:

Can the user control the density of the energy? E.g. Can a caster make a large block of ice that isn't filled with much energy and so doesn't cost much MP? Can a caster make a bullet that's imparted with a lot of energy?

What happens when the temporary object fades? E.g. Would this kill a person if they breathed the air of a green energy burst when it disappears?

What does a form consist of? Could a caster make a form that is oil and then burn it? Could a caster make a gold coin and sell it? Could a caster make gunpowder or other explosives? Could a caster make carbon nanotubes?

Do the created forms follow the laws of physics? E.g. if a caster were to create a large rock above someone, would it fall to crush them?

For transformation:

What happens if you reverse a transformation in an area that is smaller than the real body? How fast does this reversal happen?

For all blue magics:

Can these be cast on an involuntary target, either by a caster or by an object imbued with their spells? e.g. could you throw a cube of scrying at a person to take them out of the battle?

For telepathy:

Can a caster send telepathic messages to people who don't want them? Can a caster send a message that's very long but not very complex? E.g. Could a caster send the equivalent of tv static or me saying "Hi" on repeat for 1 hour?

Is a message sent all at once or does it happen over a period of time? If the latter, what happens if the target moves while the caster is sending a message?

For heal and rejuvenate:

Is the mind of the target at all affected by these? E.g. What would these do to someone who had memory loss due to being hit in the head?
