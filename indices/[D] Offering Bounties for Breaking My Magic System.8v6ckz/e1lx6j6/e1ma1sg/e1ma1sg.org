  Minimize Scry's time component to maximize its range.

That's not how it works. Apologies for confusing definition.

  Candidate law of magic: Luck isn't self-aware. Luck exactly can't influence events its existence caused, because it doesn't see them coming. If someone notices that luck prevents bodily harm more strongly than events the target doesn't like, he may cast luck on a bauble to crush it if events don't turn out to his liking. He will find that Luck doesn't know to satisfy him, because it can't figure out that he might crush it, because he only does that because Luck exists.

Thanks, but Luck already has laws -- I am just unwilling to share them.

  Are some future events easier to Foretell than others? I imagine a great beacon constructed for visibility to past Beacon Foretellers. Light it when the Goblins unite under a general once more to warn Elven civilization decades back to raise a generation of soldiers. Depending on how your time loops work, a yet more ambituous project could iterate through policies: If the policies you received work, send them back again. If they don't, vary them using what you learned. Beware that the time loop may resolve to a Goblin general, rebelling noble or third party sending back that which allowed him to conquer the Elves. Instructions may include magic exploits such as how to construct a better temporal telegraph.

Foretelling and time in general doesn't work like that.
