Oh, sure, you obviously wouldn't do it /while/ someone was swinging a sword at you, but if you took a half-second to do so while moving from one enemy to another, it could be very potent. I'd imagine this to be the kind of thing the royal family, at least, would develop a fighting style to accommodate. As long as they didn't /rely/ on the luck, it could work quite well to make them a force to be reckoned with, combat skills aside.
