  By "fades if you try to rely on it" does that mean "fades to no effect" or "takes effect and then fades"?

Yes.

  What kind of action does it take to use an imbued object? Could you have, say, a magician with every link in his chain shirt imbued with Luck and use them repeatedly through combat?
#+end_quote

You could do that, although it would be stupid expensive if you weren't yourself a mage. Also, this doesn't work in practice because it takes time to active items. If you do that while someone's swinging a sword at you, you might not be so lucky.
