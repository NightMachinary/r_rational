  Hmm... but what is the base form? Fats and muscles count right? What about hair? Can you grow out your hair to ridiculous lengths? What about cancer? Can you expose yourself to radiation and grow massive tumors to increase your weight/volume?

I... guess? This would probably kill you sooner than be useful, though.

  And what about reproduction while in a transformed state? Say two people invest large amounts of mana to transform themselves into large fertile creatures of the opposite sex. For simplicity suppose they just transform into larger versions of themselves. They then reproduce. Would the base form of their children then be a larger version of their species? Can they iteratively increase in weight/volume over the generations?

Transformation doesn't allow fine-grained control, and only allows changes to mass and volume aside from the shape-shifting effect. I suppose you could transform into a creature of the opposite sex or attempt to reproduce with another transformed individual. As this is a problematic edge-case that I didn't consider, I will reward this with a bounty and add a caveat that Transformation doesn't allow you to reproduce or to impregnate anything while transformed.

  Or perhaps an even faster method: asexual reproduction. Can you transform yourself into something like a giant amoeba, and then undergo mitosis to create two copies of yourself? Actually you wouldn't even need to be giant in this case, you can just rapidly reproduce to get a large numerical advantage in war.

Has to be based off of the user's experience of actual organisms, and the transformation doesn't let you skirt around physical limitations that would prevent a creature like that from existing in the first place.
