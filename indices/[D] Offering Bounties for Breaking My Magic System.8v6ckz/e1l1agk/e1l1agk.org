How does transformation calculate your weight/size? Can you eat lots of things to get super heavy and fat and thus transform yourself into a more powerful creature? Can you surgically transplant organs/skin/fat from other people into your own body, thus further increasing your weight/volume? Can you iteratively transform yourself into a starving creature of roughly the same weight and volume, eat until you're stuffed, then transform again, effectively increasing your weight and volume without limits (other than things to eat)?

After that, you can transform into a massive behemoth to curb stomp all your enemies. You just have to keep yourself somewhat injured at all times so your transformation can't be dispelled by an enemy heal, although maybe not even that if goblins can't cast heal.
