  Imbued objects are not valid targets for Siphon.

But the spell Siphon lets you give mana to a target right? Can you imbue an item with Siphon and then later use the item to restore mana to a target? This would let you create mana batteries whenever you have spare mana, and then use those batteries to siphon mana back to yourself when you need to cast spells. Or have the entire species keep creating mana batteries whenever they have spare mana, and send those batteries to the frontlines of war.
