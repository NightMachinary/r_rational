But imbuing the object with Siphon would make an object that could be activated to give anyone the energy that is within that object, essentially becoming a mana potion of sorts?

If so, could these be used to give wealthy nobles the ability to play mage themselves, even without the natural ability to regenerate energy?

Also, could a Siphon object or Siphoning apprentice charge someone with more mana than their normal maximum?

Does an item have to be imbued all at once or can it be imbued over time while others siphon energy into you?

Are there energy density limits to how much mana can be imbued into a person or object?

What happens to an imbued object if it breaks, is it all released in some raw form?

Could arbitrarily powerful objects be made with industrial Siphon use to the caster, that are either used as hand-held siege weapons, rapidly regenerating power generators (1% of 100 000 MO is 10 000 MP after all)?

The potential of objects of any size to be imbued with the output of an entire country's magical industry (including any previous such objects imbued with Siphon) seems very interesting, but there is a potential need to put a volume/mass limit on certain sizes, to avoid the creation of Wands of Nuclear Bomb.

Not interested in money, just very fascinated by the magic system and don't necessarily think the ability to make arbitrarily powerful magical items is a bad thing, but can be a source of flavor with massive mana battery/generators being high-value objects being carted to a place where a new wizard's tower is being built to serve as its foundation.

Or tree-lined magical wands that are good for only a few absurdly powerful shots, but can break the walls of cities so easily that city walls are only built to defend against raiders, not enemy nations.

Or temples having a massive metal rock base that is imbued with Siphon to resupply green wizards working there, or Healing to make the wizard himself unnecessary.
