  Firstly, this is a great idea! I hope all the responses aren't overwhelming you.

Thank you! It is indeed pretty overwhelming, but I am rather satisfied with how well it's worked out.

  You've commented that Energy Burst travels via some illusory medium. Depending on what blocks it, that could lead to those fearing such attacks wearing protection like wide-brimmed hats with long veils. These wouldn't absorb energy but instead block the illusory medium. Of course, it could easily be that you can just target the hat and the ice spike will continue on through.

This is pretty clever, and I like it as a worldbuilding detail. +1 bounty. PM me for payment details or let me know if you prefer gold. (E: Claimed)

  It's possible to make lenses out of ice. Energy Burst with blue mana could create such lenses temporarily, for a cost of only 1MP. This might be more economical than scrying over long distances when line of sight is available. Archimedes-style solar weapons using giant lenses probably aren't possible, though.

This doesn't work; the form don't last long enough to be useful for anything.

  When making kinetic attacks with Energy Burst, is kinetic energy measured in the caster's frame of reference or in the frame of the planet? If it's the caster's frame, you could see magical jousts where casters launch their attacks from the backs of galloping horses so that the kinetic energy of the attack is higher in the frame of a target they're charging towards. If it's measured from a particular part of the caster, like the hand, Transformation could be used to put that part on a long, flexible limb, so that the spell can be released as that part is being whipped towards the enemy.

Haven't considered this; will get back to you after consulting with physics-QM.

  In a similar manner to the Transformation for venom, could Energy Burst with green mana be used to produce a burst of nature-based energy in the form of poison or acid? That could cause more harm than might otherwise be possible, as minimal physical energy would need to be imparted. Of course, the substance would have to be fast-acting enough to cause harm before it vanishes.
#+end_quote

This is limited by the energy change in the environment, so you couldn't cause more absolute damage than with a fireball, but it would let you have some control over what kind of damage you cause (frostbite vs burns vs acid burns).

  Is the time horizon of Luck distinct from its duration? If you've narrowed a battle plan down to two options, would it help to cast Luck then toss a coin to choose between them? If a personal stake is required, you could also bet on the outcome of the battle. From the sound of it, it would be hard to tell whether this works or not - it might be a sort of superstition that some generals have. It probably counts as relying on Luck, too.

Who knows? ;)

  You've mentioned magical backlash as a possibility that is more likely when Siphon is used. Would Luck help to avoid this? Also, could this be used to counterspell by sending mana (ideally of a kind useless to both sender and receiver) to a caster as they're casting?
#+end_quote

Clever idea. :)
