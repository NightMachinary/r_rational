[Wrote these before reading other comments to avoid contamination, so may repeat things. ]

The *magic transferring* is going to be the biggest thing. You can effectively get around any of the mana restrictions by having enough minions to get the magic from them.

Depending on how fast magic builds up/dissipates in a person then you would either have arrangements with as many people as possible to regularly give you their mana, or have them all kept nearby for when needed. If it's a semifuedal society then you would probably make them your close servants/retainers. Having a large retinue would be important for retaining power and status. [This would end up being similar to how breath works in Sanderson's Warbreaker, or the magic in the Black Magician series.]

The next bit depends a lot on how much mana an individual can hold and for how long:

- if there isn't a limit and it dissipates slowly/not at all then you would end up with individuals building up as much as possible, under they are storing a nuclear level amount personally. (This would fit in well with the fuedal lords, e.g. each lord has a couple of hundred serfs who ritualistically give them mana regularly).
- If it dissipates or is capped then you would have people absorbing as much as possible, then putting it into objects and stockpiling those. (They effectively become mana storage batteries, but with a specific use.) Which ends up with a similar dynamic, but items are potentially easier to steal, deny access to, or buy and sell.
- If these items can be used by anyone, then you have an equivalent of the invention of gunpowder, where you could equip a group of soldiers with premade magic items, making them as powerful as mages for the length of a battle. This would be a potential way to explain why the not-elves have maintained military superiority, if they have squads of professional trained soldiers all with magic weapons, and the enemy has rare mages and lots of grunts. (Again the firearms analogy).
- Socially this also changes the role of mages from front line combatants to manufacturing weapons en masse, and means having a separate professional soldier class using the weapons.

If magic is capped/dissipates, but mass production of items isn't an option: You would have mages with teams entourages of dozens/hundreds on hand to power their abilities. E.g. in a battle situation a mage effectively acts like an artillery piece, with minions as ammo, continuously rotating to refill them. Tactically this means defending the entourage is important, and by killing them you can disable opposing magic users. Also since they are a limited resource the mages will run out eventually, so the side with the bigger supply has a major advantage. So how fast you use your reserves compared to your opponent is key. Meaning there might be tactics of forcing your opponent to use theirs up early in a battle.

Another way to nerf the imbued magic items would be to have them also slowly lose magic over time, or only be usable by the the original maker.

*Telepathy/scrying* gives a massive military advantage, allowing the side with the better mages (presumably the elves) to have a level of information and coordination that wasn't possible until the modern age. Obviously this makes it easier for them to set ambushes, send small groups to intercept, etc. Total information superiority is a big deal. So you may want to add an antiscrying ability? Scrying can also be used as an equivalent of telepathy, if you have someone write information in a pre specified location a scryer can read the messages. Which might allow you to get around some of telepathy's restrictions, in exchange for the added restriction that its one way. E.g. a soldier i the field can write out a page long report and leave it on top of a predeignated rock, bypassing the information restrictions on telepaths, With two scryers you can have an instant messenger style conversation with them each writing on paper and reading the otehrs paper.

Also, havign fast long distance communication means you can have a much more modern centralised state and culture than would be possible before the modern era on earth. Meaning fuedal lords would be much less independent, and news travels a lot faster. Which has various politicla and economic implications. Combines interestingly with people not being able to travel much because of the monsters etc, as that means walled cities with telepaths can be culturally and politically linked, but the people rarely interact in person

*Where does the food come from?*

- For the elves, you say they are on a small area of not very fertile land, does that mean they have a strictly limited population (much smaller than their original one) and frequent food shortages? That makes control of land and population control a big deal politically.

- For the goblin/orcs, do they have a cohesive enough society and enough intelligence to have large scale farming? If not I can't see them maintaining a population without magical assistance. This then opens the question of why they are good enough at coordinating for that, but not for other things.

Related to that, I'm not a big fan of the big dumb warrior race trope in general. Since its hard to do well without getting into uncomfortable territory. Though there are ways you can play with it. How do they maintain larg enough societies for food etc, if they are innately violent or stupid? Is there some limitation that only comes out as groups get larger? Could there be tribes who were coordinated enough that the elves could trade with them? That opens interesting possibilities with havign different not-goblin nations trading with the elves or acting as buffer states/mercenaries. Also allows things like selling some good quality weapons to one tribe and setting them off aginst their neighbours

*edit* also, there's al sorts of fun you ca have if invigorate spells can be used for magic power, intelligence, speed of thought, skill in magic, etc. But I assume those would be not allowed. Maybe make a hard rule that it can only apply to physical attributes? Being able to remove the need for sleep or food would aso be a big deal

*edit 2* Can energy burst pass through objects? If yes, then I create an extremely thin but large and wide sheet at approximately neck height in the middle of an enemy formation, killing them en masse. In general it would also be most useful to deploy very small shapes targetted at vital areas. (Tiny amount in the eye/brain is often fatal.)
