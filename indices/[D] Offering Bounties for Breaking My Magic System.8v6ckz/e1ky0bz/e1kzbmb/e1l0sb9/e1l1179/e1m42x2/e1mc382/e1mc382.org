  You could imbue a prismatic energy burst of extremely low MP cost, triggering a pulse of ultraviolet light. The Imbued coins will (slowly) recover their MP, and you'd only need to use it to verify coins during transactions.

  This would be an "imbued object that imbues objects" thing. One of the kings, having a frustrating run in with counterfeiters decides to charge for 10 years to create The Royal Mint. The mint is an enormous stamping machine that casts Imbue Object>Energy Burst as previously described.

  It's absolutely a revolutionary feat, but not an impossible one. It's exactly the kind of thing I'd expect a royal archmage to do in a fit of pique. This also creates a reason why a non-royal with prismatic affinity is socially dangerous, he can print money!

I had to patch Imbue Object; it now decays over time, and there is not really any mechanism that would allow mere mortals to imbue something with enough magic to allow for this.
