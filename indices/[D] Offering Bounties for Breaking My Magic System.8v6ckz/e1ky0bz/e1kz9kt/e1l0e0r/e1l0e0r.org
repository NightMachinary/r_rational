  Time and mana are both important, but we're talking order minutes for an expert mage to put all of their capacity into an object.

Wait, so if you get about 10% of your MP back per minute, an expert mage can dump all their MP into a new object every ten minutes, over and over? So for a four-hour work day I can crank out 24 wands? That seems super broken. At that point MP isn't even a limitation in a fight, because everyone has a bandolier of wands that they made the day before. And now your resource concerns aren't "I can only cast so many spells per day/combat" (per day already nuked by 10-minute regen time), but "I can only carry so many wands."

Especially if imbued objects can be used by non-wizards. In which case, wizards should never leave home. Just make wands.

One in a two hundred people is a trained wizard. So in just over eight days, everyone in the entire population can have a Wand of Healing. (okay fine, you need to be an advanced wizard to make wands and regen mana this quickly, so if you need to be in the top 10% of wizards to do this it takes society about three months to give everyone a magic item). I'm not sure that's what you want?
