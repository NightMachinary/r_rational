  Wait, so if you get about 10% of your MP back per minute, an expert mage can dump all their MP into a new object every ten minutes, over and over? So for a four-hour work day I can crank out 24 wands? That seems super broken. At that point MP isn't even a limitation in a fight, because everyone has a bandolier of wands that they made the day before. And now your resource concerns aren't "I can only cast so many spells per day/combat" (per day already nuked by 10-minute regen time), but "I can only carry so many wands."

  Especially if imbued objects can be used by non-wizards. In which case, wizards should never leave home. Just make wands.

  One in a two hundred people is a trained wizard. So in just over eight days, everyone in the entire population can have a Wand of Healing. (okay fine, you need to be an advanced wizard to make wands and regen mana this quickly, so if you need to be in the top 10% of wizards to do this it takes society about three months to give everyone a magic item). I'm not sure that's what you want?

There is a significant upfront cost to Imbue Object (intentionally so) that I believe makes this infeasible; you get pretty strong diminishing returns by making wands. I suppose you could set an expert mage to mass-producing +5 hp potions or one-time-use campfire-starters, but I'm unconvinced that this is the best use of that mage's time, or that it would be particularly setting-breaking. If you don't immediately die from wounds, healing is going to be pretty plentiful anyway.
