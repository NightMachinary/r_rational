  When making kinetic attacks with Energy Burst, is kinetic energy measured in the caster's frame of reference or in the frame of the planet? If it's the caster's frame, you could see magical jousts where casters launch their attacks from the backs of galloping horses so that the kinetic energy of the attack is higher in the frame of a target they're charging towards. If it's measured from a particular part of the caster, like the hand, Transformation could be used to put that part on a long, flexible limb, so that the spell can be released as that part is being whipped towards the enemy.

We have ruled that this will be from the reference frame of the user, and have added addition rules for how this applies to the game mechanics. +1 additional bounty for prompting a useful clarification.
