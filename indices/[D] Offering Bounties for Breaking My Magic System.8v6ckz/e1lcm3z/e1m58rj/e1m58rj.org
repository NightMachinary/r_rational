  It's possible to make lenses out of ice. Energy Burst with blue mana could create such lenses temporarily, for a cost of only 1MP. This might be more economical than scrying over long distances when line of sight is available. Archimedes-style solar weapons using giant lenses probably aren't possible, though.

It's stated that *matter* created with the form is temporary, but the implication is that /energy/ is permanent. That is to say, if you burn something with a Red Energy Burst it doesn't "un burn" a little while later. In that case, you should be able to use a Blue energy burst to precision freeze a form out of a pool of water. It'd require some craftsmanship, but I'd imagine "Ice Fabricators" in this way would be relatively common since it doesn't require a big MP pool.
