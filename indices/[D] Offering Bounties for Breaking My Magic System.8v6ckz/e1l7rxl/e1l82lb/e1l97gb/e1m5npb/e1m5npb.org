  Can Invigorate target Luck or Magic?
#+end_quote

Nobody knows, and no.

#+begin_quote
  Do multiple magicians' use of it on a single target stack? (I shudder to ask this, but multiplicatively or additively?)
#+end_quote

Maybe? Nobody really knows, and it's kind of dangerous to test.

#+begin_quote
  Does an Imbued Invigorate allow a choice of what to invigorate or is it pre-set?
#+end_quote

It is pre-set.

#+begin_quote
  Can you choose what end to use Foretelling to?
#+end_quote

You cannot.

#+begin_quote
  Can Non-magicians use Imbued items? It occurs to me that a staff of Soothe at every tavern would be ideal for dealing with angry drunks :P
#+end_quote

They can, and this is a thing.

#+begin_quote
  Something worth noting with Imbue Item exploits is that exceptionally few people would be in the position to exploit it.
#+end_quote

Yes, this is something I am going to have to reason more thoroughly about to figure out what level of exploits would be attainable, and how frequently they would occur in the population and over time.
