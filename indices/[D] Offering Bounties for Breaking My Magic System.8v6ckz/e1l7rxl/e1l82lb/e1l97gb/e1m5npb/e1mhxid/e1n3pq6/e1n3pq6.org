  resumably it's dangerous to test because of, for instance, accidentally breaking your arm for Invigorating strength, correct? It'd seem to be possible to stack Invigorates on something like Luck to quickly figure out whether it's possible to stack them AND if Luck is invigorable. (though of course, either of those conditions may not be true and the other was)

  What "level" of magicians' mana would be required for a regenerating Imbued item, if this is something you'd answer? Like Novice/Adept/Expert.

  I assume Rejuvenate doesn't aid in regenerating Mana? Does it instead get rid of mana?

  Could a sufficiently-amoral and skilled magician Transform a great many other magicians into a small shape (and having them on their person) and use them to siphon from, torturing them until they are sufficiently-willing if necessary?
