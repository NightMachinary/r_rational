Additional questions ('nother post for organizational purposes):

Can Invigorate target Luck or Magic?

Do multiple magicians' use of it on a single target stack? (I shudder to ask this, but multiplicatively or additively?)

Does an Imbued Invigorate allow a choice of what to invigorate or is it pre-set?

Can you choose what end to use Foretelling to? Does proximity affect its accuracy? (IE: Cast Foretelling for what meal you'd most enjoy purchasing at a restaurant for high degree of accuracy)

Can Non-magicians use Imbued items? It occurs to me that a staff of Soothe at every tavern would be ideal for dealing with angry drunks :P

Heal says it doesn't reverse aging, but Transformation does not say so. Is this intended?

Something worth noting with Imbue Item exploits is that exceptionally few people would be in the position to exploit it.
