Give the bounty to the ACLU. They need it more than me right now.

Edit: I also realized I was making this way too hard. If Blue mages are allowed to manifest forms in the middle of a barrel of slightly molten candle wax or gallium or something, they can freeze themselves permanent objects around which ceramic molds could be formed. If they are only allowed to manifest objects in open air, they could do a sort of 3D printer impression by selectively freezing the surface and pulling the object out carefully. It would take a ton of skill, but they might be able to turn themselves into a primitive prototyping machine.
