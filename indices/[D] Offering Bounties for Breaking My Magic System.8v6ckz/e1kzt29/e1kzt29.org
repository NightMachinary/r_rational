The immediate idea for a possible exploit that could break the setting comes from the use of Transformation as a means of achieving Immortality by transforming into younger versions of yourself or other people. One possible change you could make to the spell is to have Transformed individuals still suffer from debilitating mental conditions like Alzheimer's disease or dementia that effectively cause their death even if their body is young. This would allow for the existence of a very interesting setting where everyone above a certain social or financial position can retain perpetual youth without having to deal with the massive implications of an undying ruling class.

This may not be necessarily setting breaking but another idea based on Transformation is the potential ability of a Not-Elf to transform himself or a trusted compatriot into a Goblin-Thing. The Transformed Not-Elf could use their superior Not-Elf intellect and technology to acquire a position of power and unify the Goblin-Things. This seems like a great plot bunny as the Dark Lord unifying the monstrous races is a classic trope for a reason.
