Hmm, are you sure about that? 1MP to kill quickly and easily seems on the low side, unless your intent is that magic users are overwhelmingly lethal when in range.

The obvious limit on the effectiveness of cutting this way is the energy required to break chemical bonds intersecting a plane and shear slightly to prevent clean rebonding. That's not much so it's going to allow scything a lot of people at once for that single mana point if they are in range.

Maybe special armor could make the energy cost higher, either a magical counter or a very strongly bonded material (diamond?).

If chemical bonds count as quantum physics then the natural interpretation would be to extrapolate the macroscopic relationship between sharpness and cutting energy indefinitely, and for cutting to become a first class effect (i.e. that which is severed stays severed as there there is no chemical rebonding). That leads to the absurd result of being able to dice up everything in range for arbitrarily little energy. So you probably want to keep chemical bonds, or come up with some mechanism with similar properties.
