  Further, Prismatic energy does not naturally occur, but Blue, Red and Green energies may be combined in equal parts to form Prismatic energy, with all due implications.

That's a bit odd; presumably if each individual color occurs naturally and can combine to create Prismatic energy, there should be conditions for Prismatic energy to naturally arise also.
