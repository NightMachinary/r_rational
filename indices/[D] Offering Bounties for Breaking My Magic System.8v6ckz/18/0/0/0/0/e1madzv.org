  Why do you call them "electromagnetic waves"? Quantum physics isn't a thing.
#+end_quote

Quantum physics is not where EM waves come from. There are phenomena that are so intrinsically linked that no matter what is going on, you'll always get an analogue. A finite speed of propagation of a disturbance in a measurable quantity means you get waves if the medium isn't overdamped.

  Why do you even assume flux is a well-defined quantity?
#+end_quote

If magnets are a thing, magnetic flux and its density are defined via the field strength. You can of course assume that magnets aren't actually magnets, and are instead magic force generators with no relation to electricity at all.

  Heck, how do you even know perpetual motion machines are impossible?

I don't. But there are multiple ways to get there, breaking conservation of energy is just one of them, and it's probably the most harmful example.
