To provide a more concrete example, F=m*d^{2} / dt^{2} x is physics, but it's at the level of math because of calculus. You can't reasonably construct a universe where velocity, acceleration, position, and time are not linked in this way at human scales without making it unihabitable by humans. Similarly, you can find other phenomena you can't reasonably break. Wave phenomena being linked to disturbance with a finite speed of propagation is one of them; any conservative field having a curl of 0 everywhere applies as well. Many of the things you'd think of as physics are at their heart mathematical truths.

  Hypothesis: Light is formed from long conical filaments that reach out from light sources. They interact only weakly. Filaments have a maximum distance determined stochastically; the reason light appears to dim with distance is that some filaments reach their maximum distance. Presumably the distance of a filament would be proportional to the energy consumption of the illuminating source.

Then it's not really purely stochastically anymore. Similarly, you break lenses if light does not have a finite speed of propagation. Meaning no human eyes, and no glasses.

Thermodynamics will also knock on your door if you fiddle with absorption or emission coefficients because them not being equal allows you to heat or cool something indefinitely. Heating an object infinitely is rather problematic and actually has universe-breaking applications.
