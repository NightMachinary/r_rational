This just seems like a lack of imagination.

Hypothesis: Light is instantaneous─it does not travel─and acts through direct coupling of borders of objects: there is no vector field.

Hypothesis: Light is formed from noninteracting discrete perfectly-spherical balls of energy that travel through space. They are scattered stochastically from light sources, and bounce deterministically off hard objects.

Hypothesis: Light is formed from long conical filaments that reach out from light sources. They interact only weakly. Filaments have a maximum distance determined stochastically; the reason light appears to dim with distance is that some filaments reach their maximum distance.

Hypothesis: Magnets are specific metals infested by tiny creatures living in their pores. They are attracted to metals because those creatures have evolved to cast attracting magics to metals in their surroundings that they can feed on.
