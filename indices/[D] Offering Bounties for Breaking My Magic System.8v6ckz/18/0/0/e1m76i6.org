  In our world, yes, but Vecht isn't bound by our world's physics.

Some things in physics aren't arbitrary; they are mathematical truths emerging from rather simple assumptions. One would say common sense even. E.g. the strength of electromagnetic waves always has to scale with 1/r if the wave front keeps its energy. Say you assume that Maxwells equations do not hold; if rot E is not equal to the negative time derivative of magnetic flux density you can have perpetual motion machines because you'll be able to generate infinite energy.
