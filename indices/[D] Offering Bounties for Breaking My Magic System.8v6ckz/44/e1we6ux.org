*Scrying*: map-making / surveillance by scrying 10 km aboveground ("Scry at the target location" doesn't and I think shouldn't specify a height limit).

*Telepathy*: long-range communication between permanent strongholds may be easier by use of physical indicators for direction & distance. For example, you want to talk to someone at Farsville, so you go to the "communications center" which has a long line drawn on the grownd precisely indicating the direction (and somehow distance) to Farsville.

Can you force-communicate to distract an enemy general? Or whistle-communicate subliminal messages? Or pretend to be an actual person speaking?
