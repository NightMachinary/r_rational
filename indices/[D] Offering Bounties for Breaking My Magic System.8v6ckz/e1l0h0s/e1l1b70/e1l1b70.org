  •Telepathy on known locations, like a dedicated "radio room" in fortifications, or having one party stay fixed and the other report their location when they sign off. A coordinate system that communicates where the sender will be moving to in as few data points as possible would be useful (like GPS coordinates)

  •Telepathy communicating bare minimum information over longer distances then your enemy can be very useful. "On/Off", "Yes/No", or a codebook for numbers for preset messages would allow armies to coordinate quickly over long distances. That in turn allows you to cover a wider area with less men.

Yep; good ideas but this is not something I haven't considered.

  •Imbuing Energy Bursts seems to be the best use of an Expert's time, if a little boring (especially if you can spend your MP when you know it won't be useable otherwise, or make an Imbued/Siphon battery to hold MP until later). Imbued massive explosions make good artillery, landmines for treacherous mountain passes, maybe even phaser blasts at range.

Mostly I don't think this is going to be very useful except for cantrips. Expert mages might be able to create one-time use items that are pretty nifty, but not the level of explosions or phaser blasts. This is intentional.

  •Can you Energy Burst inside a person's body?

You cannot.
