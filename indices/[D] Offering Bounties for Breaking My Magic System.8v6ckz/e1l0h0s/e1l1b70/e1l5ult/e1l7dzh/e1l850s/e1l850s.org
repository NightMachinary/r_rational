Ahh, I'm not worried about the bounty. I did see that comment, but I was quibbling over the definition of 'inside the body' because the others you'd replied to had discussed brain stem and other internals, while mouth or ear canal technically are outside, I was curious if that would make a difference. For example, imagine the form of a 10mm diameter sphere of fire/plasma/lava/electricity inside someones ear canal.

I hadn't thought about the definition of target though. How is the target set and defined? You mention being able to imagine a form, and then releasing a burst of energy which fills that form, but where does the form appear and how much control does the caster have over the appearance location?
