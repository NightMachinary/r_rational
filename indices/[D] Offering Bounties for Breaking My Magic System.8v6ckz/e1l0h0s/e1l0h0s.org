•Telepathy on known locations, like a dedicated "radio room" in fortifications, or having one party stay fixed and the other report their location when they sign off. A coordinate system that communicates where the sender will be moving to in as few data points as possible would be useful (like GPS coordinates)

•Telepathy communicating bare minimum information over longer distances then your enemy can be very useful. "On/Off", "Yes/No", or a codebook for numbers for preset messages would allow armies to coordinate quickly over long distances. That in turn allows you to cover a wider area with less men.

•Scry would be GREAT for artillery spotting.

•Use Foretelling to answer questions with the least number of potential outcomes, with the maximum amount of MP. Better then guessing is still advantageous when you only have a small number of variables.

•Imbuing Energy Bursts seems to be the best use of an Expert's time, if a little boring (especially if you can spend your MP when you know it won't be useable otherwise, or make an Imbued/Siphon battery to hold MP until later). Imbued massive explosions make good artillery, landmines for treacherous mountain passes, maybe even phaser blasts at range.

•Can you Energy Burst inside a person's body?
