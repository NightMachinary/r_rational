Some tangential questions about the setting:

#+begin_quote
  Disease does not exist in this world.
#+end_quote

How and why is that? Are there microorganisms that don't cause disease? Do parasites exist, either of the sapient races or of wild animals and such?

#+begin_quote
  Any color can be used to power Prismatic abilities, and Prismatic Energy may be used to power any color of magic ability. Further, Prismatic energy does not naturally occur, but Blue, Red and Green energies may be combined in equal parts to form Prismatic energy, with all due implications.
#+end_quote

To clarify, could you use (for example) 100 red mages, 1 blue mage, and 1 green mage to cast prismatic magic at the level of ~102 mages? 1 of each colour for the initial prismatic cast and the extra 99 to provide extra juice after.

Ideas for the setting:

You didn't specify that transformations have a time limit, and it's not clear what exactly the benefits of mastering a form are other than the time to transform into that form being shortened. Regarding the not-elves tending to lose in 1-1 fights or evenly matched skirmishes, I thought of the not-elves having dedicated red mages for the purpose of transforming willing soldiers into more powerful forms---stronger and faster versions of themselves, or deadly wilderness creatures, or even goblin-things. I'd expect the mass/volume limits to be the biggest bottleneck.

A force of soldiers transformed in this way would be most effectively placed as border patrollers, or they could be used to make inroads into the fertile plains. Could they transform into, say, venomous snakes that weigh as much as a not-elf? Would the venom injected into other creatures persist if the transformation was undone?
