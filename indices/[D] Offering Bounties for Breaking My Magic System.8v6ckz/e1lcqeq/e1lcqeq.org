  Relativity isn't a thing, nor is quantum physics. No one has put any time or effort towards understanding how things happen on large, fast, or small scales, but for meta reasons it's a safe bet that magic acts exactly as is necessary to make things work as observed at human-scales, regardless of how complex that would make the object-level laws of magic and physics.

I think you just broke magnets. Magnetism is an effect that occurs at human scales due to special relativity for currents, and a combination of SR and quantum mechanics at small scales.
