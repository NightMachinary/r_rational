Why do you call them "electromagnetic waves"? Quantum physics isn't a thing. Why do you assume the wave front keeps its energy? Why do you even assume flux is a well-defined quantity? Heck, how do you even know perpetual motion machines are impossible? There are a billion ways to make magnets work in magnet-esque ways; this is clearly not Earth physics so the /only/ thing you know for sure is that it /isn't/ our way.
