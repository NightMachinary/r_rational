Imbue Object seems ripe for abuse.

Can a mage Imbue an object with enough power that it recharges itself in ~1 month, and has the ability to cast 'Imbue Object', passing on a lesser form of its abilities?

Is mana or time the main bottleneck for imbuing objects? If it's mana, then Siphon on captured enemies, willing apprentices (who would be useful even if they never get trained), or other self-charging objects (if they are a valid target) could speed up the creation process enough to unbalance things.

What are the limits on mana capacity for imbued objects? Can a mage spend five years pouring power into an object imbued with Energy Burst, then release it all at once to destroy a castle in a single blow?

Transformation is permanent (unless countered with Heal)? I see two strategies that make logistics easier for an army.

First, transform every soldier into a "normal" form, so that all equipment (armor, boots, etc.) is perfectly interchangeable. This can also replace physical conditioning if the mages are precise enough.

Second, if animals are a valid target, transform a cow into a mouse (spending ~1 hour to shrink it), carry it where you're going (and feed it over time), de-transform it, then eat it. Depending on how hard it is to do, this may only be useful for Special Forces.

This is probably just an artifact of your summary, but one joule of electricity is /far/ deadlier than one joule of fire or water jets.

Telepathy can be heavily optimized through the use of code, although your familiarity/complexity costs may cover that already. "3-7" /sounds/ simpler than "A force of approximately 100 goblin-things are currently traversing the North-East pass", but it conveys the same information.
