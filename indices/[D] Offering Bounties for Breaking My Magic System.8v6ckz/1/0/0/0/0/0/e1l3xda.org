  If a 250MP archmage can make something worthwhile, and 13 novices with 20MP can team up with Siphon to make that same item, you still run into the same issue of being able to equip the entire population pretty frequently. So unless the only worthwhile magic items require teams of powerful wizards using Siphon, it still seems like magic item creation is easy.

  Even taking into account that a novice would take 13 times as long, his Siphon buddies would be able to run in parallel with other crafters, since they're just limited by their MP regeneration rate

Okay, you've convinced me that magic gained from Siphon shouldn't be able to be used towards Imbue Object, only the user's base magic. I will offer you the $15 bounty and the $5 bounty to ulyssessword for initially pointing this out. PM me with details (or can do reddit gold as another person requested).
