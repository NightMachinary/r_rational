Ooh, another thought about transformation. Elephants live for 60-70 years, mice live for 2-3 years. If I transform a 6 month old elephant into a mouse, let it live as a mouse for a year, and then transform it back, is it now a 20-year-old elephant (equivalent amount of aging as a mouse) or is it still only a 1.5 year old elephant?

If they age, that opens you up to all sorts of fun with sped up breeding, you could whelp a litter and have them aged up to breeding age in a fraction of the time it would normally take.
