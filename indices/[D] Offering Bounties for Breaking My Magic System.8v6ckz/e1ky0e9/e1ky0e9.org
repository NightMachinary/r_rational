  The user concentrates on a form, and then charges and releases a burst of energy which fills that form. The energy can be in whatever form the user imagines (with restrictions on color of magic used; blue=water/ice, red=fire, green=electric or nature-based, prismatic=no restriction). The energy released (in terms of Joules) is proportional to the magic spent.

I only have a high school education of physics, but this doesn't really makes sense to me. If you're releasing water/ice as energy, because of e=MC^{2,} it's going to take a ton of joules to produce a little energy. And fire is a chemical reaction, if you're getting detailed what exactly is "fire" energy? Is it just a release of heat and light and sound, or is there any chemical reactions being produced?
