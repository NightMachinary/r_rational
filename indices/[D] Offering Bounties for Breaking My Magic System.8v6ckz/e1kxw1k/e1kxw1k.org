Edited to add questions I think of them:

How is mana spent, how quickly can it be spent, and how quick does it regenerate?

Can magic users combine forces, like 2 users combining the power put into an energy burst to double the power?

How is complexity measured for telepathy?

Can invigorate be used to affect mana capacity or regeneration and can siphon be used on yourself?

For transformation, is the proportion for calculating mana cost multiplicative or linear? Could I make something zero liters without changing the mass? Does shrinking something act like adding pressure and "squeezing" the target into the desired shape and the reverse for growing? Do the prim people of your world know about tardigrades?

Can you cast luck on yourself multiple times and if so do they stack?

Does soothe have a limitation on distance and is it single target or AOE?

Does hunger/thirst count as damage for rejuvenate and can it heal mental illness? What can't it heal? Can rejuvenate revive dead people?
