#+begin_quote
  Maturin returns from her shell
#+end_quote

Very subjective but I don't really like this phrasing.

#+begin_quote
  knowing that any second now he'd realize
#+end_quote

Should probably be "he'll."

#+begin_quote
  It tumbles backward, then catches itself in the air before it falls and flaps the water from its feathers as it hovers warily in place.
#+end_quote

I think this phrasing could be improved, esp. the "before it falls..."

#+begin_quote
  Meanwhile Maturin's head is back in her shell, standing upright and waiting for her next command.
#+end_quote

Maturin's head is the subject of the first but not the second clause.

#+begin_quote
  Her legs all kick out at once in the same direction
#+end_quote

A bit unclear imo.

#+begin_quote
  He'll have to rely on speed and some diversity.
#+end_quote

"Diversity" seems weird to me here.

#+begin_quote
  as some of the fire lands on his long white hair or wooden skin.
#+end_quote

Should maybe be "and."

#+begin_quote
  If he doesn't know better he'd say Jarod is being nice, in his own way.
#+end_quote

Sounds bad to me. You could say "if he didn't". It wouldn't be past tense, but subjunctive.

#+begin_quote
  Blue's shiftry hops forward from one foot to the other as the onix heaves rocks through the air with its tail, but Kemuri has already closed the distance between them and cuts the onix's grey hide with his leaves.
#+end_quote

Phrasing could be improved imo.

#+begin_quote
  if Kemuri's mobility is restricted, he would be in trouble.
#+end_quote

"Were restricted" or "will be" imo.

#+begin_quote
  It crashes to the ground on Kemuri's side, and soon its arms are a blur as bits of green particles flow in a mini cyclone toward the onix, far tighter and more directed than stray bits of leaf normally might.
#+end_quote

"It" refers to two diff. things in this sentence, and other times you use "he" for Kemuri.

#+begin_quote
  Red has a moment to wonder if that would work when Kemuri blinks, glow fading from its eyes.
#+end_quote

I think "would" is weird here.

#+begin_quote
  If Maturin didn't duck its head in immediately after, it would be crushed like an egg.
#+end_quote

Same, but more the context/meaning that strictly grammar. Like, why isn't it "doesn't/will" or "didn't/would have been"?
