I don't know if you've answered this in a previous thread or not as this is my first time on the sub. Anyways, I realized recently that Nuzleaf evolves into Shiftry through a leafstone. How do you explain the large group of Shiftry in Viridian Forest, or similar evolutions, like the Raichu? Are evolutionary stones even a thing in your story? Love the story btw!
