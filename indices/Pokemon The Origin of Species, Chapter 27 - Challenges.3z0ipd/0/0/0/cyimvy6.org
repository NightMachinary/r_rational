The difference is that Red and Blue both went out EXPECTING to succeed on their first try. Both had huge ambition and jumped in without really getting ready. Leaf is going very slow, getting lots of feedback and doesn't expect anything big to come from it. I can see her getting a huge impact with negative consequences, which she seems to be willfully ignoring the possibility of.
