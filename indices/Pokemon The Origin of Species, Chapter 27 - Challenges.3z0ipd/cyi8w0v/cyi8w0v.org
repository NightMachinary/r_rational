Hey all, welcome back and happy new year! Thanks for all the great suggestions for the Patreon. I should be launching it within the next month, and will link to it through Reddit posts first to help facilitate initial feedback more quickly.

A note on pokemon taxonomy: though a number of amusing comics have pointed out the confusion of a Pokemon world native to words like "rat" or "dog" in the pokedex or despite the (nearly universal) lack of our world's animals in theirs, I've never found this particular detail to be problematic. "Dog" is not a specific animal: it's a wide family of very closely related animals, more specific than canid but less specific than German Shepard. Houndour and Stoutland are dogs. There are no American Bald Eagles in Pokemon, or even Unovan Bald Eagles, but there are still eagles, such as Braviary and Staraptor, the latter of which could also be called a hawk depending on what features you focus on.

The point is that ekans is a snake and onix is a snake, despite them both being very different creatures, because both share enough descriptive traits to be grouped under the category "snake." It might be more colloquial and less scientific in the pokemon world than in ours, but labels are just boxes that we draw around things that are similar enough to ease communication, and there's no reason that would be less true in a world of wildly different magical beasts just because they also have other labels to use, like Fire type and Electric type.

Happy reading, and all feedback welcome!
