I'm calling it now - Balthazar is going to relate the goblinfire to demon summoning to defend himself. It's unlikely the Holies will be able to use the same excuse though.

Yes I know "nobody knows" about goblinfire being demon/devil essence - I think this is how the secret gets out - which will cull Cat's ability to use goblinfire in the future.
