Yeah, but I was worried about something along the lines of Balthazar immediately stabbing her and them burning the body. Probably would've been a good idea to do that from the beginning actually, just assassinate her in secret once the Augur is out of the way and elect Rozala. Actually kinda funny how badly they botched the coup all things considered. Anyways, soldiers being there should negate the risk of them immediately killing her though.
