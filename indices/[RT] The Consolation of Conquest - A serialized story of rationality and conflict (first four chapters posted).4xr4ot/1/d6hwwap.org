So let's see what I've managed to figure out so far.

- Strong AI is a thing, but is "like getting a checkers AI to play chess". Strong in unpredictable ways.

- Most software is distributed, made up of smart contracts?

- The realized have "magic", probably a factor of the aforementioned strong AI.

  - Reads like worm, called "conquest". Protagonist has no skills. AI magic a substitute for powers?

- What is ikon?

  - Ikon is referenced as a car
  - "Ikon was live". ikon is referenced as software
  - ikon is an AI? For driving cars? Scope unclear, maybe everyone has a personal ikon.
  - ikon is a smart-contract distribution? Less narrativly-interesting then ikon being an AI. Toyota vets smart contracts, makes cars.
