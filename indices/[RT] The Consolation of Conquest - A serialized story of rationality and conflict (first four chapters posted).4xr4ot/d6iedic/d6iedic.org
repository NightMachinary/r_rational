Bookmarked - interesting story idea, I'm excited to read further.

If anyone isn't already familiar with mrphaeton, please read his Significant Digits. There are a number of HPMOR fan fictions, but none are quite as well-written and true in spirit to EY's work than Sig Digits. In Eliezer's own words, it is the "definitive" continuation fic. I would argue that Significant Digits surpasses the original fic in a number of ways, but most especially with world building. High recommend.
