I wanted to wait until I had a substantial amount up to link the story, but from now on I'll link each chapter from here. If you'd like to discuss any of the past chapters, there are threads on [[/r/AiH]]:

Here's the blurb for the story as a whole:

/Nothing makes sense. Sophia is trapped with her abusive family, inside of a corrupt town that's part of a rotten world, and things seem to get worse every day. For every advance in robotics and transportation, there's another war or another plague. And she's not sure how much more she can take./

/A world with a singleton wasn't supposed to be this way. When Ramanujan became the first artificial superintelligence, it was supposed to solve all problems or end the world or... something. But there was neither apocalypse nor apotheosis. God was born, looked upon creation, and went to sleep./

/Sophia is ready for a new world. If she has to, she'll make it herself. One conquest at a time./
