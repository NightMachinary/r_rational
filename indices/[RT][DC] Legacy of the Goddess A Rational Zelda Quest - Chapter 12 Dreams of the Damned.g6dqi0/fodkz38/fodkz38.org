Going to compile things into some semblance of a plan, although I welcome anyone else doing this (for this thread or the future).

*Plan: Riposte*

Conversation:

- General reply approach: Rebuttal.
- The Lynx is cherry-picking a single mistake from among our many decisions - and that mistake could have easily be avoided if we had access to more information. We've been flying blind, and answers will put is in a better position to make good decisions in the future.
- Choosing not to help us has a much higher risk that we'll do something unexpected in the future. Cooperation will minimize the risk that we will act without reasonable information in the future.
- We are no without our own accomplishments, even without Hylia's aid, such as making Link a Lightsworn.
- She asked us to come to her, not the other way around. We have been more than reasonable, deferring other responsibilities to come to a meeting that the Lynx requested. We will not be bullied or demeaned.
- Ask questions.
- What is the Lynx referring to when she talks about "our" Mother goddess? Who is /her/ mother goddess?
- Reiterate that the Lynx never answered about how she knew "all this" about Hylia, etc.
- Ask out who actually killed Hylia. Also /how/ and /why/.
- Ask out what the general capabilities and motivations of this Hylia-killing entity.
- How can we fight this entity?
- What are the Lynx's goals? Why did she contact us in the first place?
- Try to find out more about the location in Link's dream that may be nearby. If the Lynx isn't helpful here, have Link investigate through other means later.
- Try to find out more about the triforce fragments, locations, etc.
- Don't be afraid to abandon specific lines of conversation if they are obviously agitating the Lynx. We won't be cowed, but we can still be surgical with our dialogue choices.

Other: * Depending on how large of a time period the next chapter covers, I'd like to begin testing if Zelda can safely transfer mana to Fi, and if so, if we could start a chain of transferring "excess" mana from others (e.g. sheikah) through Zelda and Link to Fi with the goal of gathering additional Void Power each day through this "excess" power.
