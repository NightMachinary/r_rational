The Blin attack, the Warlord, and one of the assassination attempts were thwarted by Hylia empowering Zelda. Not Zelda being competent. Or at least that's the obvious retort. Link's lightsworn status is probably the clearest win Zelda's got. Unless Lynx complains about the egg being destroyed in the process.

Maybe Link can get a second opinion on the desert location?
