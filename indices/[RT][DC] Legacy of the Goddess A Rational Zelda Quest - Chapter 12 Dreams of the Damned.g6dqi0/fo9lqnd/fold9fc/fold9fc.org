  Following my research, I believe it would be possible to reverse engineer a mechanism that would allow me to identify sources of Old Magic using approximately 50x less Void Power than my current approach.

Fi, how much Void Power are you currently using when trying to identify sources of Old Magic?

Edit: Vecht kindly pointed out that we had data on this back in Chapter 8. According to my very rough estimates Fi spent exactly 347 VP and tested at least 14 times. That gave an average of 24ish per test. So reducing by 50x would reduce the cost of testing to about 1 VP.
