  Observe time-sensitive changes to Link regarding Old Magic and/or Void Power
#+end_quote

I can confirm that I observed Link's essence being supplemented and altered to ᏇᏅᏇᎺᏯ'ᏨᎤᎾ ᏊᏫᏅ ᎹᏨᎤᏅᏨᏬ ᏪᎾᏅᏨᎤᎤ ᏭᏅᏅᏨᎤᎤ ᏊᎺᏅᎹ'ᏬᏨᎤᎹ'ᏅᏨᏨᎹᏅ ᎲᏫᏅᏅᎤᎾᏫᏯ ᏯᏅᏅᏍ' ᏡᎤᎾᏅᎺᎺᏬ during the Lightsworn initiation ritual. As directed, I spent 200 VP doing active scans on Link following the event and did not detect any ongoing changes or residual energies at work; probability ~80%.

  Spend up to 100 VP on researching the old magic detection device to see if its effect can be duplicated without the device or if other magics (e.g. an "identify old magic" rather than a "detect old magic") could be potentially explored.
#+end_quote

I have spent 70 VP investigating an alternative mechanism to identify Old Magic, similar to that used by the device. Note that I am capable of doing this on my own at present by attempting to suffuse an object with Void Power; however, the artifact appears to be capable of the same with significantly greater efficiency.

Following my research, I believe it would be possible to reverse engineer a mechanism that would allow me to identify sources of Old Magic using approximately 50x less Void Power than my current approach. I estimate this would take an additional 575 to 950 VP to complete.

I have also spent 30 VP on research towards reverse-engineering the area detection ability of the artifact. I am not currently aware of any factors that would preclude me from developing such an ability for myself; however, I estimate it would require in excess of 10,000 VP to complete the research, and possibly significantly more.

  What qualifies as "heroic" for the purposes of generating Divine Power? What are the expectations of heroism for a Champion of Hylia?
#+end_quote

I do not at present have a more precise definition of “heroic” in this context than “acting as befits a Champion of Hylia.”

  Did you observe a spike in Divine Power earnings when Link fought the Kodongo?
#+end_quote

Link generated 406 VP during the timespan of 6 days which included the kodongo incident. Due to the close temporal proximity of this event to others, I am unable to give an accounting with finer granularity.
