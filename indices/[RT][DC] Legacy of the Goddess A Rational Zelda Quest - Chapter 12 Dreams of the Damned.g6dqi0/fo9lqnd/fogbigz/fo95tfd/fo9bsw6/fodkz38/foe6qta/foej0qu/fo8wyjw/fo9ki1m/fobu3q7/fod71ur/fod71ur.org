As ever, you are free to do as you wish. Note that I do not necessarily endorse any of the above options (a few are obviously humorous), and there are no magic answers. How you (the players) choose to proceed will determine how this plays out.

I will however offer a couple points for consideration:

- This meeting is not guaranteed to turn out well, regardless of your intentions (and the opposite is also true). I heartily advise reading the blurb on the "about" page, particularly the "Rational" section.

- Thus far the QMs have been /exceedingly/ helpful. Consider all the nice things you have that are not a direct result of player action. But now we are out of the tutorial, and the training wheels are off. Good luck. :)
