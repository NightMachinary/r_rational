*Announcement:*

We are expanding the usage of player points on the website. They may now be used towards research for Fi (1:1 conversion), and to purchase limited PoV scenes for side-characters.

*Research:*

This is to be done on a per-request basis. If you would like to spend your points towards research, reply to the VP ledger post pinging me by username ([[/u/-Vecht-][u/-Vecht-]]). Note that points can only be spent on open research projects that have been started via regular plans. No new projects.

*Scenes:*

Below are the costs for purchasing PoV scenes for non-marked characters. This is limited only to side-characters that have previously been shown on screen, are not hostile towards your PCs, are in close proximity to an active marked character, and is subject to QM veto.

- 250 points - Single short scene / Vignette
- 600 points - Major scene / Chapter heavily features this character
- 1500 points - Character is the primary focus of the chapter

These prices are subject to change at any time depending on how frequently or infrequently scenes are purchased. By default they will increase by 10% with each purchase.

This is meant for fun/interesting interludes from characters who might not otherwise get the spotlight. It's not intended as an information-gathering tool---except, perhaps, in the sense that another character might have their own unique perspective or insights that one of the Marked characters might not. Please don't make us sad/frustrated that we offered this as an option. It will be revoked if it is abused.

If you would like to do this, ping me or the other QMs in the LotG discord channel or send one of us a PM.
