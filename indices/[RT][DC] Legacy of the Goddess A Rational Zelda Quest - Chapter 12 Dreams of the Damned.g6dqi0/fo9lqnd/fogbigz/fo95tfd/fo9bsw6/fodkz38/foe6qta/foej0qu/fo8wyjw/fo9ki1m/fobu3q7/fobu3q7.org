Is scorn an option? Several of her supporters have /begged/ us to meet with her. And now she acts like she doesn't want us? Is she going to pull our pigtails next? Because one of three things is true:

-this is a transparent and fairly clumsy manipulation. To throw us off our guard, to estimate our skill, doesn't matter.

-this is a playground level attempt at courting

-She and her followers have very serious disagreements on how badly she needs help. Given how she treats powerful people who have gone /very/ far out of their way to personally speak to her, We're inclined to believe them over you.
