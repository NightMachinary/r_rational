After an arduous journey you've arrived at the Sunseeker encampment and confronted the mysterious Lynx. She's hot! And also pissed off at you for some reason...

After an unsettling revelation and what seems like some sort of dressing down from the mysterious woman, the duo is faced with a question: Why are you here? Zelda gets the sense that she wants you to prove your worth to her before she is willing to engage with you as an equal.

*How do you respond?*

- Simple honesty: Well. She seemed like the best option for getting information about this unknown enemy. Information is at a premium. Help please?
- Offer her a rebuttal: After getting almost-assassinated /twice/ the very first thing you've done is come here for allies and information. You've done well to survive and make contact with such a knowledgeable woman so quickly, no?
- Get angry: Enough is enough! You have had it with these Mother-ficking riddles on this Mother-ficking plane. You're holding a kingdom together through sheer stubbornness and trying to save civilization from the brink of ruin and this tiger-lady asked /you/ to come to /her/ in the first place! Why is /she/ here, huh!?
- Get more quietly angry: If she isn't going to respect you, you won't respect her. Storm off and refuse to talk until she changes her attitude.
- Threaten her: You have a Link right here, and that's a nice (/very nice/) face she has there. It would be a shame if something were to happen to it...
- Other (write-in).

*What else do you have to say to the Lynx? Do you have any questions for her? What do you do next?*
