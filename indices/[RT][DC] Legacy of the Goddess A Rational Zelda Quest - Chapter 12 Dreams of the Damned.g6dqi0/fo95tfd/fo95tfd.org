Thanks for the chapter!

I'm going to hold off on making any kind of action oriented posts until we've had a chance for more people to read and discuss, but some initial commentary:

- I'm unclear on if Link actually investigated using Soothe to put himself to sleep. If he didn't, we should get on that.
- Zelda should also look into this if she's having difficulties with her own sleep.
- Pretty interesting that Naibi was hiding something in regards to the location in Link's dream. We should investigate that further.
- Round ears for the Lynx implies we're probably dealing with a Cosmere-hopper (human?) here. Could be interesting to try to figure out who exactly this is. " the color of a stormy sky" sounds like it could be a Stormlight reference?
- Depending on how large of a time period the next chapter covers, I'd like to begin testing if Zelda can safely transfer mana to Fi, and if so, if we could start a chain of transferring "excess" mana through Zelda and Link to Fi with the goal of gathering additional Void Power each day through this "excess" power.

I'm frankly not sure the best way to approach the hostile likely world-hopper, aside from rebutting her claim about the most meaningful things we've done (which involve successfully repelling a Blin horde and making Link a Lightsworn.) We're doing what we can with limited information - and if she wants us to perform better, we need information to do so.

It's easy to act superior when you're coming from a position of having greater knowledge; it's unlikely this Lynx would have done any better when acting based on the same starting conditions we did. It would have been easy to do a lot worse.
