To add to rebuttal option; we should probably mention that part of why were here is to make sure we don't accidentally burn down half the kingdom, or world. We've been working on limited resources and even more limited information, and were hoping that through this alliance, we can get more of both.

Put another way, sending the queen far into potentially hostile territory with a skeleton crew, while her kingdom was on fire, and after several assassination attempts, all for information and resources, is not that much riskier to us than trying to get that same info and resources from an ancient and probably friendly magical being.

Now that we're here though, she can at least steer us away from making any more major mistakes. Can't avoid potholes if you don't even know what a pothole IS, after all.
