So I was updating the woefully out of date knowledge base, and when I wrote up Vesyrn's entry I rediscovered something we ought to take into account.

Prologue:

#+begin_quote
  “He was seen consorting with a Gerudo agent,” Vian said. “We caught her and learned she was part of a renegade faction camping out in the highlands that we've had an eye on for some time. Little more, unfortunately.”
#+end_quote

A renegade faction camping out in the highlands, sure sounds like the Sunseekers. Vesyrn also mentioned a patron. And well,

Chapter 11:

#+begin_quote
  Zelda knew she had to respond, but something in Naibi's words caught her attention. .../My patron./ Where had she heard that before?
#+end_quote

Furthermore, Zelda in character knows all this. She just hasn't been thinking about because +she's been distracted by the sexy maps and history lessons+ we haven't ever mentioned it.

Chapter 4:

#+begin_quote
  Zelda could only imagine what their internal politics looked like. She also had the thought that perhaps these “Sunseekers” might even be the group that was working with Vesyrn --- according to Fi's account of Impa's conversation with Vian. Wouldn't that be something?
#+end_quote

So maybe we should ask her about Vesyrn? And what happened to the fragment of power he stole? Seems like a dangerous topic though.
