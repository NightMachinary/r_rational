Really unsure how to deal with Lynx. So little information. Severe lack of allies. Would definitely appreciate more.

Should we even be trying to cooperate? We obviously already decided to try to and now feels like have to but that's sunk cost talking.

Don't feel like the angry options will go well. Otherwise, /shrug/.
