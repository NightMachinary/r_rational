Something I noticed when doing some updates to the knowledgebase.

According to Fi, Hylia did actually contact Zelda.

  “I can confirm that it was indeed Hylia who contacted Zelda,” Fi said, seeming unfazed by Vestele's prodding. She floated in place, turning to face the priestess as she spoke. “Though, it is also true that Hylia is no more. Priestess --- I can only surmise that your belief stems from an event that happened many ages ago. Though it is likely the case that she was defeated and forced to withdraw from the world, she did not die.

According to the Lynx, Hylia didn't contact Zelda.

  “The entity that empowered Zelda and possessed her body to turn back the Blin horde was /not/ Hylia. It was merely a shadow. A husk. A remnant. The shape of the void left behind by the passing of something far greater.”

  “A Fae?” Zelda asked.

  “No,” the Lynx said. “They are related, but not the same.”

  “And how do you know any of this?”

  “Do you doubt me?” she asked. “Ask your construct. I speak the truth.”

  /Construct?/ Did she mean... Fi?

  “Mistress, Master,” Fi said, her chromatic form materializing a couple paces ahead and to the side. “I can confirm; I do not detect any attempt at deception. I conclude that she believes what she says with certainty.”

Buuuut, all that Fi confirmed is that the Lynx sincerely believes what she said. Now maybe this is just a definition dispute. Fi's definition of Hylia being somewhat more expansive than the Lynx's. But maybe it's something more?
