I'm going to try and interpret the dreams. We probably should have been doing this already, but better late then never.

Have seen variations of this dream before. Obviously both parents are dead and it's bad. The King is pointing at something. Maybe there's a diary or some sort of clue in his effects? Wailing corpse could be a reference to the BOTW 2 trailer.

Ominous, some sort of calamity involving Lake Hylia. Zelda can't do anything about it. At least in her current state. Skeltons are probably Stalfos

Something bad happening to Castletown. This might be what would have happened if we picked empower Impa, Save Zelda. Ocarina of Time reference?

Another ominous Lake Hylia dream. Zelda is also futile at escaping. Blood moon reference to BOTW

1st scene is an attractive red-haired woman. Lynx is a attractive red-haired woman. Who's the child though?

2nd scene is a bottle shop. Obvious reference to the bottles from Zelda games.

3rd scene is a Goron smoking... drugs. Zelda complains that the stones are too expensive, maybe a warning to quit using mind altering drugs? Goron also says he's just a farmer when asked to aid Hyrule. Maybe the Gorons will be unable to assist? Although, Hyrule could sure use some more food right now.

4th scene is the happy mask salesman. Don't recognize the mask.

Someone's already doing the Blin Death Cult or will be doing it.

A few woman that looked like Niesis? Sounds like Fae. And we supposedly did just release the Fae unto the world. Sage Amauruth could be chastising her because we goofed. Or maybe he's a stand-in for the Lynx chewing us out in this update.

A river, but might be connected to the Lake Hylia dreams?

April 1st joke update.

A shining piece of gold sounds like a fragment. Dark rings would be him not sleeping. He might be Link? An ocarina is a type of flute after all.
