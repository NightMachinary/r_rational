I'm fairly certain that last dream was about the Skull Kid. Vanishing in a puff of leaves after playing a single note is something he does in Oot. Meaning that there's a triforce fragment in the Lost Woods* for when we inevitably have to gather them up.

*Or Faron Woods if we're ignoring meta knowledge**

**Then again, looking at the map, the Lost Woods looks noticeably denser than Faron, and the canopy in the dream was really dense, so I think it's reasonable to conclude that the fragment is in the Lost Woods using only in character information.
