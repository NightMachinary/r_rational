[[/u/-Vecht-][u/-Vecht-]], I'd like to spend some points on research.

* Mark of Harvesting Divine Power
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: mark-of-harvesting-divine-power
  :END:
Spend up to 25 of my personal points on additional research toward *Lesser Marks of Transference* with their scope reduced even further. This further reduced version is called *Mark of Harvesting Divine Power*. (Some old discussion of the *Lesser Mark of Transference* spell [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/legacy-of-the-goddess-a-rational-zelda-quest.55903/page-22#post-12737722][here]] and [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/legacy-of-the-goddess-a-rational-zelda-quest.55903/page-23#post-12742643][here]] for ease of reference.)

*Spell description:* *Mark of Harvesting Divine Power* places a mark upon an individual that passively generates additional VP based on the person's activities. This has none of the other functions of a Mark of Transference; it only generates VP. This still requires consent from the target, similar to a traditional Mark of Transference.

Relevant Research Data: We have additional data now that we've successfully marked someone ourselves (Link), as well as witnessing the Lightsworn process. We've also had experience with other forms of Void Power generation via Sacrifice, as well as absorbing power from a fae, and transferring MP and VP. We have more context for general void power use and constraints than before; this should be utilized for assisting in the research process.

* Byrna's Armor
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: byrnas-armor
  :END:
Spend up to 25 of my personal points on researching defensive magic. We have previously researched the Cane of Byrna's defensive function, determining that it may be replicable, but seemingly at extreme cost. Attempt to research a weaker version of this function, using the Cane of Byrna as a part of the foundation, as well as observing the properties of imbued armor as a second point of data. If possible, figure out if it is possible to construct a defensive spell with a function similar to the described one below:

*Spell Description:* *Byrna's Armor*. While active, utilizes VP to defend the target against attacks. This requires an initial expenditure of VP to activate, as well as a maintenance cost to remain active. The efficacy and duration of the spell are both variable based on VP expended.

* Improve Magical Aptitude
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: improve-magical-aptitude
  :END:
Based on the changes noted to Link during and after the process of his change to Lightsworn, attempt to narrow down what specific effect improved his magical aptitude and if this is replicable. In addition, run active scans on Link as he practices different types of magic. Run scans on Zelda when she casts the same spells. Compare any essence changes that occur for them. Try this with each individual magic type. (This latter part is intended to see if there are lingering effects on Link that are gradually improving his aptitude rather than doing it instantaneously.)

*Spell Description*: Expends VP to permanently alter the target's Essence, increasing their Magical Aptitude in a selected form of magic.
