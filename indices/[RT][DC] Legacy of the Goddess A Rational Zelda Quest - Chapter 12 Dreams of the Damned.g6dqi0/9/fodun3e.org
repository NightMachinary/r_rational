Is there a noticeable physical effect when using telepathy? I assume not since Laylith tried to use it to pass along a secret message. And yet Naibi was able to tell that someone had sent a telepathy message to Zelda.

Does Zelda (or Link) know of a way for an 3rd party to detect a telepathy message being sent?
