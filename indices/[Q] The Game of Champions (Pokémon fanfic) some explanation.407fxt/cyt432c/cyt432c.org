My stance on Game of Champions:

The story is very well written, and the world very well built. It's very internally consistent both with itself and explaining the game canon, and most important characters are (to use EY's terminology) Level One intelligent or above. For these reasons I'd say it's Rational.

It isn't "Rationalist," for reasons Roxolan pointed out. The story's not a puzzle and it doesn't try to teach cognitive theory.

Regardless, I highly recommend it to this crowd. I liked it much better than Origin of the Species.
