Well, prompted by this thread I've now binge-read my way through the story so far, and /holy crap/ is this ever not the usual tenor of a Pokemon story. Fast, dark, and utterly brutal.

Had a few moments where the accelerated pace makes the timeline seem a bit unreal, but maybe I've read too quickly, missed the description of time passing, and there are actually more days/weeks that have gone by than I realise.

And I suppose my accumulated playtime on Pokemon Gold only really amounts to a couple of weeks, maybe a month tops once you add in time to sleep, and that was enough time to go from zero to world champion, win 16 badges across two regions, almost fill a pokedex, and casually bring down a major criminal organisation in the process.

As to the questions...

No idea about Chapter 11. Didn't really understand the mechanics of the situation, just accepted them as presented then moved on.
