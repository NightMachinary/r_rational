All good points, though going by the terminology on the sidebar that makes not "rationalist", but it can still be "rational".

As for powerful beings not taking over the world: I really don't think that would play out in reality. Even leaving aside that power and motivation/ambition don't go hand in hand, most of the beings mentioned do a fair job at meeting their goals. Trident Lead: I don't know what he wants, but his squirtles seem well cared for. The Ninetales Gary interacts with had a pretty good gig, and the art ninetales was presumably effective in its own sphere. I don't know about the other characters mentioned; it's been a while since I read it.
