Speaking of /Game of Champions/ here:

  Pokemon seem to have human-level intelligence. Why haven't they taken over the world yet?
#+end_quote

They* are incapable of speaking human languages, and their own sign language (?) does not appear as sophisticated. They* do not seem to understand abstract concepts. They* do not appear to have much ambition or capacity for long-term planning. They* started out at a huge technological and organisational disadvantage and do not seem to have the ability to bridge the gap. Add a layer of speciesism and it's understandable that they're not fully integrated into human society.

And here I'm talking about the few smart species/individuals. The vast majority of pokemons seem to have animal-level intelligence. Pikachu is /maybe/ ape-level. I've read dog stories with dogs portrayed as similarly intelligent.

(*With a few exceptions, and those do leverage those abilities into higher status. Mistermime is more like a butler than a pet. Trident Lead is higher status than a military officer and, to the extent of his communication abilities, can make demands that humans will obey. The Ninetales - who is above human average in every way - managed to, if not conquer the world, at least carve itself a nice slice of the pie.)

  Guess this is not a rational fic.

/The Game of Champions/ definitely isn't, for unrelated reasons. (tldr: it's almost never a [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairPlayWhodunnit][fair play whodunnit]].) It still have elements that appeal to much of the [[/r/rational]] audience though.

  What happened in Chapter 11?
