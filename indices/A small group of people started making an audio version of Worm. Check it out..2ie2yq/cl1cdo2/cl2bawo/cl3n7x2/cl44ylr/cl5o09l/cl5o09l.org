Hey this is Rein - the second narrator and the guy organizing the whole thing. What Bowbreaker said is absolutely correct. We're constantly improving both our hardware and our technique, but that can only go so far without feedback so we greatly appreciate all of it. Keep on listening, things do improve (just ignore 4.6-4.10 for a few days... I need to redo my failed experiment with Bakuda's voice this weekend). At the same time though, we're purely running on volunteers so the quality /will/ vary across the Arcs/Interludes. This is unfortunate, but we have so much content to get through that we need all the help we can get.
