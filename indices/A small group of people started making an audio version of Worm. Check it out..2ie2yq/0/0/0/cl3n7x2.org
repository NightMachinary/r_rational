There are actually two narrators who take turns from arc to arc. Each interlude seems to be done by volunteers other than those two. I can only say that the second narrator is better and that the only way for them to improve is feedback and the feeling that it would be appreciated. Also, remember that the first several chapters in hpmorpodcast.com also were worse than the latter ones but got re-recorded a good while after.
