This is my second Twig fanfic, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23704774][Logistical concerns]].

That one was a pain and a half to write, and it still feels ridiculously short when compared to the wordcount of a single Ward chapter. How the hell does Wildbow write these?

As always, I'm hungry for feedback, especially of the critical sort. Anything that helps me improve sentence structure, dialogue flow, etc, will be appreciated. Also, I am far from a stock market expert, so I'll definitely appreciate any advice for making the financial talk more believable.
