Love the detailed feedback!

  Oh, I liked the bit about "Apocalypse" being religious (and therefore vulgar) language.

Thanks =D

I really like when people catch these small bits.

(someone also commented on the coronavirus parallels, which made my day)

  this work reflects a bit on the influence and place of corporations in the world; however, the word "corporation" is only mentioned once in Twig so far as I can tell.

This is one of the paradoxes of the Twigverse as presented in Twig, which is indeed one of the themes of this fic.

The story never explicitly says how capitalistic its society is, but a lot of elements point towards "very".

For instance, when Lilian describes the end-of-graduation process, she mentions needing to get private sponsors. A big part of her climb up the social ladder is getting close to the Bergers, who seem like the very definition of bourgeois, powerful with no official titles.

There are lots of hints that the economy of Twig is a free market. The Academy itself is too decentralized to be a central planner (Professors seem to have the authority of a mayor at most, with no Professor having jurisdiction over an entire state); the Crown could in theory be one, but seems to have a mostly military role, with little shown impact on the economy. People are mostly buying and selling things to one another, using money, and never worry about eg petitioning the Crown for new machines to be allocated to their factories. Even the secret child slavery auction uses money, not favors or reputation.

So, given that there are few signs of central planning, that lots of resources are controlled by private interests, and that society is at the right tech level to undergo massive infrastructure projects that are too expensive for any individual to fund (trains, phone lines, clone factories, etc), we'd expect corporations to be popping up everywhere to finance these projects.

Yet the main characters never seem to see any.

At some point they travel to an unnamed city that is "a backbone of business, international banking, and information", and they never treat it as something important, even as they're recruiting the locals and saving them from genocide.

Sy never really concerns himself with getting support from economic institutions, except in an abstract sense as part of his general plan of abducting all the important people and putting a gun to their heads.

Thus the paradox: society shows all the sign of being permeated by a free market economy, even in centralized institutions like the Academy, and yet the main characters never interact with the institutions you'd expect in a free market.

  So, the observation that corporations have grown more powerful in "modern" times doesn't quite ring true to me
#+end_quote

Your above interpretations are valid, but another interpretation could be that "increasingly common in the modern economy" isn't the same thing as "common", and corporations haven't quite displaced familial fortunes yet. The Tyessex shareholders being shell companies for the Bergers is compatible with that idea.
