I enjoyed this a lot. I was pleasantly reminded of /Instruments of Destruction/. It does quite a good job of evoking Twig's universe, and the levers of power being pulled unseen as the Crown States hurtle toward oblivion.

Not so much a nitpick as an observation: this work reflects a bit on the influence and place of corporations in the world; however, the word "corporation" is only mentioned once in Twig so far as I can tell. If I had to guess, the reason for this is likely that the corporations are almost entirely under the control of the nobles and aristocracy (with self-fulfilling mechanisms in place to keep this true-- those who rise to corporate power likely secure themselves places in the aristocracy) and therefore under direct or indirect control of the Crown.

So, the observation that corporations have grown more powerful in "modern" times doesn't /quite/ ring true to me; while I'm sure there are powerful corporations, that line seems more at home in our own modern world. (The sequence of events in the story holds close to my understanding of the true balance of power, it was just that line that rang a little false. Unless you meant to use that line to show that, while powerful in his sphere, Stemmings himself has some fundamental misunderstandings about the nature of power in Twig.)

Oh, I liked the bit about "Apocalypse" being religious (and therefore vulgar) language.
