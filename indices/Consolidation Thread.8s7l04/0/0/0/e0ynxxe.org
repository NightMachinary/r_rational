It's not a terrible idea, really. Subreddits have two sticky slots available, and while one is used for the biweekly challenge, we're not currently using the other one, which could very well be "New to Rational Fiction? Start here."

But we do like to use that sticky slot for other stuff from time to time, and there are links (which could maybe be a bit more prominent or newbie friendly) in the sidebar.
