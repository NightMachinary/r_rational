The wiki on this subreddit has many recommendations. Unfortunately I'm not sure how to access it from the redesign... but here is the direct link to it: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index]]. Most of the series are completed but several still are going (and updates get posted here), such as [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning][Mother of Learning]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11090259/1/r-Animorphs-The-Reckoning][Animorphs: The Reckoning]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9794740/1/Pokemon-The-Origin-of-Species][Pokemon: Origin of Species]], [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3238329/1/A-Hero-s-War][A Hero's War]], and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126][Worth the Candle]]. There are also links to sites like [[http://rationalreads.com/][RationalReads]] and [[https://rationalfiction.io][rationalfiction.io]].

Besides the sites linked above and in the wiki, I enjoy perusing the list on [[http://topwebfiction.com/]]. It's not all rational, but many are and most are enjoyable no matter the genre.
