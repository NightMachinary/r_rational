I don't know if that's a greaaaat list -- I think Shade of White and Branches definitely belong on the second list and some on the latter are just much more central -- Worm, FiO, The Reckoning, Origin of Species, even MoL.

Even if you could argue that Shade of White or Branches are more "ideal expressions" somehow, the above are much more popular among [[/r/rational]] and better written -- new readers shouldn't have to wade two-thirds of the way down the list to get to Worm.

Also even if it's not meant to be an A-lister and a B-lister list, it'll be seen that way.
