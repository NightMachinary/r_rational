Huh, I'm not getting anywhere NEAR Pact anxiety, although admittedly that's a hard bar to reach. I guess I'm just not getting the feeling that every chapter is nearly guaranteed to make things worse, which was the feeling I got from Pact. Additionally, the main characters have had time to just breath and relax, and the /lack/ of that in Pact made it much harder to read for me.

Although, if we're on the topic of Wildbow comparisons, I've been seeing a lot parallels to Twig (although admittedly that might just because I'm in the middle of a Twig reread). Our main characters are a group of people too young for the job doing black ops on behalf of an imperialistic and authoritarian regime that's rife with human rights abuses and derives most of its power from an academy that teaches people to perform miracles (which also doesn't have a great track record with human rights). They're doing this work for personal reasons rather than anything ideological, though if pressed they'll defend the ruling regime. There IS a group (led by an unusually brilliant figure who has taken a personal interest in the heroes) opposed to the ruling regime and working towards ends that the reader would see as good, though they employ methods that are almost as bad as what they're fighting against and that makes it hard to want our heroes to join up with them. Despite that, the heroes are now forced to break with the regime and strike out on their own, now facing the ire of both the rebels and the powers that be. Oh, also, the main character has a looming expiration date they've been contending with since early childhood. Yeah, there are some differences, and some of those differences are pretty major, but there are a LOT of similarities.
