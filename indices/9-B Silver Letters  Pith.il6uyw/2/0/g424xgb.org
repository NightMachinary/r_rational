I'm not sure that they are being lethal. It's been pretty well established that as long as the Pith remains intact enough to perform a transfer and there is a spare body lying around, projectors can survive a LOT. Pretty much every projector death we have seen has been a situation where they weren't able to swap out bodies for one reason or another.
