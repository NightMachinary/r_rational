Those million dollar businesses you see around town, the owners of those generally didn't grow up in poverty or start the business with no investment. The latter simply isn't possible.

I'm not sure what sort of business you're imagining starting for less than $1,000, but that sounds like self employment, not something that is going to make anyone wealthy. To get wealthy in business (rather than as a skilled professional like a physician) you need people working for you whose work you skim profit from, making money parasitically from others without doing the work yourself. People can't realistically start things like that without already having wealth and the skills (and often connections) that come from a privileged upbringing.

The whole 'anyone who works hard can start a business and get rich' thing is a myth in the modern era. There are many obstacles in the way that ensure people with wealth and privilege succeed and people without those things never get the opportunity to try.
