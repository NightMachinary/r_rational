When we are talking about hundred million dollar plus businesses and people I agree. Otherwise not really. The number of millionaires is relatively high, most above average businesses you see around town are worth more than a million.

​

Being a millionaire is not *that* difficult, people tend to not pay attention to the large numbers of people that are millionaires and focus only on the ultra rich billionaire and 100 million plus crowd they see on the media, when there are plenty of average intelligence people with million dollar plus networths everywhere.

​

You just did it look:

#+begin_quote
  There are a significant number of people making one or two hundred thousand a year who are self made, with parents who were merely middle class or less. It's possible to go to school and work hard and make that kind of money.

  But once you start getting into serious wealth, the percentages of people who weren't born into wealth go down. Only about a third or so.

​

Being ultra rich is unlikely, making and keeping few millions before you're 60 is somewhat reasonable, if you are not in the "employee / trading time for money paradigm" long term.

​

PS. there are plenty of businesses you could start with less than 1000$ and get started with. Just research it, the belief you need a lot of money to start a business is just another inaccurate map example..
