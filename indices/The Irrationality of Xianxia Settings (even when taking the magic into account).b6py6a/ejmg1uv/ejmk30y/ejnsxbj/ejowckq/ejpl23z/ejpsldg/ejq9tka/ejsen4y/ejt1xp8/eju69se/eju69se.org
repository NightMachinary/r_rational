Did you seriously just copy and paste a google search? Probably without actually reading any of it, because everything on the list from the first link *isn't a business*, it's a job. Being self-employed isn't the same as starting a business with potential to grow, best case scenario you manage to get enough clients to start hiring people but much more likely is that you get hired by one of the lucky people. There isn't the same potential to make investments and profit that there is in a small business.
