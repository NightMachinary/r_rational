I like this explanation because it sort of maps onto real life; if you took the most successful/powerful person in the world and tried to reverse engineer their method for success, a good chunk of it would be "be in the right place at the right time, take a lot of bets that are probably positive-EV, but also highly risky and happen to pay off due to factors and circumstances that are largely out of your control." In that respect, reading the story of a cultivator may not be so different from reading a biography of a successful entrepreneur.

Certainly, there are things that they could do to influence their chances of success within a certain range, but even if you're always making positive-EV bets, ultimately the difference between a person who takes a bet with 60/40 odds and wins everything versus someone who takes the same bet and loses everything comes down to the luck of the draw, to some extent. One would think that the person who's best at making positive-EV bets would always win in a sufficiently-iterated bet, but as the number of bets approaches infinity, the probability of complete [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler%27s_ruin][ruin]] approaches 1.
