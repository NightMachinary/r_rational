I might add [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/11397/the-dao-of-magic][The Dao of Magic]] by [[/u/WeirdWhirl]]

and [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/white-collar-cultivator.44460/][White Collar Cultivator]] by Bob's Beard (indefinite hiatus)

as two semi-rationalist takes on the Xianxia genre.

I might also add that [[/u/ruffwriter]] employs a rational-like deconstruction theme in [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/5701/savage-divinity][Savage Divinity]] while adhering much more closely to genre norms and tropes.
