Lol.

Part of the problem is that you are considering these things from a Western, modern perspective. And the while point of Xianxia is that it's very much NOT that.

1. Picking fights without knowing enemy capabilities.

The whole point of this trope is that the reader knows something the characters in the story don't. Either the MC is deliberately hiding his power, or he appears much weaker than he truly is. By the perspective of the idiot who is about to kick an iron plate, he thinks he knows the capability, he's just wrong. And that's perfectly rational. People make mistakes and misjudge others all the damn time. It's how human brains work, you see a pattern 1000 times and you assume 1001 is gonna be exactly the same.

1. Inexplicably surviving weak organizations.

They aren't actually weak though. In reference to their peers, they are fine. Sure, a big badass from far away could ruin them. But that's like saying Jeff Bezos could bankrupt some random local rich guy. He could, but why would he? Bezos is on a different level and his circle should normally never interact with the small fry. Also, a key theme in many xianxia is the idea of the circle of life and how that operates not just for individuals but also for organizations. So let's say some guy gets strong and starts a sect. The sect in his lifetime and maybe his kid's and grandkids' will stay strong and even grow stronger. But eventually a loser will become the heir or their rivals will in turn have a badass of their own, and then the sect begins its path to oblivion. Internal fights start, people care more for their own benefits than for helping the organization, until it collapses. And then some other group takes over and starts the cycle again. Xianxia just generally revolves around that inflection point where the balance of power is at a tipping point, because that's more interesting.

1. The worst techniques are the most popular.

Again, you have to remember that xianxia is generally set in a medieval style world. Where IP protection isn't a thing. If someone with a badass technique tell other people the details, they'll just pirate it and sell their own copies and he'd get diddly. Worse, then they'd come back and kill the first guy to reduce the competition, and since he just gave away his fighting secrets, they'd know his weaknesses and be able to kill him more easily. Only a strong government would able to prevent this, and these world are generally set in a chaotic anarchy where that government doesn't exist.

1. Armies of useless weaklings

First, a lot of novels have formations. Where basically multiple weaklings can join together and enhance their strength. Second, even in the novels where formations aren't a thing, it would be dumb to rely on the 1 strong guy to do literally everything. Sure, he'll be available when you need to fight your nation state rival. But its a waste of his time to call him just to arrest a thief. Or guard the front door. Or any number of minor things that needs a fighter to do. Especially since in cultivation, you need to spend lots of time in solitary meditation to get stronger. So if you waste your time on petty nonsense, whilw your rival has been contemplating the secrets of the universe, the next time you fight, he'll have leveled up and will straight up murder you and then kill or enslave everyone you love. Third, generally when weaklings get used in battle, it's because the top dogs are equally matched. So if the big guy is tied up, are you just gonna let the other side send a bunch of weaklings to rape burn and loot while he's too busy? No, you send your own weaklings to counter thier weaklings.

1. Unmanageably worthless currency

Yeah, this is just Xianxia inflation at its finest. Generally though I assume the author is glossing over the counting. Cause who wants to write about bookkeeping minutiae?

1. Misguided masters losing face by caring about face

Yeah, again the point here is that all these novels are set in worlds where might makes right. The point of face isn't just about being virtuous or having a good reputation. It's literally a deterrent to getting attacked because the other guy knows you will fuck his shit up if he does. And you know the best way to lose that deterrent? Be seen as weak because you didn't defend your property. Then every motherfucker thinks he can get a piece.

1. Auctions without Protections

Nah, most auctions in these novels have protections. They just tend to end that protection right at the door. Again, its face saving. You want to establish that people can't just rob blatantly, but you know you can't actually protect EVERYONE, especially from people just as strong as you. So there is an unspoken understanding that you protection ends at the door, so the strong folks won't be tempted to test your strength since they can simply wait a bit and rob when their target leaves.
