There are easily 100 million words worth of material translated with this phrasing in just xianxia literature. Before xianxia novels, Taoism has been talking about cultivation/xiuzhen (修真) of qi in some form for a much, much longer time.

Their conception around this is the desire to grow spirit to/from qi, qi into emptiness, emptiness into tao. Basically any way to attempt to turn health into spirituality and vice versa and grow (cultivate) both in the process.

The terminology of cultivation from taoism is well entrenched. Your personal objection seems unlikely to move folks for whom that analogy is exactly what is intended.
