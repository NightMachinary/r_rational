  By that logic the bow and arrow would be more useful on the battlefield than a machine gun.

Only if you pick and choose what parts of the argument to take to their logical conclusion (and not even then, because archery has existed worldwide for a very long time). Here's a better example: until they got modern weaponry, the Chinese military was completely outclassed by the Japanese and European ones. Today they're not. A technological (or technique) advantage is only an advantage when you have that knowledge and your enemy doesn't. If everyone knows your fancy technique, if it's better than what they used before they'll use it and now everyone has an equally strong technique. You're no longer hitting harder or defending better than everyone else.

  well it depends what you're talking about.

In general you have to make some trade offs, and one of the things that is often traded off is cost to produce something. Most of the time you can get better quality for more cost up to a point. That point is usually beyond what most people can afford. You can always find some obscure counter-example to a "rule" like this, the point is that it holds often enough to be useful.
