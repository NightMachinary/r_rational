1 and 6 regularly happen IRL, that's not a worldbuilding problem. Those are mistakes people regularly make, it's only an issue if you're trying to write someone who would be the type to avoid this or has lasted long enough that they know better.

I... /kind/ of agree with 3, but a technique is powerful because it's stronger than what everyone else has, so when it becomes common it's no longer so useful. So, if you're expecting ever have to use it, you'd want to keep it to yourself. The only people selling techniques are those with a better one. Also:

  There's a reason why in the real world it's the best strategies and products that are the most widely used.

This is wrong, the best products are typically the most expensive and rarely used. The /best/ strategies are usually nearly impossible to figure out due to the massive search space, so we settle for good.

5 is solved by having denominations of currency. If you mean they're bartering in an auction, that would be a problem. Any functioning civilization probably has some form of currency.

For 7 it seems like you're seeing a rare scenario happen for the sake of plot, most people aren't willing to kill over losing an auction and those who are would probably get themselves killed fairly soon from recklessness.
