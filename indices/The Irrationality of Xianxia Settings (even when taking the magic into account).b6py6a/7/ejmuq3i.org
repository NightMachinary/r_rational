If you are reading Xianxia lately and looking for a more rational/rationalist take on the genre, I highly recommend [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21188/forge-of-destiny][Forge of Destiny]], a Quest from Sufficient Velocity that is being adapted into a fiction on RR, the quest itself is "complete" and continuing in a second volume in a new thread called Threads of Destiny, they are both /very/ good examples of the genre, and actually do a lot to sidestep and actually explain and acknowledge the problems that you are outlining, as well as having coherent and meaningful themes that carry throughout the story.
