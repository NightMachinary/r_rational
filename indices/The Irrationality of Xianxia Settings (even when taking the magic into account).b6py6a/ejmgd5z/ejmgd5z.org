I used to be very big into wuxia/xianxia. I just got tired of how low quality the writing was in general and gave it up.

I've noticed that a lot of the people who read it will try to explain away the bizarre behavior or characters by arguing that the act of cultivating or the act of surviving for such extremely long periods (aeons and aeons) will naturally drive cultivators completely insane, eccentric, psychotic, etc etc etc. This gives rise to all the bizarre nonsense behavior.

I don't personally buy it but it seemed reasonable to me. In a world where strength is literally everything, you would expect the vast majority of characters to be brutal psychos who rape, murder, exploit at the drop of a hat.
