I really wonder what's going through your head if you read a work based off of martial arts and Romance of the Three Kingdoms type stuff and being surprised when the characters get into fights over honour and really care about preserving face.

That's kinda like watching a Western movie and wondering why none of these rugged gunslingers don't want to settle their differences with a game of chess.
