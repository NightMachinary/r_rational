well I can tell you that having read western fantasy, my pet peeves are:

1. Magic is almost always seen as dangerous or evil/bad (ie the entire supernatural / paranormal genre)
2. Magic is almost always low tier (not tons of magic being thrown around), most characters in these stories use little to no magic

And xianxia avoids that.
