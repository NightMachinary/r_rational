The thorough answer to this question basically encompasses the answer to "What is Xianxia?", but trying to be concise:

Cultivators are a xianxia's settings magic users/martial artists/etc. They 'cultivate' by manipulating their ki/chakra/mana/chi/whatever to become stronger over time, learning new abilities and gaining power. A normal setting conceit is that cultivators keep on scaling up until the author gets bored and the story ends, usually after getting stronger by factors like 10x or 100x /dozens of times over/ - they start out at the level of 'badass humans' and eventually hit the level where individual punches destroy planets and then they /keep going/. Think "Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann".
