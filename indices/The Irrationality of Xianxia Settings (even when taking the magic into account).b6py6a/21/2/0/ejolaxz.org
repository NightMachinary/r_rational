Those worlds are often more akin to other dimensions, with different levels of power in those laws.

Often, in some novels I've read, when a cultivator becomes too powerful, he starts being constrained by the laws of his world and compelled to seek a new world or dimension where his power can grow. Otherwise, he risks falling to a tribulation of that lesser world rejecting him.

More or less like those Worlds have some innate power, and unless you are much more powerful than that world to suppress it's laws, they will limit your power severily, putting something like an effective cap on your power.

The other possibility is that, instead of being hard limited by the World, they have to go to another place because the laws of lesser worlds are imperfect, and keeping cultivating there will result in an incomplete development and loss of power in comparison to cultivators that moved away.
