I'm not especially familiar with the genre, are points 1, 3, and 6 presented positively? Finances I could see being purely an oversight, and military logistics probably should be thought through more thoroughly, but the rest of this sounds like the foolishness of the characters is intentional on the part of the author. 1 sounds like the most stock parable on kindness to strangers ever. Yeah it's stupid to make enemies when you don't know how powerful they might be, but making enemies of strangers is a thing people do in reality. The worst techniques being most commonly used sounds like a parable about innovation vs tradition. Yes, market forces would tend to encourage the better techniques to spread, but market forces do not act instantaneously and new innovations have to come from somewhere. Protagonists are by nature exceptional individuals, and sometimes that means that they're innovators, and can use whatever new technique they've found/discovered/invented for quite some time before their enemies are able to adapt. The people failing to search out more sophisticated techniques adequately are not being rational of course, but I don't think the story is claiming otherwise. Lazy traditionalism is a thing in real life too, and it isn't rational here either, but it still happens. And I can tell immediately from your description of point 6 that these masters are not people we're expected to be rooting for. They're the villains, they'll tend to do things that are wrong, sometimes even obviously wrong and foolish. The question isn't whether what they're doing is right, or even whether it's smart, it's whether it's realistic. I don't know enough about the honor culture involved, but just off the top of my head I can think of a few examples of people proving themselves hypocrites in the name of defending "their" people against outsiders without regard for justice. The Catholic Church does it all the time. As long as it's a thing real people sometimes do, I don't think you can call it unrealistic for a villain to do it.

To me it sounds like these stories are not especially more irrational than comparable Western fantasy settings. Most of your complaints seem to be about the behavior of the characters being irrational, when that isn't really a valid criticism of the work itself. The character is not the author, especially villain characters.

For the rest of it, with regard to the finances and military logistics being less well thought out than you'd like, I'm afraid that's just conservation of detail for you. The weak organizations and weak armies especially are obviously just canon fodder for the protagonist to pulp, and any further explanation just doesn't exist. So yeah, the stories are irrational in that sense.

But even though this sub is about rational fiction, I don't think there's anything inherently wrong with some stories not being rational fiction. As long as nobody's claiming that it is or posting it here, it could get away with being far more irrational before it became unreadable for most people.
