Not all xianxia have battle formations, most actually don't. Most xianxia emphasize repeatedly that the gap between cultivation levels is unsurpassable even if you bring 100 Jindans to a fight - they won't win against Nascent Soul.

Desolate Era, ISSTH are considered to be one of the best in the genre, with a bit more well thought out world building.

When there are formations/some other way to combine power of many to fight against stronger opponents, an army makes sense - I'll give you that.
