So what's the point of the army of weaklings again?

Army is supposed to defend the nation from inner and outer threats.

We've established that masses aren't a threat in xianxia novel - their rebellion means nothing, and it can easily be suppressed by a local mayor/ruler who is usually the strongest in the region. So no inner threats to defend from by using masses.

There are no outer threats that'd require an army either, I mean those other countries in poorly thought out xianxia novels also have an army of weaklings for some reason - but it's not rational for either side to have them if in the end the war will be decided by the skirmishes/duels of the rulers/strongest generals of the nation.

What'd make more sense is to have highly trained, elite spec ops with above average cultivation and with high utility/support skills to aid the generals in their skirmishes against the enemy generals.
