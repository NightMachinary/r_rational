Since the worlds aren't overflowing with immortals, mostly cultivators are portrayed with working towards immortality, with lifespan increases at each realm/power-level breakthrough, but often building up their clan/sect in the meantime. Even if main characters don't have to deal with it, that's the cultural context.
