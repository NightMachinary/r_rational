I never actually used the word impossible, he seems to be arguing against imagined opponents. He also seems to have fallen for a particular kind of self-help hype that is a profitable business in the United States. It goes along the lines of 'Buy my books/come to my seminars and you can become a millionaire by starting a business/trading real estate/trading on the stock market'.

It's just another form of exploitation appealing to people's desire to get rich by telling them they can, glossing over the difficulties in favor of selling a dream that people desperately want to hear. People who are actually rich from business don't need to sell books and seminars on how to get rich, of course, but the victims of this particular scheme don't think that far.
