  Did you seriously just copy and paste a google search?

Yes, and no I didn't read it. I'm sorry this discussion doesn't really interest me that much. To make up for it let me tell you one of the intended uses for business loans you might not have thought of..

It can obviously be used to cover starting costs and the like, but also be used to help new business owners pay themselves for the first year or so while the business is unlikely to be profitable, allowing them to work on it full time.

BTW I said you could start a business with less 1000$ to get started with. There are obviously better options available if you're not broke and or have a good credit rating. And I'm sure you can google several stories of people starting profitable businesses without much starting capital.

  best case scenario you manage to get enough clients to start hiring people but much more likely is that you get hired by one of the lucky people.

Read some of the notable and gold posts there if you're interested in 'best case scenarios'. I'm not into freelancing, but it's a valid option to get started for some people..

*edit Again I'm sorry, arguments on this topic can be like arguing about evolution with some people. It tends to make people angry, and offended for no real reason. It's something people don't like to hear, because it challenges their world view, puts their beliefs in question, points out potential flaws in their 'maps of reality' and choices they've made.
