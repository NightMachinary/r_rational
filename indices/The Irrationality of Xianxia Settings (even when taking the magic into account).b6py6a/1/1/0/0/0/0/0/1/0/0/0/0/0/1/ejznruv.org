"It's not impossible" is not a particularly useful argument, because nothing is strictly impossible unless a mathematical proof shows it is. [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9ZooAqfh2TC9SBDvq/the-argument-from-common-usage][We all know this, we're not using the literal definition of "impossible".]] Outside of math you should almost always interpret "impossible" as "improbable", the degree to which depends on context, because that's almost always what it means. Recognize hyperbole. Saying "it's not impossible" is just [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7X2j8HAkWdmMoS8PE/disputing-definitions][semantics]], what [[/u/Law_Student][u/Law_Student]] /means/ remains the same, and they probably meant to use the word the technically incorrect but common way.

You're appealing to emotion and semantics in order to prop up an argument which, in the wider context, is used to justify why we shouldn't give help to those who need it. You're not the only cool head in the room, you're just paying more attention to the splinter in your neighbors eye than the plank in your own.

Pretending there isn't context to what you're saying, interpreting someone's words in the worst way possible rather than the most likely meaning, appealing to emotion... you're making invalid, deceptive arguments on [[/r/rational][r/rational]]. If you're wondering why you're being downvoted it's because of that, not because we're too emotionally tied to this. We know these tricks, most of us had to unlearn them. You're not fooling anyone but yourself.

Here's an example:

#+begin_quote
  All I implied was: hey maybe the chance of people (yourself included) doing X is higher than you think, here's some evidence. It's an encouraging positive message, you'd generally expect a positive or neutral response from reasonable people, but that's not what tends to happen.
#+end_quote

That's not all you implied and you should know it! Your "evidence" is invalid, it's anecdotal (which is technically bayesian evidence, but in most cases it's so marginal it's not worth taking into account). You're saying that our disagreement with you means we're unreasonable, not that your argument is flawed. Which, of course, is the actual reason. That's ad hominem, and you should know better. I promise you we'd respond better if you weren't constantly trying to pull shit like that. I don't think you realize this is what you're doing, but you need to do some introspection into the way you argue. Don't base your writing style on Yudkowsky, his sequences are literally a manifesto. They're not debate, and you should not debate in that way.

The jargon you use, the focus on the metaphor of a reality map, and the incomplete understanding/application of concepts makes me think you've read the LW sequences and stopped there. You need to do and learn more if you want to be better. For one thing, pay more attention to other people instead of dismissing them. Your first post in this chain is about you saying people don't try to start a business because they don't think it's possible. It's this sort of looking down on the "unenlightened" that makes me dislike LW. It's not that they're uninformed, it's that they're informed enough to know trying to start a business in their position is probably economic suicide. LW won't teach you real humility, and knowing every bias and game theory theorem in the world won't help you without it.
