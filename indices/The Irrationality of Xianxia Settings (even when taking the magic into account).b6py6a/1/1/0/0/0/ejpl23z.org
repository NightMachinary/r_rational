I'd have to disagree there, there's so much disconfirming evidence to that statement it's crazy. Basically that's a comforting excuse people use to rationalize their situations even. While saying everybody that is rich has been born that way is flawed, so is denying nobody ever got rich without being born rich.

​

The rundown of how you get rich by normal means is: You take risks and open a business, it's a risk of money, time, status, health etc. With a business you can profit from other people's time as well as yours, then you as you grow you trade more overhaul labor for more money. You have extra money you can invest, some of those investments are successful things compound and snowball..

​

The thing is most businesses won't succeed, most people aren't willing to risk it, and many don't know it's possible because their 'map of reality' is incomplete or flawed.
