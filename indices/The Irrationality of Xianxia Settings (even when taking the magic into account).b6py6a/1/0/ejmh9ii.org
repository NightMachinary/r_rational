This is basically it. All xianxia MCs are one in a billion level lucky, and have basically Anthropic Principle'd their way to power (they got there because we're reading the story about the one that made it).

This is why they often talk about the "will of the heavens" or being "blessed by the heavens", they literally have luck of such a high level it looks like divine intervention from the outside.

The worlds in xianxia are, even when you adjust for the massive over-exaggeration that is a feature of the genre ("It wasn't too far, a mere 500,000 km away" [1.3 times the distance from the Earth to the Moon]) mind bogglingly huge - there are often nested multiverses of worlds, each with billions on billions of inhabitants. In the vast majority of cases, someone with the level of status of a young master of a chosen clan can do whatever they want without any repercussions, and so can their son and his son unto the tenth generation. Because the world is so huge and cultivators live so long, power blocs can last tens of thousands of years without interruption. They have literally a hundred generations of power to fall back on.

It's just their luck the MC is lucky enough to be the 1/1,000,000,000 person that can stand up to that through an escalatingly hilarious set of coincidental powerups.

Similarly, because the world is usually organized in tiers, while a Deva Tier cultivator could destroy an entire nation of Foundation Establishment cultivators, they would have no reason to do so, as that whole nation wouldn't have anything worth the Deva's time. Any magical reagents they need would be in the more spiritually powerful tier of nations in which the Deva lives, and naturally they are competing with other Devas for those resources.

Information control is also key. clans protect their bloodline abilities, and after 10,000 years of dominating the local area, most of the younger generations don't know their techniques are sub-par. After all, they have dominated all their opponents forever. Even if overall they have a D tier technique, everyone around them is using Fs or lower. How could they know this one ancient legacy had an A rank technique which the MC just happened to stumble upon?
