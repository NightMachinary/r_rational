  This is basically it. All xianxia MCs are one in a billion level lucky, and have basically Anthropic Principle'd their way to power (they got there because we're reading the story about the one that made it).

While, fine, that can be an interesting story, doesn't actually contradict the OP's point. If we wanted to read stories driven by strange coincidences, we wouldn't be on [[/r/rational]]. Around these parts, you get exactly two gimmes: whatever it takes to set up the world you want to write in (e.g., an Alien Space Bat willing to transform people into superheroes) and the ability to choose a main character that gets into interesting situations. Any other luck, the character needs to make for themselves.
