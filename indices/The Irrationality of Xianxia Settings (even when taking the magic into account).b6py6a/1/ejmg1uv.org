The way I've rationalized Xianxia is that the world is huge and the protagonist story is incredibly incredibly rare. Xianxia doesn't tell the story of a random person, it tells the story of the most powerful being in the universe and how they got there. Of the billions of worlds that exist, they're the one who found a rare technique, insulted a young master and didn't get squashed, found a weak organisation they could take down for their own gain and ect. Everything they do is by incredible strokes of fortunes. And meeting people on higher levels of cultivation they have had similar strokes of fortunes, eventually someone's luck runs dry and they die. But not the protagonist.

On your second point that relates to the size of the world, we're talking about generalisations here, but the world's are usually massive with an incredibly small % as cultivators so a lot of areas may never/rarely see cultivators
