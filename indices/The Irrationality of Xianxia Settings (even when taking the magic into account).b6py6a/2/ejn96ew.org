6: I notice this a lot in Chinese fiction in various guises, morality asymmetry/inconsistency: "I approve of your methods, but the moment I learn any recipients had any relationship to me you will have my undying hate and we cannot live under the same sky."

This seems to be linked to the cultural imperative to 'be filial'--you must side with your parents/master, you must side with your country, you must side with your childen/disciples, anything else is being a contemptible traitor. If you don't side with those above you, then you're an "ungrateful white-eyed wolf". If you don't side with those below you, then "Even tigers don't eat their young!".

That said, in the minds of protagonists there is often hypocrisy--any relation who isn't partial in favor of a protagonist will be demonised as heartless/disloyal, whereas any non-relation who is partial in favor of one of their relations will be sneered at as being immoral.

One also sees protagonists using the same sorts of methods against others that they themselves have in the past sought vengeance for--"I feel the actions are appropriate, I feel hatred and vengeance is an appropriate response, now when I'm doing these same sorts of actions the important thing is to 'remove the roots' by thorough child-killing so that there's no appropriate hatred and vengeance towards me.". ...Hmm, Godfather rules.

I always feel a little mystified when the same character is completely unemotional when they're doing something to someone else, incredibly emotional when the same thing is (unrelatedly) done to them, and yet at no point seems to show any signs of cognitive dissonance.
