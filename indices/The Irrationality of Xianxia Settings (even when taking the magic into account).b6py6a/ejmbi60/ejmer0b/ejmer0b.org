among the chinese/eastern equivalent of light novels have a common sentting in the same way as western fantasy novels have a tolkieneske setting.

the common magic system is "cultivation."

there are 2 premises than i can think of: * one that there are impurities in the world in general and in humans in particular,

*two there is chi flowing in the world, that a awakened individual (cultivator) can draw inside its body through meditation and breathing techniques (cultivation), into chi channels called meridians and towards a nucleus caled dantian, behind the navel. the drawing of that chi can purify the body removing the impurities and strenghten the individual. once inside that chi can be used to power techniques from the sho ryu ken to naruto's rasengan.

eventualy a cultuvator has removed enough impurities to leave this planes of existence and finding more chi rich worlds, here most novels fall into idiotic power creep.
