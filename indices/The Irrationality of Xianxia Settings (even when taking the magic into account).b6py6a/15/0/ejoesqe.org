1. Action
2. personal growth/it takes years to master X
3. (potentially) big magic systems with lots of interesting parts
4. A world where the existence of magic has societal consequences. (If magic is effective in warfare, then armies or police might include or solely be mages, etc.)
5. Technological consequences. (I haven't seen this done, but a) if you can use magic to make things move, can you make +robots+ golems/enchanted statues/walking war machines? b) If magic can be used to set off explosives easily, people might not use guns, but mines might be more prevalent.)
6. A fictional genre with a /different/ set of tropes or crazy things in fictional worlds - maybe the fictional societies doesn't make sense in this way or that, but they get things right that, say, American media doesn't.
