You should read Immortal Mortal. There's a lot of aswers to such things there. Just beware the huge drop of quality near the end, and the unfinished feeling at the end.

But on your points:

Usually, good resources are monopolised ruthlessly by powerful entities, either cultivators, sects or countries. They control the access to such resources, but are somewhat kept in check by other rivals. Thus, they need to keep their best forces at hand to secure what they already have.

As such, they recruit and prop up subsidiary entities in order to obtain more resources, and if something good appears, they attempt to take over, either pacifically, through marriages and alliances, politically by sending elder and protectors to get control, or ruthlessly through killing. Meanwhile, the subsidiary sect benefits by getting any leftovers that the main sect can spare, or subpar/reliable techniques that don't require being a super genius to cultivate, even if they aren't as effective.

But not everyone wishes to become a subsidiary of a power. Some choose to go to areas considered as "wilderness", away from the main powers and the established, "civilized", cultivation world.

They tend to have some very outdated techniques, and most sects that atempt this fail and disband or die horribly. But sometimes, they prosper, finding some resource to trade with others. They have to balance their small sucess with avoiding the interest of stronger entities, like subsidiary sects or disciples of a decent power. Also, natural selection and enviroment tends to make the survivors improve their techniques somewhat.

This need of trading resources takes us to the Auctions. Those are usually established by a semi - independent power, but are deeply probed by the bigger powers all the time. Most transactions won't interest any of those entities, but MC's tend to deal with very interesting and rare resources.

The amount of currency traded on those auctions is usually resources obtained from several subsidiaries as tribute, acumulated for decades and centuries, or results of plunder between cultivators. Due to the nature of regular cultivation, outside MC's and geniuses, people tend to have difficulty advancing, and lesser resources often are very innefective at raising your power. So, it's better to trade them on a powerful weapon, or get better resources for improvement even at a extortionate rate of exchange. A vertical growth, if you consider.

On the other hand, some power prefere to raise horizontally, raising more disciples and sending them after renmants of previous civilizations after better techniques, or attempting to create new techniques from scratch by mass recruiting and teaching slightly different versions of the technique (that often cripples the disciples cultivations, cause madness, or make them explode).

So, the logic of the xianxia is an ultra captalistic, amoral setting. Pretty close to cyberpunk, really.
