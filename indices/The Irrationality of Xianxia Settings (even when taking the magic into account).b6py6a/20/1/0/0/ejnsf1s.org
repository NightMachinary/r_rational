I've never thought of cultivation as a word strongly associated with plant care. Maybe you just hear it a lot in that context due to whatever your job is or something? Always thought of it in the same vein as words like "development" etc, a general term for all sorts of things. I've never heard of "husbandry" being used for anything other than agriculture, while you hear all the time sentences like "try to cultivate a welcoming atmosphere" or "cultivate a healthy appreciation for X", so on.
