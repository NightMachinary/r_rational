From "The Only Real Cultivator" description:

#+begin_quote
  You will see an overpowered main character with a cheat ability.  You will see "comedy". You will see a normal guy who gets teleported to another world. You will see classic wuxia elements like Qi cultivation and alchemy.  You will see grammar from a native speaker. You won't see a ruthless MC who kills everybody that offends him. You won't see harem.

Gotta say, sounds good.
