Agreed. I think this discussion relates to the concept of a [[https://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=27382][bent world]]. Just like comics have odd rules like how Batman can't kill the Joker no matter how bad he is, Xianxia has odd rules about how everything is bigger, stupider, crueler, etc. And since it evolved separately from Western fantasy, it is bent in different ways.

Well, it could be subverted in interesting ways, like HPMOR did to Rowling's wizard boarding school idea. Perhaps a Ringworld-like HSF about people living on a supramundane shell who have access to medical nanobots of varying capabilities.
