Another crazy one I see is when sects are /totally/ fine with disciples straight up murdering each other because they have this darwinist idea that this will filter out the talentless and strengthen the rest. Then you get situations where a sadistic disciple will murder kids effortlessly simply by virtue of him being ahead several years in cultivation.
