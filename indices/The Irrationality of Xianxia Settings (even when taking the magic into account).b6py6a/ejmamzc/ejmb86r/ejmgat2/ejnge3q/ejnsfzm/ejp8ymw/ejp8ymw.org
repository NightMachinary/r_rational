It makes sense for a town or county to have a weaker army, but a country would need to field people who can actually stand up to a threat to it. When the central authorities send reinforcements in a setting with exponential power scaling, they need to scale their response in the same way with powerful elites. (Which any government would necessarily have in order to stay in power.) Sending an army of weak soldiers is a terrible military move even if there's a reasonable explanation for that army existing.
