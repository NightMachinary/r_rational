  a country would need to field people who can actually stand up to a threat to it

There are threats of different levels. Some are internal too. Army of certain level can take care of certain level of threats and the stronger people would only need to bother doing shit when it's really bad.

If the leader is the strongest, he would just make competition for himself if he made supersoldiers.
