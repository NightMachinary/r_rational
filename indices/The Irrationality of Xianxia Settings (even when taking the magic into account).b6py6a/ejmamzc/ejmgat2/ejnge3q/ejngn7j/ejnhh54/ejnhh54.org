  Someone has to make sure the laws are obeyed by the masses
#+end_quote

What laws? The setting stars with this is "a dog eat dog world", individual power is the only law that matters - there's no government in the modern sense of it.

There's need in police to regulate, organize, and manage masses for sure, but that's not the job for an army. We're speaking about millions of soldiers here, who are soldiers for no reason, and who don't act as police.

Even the masses, in contrast to our world, in this one there will be almost no rebellions that aren't led by the cultivator because there's no chance for success. In xianxia world ultimately there's an unsurpassable difference in their power so no sane peasant would join a rebellion that is doomed to fail from the beginning. Again masses are no threat, and not even an inconvenience.
