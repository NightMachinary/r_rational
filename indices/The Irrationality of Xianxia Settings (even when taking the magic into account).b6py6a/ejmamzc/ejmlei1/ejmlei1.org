The problem is that while there may be incentive to privatize knowledge, without some kind of ability to "copyright" techniques, eventually most of the good techniques are going to leak and become readily available.

â€‹

This is because not everyone always acts perfectly in their own self interest, and people near the end of their lifespan have no incentive towards further economic profit. So occasionally the best techniques would get published, then rapidly copied everywhere and there would be many copies.

Even if there /was/ a copyright system, without some mystical means of hunting down pirate copies there would be many copies of the most famous techniques everywhere.
