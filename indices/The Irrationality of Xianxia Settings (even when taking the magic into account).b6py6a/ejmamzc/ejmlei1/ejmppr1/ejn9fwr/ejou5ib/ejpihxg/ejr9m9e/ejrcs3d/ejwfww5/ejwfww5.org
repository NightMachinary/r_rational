Of course you're the only person with the technique.

It's like this. Some guy invents a martial arts technique. He gets strong and advances. Will he now sell his major advantage to his competitors? Fuck no. He'll keep it to himself and maybe give it to his kid or a single promising disciple. And they in turn will try to keep their technique as secret as possible, and murder anyone who either tries to leak it or has the unfortunate bad luck to learn it by mistake.

Nobody sells techniques unless they are so garbage that nobody powerful would bother with it. If the technique is actually useful, the second someone powerful gets it, he'll murder everyone else who might have knowledge of it.

You're still thinking from the point of view of a world with law and order. But these aren't. You basically have two scenarios. Either the buyer us weaker, in which case, why sell your better technique to him when he's naturally weaker and you can beat him and take his money. Or he's stronger, so why the hell is he going to bother paying you when he can just kill you and take the technique? Especially when the less people with good martial arts techniques around, the less competition there is. Why would anyone be dumb enough to teach other people how to murder them?
