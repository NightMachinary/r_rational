  in a lot of cases the technique is possessed by some handful (but not only one) of users.

A handful of users who are all in the same clan and have very strict rules about inheritance. There is literally not a single cultivation novel where high level techniques relative to the current environment are not rare. Also, I think you are mistaking "I know what skill is" with "I have the in depth knowledge and training required to perform said skill".

Sure, everyone might know that when the white robed swordsage whips his sword super fast and it turns into a giant dragon its the Dragon Breath Ultimate Super Attack. But they don't know how it actually works. Especially the self created techniques that are basically a signature move, which also tend to be the most powerful.

  That's like saying the moment someone has a machine gun he will gun down everyone else with a machine gun.

No, it's like saying if someone has a nuke they'll make damn sure nobody else has access to nukes. Which, uh maybe you don't pay attention to global politics, but...

  By that logic cultivators wouldn't ever have such a thing as currency
#+end_quote

First, trading occurs with people of relatively equal strength. You have a high level axe, but you use swords, I have a pill that can save your kid from dying of poison, so we trade. If one side is stronger, they wouldn't bother trading.

Second, why else do you think so many cultivation currencies also double as cultivation resources? It's not worthless gold and silver, it's actually useful in itself. Which also helps with not getting your shit robbed because people who are so strong they can steamroll everyone generally no longer need that level of cultivation resource, so they won't bother.

It's a central theme of these novels that anyone who has a treasure and doesn't have the strength to protect it is begging to be fucked over. It's a basic premise of the culture. Time and time again its repeated in the novels that "a weak man's sin is holding a treasure".
