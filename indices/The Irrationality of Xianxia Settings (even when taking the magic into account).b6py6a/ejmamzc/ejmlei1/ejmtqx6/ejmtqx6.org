  This is because not everyone always acts perfectly in their own self interest, and people near the end of their lifespan have no incentive towards further economic profit.

Even if that's true of immortal heroes, people near the end of their lifespan have /all sorts/ of incentive to keep these secrets within their family or clade.

Publishing the secret behind your clan's unbeatable righteous thunder fist cultivation technique is going to absolutely demolish their competitive advantage among other clans, so why would you do that?

Especially since there's no real way to tell the difference between a true copy of a secret manual, and a copy of a secret manual that's been intentionally manipulated by someone who's two realms ahead of you and basically has godlike mental capabilities.

I imagine that in a rational cultivating world, you'd be able to find pirated copies of any famous technique you'd care to name - and a hundred out of a hundred copies would be subtly incorrect, in a way that serves a transcendent cultivator somewhere.
