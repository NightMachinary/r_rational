All your points are valid except number 3. Privatisation of knowledge is the basis of hegemony. You don't need money from the weak because with a strong technique you can just take what you want. You cannot do that if other are as strong as you. Thus you limit the amount of people you teach to those you are sure will remain allies (your sect or clan). And there is also the question of talent requirement to practice said technique. All in all I think it makes sense.

What doesn't however is those god-tier technique that completly ignore power scale and world building. Fuck those.
