I'm gonna comment specifically on the monetary aspect since it is a regularly thing in Xianxia.

Xianxia authors LOVE to exaggerate, whether it is the size of something (medieval period cities that are the size of North America), how obscenely huge the damage spells & martial arts moves inflict to money.

In fact what regularly happens with money is the numbers become so vastly inflated (dealing in millions or billions of <currency>) that every few hundred chapters the author simply introduces a new currency that the next tier up of people deal exclusively in.
