I recently forced myself through books 1 and 2 and skimmed the 3rd (Blackflame), so excuse while I retch:

1. Picking a Fight Without Knowing Enemy Capabilities Yes, everyone in Sacred Valley, all the time. Soulsmith has lots of examples of this, too.
2. Inexplicably Surviving Weakling Organizations Sacred valley and the Heaven's Glory school.
3. The Worst Techniques are the Most Popular Sacred valley has a variant of this, where their obvious martial inferiority is never mentioned and where they endlessly bitch and moan about the burden of the unsouled among them instead of trying /anything/ to solve that problem.
4. Armies of Useless Weaklings Does not apply.
5. Unmanageably Worthless Currency I couldn't care less.
6. Misguided Masters Losing Face by Caring about Face Again, almost every master in Sacred Valley and at Heavenly Glory school. Markedly improved in Soulsmith with the sandvipers and the fishers.
7. Auctions Without Protections Does not apply.

I don't remember any armies or auctions, so I get 4 out of 6 if I decide to count the assembly around the ruins as an army.
