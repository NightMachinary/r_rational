Cradle still suffers from the problem of training being too much of the story- book 3 is like 75% the MC learning new techniques and training to become stronger, with no real plot affecting him meanwhile. It's certainly a different issue, but another common deficiency of the genre.

ETA: actually, I think this is a fairly inherent problem- either the MC is unfairly lucky, or very little happens (because they can't beat the people centuries older without getting lucky).
