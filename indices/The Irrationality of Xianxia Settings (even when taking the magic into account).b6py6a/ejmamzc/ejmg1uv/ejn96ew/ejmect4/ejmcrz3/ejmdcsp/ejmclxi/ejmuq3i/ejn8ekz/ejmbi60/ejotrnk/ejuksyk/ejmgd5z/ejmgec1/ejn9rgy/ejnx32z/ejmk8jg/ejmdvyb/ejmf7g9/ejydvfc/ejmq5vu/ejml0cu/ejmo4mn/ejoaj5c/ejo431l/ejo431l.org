Technically this could be a possibility for artificial worlds. You can take a star (or gas giant) and build a shell at the 1-gee point, which you could then walk on. Strong enough materials to build a static shell that wouldn't collapse don't exist, so it has to be a dynamic structure. The shell could either be held up by massively energetic orbital loops (large amounts of material moving faster than orbital velocity and transferring the momentum to the shell via magnetic field), or you could have the shell be reflective on the inner surface and be held up by radiation pressure.

For the Sun, a structure called a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyson_sphere#Dyson_bubble][Dyson bubble]] that balances radiation pressure against gravity would be extremely thin, about 0.78 grams per square meter, and would most likely be set up quite a bit further from the Sun than the 1-gee point (which is ridiculously hot and close). It would most likely serve as a power collector, not a habitat, and would be composed of many independent units rather than a single shell. However, a 1-gee habitat shell this has been suggested as being more feasible for [[https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.04376][white dwarfs]].
