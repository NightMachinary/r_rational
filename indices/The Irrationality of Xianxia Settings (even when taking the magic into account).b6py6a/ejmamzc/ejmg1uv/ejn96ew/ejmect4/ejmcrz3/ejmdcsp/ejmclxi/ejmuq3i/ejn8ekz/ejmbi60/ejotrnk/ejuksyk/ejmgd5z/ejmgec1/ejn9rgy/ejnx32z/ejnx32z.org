So why is this genre popular around these parts, anyway?

I'll disclaim that I'm very unfamiliar it, not having read any of it on account of being unable to get past the writing style. Lots of [[/r/rational][r/rational]] readers have a higher tolerance for that sort of thing, I realize, but then what /is/ appealing about the genre?

Every description of this genre that I see, including the commentary in this thread, just pattern-matches in my head to things that rational fic readers tend to hate. Unrealistic, exaggerated world-building, people solving problems by Being Really Strong instead of through intelligence, and so on.

So I find myself confused... what about this genre do people like?
