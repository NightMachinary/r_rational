Thousands of chapters? Wow, I'm impressed! I drop the series whenever I found cultivator has nothing to do with growing plants. Translation really need to find better term.

Anyway, the points you're stating, while valid, only shows that the series were intended for a power trip fun. In other words, they were made for boys. It's like criticizing Transformer movies for not making much sense. Which is silly. Boys want excitement of triumphing over their rival/opponent. Preferably leaving the loser forever subdued, never again fighting back. Little boys inside of us want that too. It's just exposure to more logically sound works made us see those wanton no longer satisfying. I'd say it's a call to leave the genre behind.
