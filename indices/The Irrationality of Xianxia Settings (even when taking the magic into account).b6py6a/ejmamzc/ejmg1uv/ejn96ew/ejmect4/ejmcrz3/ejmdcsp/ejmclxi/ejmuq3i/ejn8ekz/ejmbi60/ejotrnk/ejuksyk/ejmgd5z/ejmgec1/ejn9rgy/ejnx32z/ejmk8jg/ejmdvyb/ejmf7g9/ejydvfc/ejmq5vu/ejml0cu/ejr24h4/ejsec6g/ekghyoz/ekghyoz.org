Number 3 happens often in the real world.

- The worst study techniques are the most popular
- Bullshit diets are more popular than calories in calories out
- Applied critical thinking skills are not popular
- Dunno about popularity compared to better techniques but for sure many inefficient workout techniques aren't popular
- Not doing anything about mental health is more popular than using effective/healthy strategies to maintain it/improve it

Number 2 happens to an extent. There are many companies around which are "weak" compared to the big dogs. Many do eventually get bought up/subsumed but not all.
