Some of these complaints can be answered by appealing to the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situational_analysis][logic of the situation]]. Not every decision should be done on a realpolitik, /homo economicus/ basis.

Look at it through the lens of "face" and some of these things cohere.

*Picking a fight without knowing their capability* -- well what is impressive about picking a fight only once you know you can win it? More important is showing a willingness to throw down, anytime, any place. No insult will be tolerated, even if it is likely you'll get your ass kicked.

*Inexplicable weakling organisations* -- perhaps these organisations have survived by virtue of having good face, i.e. seeming more powerful (or at least more troublesome) than they really are.

*Worst Techniques are Popular* - this is one of the key elements of face that seem irrational from the outside: the concept of "everybody knows". If "everybody knows" X martial art is the best, you open yourself up to scorn and humiliation if you don't practise it - even if you have firm proof that it actually sucks! Hell, this happens all the time in real-life. Look at the idea of "skeuomorphism" in design circles. It's fallen so much out of favour that even if a designer finds a good application of it today, they'll probably seek a different approach because "everybody knows..."

*Armies of Useless Weaklings* - in terms of actual usefulness, very dumb yes. In terms of face, a small-but-elite army "looks" pathetic. So it can't be done. An army of a million mooks "looks" mighty. So it's de rigueur.

*Losing Face by Caring about Face* - you have to /care/ about face, all the time! No matter what kind of stupid hole it gets you into. You can never admit error, withdraw a claim, voluntarily lower yourself by even /one/ rung on the ladder of esteem. You have to be always right and have always been right. It is illogical in a long-term sense - you'd ultimately gain more face if you nipped your mistakes in the bud, so to speak. But because face is so oriented around perception, specifically others' perception, you can never seem to show to look to not care about it. (If that makes sense.)

And yeah, you can totally say "well, face is a stupid concept". And yeah, by and large I'd agree. But at the same time, if that's how you feel...xianxia fiction is just not the genre for you.
