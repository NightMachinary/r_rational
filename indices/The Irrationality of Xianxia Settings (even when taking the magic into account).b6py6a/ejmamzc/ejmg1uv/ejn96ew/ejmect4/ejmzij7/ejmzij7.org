This, pretty much. Went through point-by-point to indicate how this is true, in a hopefully non-spoiler-y way.

#+begin_quote
  *1. Picking a Fight Without Knowing Enemy Capabilities*
#+end_quote

In FMoC, anyone who isn't characterized as an idiot is extremely careful about this. Any faction worth mentioning has extensive intel capabilities, and even with that kind of information, experienced cultivators are still reluctant to casually feud with each other, just in case their intel is wrong. After all, hidden secret techniques and life-saving talismans are fairly abundant, so you can never be sure that you have the advantage in an 'even' fight... and if you were to bully a notably weaker party with your higher-realm skills, you'd probably incur the wrath of their allies.

  *2. Inexplicably Surviving Weakling Organizations*
#+end_quote

It's a less dog-eat-dog world than most cultivation stories, and the government of cultivators respond to a middling cultivator wiping out a small sect in much the same way modern governments respond to public mass murder (re: they send teams of highly-trained and well-equipped specialists to kill or capture the murderer). As such, this almost never happens, which means that weakling organizations have their niche.

#+begin_quote
  *3. The Worst Techniques are the Most Popular*
#+end_quote

Not true; in FMoC, there are plenty of good techniques offered freely by the government for the purpose of building the skills of young cultivators. At the same time, though, truly powerful techniques are the lifeline and primary income source of many sects. This might mean that they jealously guard their secrets (to make more money from their monopoly), but it often means that said high-end technique is a specialized one that requires a lot of lower-level training first before it becomes viable, and so can't be taught to everyone. 'Bad' techniques aren't in widespread use, but the 'best' techniques are viewed as the treasures they are, and the time of the experts willing and able to teach them is valued appropriately.

#+begin_quote
  *4. Armies of Useless Weaklings*
#+end_quote

Cultivators could fight lots of weaklings at once, and win... but FMoC notes that it costs them to fight on such a high level, and the spiritual energy they burn to do so can run out. Enough 'weaklings' can actually defeat a powerful cultivator through attrition, so it helps to have more of your own 'weaklings' to fight their 'weaklings', allowing your powerful cultivators to save their strength for the most important targets.

#+begin_quote
  *5. Unmanageably Worthless Currency*
#+end_quote

In FMoC, the credit chip has been invented. There are many ways of transferring wealth that don't involve handing over a literal mountain of low-grade spirit stones. That said, cultivators that have a need to work with large quantities of materials do in fact develop skills for quickly assessing the quantity and quality of those materials, and likely carry magic items that aid in storage and retrieval.

#+begin_quote
  *6. Misguided Masters Losing Face by Caring about Face*
#+end_quote

Without getting into spoilers, let's just say that sect masters in FMoC are well aware that the deeds of their disciples reflect upon them, and that there are multiple instances of them reacting appropriately to inappropriate behavior by a junior.

  *7. Auctions Without Protections*
#+end_quote

The existence of a strong central government helps to mitigate the "bitter and murderous loser" problem, but there are also plenty of magical items that promote anonymity, for the shadier sort of markets that would benefit from it. There is also at least one case in which an auction dispute is resolved amicably via mutually-beneficial trade.
