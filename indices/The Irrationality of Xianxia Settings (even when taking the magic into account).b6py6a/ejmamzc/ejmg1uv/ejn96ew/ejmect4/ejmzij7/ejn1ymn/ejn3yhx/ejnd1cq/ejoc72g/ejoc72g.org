The early part of FMoC is a rather deliberate deconstruction of a lot of xianxia tropes. e.g. what are the consequences for a society where all these cultivation tools are still lying around and accumulate in dumps, etc.

There are some good elements of this that survive throughout. The crystal suits and other high-tech fantasy elements are quite well grounded compared to most ideas in this literature, and for the most part the protagonist has to actually face hard challenges and situations in an oblique way to get ahead, rather than just fight someone one power-level above him in a tournament every 5 chapters like most of the genre.

Later on, it starts to drag in a lot of the standard escalation machinery out of the genre, and does a ton of setting-switching whenever the author gets bored and needs a larger stage. It is also not immune to the protagonist getting by on a metric ton of luck, but it actually lampshades this in the story and the fact that people have these special chances and society destroying calamities is explicitly built into the structure of the universe the story takes place.

It does however, seem to have more of an overall arc and "message" that most of the genre lacks, but the delivery of that message seems a bit non-rationalist, despite being enjoyed in rationalist circles.

*tl;dr* FMoC is somewhat refreshing if you've read a lot of xianxia, but if you haven't the tropes it tries to deconstruct aren't ones you'll have had much exposure to.
