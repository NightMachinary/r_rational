I couldn't get into it because of

1. word padding for chapters and overused info dumps

2. chinese racism disguised as nationalism

3. author is either forgetful or an idiot as they would constantly ignore facts that were said earlier (even basic arithmetic seems to be something they struggle with in the novel)

4. characters are one-dimensional

I could go on but I dropped it after breaking so many of its own rules constantly
