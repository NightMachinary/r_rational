Ironically you were making those attacks in the process. I didn't start any ad hominem until I got annoyed enough to point out your flaws, but at that point I wasn't arguing against you but instead saying why you should stop arguing and reevaluate your life.

Look, there are two ways to interpret this: either you take the argument without context, in which case you're arguing against something no one said, which is pedantic at best and a strawman at worst.

Or you put it in the wider political context, in which case people's responses make perfect sense and your argument becomes deceptive.
