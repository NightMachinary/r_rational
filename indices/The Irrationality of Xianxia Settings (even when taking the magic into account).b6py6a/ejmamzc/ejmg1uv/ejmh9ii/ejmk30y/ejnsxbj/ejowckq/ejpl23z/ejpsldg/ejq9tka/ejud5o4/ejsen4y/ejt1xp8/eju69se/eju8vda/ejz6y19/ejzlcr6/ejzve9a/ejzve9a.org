If you really don't understand why people are upset by a message along the lines of 'anyone can start a business and become rich' then think about the unspoken implication of that message. It says anyone who isn't rich isn't trying. Is lazy, or incompetent. That it's their fault if they're not rich.

This is why people are insulted. They are also attempting to educate you about the many obstacles to starting businesses and other ways of acquiring wealth that an industry of rich quick books and seminars won't tell you because their business hinges on not mentioning how improbable getting rich without any wealth to start with really is.
