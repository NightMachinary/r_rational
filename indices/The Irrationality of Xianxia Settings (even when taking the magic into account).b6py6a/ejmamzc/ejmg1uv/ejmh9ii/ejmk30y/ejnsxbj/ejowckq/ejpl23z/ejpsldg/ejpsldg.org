If you look at the statistics (for the U.S.) it depends partially on how you define rich. There are a significant number of people making one or two hundred thousand a year who are self made, with parents who were merely middle class or less. It's possible to go to school and work hard and make that kind of money.

But once you start getting into serious wealth, the percentages of people who weren't born into wealth go down. Only about a third or so. (Meaning two thirds were born into the wealth.) This is because doing things like starting businesses costs a lot of money, money that the vast majority of the population simply does not have and cannot realistically obtain loans for because they don't have millions of dollars in collateral or wealthy connections willing to take a risk on them.

Wealth makes it easy to accumulate more wealth, which is why most of the wealthy in the U.S. didn't actually earn it. It takes strong progressive taxation to keep down the generational wealth accumulation to a point where most of the wealthy are first generation. It's something seen in some European countries.
