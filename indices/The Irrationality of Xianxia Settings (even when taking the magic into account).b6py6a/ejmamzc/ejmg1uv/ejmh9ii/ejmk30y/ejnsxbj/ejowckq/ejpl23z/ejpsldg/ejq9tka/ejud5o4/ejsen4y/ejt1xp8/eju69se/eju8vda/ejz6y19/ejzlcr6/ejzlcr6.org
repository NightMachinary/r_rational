  You can, those are called outliers. It's statistics and survivorship bias. You should know better if you're on [[/r/rational][r/rational]], unless you're a Ben Shapiro style "rationalist".

The discussion started because it was stated / implied 'it's not possible', there is evidence against it, disconfirming evidence, therefore it is 'possible'.

​

It's a simple point I'm trying to make. You might argue the evidence is not ideal, and I'd agree, but it happens with enough frequency to be imho enough evidence to prove it is not 'impossible'.

The survivorship bias itself shows that the probability isn't 0.

  If you're seriously arguing that having more money and status doesn't give a clear advantage to starting a business go ahead and look at the actual data instead of what you've heard on talk radio.

I didn't, it obviously does. I said it isn't a Requirement given the evidence available.

  No, people don't like to hear it because it's a flawed argument that relies on survivorship bias.

  It is, and you're the one who's arguing against evolution in that simile. Have you ever considered you could be wrong about this, instead of just dismissing other opinions?

All I implied was: hey maybe the chance of people (yourself included) doing X is higher than you think, here's some evidence.

It's an encouraging positive message, you'd generally expect a positive or neutral response from reasonable people, but that's not what tends to happen.

​

The response you generally get from some people is: No it's IMPOSSIBLE, only XYZ people could ever do it, that evidence is worthless, no amount of evidence you can ever provide will be enough to change my mind ever.

And often a fair bit of ad hominems and straw man attacks. Both of which you might or might not have just attempted..

​

How dare I suggest people could do something they thought wasn't possible ?

It's been at least 2 days, probably more, and some people are still bothered enough to be messaging me about this. It's not even a topic I particularly care about, as I've repeatedly stated..

Do I really seem unreasonable to you ?

  This truth thing seems pretty handy. Why, then, do we keep jumping to conclusions, digging our heels in, and recapitulating the same mistakes? Why are we so bad at acquiring accurate beliefs, and how can we do better? These seven sequences discuss motivated reasoning and confirmation bias, with a special focus on hard-to-spot species of self-deception and the trap of “using arguments as soldiers”.
