Martial World (on wuxiaworld.com), full of cliches, but also very well written action scenes.

Xianxia with a touch of comedy: A will eternal (on wuxiaworld.com) & Cultivation Chat Group (on webnovel.com). You can read webnovel.com novels on pirate site wuxiaworld.co to avoid having to pay.

Rational xianxia with a scifi flavor: Forty Millennia of Cultivation (webnovel.com). This one is a favorite of many people here. The first arc, up to chapter 95, is more cliched and the translation improves as it goes along, so you might as well skip it, and start reading when the MC goes off to college.
