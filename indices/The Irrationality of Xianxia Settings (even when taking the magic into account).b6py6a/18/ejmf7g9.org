a novel that just appeared in top web fiction and that side some of those mistakes is forge of destiny, now rocking in number 4. the points that i found more idiotic are 2 4 and 5, they are simply irrational and i deeply dislike them.

1,3 and 6 i dont really have much problem with, is simply (imo) taking too far the concept of face, but the young master problem i think is normal in universe because the mc usually is an freakish fenomenon and is very much abnormal.
