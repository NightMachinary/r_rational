I find myself pondering again and again what Bard's story is a metaphor for. There are a few I can think of... the innkeeper represents the Gods, who basically say "You can fight for what you want." TDK is, well, TDK. But who do the rest represent?

First thought: The Princes are the sides of the war. Arlesite is proud and formal and not too bright - my first thought was that he represents Procer. Cordelia may be smart, but the Procerans in general seem pretty foolish and haughty, convinced they're stronger and that their enemies will play by the rules. Alamans is haughty, entitled, and snobbish; that's the Praesi to a T. And the Lycanoese is spiteful and wants to deny TDK even if it's not in his own interest. Callow loves them some grudges and spite. The soup in the metaphor is land - they're all fighting over claiming some ground and assume TDK wants it too. But no, TDK wants the baby - which represents people. More useful resources he can use for his future purposes.

Second thought: The Princes are all parts of the Crusade. Arlesite is none too bright and prepared to easily win a straight-up fight: this is the traditional blustering Procerans and the heroes convinced they can win honorably in frontal assaults. Alamans represents the entitled princes thinking they're owed their due for no reason other than that they're nobles. And Lycanoese is Cordelia (and possibly GP), who actually knows where the true threat lies and (thinks she knows) what it wants. Cat is the woman, the soup is Callow, and the baby... I don't know. It might represent the future, but of Procer alone or Calernia itself, I'm unsure.
