I don't think it's a reference to killing Cat. Instead, its a note about how the Dead King is going to gain power. We remember that his rise came from him out playing the wandering bard, having to play war and politics perfectly to rise. This time, rather than try to gain power any of the normal ways, like the others in the bar do, he's going to eat the baby, satisfy his lust for power in a way that is utterly foreign to anyone else. I can only hope it will be worth the wait (and that the bard isn't lying)
