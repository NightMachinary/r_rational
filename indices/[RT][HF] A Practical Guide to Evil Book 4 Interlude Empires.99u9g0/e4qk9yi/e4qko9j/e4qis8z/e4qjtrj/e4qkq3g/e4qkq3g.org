I'm glad not only that Cat didnt murder Malicia but that Malicia out planned her. Malicia was set up as a supremely competent character and i was worried the story was going to have Cat wipe the floor with her in a way that didn't feel deserved. The kind of layered fail safe's we saw here are very much the Malicia i was hoping for.
