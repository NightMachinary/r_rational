Honestly, does it matter?

We don't need it to be part of the secret conversation. It's only reasonable. Cat knows Malicia has a method of talking to the Dead King, and vice-versa. Even killing her 'meat puppet' wouldn't really ruin any deals. She could simply say "I agree to your terms" and, if necessary, send another representative or go herself to sign. Just being stopped *now* doesn't mean her plan would be stopped.

It's a curious game. The only winning move is not to play. So she flips the table and storms out before Malicia keeps letting him get away with more and more.
