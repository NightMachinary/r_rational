Different cultivation realms, every seperate realm is a massive powerup compared to the former. Its somewhat exponential.

If you want to read some xianxias, I recommend ISSTH at Wuxiaworld.com, but if you want to start on a story with no chinese names, start on Coiling Dragon. I was actually put off when I first started reading Xianxias by the Chinese names because I got confused, and didnt understand how the names worked

Protip: Most of these stories aren't rational.
