I think that was more of a metaphorical thing. I looked up "Stand" in the context of eastern mythology and couldn't find anything, and TVTropes didn't have much about it. Also, when the author of Jojo introduced the concept of Stands to replace ripples, he remarked that he was worried other people wouldn't understand the concept, which doesn't fit with it being a semi-permanent part of mythology.

My best guess is that this aspect of xianxia is just derivative. Jojo is pretty popular in the east, and so are series with similar mechanics, like /Persona/. The whole "summoning an other" to fight for you thing is a common theme in Japanese games too.
