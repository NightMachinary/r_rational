(I'd just like to note that I got in touch with Strivon and we're coming up with more intuitive nomenclature for a lot of the terms. I've always felt rather dissatisfied with 'official' translation terminology anyways, and this was an opportunity for me to help put some nonliteralist translation theory into practice!)

Basically, to put it in my own words:

The basic concept of xianxia levels is transhumanism through magic through kung-fu.

At mere mortal stages of preparation, you hone your body so that it becomes a resilient physical vessel that can hold the sheer power of essence without breaking.

At the early stages of cultivation, you gather essence into your own body, opening channels with 'hydraulic' pressure, creating a secondary system of circulation for your body to use for magic, and forming a reservoir of magic within your own body. Now you can store magic and draw on it later, rather than just relying on ambient magic in the air, making you a proper cultivator sorceror at last and not just some dude who's chanting off a scroll or whatever.

At the medium stages, you start consolidating your essence into a physical organ inside your body. This organ becomes a secondary, backup brain. If you die, this organ can survive outside of the body, like a phylactery hidden inside your body; you can use it to possess other people, and it retains your full mindstate, ensuring your continuity as a being. It also often functions simultaneously as the magic reactor that powers your whole body, being an evolved form of the magic reservoir previously described; this is the 'core' referred to by the other post.

At higher stages, your phylactery turns out to have been an egg the whole time, and hatches into a Stand. You can now manifest a spiritual form that represents the condensation of all of your magical power to augment your own powers and beat people up. It also retains the previous functionality as a mindstate escape-pod, but it can now actively use a limited range of the magic you had available previously.

Beyond that, every single story makes up its own levels of bullshit, with differing levels of mysticality. The first four levels tend to be mostly consistent across stories, though.

Note, also, that Cultivation40k doesn't follow a lot of these proscriptions in detail. It's got its own worldbuilding justification for how stuff works, which is much more consistent with rational storytelling tropes, and- to strike the comparison again- reminds me a lot of how Harry analyzed magic in HPMOR. Everything I wrote above is just how /most/ xianxia novels approach magic powerlevels.
