In most xianxia the goal of everyone is to become as close to immortal and almighty as possible. This is done by transforming yourself through meditation / training / medicines. There is usually a single established way everyone does this (even if the details differ), which is then divided in "stages" that you have to accomplish in a certain order, each one transforming one aspect of yourself.

To take ISSTH as an example, the goal is to form an immortal soul. (There is also some lost knowledge about cultivating an immortal body, but only the MC does that.)

  Qi Gathering:
#+end_quote

- Goal: Infuse your body with Qi energy and develop channels so that you can actually do anything with that energy. In the center of your "self" form a Qi lake.
- Benefits: Basic magic techniques (summon small fire serpent, activate magic items, concoct basic pills, a couple of seconds of flight).

#+begin_quote
  Foundation building:
#+end_quote

- Transform the Qi lake into "dao pillars", which form the foundation for later stages.
- Benefits: Sustained (slow) flying, more powerful magic.

#+begin_quote
  Core Formation:
#+end_quote

- Goal: Form a "Core" out of your pillars.
- Benefits: A couple of decades more life.

#+begin_quote
  Nascent Soul:
#+end_quote

- Goal: Use the Core as a seed to form an actual soul self.
- Benefits: If you die, your soul can escape and try to form a new body. Natural age of several centuries. Short range teleportation.

#+begin_quote
  Spirit Severing:
#+end_quote

- Goal: Cut away the central aspects that are holding your soul tethered to your mortal life. Kill your friends and loved ones, or surgically remove any doubt and remorse over whether this is a good choice. Only your way of the dao may remain.
- Benefits: Lifespan of (I think) two millenia. Only focussed on the truly important things in life. May appear two-dimensional. Long-range teleportation.

#+begin_quote
  Dao Seeking:
#+end_quote

- Goal: Find what you really care about.
- Benefits: I don't even know.

#+begin_quote
  Immortal Ascension.

- Haven't read that far.

If one is really, really talented and finds a very spiritually rich place, one might theoretically reach Core Formation without using any resources other than the energy one has personally filtered from the air. That would mean one has spent their entire life sitting still and doing nothing of consequence, though.

On the other hand, even the most talentless hack can accomplish the first stage with a few resources.
