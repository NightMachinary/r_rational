To, uh, put it in a less flattering light-

Basically, in most Xianxia novels, /literally everybody is Voldemort./

Once you get high enough in power levels, there will no longer /be/ any sympathetic characters with the full diversity of human motivations and experiences for the reader to identify with. All that you're left with are soulless, identically ruthless murderhobos fighting each other over resources, and the only thing that privileges the protagonist is them being able to out-murderhobo all the other murderhobos consistently. Somehow, this is a writing paradigm that has managed to not only survive, but /thrive/. Somehow.

Cultivation40k, luckily, isn't most Xianxia, and actively seeks to deconstruct this dynamic in later chapters. One of the many reasons why I /really really love this story/.
