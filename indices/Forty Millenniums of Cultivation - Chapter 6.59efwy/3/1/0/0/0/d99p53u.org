- Goal: Cut away the central aspects that are holding your soul tethered to your mortal life. Kill your friends and loved ones, or surgically remove any doubt and remorse over whether this is a good idea. Only your way of the dao may remain.

Please note that at least in ISSTH you don't /have/ to become a ruthless murder hobo. You could have some complex dao about always being reasonable despite all the ruthless murderhoboing around you, provided you feel strongly enough about it. Pill Demon is a good example of this, I think. Though it should also be noted that he didn't have enough motivation to keep advancing until he felt he had to protect one of his students.

Somewhat relevant to this subreddit, this could you into what is essentially an AI with a single goal as defined by your dao.
