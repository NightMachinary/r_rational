Chapter 6 basically sets the tone for how this story deconstructs existing xianxia settings by saying 'look, your resource consumption rates are unsustainable, your society is top-heavy, it's got too many superpowered wizards that need to eat a whole city's worth of energy every single day, your society was inevitably going to collapse sooner or later.'

I remember rather distinctly the first time I read this chapter and how I went 'holy shit this is literally the most accurate criticism of Xianxia I have ever read, this is the perfect rational deconstruction, I need to share this with [[/r/rational][r/rational]]'. The way the author begins the story by challenging the entire establishment of magical society and basically yelling 'your worldbuilding doesn't work, your economy is bullshit' at the top of his lungs reminds me a lot of the first few chapters of HPMOR.

Also, just in case you didn't notice it, the Supreme Emperor described in this chapter, who formed twenty 'Sects of Provenance' (or, alternatively translatable as 'Primarch Sects'), is, well, it's pretty obvious why the story is named 'Cultivation 40k' isn't it, now? :P
