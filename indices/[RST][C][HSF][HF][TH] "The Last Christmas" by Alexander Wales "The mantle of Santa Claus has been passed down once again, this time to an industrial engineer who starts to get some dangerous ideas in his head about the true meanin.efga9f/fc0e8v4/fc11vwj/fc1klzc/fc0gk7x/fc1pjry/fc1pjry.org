I love it, though the problem of the elves' mortality is an interesting one... The protagonist basically uplifted a species without testing what would happen when they had immortality or putting any safeguards at all in place (then did it immediately again, with humans). I'm not convinced it doesn't also imply that human psyches aren't stable to millennia of experience with the elves' comments about delivering presents and the case study of the previous Santa, as well... This may actually class as a 'worst possible end' under that reading.
