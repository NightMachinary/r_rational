"Breaking it" seems uncharitable. The original situation was entirely terrible - the powers to bring about any utopia were held back to do incremental amounts of good at best, and millions of elves were dying needlessly every year.

Wrangling godlike powers to create a sustainable utopia is, as we should all be aware, /difficult/, and Charles seems to have mostly managed, if in a somewhat more hasty fashion than he had hoped.
