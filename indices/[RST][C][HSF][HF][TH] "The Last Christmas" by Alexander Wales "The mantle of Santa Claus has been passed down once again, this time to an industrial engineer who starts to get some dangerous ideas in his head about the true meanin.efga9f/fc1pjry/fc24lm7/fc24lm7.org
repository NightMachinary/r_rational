To be fair, the elves only benefited from this. They were right to point out that millennia of menial labor for mature minds is dulling and unacceptable. I'd expect humans to react to long-term mental/physical slavery the same way. They seem to have a codified set of laws, are still a unified people, and have enough compassion to not strike back against humans in any of the clever ways they probably could, given their mastery of the Christmas Spirit. That last part immediately makes this a fantastic end in my book. And I'd have faith that, in helping Charles craft The Last Christmas, they'd maintain that level of care/respect for human life, immediate and future.
