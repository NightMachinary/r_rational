I'm not as convinced. My reading is of the Christmas Spirit as some capricious off shoot of human culture, which is not inherently aligned with human interests. That the elves became less rigid and more functional as they aged doesn't really help me shake the feeling that their values are ultimately so alien to human interests that in mastering them they necessarily are capable of making that judgment call - younger elves certainly aren't.
