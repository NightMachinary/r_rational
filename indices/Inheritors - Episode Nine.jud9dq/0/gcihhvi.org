I've been following this story for the past few chapters and the writing is pretty polished. The world building lore is slowly doled out and it doesn't take long for the main conflict to be identified. The protagonist's power is pretty strong, but based on the events that happened in universe, he's not exactly overpowered. To me, it looks like a rational reaction to the way society would develop if people did develop powers. Chaotic with some form of government backed by people with powers.
