That feels like a very big project. I don't think I have it in me to work on that right now. It occurs to me that the story above might work if Kirby got spliced or cloned partway through the story and the other Kirby alllied himself with Voldemort...

If you would like to try writing either of those story ideas go ahead. I have to admit nightmare and dreamland definitely has potential for rational retelling.
