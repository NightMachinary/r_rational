I'm enjoying this uncommonly self-aware version of Kirby, but I don't know if I'd qualify him as rational just yet, and also I'm not seeing any Wizard People and frankly, don't really want to.

Consider the possibility of coming up with a Kirby fan fic rather than an un-fitting crossover. I particularly like the idea of reading in rather more detail about the misguided attempt to imperialistically exploit planet Popstar by a well-meaning but fundamentally wrong businessman.

Kirby's world is bizarre and strange and it'd interest me far more to see it given the "rational treatment" than to shunt Kirby off into Hogwarts.
