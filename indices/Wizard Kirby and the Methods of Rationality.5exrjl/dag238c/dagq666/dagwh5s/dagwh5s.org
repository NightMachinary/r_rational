Thanks- I might give it a shot, but you're right to say it's a big project and I'm already trying to write some fairly expansive things, so who knows how far I'll get. On the other hand, "Rational" fan fiction is almost universally expansive, which is one reason I haven't tried my hand at it much. As a result, it kind of baffles my mind to think you'd want to write a Rational work about Voldemort and Hogwarts and Kirby and consider that /not/ to be a big project. It might even have to be bigger than the one about Kirby's world in order to justify itself.

Good Kirby vs. Evil Kirby has limited potential. One facet of Rational fan fiction is that the hero is Right by virtue of their reasoning abilities. If Evil Kirby is initially the same person as Good Kirby (and just off the top of my head he should be to maximize dramatic tension) then the only reason he'd make different choices than Good Kirby would in a given situation would either be that Good Kirby only obtained his rationalist worldview (and thus, his Rightness, by the rules of this type of story) after they became two people, or if Evil Rational Kirby was actually Good Rational Kirby and knew something that Good Kirby (actually Misinformed Rational Kirby in this hypothetical) didn't. If it's just Good Kirby vs. Evil Kirby in a straightforward way, then I fail to see what makes them fight or indeed what makes them Rational beyond an uncommon self-awareness, which of course isn't the same thing...

Good luck on the project either way! :D
