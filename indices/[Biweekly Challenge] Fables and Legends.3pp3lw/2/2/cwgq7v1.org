My upvote is for "Future Apparent," which I enjoyed a lot. Like the other posters, I found that "The Kept Promise" covered too much inferential distance without enough explanation. But I'm glad that explanation was absent, since it caused your wordcount to come out low and therefore in turn caused you to write the other story.
