The Kept Promise and Future Apparent have nothing to do with each other--they're separate ideas that I had rattling around in my head and wanted to try writing down. The Kept Promise is about fable exploitation/usurpation, whereas Future Apparent is presented in terms of the self-narratives which run through the two sides' societies (the shape of the future each side sees and is absolutely certain of, which we can contrast each other and see to be both wrong and doomed). I'm not sure I understand what you mean by 'the act of union'. I'm sorry for not making it clearer that the two stories weren't part of a series--thank you for making me aware of that assumption as a possibility!
