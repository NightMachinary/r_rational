Ahh. I might not have gone to that degree of wordiness (trying to represent a person's thoughts/impressions rather than oration), but for example 'To all our country' would likely have been much better as the more explanatory 'To all in the British Isles'. (I can't change the 'England's once and future king' part at the end without invalidating the 'once' or otherwise marring the line.)

Edit: Incidentally impression is that a version without a different timeline is simpler to posit than a version with it, but if mentioning Ireland by name is necessary to convey its presence I have no objection to the setting being imagined as an alternate timeline instead. <Code Geass reminiscence>
