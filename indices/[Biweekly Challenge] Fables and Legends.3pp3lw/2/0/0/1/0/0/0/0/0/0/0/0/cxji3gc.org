  Geoffrey's version of events often served as the starting point for later stories. Geoffrey depicted Arthur as a king of Britain who defeated the Saxons and established an empire over Britain, Ireland, Iceland, Norway and Gaul.

Obviously the French weren't really French by the time of Arthur's supposed existence.

But anyway that's what I remembered so the idea was his choice of either just the UK or the entire British Isles would be notable enough to be mentioned. Trying to find a map of his supposed Kingdom leads to all sorts of contradictory nonsense.
