Ah, I see. My apologies for misunderstanding. The entire British Isles (yes, including southern Ireland, for example because it would raise eyebrows amidst the populace if only it were unnecessarily left outside) are being protected/dominated, but an English person may tend (depending on personality/upbringing) to think of England more in terms of England than Britain, especially when thinking about English legends. It's a good point that Scotland, southern Ireland et cetera may have more incredulous populace overall regarding this.
