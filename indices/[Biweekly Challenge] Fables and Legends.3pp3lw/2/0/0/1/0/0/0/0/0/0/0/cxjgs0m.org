Ahh, I see! Relevant indeed, though it might make more people in the populace suspicious (particularly in the context of defense against a powerful outside threat--though, the more I think of it, the more the incidental folding of Ireland back into Britain in the face of a fearful enemy makes sense as something happening in the background, sooner or later (unofficially first, later officially)). Do you know of any legends of King Arthur as an English king that deal with him conquering other lands or ruling over Ireland? My impression of him was that he inherited the kingdom from his father (via the sword?) and then kept it safe until the Mordred thing, but I'm not a dedicated scholar.

--That said, it /would/ be hilarious (in a completely different story, say) to see the real Arthur come back, without an fraud of a great enemy (maybe "The people's souls cried out to me that the land is in need once more, threatened by this 'economic recession' fiend!"), and try to lead an army against 'the uppity French' by invading Disneyland or something like that... less so if in reality due to the death and bloodshed involved, but are there any fictions that come to mind where a legendary hero ends up in the modern world and actually makes reasonable headway at war against his traditional enemies before someone stops him? (Something like if, in Fate/zero, Alexander/Rider had /actually/ won and then tried to conquer his way from Japan to Greece across Eurasia as he'd planned...)
