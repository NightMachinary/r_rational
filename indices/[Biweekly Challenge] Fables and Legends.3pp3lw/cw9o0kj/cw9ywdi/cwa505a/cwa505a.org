  How does the fox know that the rabbit he caught is the smartest rabbit in the forest, and not just a smart rabbit in the forest?
#+end_quote

He doesn't know that it's the /smartest/, but he reasons that Father Moose probably doesn't have some super-special way of figuring out which rabbit is the smartest either, so the context of the challenge is "beating Bear" rather than complete optimization (and Fox is both clever and lazy). Fox is not terribly surprised to find that this challenge was about /good methods/ rather than /good outcomes/.
