The narrative is fine. I love a complicated narrative, and no doubt most of the other lurkers do as well. The issue is a mixture of the voting system and the planning process, leaning a bit more towards the first than the second. That said, both of those are symptoms of how you guys write the quest.

Most of the time, quests as fleshed out as MfD (i.e., not a CK2/spreadsheet quest) will have votes be more general; guiding themes of thought, not actual specific motions. Votes tend to be more about shaping the narrative than the mess of actions and sub-actions I tend to see when I look at a plan. The character is, well, trusted to be that character. Most of the time there simply isn't going to be a need for the level of micromanagement MfD tends to get up to. Sure, in high tension situations you'll get more specific voting, but even then, most of the time it'll be a 'framework' of ideas not a 'machine' of them. Big picture voting is what normally happens, if you get my meaning.

If you want to draw in more people, leave more up to Hanzou and less up to us. Oh! Recent example, the youthsuit retcon. In a normal quest like this, that wouldn't have happened the way it did because it was OOC for Hazou. He would have done his best to reach the goal 'get youthsuits to cheer up the team', but would have done so with IC actions/thought process.

/That said/ your currently active players probably enjoy the micro (at least in part), so changing things up might not run so well with them.

I'm not entirely sure what you should do. Maybe check with your most active players and see how they would take you guys simplifying things? Otherwise, keep on trucking.

TLDR; MfD is more control heavy than most expect for a quest of it's size/type, so voting takes more effort. So less people vote. If you want more active players leave more to the character. Just make sure you don't alienate the players you already have.
