#+begin_quote
  Just out of curiosity, let me try something:

  Hey, all lurkers: would you please make one post, either here or on the most recent MfD Reddit thread, stating that you read this? I'm curious how many are out there.

  (If you wanted to add more information, that would be great but definitely isn't required. Good options would be why you prefer not to post (too complicated? too fast-moving? something else?) and how you found us in the first place.)

I read this! First found it from a post on the subreddit, shortly after it began. (The thing I remember from when I first caught up was Wakahisa's limb-grafting bloodline getting vetoed). I'd enjoyed other works from the quest authors, so I gave it a look, then kept giving it a look every couple days or so.

As for why I lurk: +lupchanzen are responsible+ I tend to read much more than I post in general, so it's mostly force of habit. If I saw some low-hanging fruit that everyone else was missing, I'd post it, but the thread goers are quite attentive. (I'm definitely willing to interfere if a joke plan ever resurfaces, though).
