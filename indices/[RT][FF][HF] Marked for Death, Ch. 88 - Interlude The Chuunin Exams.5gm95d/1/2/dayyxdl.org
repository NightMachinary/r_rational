I too read pretty actively. I greatly enjoy reading the planning and discussion, and at the moment MFD is probably my favorite piece of serial fiction.

I lurk mostly out fear of the time commitment. I don't tend to really participate in things on the internet and I have an aversion to starting. I'm steadily working to convince myself to actually vote though.
