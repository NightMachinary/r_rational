  Still other texts say the Messiah will come in a generation that is both the most righteous and the most wicked. I don't even know what to think of that one.

Joint over and underdiagnosis! Kinda. Ish. It's definitely this one, though.

Ish. Ishmael. Call me Ishmael. Maelstrom. Hunter of the white whale. Sow the wind, reap the whirlwind. Reap the maelstrom, the mal-storm, revenge, justice, punishment for violating God's command that you proselytize to Niveneh. Imprecision as natural consequence of brokenness: hold the edges loosely lest they cut against your skin. When you cleave reality at the joints, it cleaves back. This is fun.
