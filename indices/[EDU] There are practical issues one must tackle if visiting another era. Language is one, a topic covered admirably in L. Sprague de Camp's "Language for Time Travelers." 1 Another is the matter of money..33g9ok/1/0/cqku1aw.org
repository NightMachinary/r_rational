I seem to recall that before the 18th century, diamonds were really not valuable. Sure, there were some remarkable and large pieces, but small diamonds were boring. People liked jewelry with color, like rubies, sapphires, etc. There are artificial gemstones of other types that might be of greater value than diamonds.

Interesting. Reading the article, apparently Romans liked diamonds a great deal.
