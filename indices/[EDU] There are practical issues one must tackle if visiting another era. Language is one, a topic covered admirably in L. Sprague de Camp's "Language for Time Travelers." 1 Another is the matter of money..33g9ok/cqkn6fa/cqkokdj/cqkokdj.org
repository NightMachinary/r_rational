Yes actually because aluminum was an extremely scarce material centuries ago. In fact, royalty would eat off aluminum plates while dukes would eat off /platinum/ plates. However, when Hans Christian Ã˜rsted (I think?) managed to produce aluminum by extracting it from the reactions of two common chemicals, aluminum became insanely cheap. Imagine diamonds becoming cheap as bread.

TL;DR - Yes, more than gold or silver.
