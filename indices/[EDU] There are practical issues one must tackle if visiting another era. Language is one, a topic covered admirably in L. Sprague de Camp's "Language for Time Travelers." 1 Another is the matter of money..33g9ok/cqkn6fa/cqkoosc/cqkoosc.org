Sure, as long as you're between 1850 and 1888 - preferably towards the end. Before 1846, metallic aluminium had never been synthesised, so nobody would have any use for it except as a curiosity.

If you specifically knew you were going to the mid-1880s, then an ingot of aluminium would be more valuable than gold. But everywhen else it's not particularly good for trading.
