Without having read the article yet, my first thought would be: Go to the supermarket, buy up all the salt and spices you can get your hands on. Salt is cheaper than dirt (well, potting soil) in much of modern Western society, but was highly valuable back in the day -- Roman legionnaires were paid in the stuff. Spices are high-value, low mass, and the small screw-top glass jars you can get them in will be valuable in their own right. (Granted, you'll want to buy most of your spices in bulk.)

Aside from that...hm. Medical supplies won't be understood well enough to be valuable in much of history, although you'll definitely want some antibiotics for yourself. Cubic zirconia might be a good option if you're morally flexible -- I don't know if anyone in the far past could tell the difference between CZes and diamonds.

One thing he brought up at the end of how to make a profit on your return. He mentions the mass / volume limits on bringing stuff back, but there's another issue: anything you bring back in your time machine won't pass carbon dating etc as being the right age. Much better would be to set up multiple caches of stuff and then simply "treasure hunt" them up in the modern era. No mass / volume limits, and everything will pass any tests people want to use, because it really /is/ exactly what you claim it to be.
