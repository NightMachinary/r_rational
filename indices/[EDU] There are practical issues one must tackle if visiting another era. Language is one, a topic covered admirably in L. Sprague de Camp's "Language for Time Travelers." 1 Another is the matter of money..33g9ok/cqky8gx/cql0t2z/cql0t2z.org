The problem with these ideas is that you don't remain in control of them, and the concept of intellectual property really has no roots going back beyond a few centuries ago. You teach people how to distill alcohol, make float glass, or design greenhouses and the effort might earn you short-term wealth, but your ideas would be stolen and used by others very quickly - especially if they are game changers.

So, if you want wealth, you need to sell the results of a process that you can manage yourself. Distilling alcohol would be a good one.

If you want to improve the world, well, that's a completely different story!
