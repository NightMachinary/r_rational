I won't say it's impossible, but trying to get into political power in the ancient world would be dramatically difficult, even by proxy. In a day and time when there was no internet and no organized postal service, figuring out who is talking to who was not hard. The more people your figurehead ruins, the harder that their enemies are going to be looking for your figurehead's source of ideas, money, whatever. Not an insurmountable problem, but, honestly, I'd rather trade as a merchant in the distant past, and live rich in the future.
