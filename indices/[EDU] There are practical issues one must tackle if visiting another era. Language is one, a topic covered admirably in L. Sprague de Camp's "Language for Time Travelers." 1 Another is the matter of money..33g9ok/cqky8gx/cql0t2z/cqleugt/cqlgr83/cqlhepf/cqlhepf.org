Do read the article I linked. /You/ don't have to worm your way into politics; you just have to be the /Ã©minence grise/ behind the person who does. They can be a local.

(And, if you can't find a local by being nice, being able to "treat, but not cure" what you recognize as vitamin deficiencies with some "miracle pills" can make for excellent bribery/blackmail material. Most of those were only solved in the last 100 years!)
