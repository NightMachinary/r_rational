I hesitate to believe that well-explained ideas wouldn't spread quickly and far. A lot of the ideas that we look at today as being pivotal and potentially game changing in ancient days were barely understood, scientifically, and were frequently military secrets.

Now, if you feel immortal enough to try to get into the politics of ancient governments, then you can start feeding to the military industrial complex of that nation, true. You'd best hire a lot of damn fine bodyguards, and pay food tasters though, because every new advance you generate will destroy some other important person's industry.

You would have a hard time worming your way into politics as an outsider in many nations, no matter how you tried. In others, there's no way you would manage it in any way as a merchant.

We have a very open world these days. It's hard to imagine how closed the world was in ancient times.
