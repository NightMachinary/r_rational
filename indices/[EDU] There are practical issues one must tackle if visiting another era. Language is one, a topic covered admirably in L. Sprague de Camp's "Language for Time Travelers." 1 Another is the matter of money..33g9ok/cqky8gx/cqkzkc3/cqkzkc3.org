Secrets are a powerful thing to be selling.

Sell the steam engine. I could design a wood burning steam powered mill, and get it working in 2-3 attempts, from memory, now. I could do much better bringing back technical schematics. The only issue here is fuel. Of course with steam power, I can run a drill that pulls out more coal than the drill consumes, to power even better engines.

Don't sell today's spices at yesterdays prices, build a rail line across the middle east and sell yesterdays spices at yesterdays prices.
