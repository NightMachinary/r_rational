Personally? I'd carry razor blades as trade goods if I went back to the pre-industrial age. Good, stout blades that could be mounted in wood, brass, bronze, copper, or ceramic tools. Teach people how to sharpen them and keep them oiled. Be careful though. The military will probably attempt to recruit you for your knowledge, and would almost certainly be extremely upset if you were to take your secret of blades to another nation. Choose the nation you visit carefully, and make the stay a short one.

Trade razor blades for gold. Rinse, repeat.
