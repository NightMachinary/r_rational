Assuming you can jump back and forth at will, take sufficient tools to perform a massive bank heist in a given era (or theft of gold, silver, or other valuable commodities), and then skip back five or ten years and establish yourself as a rich trader or foreign dignitary.

If you absolutely must stay through to the time of the heist (and assuming a single timeline), it would be trivial to arrange to be seen in public in a different city by multiple persons of impeccable word, and your own known wealth would not change (ie suspiciously increase).

As for bringing items and commodities forward in time - why not simply invest a large amount of money in the past and leave a set of instructions about how to manage and invest it over the centuries? Let compound interest and knowledge of how various industries would develop do the work for you. Have an ancient order of monks hang around for a thousand years carrying out your will.
