Steam engines aren't a bad idea, but I think you would run into issues with material sciences. if you were restricted to copper or bronze or brass, would you be able to create an engine that could perform enough work to justify the cost of the mass of metal required to contain the combustion and cooling systems? Systemically, it is an interesting problem. I've considered it from the aspect of a stone aged materials base with a modern era understanding of science. You would need to create the science understanding though, or figure out a way to use simple materials.

Mining coal would likely not be a good choice before high grade steel. Even iron chisels and tools would break down quickly, and your energy would have to be largely devoted to replacing the bits and the equipment to make the bits, even if you could recycle most of the iron. Charcoal from charcoal burning pits, or even wood would work though.
