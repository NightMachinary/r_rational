But, before globalization, ideas also didn't spread very far. Pick a small country, and then start continuously pumping up its GDP by feeding "discoveries" to random local entrepreneurs, while also worming your way into its politics (propped up, of course, by lobbying from the same now-successful entrepreneurs.) Whichever country you pick takes over the world at the same rate you take over the country.

(Oddly, this is effectively the same strategy [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/04/07/no-physical-substrate-no-problem/][posited here]] as the easiest way for an AI to get a lot of human labor-force under its control to build it a body. Time-travellers and AIs are somewhat analogous in plausible bootstrapping mechanisms, aren't they?)
