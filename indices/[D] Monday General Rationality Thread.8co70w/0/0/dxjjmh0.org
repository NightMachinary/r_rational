Get hyped guys. I've been following this project since it broke off from Leela Zero. It's amazing how far it's come in just a few months. It was good enough to take a few games against the lowest engine in TCEC while making endgame blunders all the way. The bonus is that it plays much more like a human than previous chess engines, so this will be a very interesting set of games to watch.
