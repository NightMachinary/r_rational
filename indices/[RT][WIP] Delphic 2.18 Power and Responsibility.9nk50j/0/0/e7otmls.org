Huh~~~ so you think they're in league with LL... I hadn't thought of that... I figured that LL's faction was just trying to keep them from ruining their refraxx story...

But this makes so much more sense... Ppl wouldn't listen to them if they claimed refraxx attacked first anyway, not after they shoved him into a trunk... But if it was covering up LL's involvement in whisper's kidnapping...
