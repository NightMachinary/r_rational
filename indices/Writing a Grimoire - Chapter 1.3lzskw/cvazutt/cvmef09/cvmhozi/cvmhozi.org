No. This sub isn't a very good format in itself. You'll note that this post doesn't link to the next section (it's ridiculous to call these chapters). There is no centralized location to link to this story; the sections will be distributed as scattered posts, only able to be recohered through a search. And if the author decides to change the title? Reddit is a bad idea for this sort of thing, while there are plenty of avenues that work much better.
