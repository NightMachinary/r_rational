I think they're talking about avatars and puppets with lower-case first letters, because a good friend has just killed himself and left an obviously supernatural suicide note implying that he is, in fact, somewhere else now. What's reasonable? Well, he's not entirely crazy, because he's left a demonstrable proof of magic, so he might not be "dead", either.

But he left a body.

So what was that body to him? Was it a clone? An avatar of an off-site intellect? A puppet for the same? A temporary carrier for some ineffable quality that we shall henceforth call a "soul"?
