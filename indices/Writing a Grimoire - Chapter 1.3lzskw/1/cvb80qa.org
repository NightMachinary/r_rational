I don't understand what happened to Ralph's brain. Is it missing? Does it look like a baby brain? Is it made of computer parts?

Why are they poking around and opening envelopes of suicide notes rather than rushing him to the hospital?

Why aren't they contacting authorities?

I normally enjoy "in medias res," but I feel way too disoriented about what exactly is going on.
