I have a lot of friends that are very into yoga, meditation, alternative medicine, 'wellness', etc.

I am a big fan of meditation, and I'm probably more into it than even most of my somewhat hippie friends, but I'm definitely far more skeptical than them.

Like, I'm hilariously high in Openness to Experience, I'm into all sorts of 'wooey' spiritual experiences/traditions (meditation, fasting, reading about all kinds of mystical traditions), and on the right day/night I can be persuaded of deism or some vaguely theistic tendencies...but that's tempered by basically reflexive skepticism and materialism.

So I share your experience. Out and out skepticism usually ruins the vibe of most conversations so I reserve it for certain friends/situations.
