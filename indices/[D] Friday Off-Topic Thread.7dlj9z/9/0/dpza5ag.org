My favorite podcast is The Mixed Six, My Brother My Brother and Me is my go-to comedy show (start with the first episode of this year), Trends Like These helps me keep up with the news, NPR Politics and On The Media bring me great analysis, Heathcare Triage is the one source that makes sense of healthcare politics, Welcome to Night Vale has surreal humor mixed with cosmic horror, and The Adventure Zone is some damn entertaining pulp fantasy.

I'm currently working my way through Wolf 359, Story Break by RocketJump is a concept I love about outlining stories, [[https://soundcloud.com/greg-stolze/termination-shock-1-frasier-crane-and-the-spiders-from-mars][Termination Shock]] is a rpg campaign about exploring a really weird and interesting sci-fi setting with the brothers from Fraiser (no really), and One Shot has some hilarious improv comedy like Lasers & Feelings and the stupidly awesome Pizza Party Rumble.
