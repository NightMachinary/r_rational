I've been listening to the podcast Early and Often: The History of Elections in America, and enjoying it immensely. David Severa does a great job teaching about this fascinating bit of history. Available on iTunes [[https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/early-and-often-the-history-of-elections-in-america/id1274290333][(link)]] or PodBean [[https://www.podbean.com/podcast-detail/zyxpb-58e1f/Early+and+Often+The+History+of+Elections+in+America][(link)]].

What podcasts are you all listening to? Anything cool?
