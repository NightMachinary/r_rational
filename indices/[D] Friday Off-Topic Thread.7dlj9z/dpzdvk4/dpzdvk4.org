TOMT: I remember reading a rational fic some time ago, called or subtitled something like Alex in Wonderland, but what I recall of the plot is fuzzy and I can't find it.

The main character was a significant human, and fell into some kind of human reserve, where I think there was some population engineering going on. They find their way out, by following a multi-legged robot, into a surrounding maintenance area - I recall a scene where the robot walked on top of him, but the pressure was low enough that he was uninjured.

At some point in the story, possibly through flashbacks, it's revealed that presently there aren't many humans left and that they slowly phased out in favour of robots, the Earth is a biologically uninhabitable robot-world, and that the main character(?) or the robots(?) have memories from earlier versions of themselves in the distant past of being in a lab able to walk independently and looking intimidating, and of being a military robot that was commanded by an inspecting general that it was being pitched to to shoot itself(?).

I think some of the flashbacks, or the information nature of the world, came to the main character in the form of a dream.
