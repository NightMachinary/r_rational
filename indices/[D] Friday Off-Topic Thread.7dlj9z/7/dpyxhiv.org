I watched The Good Place because a recommendation on this sub led me to find a lot of praise for a show that flew under my radar despite being created by one of the people behind Parks & Rec and Brooklyn 99. Unfortunately, I ended up very disappointed by the series.

I like Parks & Rec and Brooklyn 99 because they are more than just comedies, they tell stories you can (sometimes) take seriously with characters who undergo development on top of being funny. So I immediately began looking for an underlying theme of The Good Place.

From the start, I thought the show was going to be a satire of W.E.I.R.D. culture. We'd see a heaven and hell based on the morality of modern middle class liberals, the target audience of which I'm a member, only to see how such a system can still be discriminatory and somewhat arbitrary.

Eleanor would be a narcissist who couldn't learn empathy, Chidi an intellectual who never did anything important with his knowledge, Tahani a pretentious elitist who only helped people for the social status, and Jason a street kid who simply didn't know any better. I thought it was a brilliant idea.

Turns out, that was not what the show was about at all. It was just a comedy about characters who are idiots and assholes who get humiliated and actually do deserve exactly what the afterlife gave them because heaven takes context and intention into account, except I don't think that makes sense.

Eleanor, Tahani, and Jason's upbringing made them who they were and the latter seems mentally incapable of understanding the consequences of his actions. Even Chidi is stated to be solely responsible for his own failures even though I think he suffers from an anxiety disorder.

I get that we're supposed to root for these characters in spite of their flaws or still consider their fate unjust, but I thought the way the ending recontextualizes the characters within the story completely undercut the set up. After that, I didn't care about what happened to them because they didn't seem to have any control anymore.

It's not that I think the show is bad, it just turned out to not be what I wanted it to. I thought it was a subtle social satire that disguised itself as an odd unsubtle comedy, but it turned out to just be a comedy that I never found all that funny in the first place.

It's almost exactly the same thing I felt toward The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. A goofy satire that seemed to be really about the determination to survive in the crazy world we live in, only for the plot to go where I didn't want it to and all that's left are jokes about people being dumb.

I can't just laugh at idiots and assholes because of what they do, there needs to be some wit to the writing or substance to the story to get me to care. SAO Abridged, Faiser, early Brooklyn 99, and Sirens managed to do both and I love them all, but even just one of those would be enough.
