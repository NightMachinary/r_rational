  That ended up not happening, so it just became a story about victims of an unjust cosmic order where the characters accomplished almost nothing.

You know that it's got a second season, right? Based on what you said, I'd advise you to just drop the show, but this critique in particular seems like a bad one, given that the show is ongoing. (And it seems like a bad critique in a way that I think a lot of critiques of serial fiction tend to be bad when they try to look at a work holistically before that work is completed.)
