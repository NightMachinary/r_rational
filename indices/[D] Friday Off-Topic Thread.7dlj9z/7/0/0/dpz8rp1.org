I actually felt the same way about the afterlife, literally any system based around the idea of assigning people to paradise or torture for eternity is based on a fundamentally unsound premise. I never laughed at the jokes they made about the afterlife because I couldn't stop taking the situation seriously no matter how absurd it got, especially since they state how getting into heaven is the exception rather than the norm.

The problem with the message that this system is flawed is that I consider it so blindly obvious that I can't enjoy a story that's just about that, so I thought the way they'd inject nuance is by getting the audience to relate to the moral code of heaven so they would pass judgment on the characters and get called out on it. The point would be that there's something wrong with us for implicitly hating fans of Nickleback and that's a message I want to hear.

That ended up not happening, so it just became a story about victims of an unjust cosmic order where the characters accomplished almost nothing. If that reveal had come halfway through I would've enjoyed seeing them continue the fight, but when it's the ending I feel like I wasted a lot of time on a story that failed to give me what I wanted from it. I don't understand what people got from the show that I didn't, besides humor that doesn't suit my tastes.
