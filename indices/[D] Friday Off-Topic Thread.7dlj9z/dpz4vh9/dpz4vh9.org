Pokemon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon just got released today. Does anyone else plan to get it?

Personally, I already own Moon, so I'm buying Ultra Sun. I used Primarina in my previous playthrough, so I'm split between either using one of the other starters, or bringing in a bred pokemon from moon by using a friend's DS as an intermediary.
