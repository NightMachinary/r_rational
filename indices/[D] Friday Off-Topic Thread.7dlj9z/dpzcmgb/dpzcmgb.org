I just got introduced to the Polity novels by [[https://youtu.be/EfszijxnVCg][this short video]] and have never been sold on a book series so fast, it sounds like just the right mixture of hard and soft sci-fi I'd love, but have been unable to find an ebook or audiobook version on Amazon. Does anyone know where I could find one?
