Interesting - I personally see a "buy now with 1-click" that I am not going to click on because I don't actually want to buy them. The "Send a Free Sample" option appears to work entirely correctly for Gridlinked.

If you seriously can't find a way to exchange money for them, there are probably alternatives - the most moral of which would probably be obtaining them through a public library.
