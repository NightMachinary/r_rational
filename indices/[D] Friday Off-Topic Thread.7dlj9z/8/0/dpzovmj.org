Amazon shows a LOT of his stuff as kindle e-books for me. Are you misspelling his name or something? (e.g. Neil instead of Neal). [[https://www.amazon.com/Gridlinked-Agent-Cormac-Book-1-ebook/dp/B003DWC6I6][This is an early book in the Polity series on Amazon.com]].

I am not sure about Amazon and international shopping; is it possible that Amazon.co.uk and Amazon.ca and etc. might have different book availability or something? I haven't really looked into that at all personally.
