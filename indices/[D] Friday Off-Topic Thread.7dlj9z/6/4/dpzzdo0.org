Because Pathfinder vampires [[http://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/vampire/][suck]] (no pun intended).

  If killed by any other means, they turn into a cloud of gas and have two hours to make it back to their coffin where they will be able to regenerate within an hour.

Yeah, they flee back to their coffin ... at 4.5 mph, helpfully leading the prospective vampire-slayers back to their lair at a leisurely walking pace. And then they spend an hour orporeal and Helpless.

In addition, it's "very difficult" (DC 25) and takes at least two rounds for them to approach or attack a person with a holy symbol (or a mirror, or garlic), they can't enter homes, and they suffer grievous damage from water - not holy water, just ordinary running water.

Sure, they're superhuman ... sort of. But they're not super-angry-human-mob.

Newborn "vampire spawn" are even weaker, can't reproduce, and AFAICT there's no rule for how long it takes for them to develop into proper vampires.

Oh, and Pathfinder vampirism can't spread beyond the original species, so in the event that a vampire apocalypse did occur all other sapient species would be fine:

#+begin_quote
  A vampire can create spawn out of those it slays with blood drain or energy drain, provided that the slain creature is of the same creature type as the vampire's base creature type. The victim rises from death as a vampire spawn in 1d4 days.
#+end_quote

So if you really need an excuse for every village to have a /Decanter of Endless Water/ for easy Vampire extermination and every villager to wear a holy symbol (which one would assume they would anyway TBH), you could always kill off a minor breed of Elves to vampire plague in the backstory to forewarn them.
