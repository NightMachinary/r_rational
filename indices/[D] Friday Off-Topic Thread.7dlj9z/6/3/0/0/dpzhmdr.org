  Absolutely, yes. However, to do that, you'd need to delve into whatever cave, dungeon, sewer or basement that the vampire placed has its coffin in and fight the vampire on its own turf. You may need to deal with traps the vampire has laid. It's likely going to be very difficult and there's good odds that many people will die in the process, but it is feasible.

Ah, never even considered caves. I was picturing a group of people throwing bombs or fireballs or whatever is appropriate at a house or mansion. Guess that shows my bias from living in a flat area near the coast.

  I don't expect it would be intentional. I suspect it would happen naturally as a result of free-willed vampires creating a tragedy of the commons kind of situation.

I'm not sure this applies. I'm postulating that the end state is undesirable, even in a world where there is a single vampire. If a free willed vampire finds that living in a predominantly human world is desirable, and that adding additional vampires gives diminishing returns, and the cost of keeping said vampires fed is linear, the free willed vampire wouldn't have any incentive to enslave more vampires beyond a small number.

For an example, say 4 vampires inhabit a large forest, with a few towns along the border with a total population of 40,000. They need to feed on one human a month. The human cost is basically lost in the noise of people dying in the forest. Does having 40 vampires improve the master vampire's quality of life? Does it improve it in proportion to the increased difficulties of feeding 10 times as many vampires?

  Yes, so theoretically you could have a single vampire indirectly controlling millions of vampires. Each vampire only gets direct control of its own spawn, but it can command its spawn to command their spawn to command... etc.

That's what I thought. It would be a bit silly for this post to exist if it was firmly established that the slaved vampires can't control other vampires.
