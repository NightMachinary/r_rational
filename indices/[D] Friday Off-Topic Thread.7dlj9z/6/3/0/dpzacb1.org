  If someone wanted to kill a vampire, could they not expose said coffin to sunlight, then kill the vampire through normal means?
#+end_quote

Absolutely, yes. However, to do that, you'd need to delve into whatever cave, dungeon, sewer or basement that the vampire placed has its coffin in and fight the vampire on its own turf. You may need to deal with traps the vampire has laid. It's likely going to be very difficult and there's good odds that many people will die in the process, but it is feasible.

  Turning everyone into a vampire means that either they run out of humans to feed on, or they have to farm humans for blood.
#+end_quote

I don't expect it would be intentional. I suspect it would happen naturally as a result of free-willed vampires creating a tragedy of the commons kind of situation.

  I'm assuming from your post that the two enslaved vampires can enslave others.
#+end_quote

Yes, so theoretically you could have a single vampire indirectly controlling millions of vampires. Each vampire only gets direct control of its own spawn, but it can command its spawn to command their spawn to command... etc.
