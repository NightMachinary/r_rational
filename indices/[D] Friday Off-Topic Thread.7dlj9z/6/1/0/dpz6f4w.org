The Shadow Apocalypse is a very good point and I love the name. It looks like that would spread at nearly 100 miles per day. However, the RAW state that shadows are content to stay in one place, sometimes even just one building in a town, leaving other buildings unscathed.

As such, to have a Shadow Apocalypse, you'd need a necromancer who created the first shadow and orders it to direct its spawn to wipe out everything. Assuming the world survives the first Shadow Apocalypse, subsequent attempts of that sort should be quite feasible to disrupt. In the event of an impending Shadow Apocalypse people could simply use divination to figure out who was controlling the shadows and kill that person plus the original shadow to stop the spread.

In contrast, with vampires, taking down the upper echelons of the hierarchy just leaves you with an increasingly free-willed cluster of varying vampire factions. Also, note that vampire mages can teleport, block divination, specifically assassinate mages who try to stop them, etc. And each mage killed by vampires is likely to become a new vampire mage. Once the vampire apocalypse begins, I don't see an easy end to it.
