Another name for the Shadow Apocalypse is the Shadow Over The Sun. If the Necromancer directing this has Mind Blank up, goodbye cruel world - I strongly recommend Mind Blank for the discerning wizard attempting to bring about the end of the world, and that spell by itself is a strong argument to not take Abjuration as a banned school in 3/3.5... though in Pathfinder the penalties are much less burdensome for specializing, of course.

Anyways, to perhaps be more helpful regarding this sort of thing - there are a few fan-written supplements for D&D 3e/3.5 which you could use in a Pathfinder game with appropriate changes, that address this and similar consistency problems. These are the Tome series were written by Frank Trollman (who also wrote for Shadowrun 4 in e.g. /Street Magic/) and K, and distributed for free online:

As well as providing interesting flavour and character options for a lot of popular archetypes that had been ill-served by the official rules, the authors restrict certain problems like the Vampire and Shadow spawning problems to make the established world more plausible by curtailing these paths to power a bit. In these houserules, Vampires created from characters of less than fifth level are only Vampire Spawn (who can't make more vampires), and of course fifth level and higher characters can conceivably defend themselves and in any case are significantly rarer; shadows are restricted in the section on Pools of Deep Shadow, which essentially restricts the area that Shadows can travel around and prevents spawn from eating the entire world. They also address a lot of other rule issues that are more 3/3.5e specific, and I'm unsure how much of these issues are still present in Pathfinder.

I strongly recommend reading them even just to mine for ideas - the Races of War depiction of the Sahuagin is one of the most hilarious pieces of flavour for the background of a campaign I've read:

  * Borderlands of the Sahuagin: Sore Winners

    :END:
  The first thing to understand about the Sahuagin is that they have already won. Completely. The surface of the world is about 3/4 ocean and they own almost all of it. From the standpoint of the Sahuagin, the only places on the planet that have non-Sahuagin races in them are the stale crusts that they already had the presence of mind to cut off their sandwich. All of the non-Sahuagin races are all ghettoized. Even the other aquatic races have been marginalized to the point where they only get the brackish water (Locathah), the rocky shallows (merfolk), the underground darks (Kuo-Toans), or the muddy salt marshes (Lizardfolk). The real real estate -- the ocean and coastline -- are pretty much the private playground of the Sahuagin.

  Individually, Sahuagin will kick your ass, and collectively they will kick the ass of any nation you happen to support. The combined populations of all other sapient races on any planet are less than the population of Sahuagin on that planet. The Sahuagin are also much smarter and better organized than you are so their cities are actually more productive than yours per person in addition to the fact that they have more cities than all the other races and their cities are more populous.

  The Sahuagin mutate constantly, but are not inclined to Chaos. They just all have different appearances and capabilities. But every one of them is gifted with super intelligence and thick natural armor. The Sahuagin deep seers are some of the most gifted wizards on the planet and honestly have nothing better to do than just scry on crap and tell the armies where there's some cool stuff to go loot. From time to time the Sahuagin will come onto land to beat the living crap out of people and take control of important or valuable items. Then they take the spoils of war and drag it back under water, laughing the whole time.

  Against this backdrop of crushing inferiority, how do the other races maintain? Most of them are fighting for stakes so small that they haven't even /noticed/ that the vast majority of the planet is owned and operated by brutally efficient fish men. But one race that certainly has noticed the power discrepancy is the race of elves most likely to be forgotten: the Sea Elves. They actually live in many of the same areas and have a war going with them.

  Life is hard for a Sea Elf, because every one of them is born into a post-apocalyptic world where mutants run amok and hunt them for sport. But it's actually even worse than that because in addition to simply being physically and intellectually inferior to the Sahuagin like everyone else is -- they are actually stupid and useless /even contrasted with the surface races/. An average Sea Elf is as much the intellectual inferior to a Sahuagin as a Griffin is to a normal human. The Sahuagin consider the Sea Elves to be little more than animals, and they aren't wrong.

  The Sea Elves keep surviving at all because they see farther than Sahuagin in low-light conditions (and are thus often able to /swim away/ from potential encounters with Sahuagin during the morning and twilight hours that Sea Elves leave their hidden nests), and also because every so often a Sahuagin gets born who looks exactly like a Sea Elf. These Sahuagin mutants, called Malenti, are a little bit worse than a normal Sahuagin in that they lack the rending claws. But they're still stronger and smarter than any Sea Elf that ever swam the 7 seas. So when these Malenti realize that they get a crap deal from Sahuagin society, they often as not run off to join the Sea Elves, where they almost immediately rise to positions of leadership. They also gain crap loads of experience very quickly because the odds are so stacked against them. In short, the reason that the Sea Elves still exist is that they actually are a splinter faction of Sahuagin that uses real sea elves as beasts of burden instead of simply hunting them like the more normal Sahuagin groups do.

  And yet, despite the fact that the Sahuagin have *won* at *everything*, they still continue to fight the other races and take their children and stuff. Partly this is to feed the insatiable demands of their Baatezu masters, and partly this is because on some deep level the Sahuagin are convinced that it actually couldn't possibly be that easy. In addition to looking for bling and candy to take from the weaker races, the Deep Seers are also combing the world for the one thing that the Great Mothers are pretty sure exists somewhere: the hidden army that the other races are putting together to take the world back from the clutches of the Sahuagin Empire. As far as anyone knows, it doesn't exist, but for some reason the Great Mothers keep insisting that the searching continue. Maybe they know something we don't?

  *Campaign Seed: Free Your World*

  The Sahuagin have pushed things too far. After the leveling of the city of Kelport, the remaining peoples of the land have at last come to realize the danger that the Sahuagins' unchecked strength poses. The natural alliance of pretty much everyone against the Sahuagin has formed. But how far can you trust your allies? Will the goblins really show up when they said they would? And does everyone together have the strength to topple the coral spires of the Deep Seers?

  *Campaign Seed: The Price of Hubris*

  In ages past, the Sahuagin conquered the seas of the Kuo-Toa. They crushed their temples, and slaughtered their children. And noone liked the Kuo-Toa because of all the sacrificing people to the Great Evils they used to do, so noone did anything about it at the time. As massively successful empires are wont to do, the Sahuagin have allowed themselves to become decadent and haven't been crossing their Ts particularly, and now the Great Evils are straining to enter the world. That's... unfortunate... because these ancient and malevolent forces have the power and inclination to destroy everyone on the planet. And to make things worse, while some of the Sahuagin are aware of the problem and contracted our heroes to help solve it, lots of other Sahuagin refuse to acknowledge that any problem could possibly warrant getting help from outsiders and will work against you at every turn.
