Well, the Two Year Emperor solved this problem via direct divine intervention. Wraiths, IIRC, have the same problem. Anything killed by a wraith can become one. What they did there was drastically reduce the probability that turning would work.

Terry Pratchett solved this problem culturally, in Lords and Ladies. Vampires that bred too quickly, or stepped too far out of their behavioural expectations were slapped down by everybody around.

Both of these have a "created already in motion" aspect. If nobody knows the vampires are a problem, you won't get the coordination to work either solution.

But where does the first vampire come from? Was it made by a dark god? Perhaps that god doesn't want the world to be boring and peopled entirely by vampires. There's nobody to torture, for instance. So that god might "sit" on vampires, or instill compulsions, or maybe make the vampire maturation process take longer.

Maybe the first vampire was made by a wizard? Then the god of magic could do similar things, or let all the other gods know. The wizard could be smart, and tell people about the problem, so that anti-vampire crusades are a regular part of the local culture.

A world with vampires, that still exists, will have all sorts of things built into the culture for dealing with them. You don't go down dark alleys, well, these guys won't either. Everybody will wear holy symbols, public building will be filled with mirrors, garlic oil on the door posts, etc.

Finally, why does the first vampire want to spark an apocalypse? Maybe he likes the world the way it is. Better to be a legend that nobody believes is real, then there aren't holy symbols everywhere when he's trying to get lunch. Maybe he tried it, and the gods slapped them down, so now every new vampire is taught to keep things low-key out of self preservation. Then if you get a crazy vampire who doesn't follow along, the others might keep him in line. They know his weaknesses, after all.

There's a ton of divination magic in Pathfinder. Some vampire causes trouble... scry up his coffin and send some people to burn it while you distract the vampire somewhere else. Now he's as killable as anybody.
