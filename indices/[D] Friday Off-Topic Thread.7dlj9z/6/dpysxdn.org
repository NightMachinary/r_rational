I'm world-building a Pathfinder setting (similar to D&D 3.5) and trying to solve one particularly nasty problem: why there hasn't been a vampire apocalypse. Think of your ordinary zombie apocalypse, and now imagine those zombies as vampires. Intelligent, able to turn into a giant bat or a cloud of gas, dominate your mind, heal rapidly, spider climb, and each vampire can create up to two new vampires who are utterly enslaved by it. However, if said vampire dies, those vampires it controlled become free-willed and able to do as they please.

The only things which can kill them are sunlight or having a wooden stake driven through their hearts followed by severing their heads and anointing them with holy water. If killed by any other means, they turn into a cloud of gas and have two hours to make it back to their coffin where they will be able to regenerate within an hour. Their only other weaknesses are inability to enter a private home or dwelling without permission, and a strong repulsion to mirrors, holy symbols, and garlic.

I don't see any good reason why a world with even a single free-roaming vampire would not rapidly turn into a vampire apocalypse. Any thoughts?
