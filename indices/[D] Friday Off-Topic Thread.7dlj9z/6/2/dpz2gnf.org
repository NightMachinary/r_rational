In a previous 3.5 setting I had, Maruts [[http://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/inevitable/inevitable-marut/][(d20pfsrd link)]] tracked down each type of undead, so there'd always be at least one high-level automaton tracking down and slaying vampires on the material plane.

I've also run a Pathfinder campaign where the world was mostly overrun by undead before the remaining people managed to get a barrier up to protect themselves. Roughly 1/4 of the world sits behind a high magical wall with a terrifying number of undead just barely visible on the other side, waiting for the barrier to come down.

It's possible some deities see a significant rise in vampire population as one particular god or another trying to seize more power, and in turn, send their own champions to strike down the offending vampires.
