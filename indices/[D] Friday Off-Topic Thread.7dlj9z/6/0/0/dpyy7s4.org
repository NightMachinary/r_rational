For Pathfinder, vampires do not strictly require blood to survive, though they suffer penalties without it, including compulsions to feed. It would be possible for a vampire apocalypse to end in a world filled with vampires who must feed off of livestock because all of the people have become vampires. However, feeding on sentient victims creates a euphoric sensation for vampires, and is compared in the rules to a drug addict 'satiating her inner demon,' so feeding on livestock would not be the ideal situation for the vampires.

The way I see it, I suspect that the first vampire would probably start off enjoying more or less free reign to feed its addiction, committing assaults here and there to render victims helpless for feeding. Eventually, people with proper weapons and magic would follow the vampire's tracks and try to kill it. If it survives, it would likely see the need for creating vampires to help protect itself, and the arms race would begin. Eventually, some of its subordinates would be killed while their thralls remain alive, and there would start to be multiple factions of free-willed vampires, leading into a tragedy of the commons scenario and eventual vampire apocalypse.
