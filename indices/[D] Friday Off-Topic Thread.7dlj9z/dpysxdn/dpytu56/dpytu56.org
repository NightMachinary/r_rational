Though I don't /believe/ this is the case in 3.5 D&D, vampires requiring blood is a major impediment to their spread. If a vampire needs 1 pint of blood every day, and a human can safely give 1 pint every month, then the maximum carrying capacity for vampires is 1:30, though probably even more lopsided because you can't safely extract blood from e.g. babies. Maximum extraction of blood from the humanoid population is a vampire dystopia, not an apocalypse; the apocalypse only happens if the incentives for the creation of new vampires result in a tragedy of the commons where the humanoid population is wiped out, resulting in the eventual end of the vampire population as well.

So basically, your free-roaming vampire has to /want/ to create more vampires ad nauseum, which I don't think that he necessarily does, so long as he's constrained by the resource of blood, or maybe not even then. More vampires means more attention, and inevitably means more knowledge of vampire weaknesses, along with organized counter-forces dedicated to operating against vampire-kind. A free-roaming vampire can do as he wishes, with his freedom guaranteed by the difficulty in seeing his patterns; if there are too many vampires, then you have people walking around with mirrors, garlic, holy symbols, etc., never inviting anyone into their home, and adopting other anti-vampire practices.

It seems to me that it's to the benefit of every vampire, at least in the long-term, to ensure that as few people know about vampires as possible, and to ensure that the vampire population is small and controlled. That is, unless the vampires want to conduct war and make a play for taking over civilization, and that somewhat depends on what the civilization in question looks like.
