I think what I've described is predicated on keeping vampires rare. If vampires get organized ( or individually powerful enough as a mage, I suppose), then you the kind of cultural tactics I'm describing go away and you end up with a sort of militarized human culture instead.

Like people living in mountains, with sunlight wards near all the entrances, no communal spaces, vampire hunting parties all the time, etc. I'm assuming you still want something of a normal culture running around for your adventurers after all.
