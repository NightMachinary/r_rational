  Everybody will wear holy symbols, public building will be filled with mirrors, garlic oil on the door posts, etc.

  There's a ton of divination magic in Pathfinder. Some vampire causes trouble... scry up his coffin and send some people to burn it while you distract the vampire somewhere else. Now he's as killable as anybody.

Good points, a sufficiently organized resistance might be able to manage. People would need to grow garlic /everywhere/, everyone's clothes and equipment would need holy symbols on them, etc. but it should be feasible. I'm just concerned that in this case, vampires might turn to unconventional tactics, like firebombing cities to force people to flee their homes. It doesn't fix the holy symbols issue, but that only has a range of about 5 ft. against vampires anyway, and they can potentially resist the effects, it's just difficult for them. I can imagine that garlic bread would quickly become one of the staple foods.
