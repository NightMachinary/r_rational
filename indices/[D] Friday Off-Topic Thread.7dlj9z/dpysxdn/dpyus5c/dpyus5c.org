The reason that this hasn't happened is quite obvious, and spelled out in the rules explicitly. It hasn't happened because the Shadow Apocalypse happened first and wiped out the world even faster and harder - Shadows being CR 3 undead who are all incorporeal and thus basically even more unkillable for your average commoner than a vampire is, and also their spawning from killing people takes 1d4 rounds instead of 1d4 days. So a Shadow Apocalypse should wipe out your given civilization that consists mostly of people without magical weapons at a rate approximately 1,440,000% faster, thus explaining why a Vampire Apocalypse would never wipe the civilization - they're much too slow, the Shadow Apocalypses always run to completion first. They aren't even repelled by threshholds or anything, a single Shadow should be able to kill an entire village and make everything it killed into killers in a single night, they even pass through walls.
