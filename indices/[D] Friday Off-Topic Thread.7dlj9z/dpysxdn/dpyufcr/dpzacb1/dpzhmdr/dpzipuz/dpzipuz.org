  the free willed vampire wouldn't have any incentive to enslave more vampires beyond a small number.

The problem is if that original vampire gets killed while its subordinates survive. You then have two free-willed vampires who potentially split off and form separate groups, and the same thing can potentially happen again, resulting in additional groups of free-willed vampires.

  For an example, say 4 vampires inhabit a large forest, with a few towns along the border with a total population of 40,000. They need to feed on one human a month. The human cost is basically lost in the noise of people dying in the forest. Does having 40 vampires improve the master vampire's quality of life? Does it improve it in proportion to the increased difficulties of feeding 10 times as many vampires?

More likely the vampires would need to feed every day or so, but every week might be feasible for stronger vampires. Four vampires could probably take turns and drain a person dry, although that would likely sometimes be insufficient for a group of four, so they might sometimes need more than one victim. Assuming 1Â½ victims per week, it would be about 78 victims per year.

Compare this to the country with the highest homicide rate in the world, El Salvador, with 108.64 homicides per 100,000 people per year. These four vampires would be claiming 195 victims per 100,000 people per year. It's more than enough to draw attention. Even a single missing person in the forest would likely draw investigation. Bloodhounds and trackers could follow the victim's scent and footprints and work out where they ended up. When their corpse is found drained of blood with obvious signs of a struggle and nearby humanoid footprints, the vampire hunt would be on.
