Not familiar with Pathfinder, so take what I say with a grain of salt.

If someone wanted to kill a vampire, could they not expose said coffin to sunlight, then kill the vampire through normal means? Basically just wreck their home during the day, and the vampire has no ability to escape. Any vampire set on overrunning a society would have to face quite a bit of push back from people who would otherwise be unwilling to take the risk of attacking them.

Other options could be that vampires are unwilling to overrun society. Turning everyone into a vampire means that either they run out of humans to feed on, or they have to farm humans for blood. That sounds like quite a bit of work when they currently are an Apex predator surrounded by food.

Or possibly vampires are limited on the number of vampires they can enslave, and are intensely antisocial towards other free-willed vampires. I'm assuming from your post that the two enslaved vampires can enslave others. If the original vampire can only control, say, two levels down in that hierarchy, and free willed vampires are otherwise in a constant power struggle, you would never have a party of more than 7 vampires acting with any degree of coordination. That's threatening to an individual, or small parties, but not a threat to a society or a decent army.
