To me, it was a relief to see the big reveal because there was just so much wrong with that notion of Heaven that I was constantly distracted by it. I get that things like loving Nickleback being worthy of going to hell is The Joke but it was just too absurd to be taken seriously enough for me to care about the characters.

I like your perception of it as social satire, but don't think that was necessarily undone by the reveal. Instead, the core message of the story to me seemed to be that People Can Change, even those consigned to an eternity of torture, and if that's true then there's something even more fundamentally broken with the system. I haven't seen season 2 so I don't know what direction they take things in, but if the series doesn't end with them causing an utter breakdown of order in the afterlife by proving that people can actually be redeemed if they meet the right people and are put in the right circumstances, I'd be very surprised/disappointed.
