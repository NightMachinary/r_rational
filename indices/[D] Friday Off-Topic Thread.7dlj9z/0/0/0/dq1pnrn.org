Actually I felt really rich in academia compared to my situation now. It's like night and day. I wasn't exactly swimming in money, but I had enough to live comfortably, live my hobbies, travel... and I still had money left to give to the Against Malaria Foundation. Not having to worry about how to pay rent is a real luxury.
