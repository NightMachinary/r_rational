Is anybody here working i an artistic field?

I quit my phd in computer science (machine learning) and moved to a different town to study dance theatre. In general I enjoy my new live as a dancer and performer a lot and I love the community of dancers around me. In many aspects I have much more in common with them than with the computer scientists at my previous university.

Sometimes it's a bit strange though. My thoughts on a lot of subjects are very much lesswrongish. But I am surrounded by people, who take homeopathic medicine, believe in souls or some kind of afterlife, are into Chinese medicine.... Even concepts, which are very common in STEM communities like a certain trust in scientific progress as a positive thing and a reductionist way of thinking are not shared by many of my current friends. Not to mention more weird concepts like effective altruism or transhumanism, I usually don't even try to talk about these. The few times I did try, it was a very frustrating experience.

My main interest with this post was not to complain though. I am mostly curious, if there are other people here working in fields, which are far away from “hard science” and what your experiences have been.
