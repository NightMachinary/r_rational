I think this is an interesting question. 2+3=5 is a relationship between integers. This relationship's truth is independent of the behavior of anything you describe, because it's impossible to find a counter example of integer quantities not following this relationship.

To provide an exception that proves the rule, let's define addition with speed. If you stand on a train moving 3 mph and start walking forward at 2 mph, your speed will be 5mph, as far as you can tell. Then, you might think "I have found a phenomenon which follows the laws of integers! Walking on this train, I can add the speed of the train to my speed by going forward, and subtract my speed from the train's speed by going backward!" One day you are going about your business when you hear about some kind of absolute speed limit. Confused, you ask a friend knowledgeable about such thing the question "If I stand on a train going 2/5c, and run forward at 3/5c, shouldn't my resulting speed be 5/5c?" In response, you learn that you cannot merely add speeds together, and must do a bit of math to find the real resulting speed. Is math wrong? Have you found somewhere where 2+3!=5? In short, no. It turns out speeds aren't like integers, but rather like something called a tensor(? Vector? I don't know the actual proper term for what velocities are in relativity, feel free to correct me on this,) and in fact to be able to describe the addition of velocities 2+3 must still equal 5, always and forever.

So it seems that there is something more to 2+3=5, that it only applies to "integery" things, and if it doesn't then by definition you are working in a place where that relationship doesn't directly apply. However, for example in velocities under relativity, this relationship must hold in the background, through linear transformations. I think this gets to the heart of your question. Even if we lived in a world where there were no "integery" phenomena and there were only velocity like phenomena, the relationship between 2,3 and 5 could still be proven and would still hold, even though nobody would be able to produce a physical example of such a relationship.
