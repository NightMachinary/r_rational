It means that a mathematical theorem like Fermat's Last Theorem is true everywhere and everywhen. Without reference to any particular physical context. It was true before life on Earth began, and it will be true after everyone has forgotten it. If other universes exist, it is true in them as well. If everyone believed it was false, it would still be true.

... I mean, it's conceivable that the proof I've heard of is wrong (due to human error) and Fermat's Last Theorem is actually false. But in that case, it's false everywhere and everywhen, without reference to any physical context.

Scott Alexander [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/11/21/the-categories-were-made-for-man-not-man-for-the-categories/][once said that 25% of philosophical problems can be solved by drawing a picture of two pentagons]]. This is one of them.

If a basket contained 2 apples before another 3 apples were put in it, it now has 5 apples. If I walk 2 metres north and then 3 metres north, I will be 5 metres north of where I started. A solar system with 2 stars and 3 planets contains 5 bodies in total. A cake mix made of 2 pounds of milk and 3 pounds of flour weighs 5 pounds. If a bank account that contained $2 receives a credit of $3, it now contains $5. A particle that decayed into two particles massing 2 GeV and 3 GeV originally massed 5GeV.

Either these diverse situations reflect some deeper truth about 2, 3 and 5, or it's just a coincidence. Either "2+3=5" is true without reservation or limitation, or "2+3=5" doesn't really mean anything at all.
