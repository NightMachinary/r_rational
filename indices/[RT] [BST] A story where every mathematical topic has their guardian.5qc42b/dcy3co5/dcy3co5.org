The rule that "Mathematics doesn't exist until human minds invent it" is clear enough. It's not my own philosophy - I go for "Mathematics is eternal and beyond the universe, and humans can only discover it" - but it's acceptable for a fictional setting. That said, you may still want to make it an explicit rule of the setting.

What does it mean for guardians to change the way their domain works? Can the Numbers King change the value of 413+612 from 1025 to 1024? How does this affect the physical world? What does it do to theorems like "an odd number plus an even number is an odd number"?
