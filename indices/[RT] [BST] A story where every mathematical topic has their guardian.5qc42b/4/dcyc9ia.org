Honestly the only thing I'd kind of be interested in in this universe would be how different gods of mathematics would react to different alien gods. What if we're the only species that uses base 10, what would be the larger universe's reaction to that and vice versa? What if there was a more war oriented race that would have a god that's more focused on quick off the cuff mathematics that could be done during the last second during a battle? Would there be a sort of elitism that occurs between certain branches? I'd kind of like to see these interactions, but not much else.
