  1) Math is math because it's inalterable. I don't think you /can/ change how a math concept functions - A square is (AFAIK) a shape with four equal sides; how would you twiddle that? And then - math is mostly derived from other math. If you change how numbers work, you change a helluva lot of other math concepts.

I think the best way of putting it is this: math is the study of /which conclusions follow from which premises/. In short, it's a bit like a game: if you play here, I can play there; if you assume this, I can prove that, etc. Of course, this means that it's ridiculously hard to use math as an actual /power/--at least, not one that makes sense. Gravity powers, for instance, might mean I can change the shape of the local gravitational field. Sound manipulation might mean I can create and alter existing pressure waves in mediums around me. But "math" powers? It's hard to see how you can change /the logical conclusion of a series of steps starting from certain axioms/, after all. The best I can think of is that the "Guardians" in the OP might be able to change which axioms are true in the "real world". Of course, then it's less "math manipulation" and more just straight-up reality warping, but...

  Math is not actually provable without axiom's - see Godel's incompleteness theorem.

Well... uh. It's true that math can't be done without axioms (just like you can't build a tower of blocks without a floor to place the bottom blocks on), but this has very little to do with Godel's Incompleteness Theorem, which states that any formal system whose set of axioms is recursively enumerable cannot be both consistent and complete--or, equivalently, that any such formal system, if consistent, cannot /prove/ its own consistency. (Yes, it's complicated. A more intuitive--if not entirely accurate--way to think about is that there are certain statements in math which, given the axioms we have, cannot be proven or disproven. Such statements are referred to as "independent" by mathematicians and "undecidable" by computer scientists; one example you might be familiar with is Euclid's fifth postulate, the "parallel postulate".) Just a brief lesson there, because I am physically incapable of seeing a mathematical inaccuracy without correcting it. ;)

  I imagine the first would hinder your story, while the second would aide it - the only things possibly more powerful than the Number King are the Axioms. Or, all guardians are masks that the Axioms wear, and any alteration the "guardian" does is actually an alteration by the Axiom...

Well, again, it doesn't really make sense for axioms--that is to say, /definitions/--to be characters, but I think I see what you're getting at here, which is basically something functionally identical to what I said above about the Guardians being able to change which axioms apply to reality. If I'm wrong, feel free to correct me on that.
