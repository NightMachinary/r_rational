In a game of Nobilis I ran, the Baroness of Arithmetic was more of a zookeeper than a sorcerer. Axioms and postulates were Lovecraftian horrors: incomprehensible beasts of great power and strange motive. She could command them, and they would exercise that command, but she could not change their nature... nor even could she fully grasp it.

She had established the Commutative Property of Addition as guardian to one of the gateways to Heaven. The player characters needed to get through and the terrible singularity of the thing proved implacable to all their reality-warping powers. So one of the most memorable moments of the campaign is when the Duke of Friction (who had, in his previous life, been a stage magician) cowed the beast with a corny sponge ball routine.
