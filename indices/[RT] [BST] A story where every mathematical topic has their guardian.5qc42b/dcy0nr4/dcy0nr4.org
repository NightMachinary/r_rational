Two things come to mind:

1) Math is math because it's inalterable. I don't think you /can/ change how a math concept functions - A square is (AFAIK) a shape with four equal sides; how would you twiddle that? And then - math is mostly derived from other math. If you change how numbers work, you change a helluva lot of other math concepts.

2) Math is not actually provable without axiom's - see Godel's incompleteness theorem.

I imagine the first would hinder your story, while the second would aide it - the only things possibly more powerful than the Number King are the Axioms. Or, all guardians are masks that the Axioms wear, and any alteration the "guardian" does is actually an alteration by the Axiom...
