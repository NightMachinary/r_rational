You have an interesting seed of a concept here, but I can't help but feel that this isn't even fleshed out enough to have a productive discussion about, much less write a story around. I mean, what do these "Guardians" /do/, exactly? What /can/ they do? You've said, for instance, that if the "Numbers King" fails to do his job, there'd be a "worldwide catastrophe fraught with non-existence of logic", but what does that /mean/? It sounds bad, sure, but that's about it. Why does math need "Guardians"? Apparently, because mathematics was "injected into the context of humanity". Again, /what does that mean/? Without knowing more, it's literally impossible to talk about your idea.
