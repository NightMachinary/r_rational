I... disagree? There are plenty of characters in fiction who hold Impressive Titles with Capital Letters and Important Roles. Even if we exclude all those characters who do not explicitly embody a particular idea or concept, that still leaves stuff like Mother Nature, Father Time, "capital-G" God, "capital-D" Death, etc. I mean, I don't think the idea of having sentient beings guard the /foundations of mathematics itself/ is a very well-thought-out premise, but I can't say I understand the nature of your particular objection.
