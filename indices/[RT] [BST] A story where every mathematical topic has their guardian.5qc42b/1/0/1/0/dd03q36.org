All right, I'm with you so far. I'd like to ask you a few more questions, though (if you don't mind):

If it's true that mathematical propositions are either true or false without reservation or regard for the physical universe, then how is it that humans--who are very much part of the physical universe--able to obtain knowledge regarding mathematical objects? For that matter, I noticed that all the examples you used when discussing "2+3=5" directly involved things existing in the physical universe--so is there any reason to say that there's something /additional/ about the statement "2+3=5", beyond whatever physical phenomena it happens to describe? And if there /is/, what is that something?

I should note at this point that I'm actually partially playing devil's advocate here: although I'm fairly sure your position is actually fairly close to my own, I'm still interested to hear what you have to say in response to my questions.
