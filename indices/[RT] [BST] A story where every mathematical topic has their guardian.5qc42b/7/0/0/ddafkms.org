Maths are pure but abstract. Three apples, for example, can vary quite a bit even though they share the same unit so that what you're left with when you subtract two could be as tough and sour as a Granny Smith or as crisp and sweet as a Cripps Pink.

Humans care about quality and fairness in ways that are actually rather hard to model mathematically... and maths are, as they interact with the world at a human scale, almost always models. Measuring errors and definition conflicts are everywhere.

Not that any of those concepts is particularly epic. The Guardians of such things would wind up being petty bureaucrats rather than crusading heroes.
