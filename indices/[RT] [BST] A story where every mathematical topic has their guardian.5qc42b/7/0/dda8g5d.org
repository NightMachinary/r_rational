I guess the Guardians could very well be the keepers of axioms, and the axioms generally being rules written in an absolute language without homonyms/double meanings in order to keep absolute clarity.

The need for guardians would generally arise in the case that there is a force which is obliterating/obscuring these axioms, and the guardians would basically be glorified janitors/caretakers who rewrite and restore the axioms.

I'm having issues coming up with a feasible "force" which has the power to shake the fundamentals of mathematics, and I've got a feeling that my already established reason "Human beings emit a wavelength which is obscuring the axioms and basic rules of maths".

This Nobilis game sounds fun.
