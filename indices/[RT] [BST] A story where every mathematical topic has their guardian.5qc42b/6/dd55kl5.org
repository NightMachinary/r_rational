I once read a quite good short story wherein mathematical statement's truth-values were linked (via hand-waving) to the equivalent computations having been carried out by particle interactions at some point since the BB. The plot was that some mathematicians figured out a way to 'wiggle' the truth values of statements at the boundary of our mathematics, uncomputed theorems, and the negations of our mathematics (and there were beings on the 'other side'. There was a whole thing about how if either side made all of math conform to their side, it would destroy the other utterly. It made more sense in context. Can't remember the title, or author, sadly....
