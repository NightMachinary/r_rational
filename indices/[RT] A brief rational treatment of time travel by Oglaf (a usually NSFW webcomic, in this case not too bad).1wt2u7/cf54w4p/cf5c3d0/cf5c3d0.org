Time paradoxes make a lot more sense when you start thinking in terms of personal timelines instead of overall Time. I always thought it was silly but that whole "wibbly wobbly" thing the Doctor Who fans have going is pretty accurate if you have time travel, looking more like a tangled ball of string than a river of one-way-flowing time.

And if any of that made no sense to you, it's OK. It mostly doesn't to me either.
