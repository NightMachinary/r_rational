What's this fear of 'noise' based on anyway? As is, there are posts on the front page that are a week old, meaning that currently posts are sorted more by chronology than by popularity. As long as we don't need to go to the second page to find 3 day old posts I say the more content the better, as long as it is in some way relevant.

Honestly, why not let upvotes/downvotes take care of what we do or don't want to see here. It's not as if we're even remotely popular enough to have to worry about meme flood or anything like that.
