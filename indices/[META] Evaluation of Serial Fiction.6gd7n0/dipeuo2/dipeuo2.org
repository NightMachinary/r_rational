I'm not sure there's any value in differentiating works which are fractally rational at all levels and those works which are rational as a complete whole. Even if the world runs on relativity, if you don't scrutinize it too closely it can look Newtonian. Actions can similarly be rational at some higher level of information and not others; this does not make the territory irrational, merely your evolving map.
