Adding to this, I think frequency of posts, and a lack of native discussion fora should also be a factor. If the story's host has easy native support for discussing the work with other readers, or there's updates more than once a week, posts here can be more limited to significant events.

If updates are less common, and the hosting site has no comment section (or a horribly designed one like Fictionpress), this sub can reasonably support the regular post.
