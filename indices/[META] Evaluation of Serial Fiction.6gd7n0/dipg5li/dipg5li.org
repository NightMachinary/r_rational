[PERSONAL OPINION WARNING]

Individual chapters should be posted when:

- The work is just starting, and both the story and the sub could benefit from increased readership
- The work is very popular and likely to engender discussion (ex. mother of learning)
- The chapter's contents are very in-line with this sub, even compared to the baseline level of rationality of the story.

Aside from that, chapters should be posted on new arcs, when a story ends, and when a sequel begins.
