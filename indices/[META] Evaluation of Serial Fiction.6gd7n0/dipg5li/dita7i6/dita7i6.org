I fully agree with this assessment.

Particularly with the OP's linked comment, as the mod pointed out, even if the work it's taken from /is/ rational fiction, the chapter was not at all in line with the purpose of the sub, nor did it lend itself to any sort of in-depth discussion. At a base level, the post serves little purpose, and gives new community members a skewed idea of both the story in question and the sub in general.
