I think if it's a rat!story, there's no problem with creating a thread for each new chapter. If the subscibiers don't like it for whatever reason, they can just downvote it and move on.

If the story starts as a rat! but then fails to uphold the standards for whatever reason (e.g. OoC zombie decisions, idiot balls, unrealistic psychology, bad writing tropes, etc), then the readers can discuss that and maybe decide that for that story further updates should not be posted on this sub any more. Exclusion to this --- if the writer gets in touch and hints that the critisized elements are intended and their purpose will be revealed later in the story (e.g. a character's being mind-controlled, has been converted into a manchurian agent off-screen, etc).

One problem I personally have with chapter-by-chapter discussions is that I can't demonstrate my support by participating in the chapter discussions because lately I've started waiting for the work to get finished first, before starting to read it. The only exception to this being MoL because of its frequent and consistent updates.

Also, a shout-out to [[/r/noveltranslations/]] --- there are some web originals that are overall good ones even if they fail to match the criteria for this sub. Updates on some of such stories I've seen posted on the mentioned sub (even if they're not translations).
