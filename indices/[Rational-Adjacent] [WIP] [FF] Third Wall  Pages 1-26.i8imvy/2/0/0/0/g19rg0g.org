I think it could be argued it shares a lot of adjacent tropes: characters who are genre-savvy, if in different ways; powers with hardline limits and rules; a reconextualisation of tropes in a more realistic manner (e.g --- how it recontextualises ‘quipping' during high-stakes situations as . . . not the best idea often?), and few more that will be easier to argue for as this develops, hopefully.

Obviously this might be (and probably is) executing these tropes poorly, and there is obviously an initial cringe factor here that might make this sort of teen-drama-y work inherently irrational, but I don't think it's ridiculous to describe this thing as ‘rationalist-adjacent', or at least as an attempt at being ‘rationalist-adjacent'.

It's probably more explicitly and shove-in-your-face-ing-ly so than, say, ‘Worm' (although that doesn't mean that Worm is not obviously an infinitely subtler, better, and more intelligent work).
