The thread deals with the fact that "politics is the mind killer" doesn't convey the proper meaning. People will either think you're insulting them by calling them "mind-killed" or it makes it look like aspiring rationalist shouldn't think about politics, lest they be mind-killed.

And that's just not what is meant by "politics is the mind-killer."

Politics is hard-mode has it's own problems, though, but I like it better than "mind-killer". Another suggestion was "politics is a minefield", which also works.
