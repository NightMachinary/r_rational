  Rule 2: [[http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Politics_is_the_Mind-Killer][No Politics.]] Period.

Dude bro pal, you do know [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/kkp/politics_is_hard_mode/][that's not what that means]], right? A better phrase would be ... "Politics is difficult to talk about without falling into tribalism, so watch yourself", or "Political examples should not be used in a non-political discussion." Or my personal favorite -- "Politics is SPIDERS."

Whatever phrase you choose, it /doesn't/ mean "never talk about politics"; nowadays, I think politics is getting extremely important for scientists and rationalists to not just ignore.

I mean, it's your sub. But /especially/ since you call it a */Lounge/*, i didn't expect a rule like that. Just expressing your surprise.
