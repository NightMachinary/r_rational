I don't know. When I think about the hot-button political issues, I usually think of them as just the tip of the iceberg for much more involved issues. People just flippantly say "I'm pro-choice" or "I'm pro-life" as this really extreme shorthand for a whole host of deeper matters of philosophy - in that particular case, there are three or four enormous discussions that are laying below the surface. If you're talking to the right people, a question like "Are you for or against gun control?" can actually turn into an interesting conversation about personal responsibility, the rule of law, game theory, etc.

Granted, /most of the time/ it just turns into arguing over the facts or screaming the same old rhetorical points at each other with not the slightest trace of originality, but I really don't think it has to be like that.
