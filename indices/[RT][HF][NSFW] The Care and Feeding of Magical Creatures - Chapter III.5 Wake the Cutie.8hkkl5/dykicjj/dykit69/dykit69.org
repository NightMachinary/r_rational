Yeah that's the first chapter and if you click in the upper right corner, it'll open up a sidebar with the table of contents and formatting options.

Basically it's a story where Hell is real, except it's actually a kinky Heaven and the people who rejected it to come back were the wierdos who gave us a distorted idea of it. The protagonist just wakes up one day with a succubus who proceeds to kidnap him away from his sucky life onto a kinky journey that sorta looks like a mishmash of Narnia and Harry Potter.
