It's a story about a boy meeting a succubus (though I must stress that the succubi in this world are fairly different from the more wicked, straight up evil succubi portrayed elsewhere) and essentially signing a life contract with her and all of the sexy play that comes with it.

It's very much an erotica, that's pretty much the entire point of the story in a certain sense, but the worldbuilding and level of detail the author put into it is truly mind boggling. If you're squicked out by erotica, then this definitely isn't for you, but if you're even mildly interested, I can say that the characterization and world building and magic systems and just...everything....are crafted particularly well, though the drawback of that is that it takes rather long for the actual "plot" to get moving because everything is laid out in vivid detail.

Overall, from what I can remember, an interestingly different read and definitely worth it if you're a staunch purveyor of rational works and a sometimes-or-more purveyor of erotica.
