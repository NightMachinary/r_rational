I've been really enjoying your story!

I like how your AI protagonist is pretty much an early-stage paperclip maximizer (all it really cares about is being the best factory it can). It's not needlessly aggressive towards humans, it just really doesn't care very much for them.

It does kinda make me wonder where all the other paperclip maximizers are - you'd imagine that this can't be the first AI Lord, but somehow none of the other ones have managed to bootstrap into absolute power yet. I'm sure that'll be answered eventually.
