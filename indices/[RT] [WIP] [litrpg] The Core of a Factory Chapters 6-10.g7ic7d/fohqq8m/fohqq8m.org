This is a story I have been writing to help keep myself sane during physical distancing. Blurb:

#+begin_quote
  An abandoned steampunk arms factory, in the middle of a conflict torn former state of the Empire it served, gains a soul. This transforms it into a Lord, capable of turning land into power. Beset by enemies on all sides it must figure out how to win the war its creators lost a century ago.

  This is a progressive Dungeon Core novel (which is to say the core will progress and expand in scale, eventually) across multiple dimensions with different characteristics (e.g. steampunk, magic, mythological). It has rationalist leanings (paragraphs of reasoning) and litrpg leanings (there are stat blocks). The core game mechanical idea is something like "what if different flavors of magic power actually did come from controlling land" and then the story is: "what if there was a flavorless +artifact deck+ dungeon core".

Like I said in my first post if there was a community I had written this story for it would be this one (not that I claim to be any good as a rational fiction writer). Below are my notes which might go a bit too far in making the subtext into text.

This is the sequence of chapters in which I show how I plan to keep an AI protagonist interesting (the answer will surprise you... but probably not). It's one of the reasons I have written the AI the way I have in these chapters which some may find tedious (but I unfortunately plan to keep doing it).

I try to practice rationalism and find the sequences to be a useful bit of philosophy with which to improve my life. But I do have some disagreements about how AI will shake out. I plan on making my arguments (which come from my background as someone with a Masters degree in Computer Science) through this story. But for those who disagree with me you simply have to grant me the conceit that in this universe super scaling AI doesn't quite workout for various reasons like not being able to effectively miniaturize or due to the vagrancies of the underlying physics, those will remain reasonable alternative explanations throughout. I don't plan to be preachy about it and I think they will be well intermixed with other ideas.
