I appreciate your detailed feed back, the editing notes especially.

Editing notes:

#+begin_quote
  Chapter 2, noting a case of 'effecting' used when should be 'affecting', I believe.
#+end_quote

I only use affect in chapter 2 (or at least in my reference copy). And I am like 80% confident it is supposed to be affect in the case I do use it (please do correct me in more detail if I am wrong).

#+begin_quote
  Chapter 9: 'Power I', 'Power II', 'Power X' (rather than 'Power III', and with no elipses or similar indication or held-but-unlisted powers): deliberate or not?
#+end_quote

deliberate, I may screw up words like feet/meters regularly (and the ones you pointed out) but the stat blocks are all relatively carefully written/designed.

Story notes:

#+begin_quote
  If it was the danger lines, how could they have recognised them?
#+end_quote

I'm going with hand wave they are a relatively consistent sign in this dimension. It wasn't meant to be a logical argument by the AI. More a flavor of an old grievance (not-cannon, just an example of what I was aiming for): "I /still/ have to not kill the humans even when they step on my factory floor? They stepped over the danger lines, they were warned to not get in my way." to which the AI technician responds with "yeeeeaaaaaa, lets adjust some parameters on your morality."

#+begin_quote
  I'm wondering whether I missed the option of collapsing the tunnel on top
#+end_quote

in chapter 10, the AI inspects it's own beliefs like getting blinded by the original human design, which did not include collapsing the tunnels (because it wasn't worth it, that wasn't a concern;) (maybe) spoiler from author/unwritten-chapters: (bombing and strike teams, not sieges were the original concern)
