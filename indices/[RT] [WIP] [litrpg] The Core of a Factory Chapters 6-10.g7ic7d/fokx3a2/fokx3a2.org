My favorite sapient factory is back, and /this/ time it gets to do more shenanigans!

I can't wait till it begins experimenting even more with its abilities. In particular:

#+begin_quote
  *Modular Production Lines II*/: Machinery can continue manufacture while being reorganized. Any partially manufactured run that is part of a manufacturing focus may at anytime swap it's progress with that of another manufacturing run of a manufacturing focus (adjusting for materials in the quantities swapped)./
#+end_quote

Bwahahaahaha. This reminds me of production in the original Master of Orion and such games. So I have to ask if it works the same way. Because if so, it is *insanely* min-maxable to the point of silliness.

Does this mean that one large object that's partially constructed can be turned into *multiple* other items? (Is a production 'run' a single items or an entire order? 10 20mm cannon shells started at once counts as a single run, or 10 runs?)

If so, it will always be advisable to have at least one large object (such as a heavy mech or whatever the Factory has focus on) to be under construction at all times. Should numerous smaller things (like ammo) be needed, he just switches over production and *BLAMMO*, heaps of ammo.

If it works the same with smaller mechs or the like, then it pays to always be producing something with similar proportions of raw material--like an even larger mech. Start production on something like a WH40K Titan. It doesn't matter if he only has space for one of its feet, giant blades can come out like meat slicers and just chop it into personal warmechs or flocks of chickenbots, as needed.

Now, if this *isn't* possible, he can simply do the reverse.

Make something smaller he might want in the short term, and if it is not necessary at the time, change it over to another thing right before it gets completed.

IE: Start work on Small warmechs, as they get to 99%, change them over to Medium, as THEY get to 99%, change to Large, etc. If anyone tries to attack or raid him or the like, he can just finish the thing that's currently being worked on, or if it doesn't have enough progress to come out in time, immediately downgrade to the other.

  *Pull*: /Let each manufacturing step pull from the previous one. Demand is the driver of manufacturing, let it pull towards perfection. Every manufacturing run you complete will increase the quality of future runs of similar products (proportional diminishing returns), from time to time you will gain research breakthroughs./
#+end_quote

And now we come back to constitutes a 'run'. Is it a single item? A stack of them? Is there a % chance to get an upgrade with each, or after certain numerical thresholds?

He should check by queue'ing up multiple 'runs' of ammo. Say, a 1,000 round run and then do 1,000 sequential single-print runs. Keep repeating whichever seems to be more productive. Should also help determine the quality of change from the runs, as well.

If it doesn't work that way, well hey, he should be making as much as he can of designs that will be re-used. Ammo is certainly on this list.

#+begin_quote
  They were also difficult to reload, requiring the removal of the thermal capacitor, then the steam engine, then analytical engine (with it's delicate torsion radio), before finally the drum could be replaced.
#+end_quote

So why not load it from the other direction?

Or, you know, make the entire weapon cylinder itself modular, so that you 'reload' it by swapping out the entire weapon without going through the other junk? Then if you design other models of weapon that have the same exterior surface specs, you can easily change their loadout with a single design. Have some rapid fire models, some slower-fire models, some that launch gyrojet rockets or incendiary rounds, etc. You could even make 'collier' mechs which do this job out in the field (basically a modified maintenance model with a backpack full of chicken-guns).

#+begin_quote
  With their default engagement algorithm that left them out of ammo in a few seconds of steady contact. At which point they would stand there, tracking their target, cycling the drum as they continued trying to fire.
#+end_quote

Why? Shouldn't they have a 'regroup' subroutine that haves them move off of the battlefield to a predetermined location (ie: the location they were activated to go into 'attack mode')?

If nothing else, these things all being the same height with little tracking would quickly provide cover to their enemies when they run out of ammo. Seems like a bad philosophy even for disposable mechs. If nothing else they should have a shutdown subroutine so that they fall over or squat or go prone or something when they run out of ammo so their fellow squad-chickens can attack the enemy.

#+begin_quote
  It was an unregulated warzone at that. No one was following any conventions, hence I was under no moral obligations to engage in ethical warfare.
#+end_quote

Good factory!

#+begin_quote
  *Thought Burst* • Intelligence Core Perk /Once per day you may think for up to 100 minutes during which time does not advance. (May include all directly connected external computational hardware. No new information may be received nor sent.)/
#+end_quote

This ability is as broken as they come. Turning a real-time-strategy game into a turn-based game where /only you/ get to take a turn is broken. And I love it. That 'once per day' is probably the only thing that keeps it from being absolute BS. Being able to come up with a plan when everything has gone wrong is a nice perk, but the ability to execute it in massive, specific detail (thanks to the Factory being an AI) is what pushes it over the top.

#+begin_quote
  On to the more distasteful solution. Admitting I was wrong.
#+end_quote

And that's what truly makes the factory a frightening foe. It can be humble and admit its mistakes, then work to change them. That also makes it likeable as a character.

Thanks for all these updates!
