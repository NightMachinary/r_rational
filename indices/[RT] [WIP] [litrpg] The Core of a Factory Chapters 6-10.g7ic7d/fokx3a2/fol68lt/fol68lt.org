Thanks for the detailed feedback!

It helps to know what people are thinking so I can make sure I didn't miss anything. if I didn't comment on something it's probably something I already plan to include

  Because if so, it is insanely min-maxable to the point of silliness.

If it helps, I actually write out all the abilities at different tiers (just rough sketches) and multiple reviewers thought (beware spoilers from the author) this was the weakest path of the three (even after I tweaked them a little), I'm glad someone finally agrees with me.

  So why not load it from the other direction?

  Or, you know, make the entire weapon cylinder itself modular,

This was part of chapter 10: that maybe I should go back to edit to include the chicken mechs. The factory didn't fancy itself an engineer so it didn't imagine that it should redesign it. It also got caught by the Soul "mechanics" and began thinking it /couldn't/ (or at least /shouldn't/ try to) do something that was covered by the Soul or the attributes/ranks of the facility, like (it's implied) include design.

Another clarification I should perhaps go back and edit (or maybe that I should add to a coming up section) is that the weapon is built into the "chassis" of the Cylinder, the Turret, and the Legs all being a single construction, with the one loading port at the top.

  Why? Shouldn't they have a 'regroup' subroutine that haves them move off of the battlefield to a predetermined location (ie: the location they were activated to go into 'attack mode')?

This is a little bit of the AI being condescending to lesser machine-forms, but it's implied part of the heterogeneous flocks are "controller" models that would trigger state changes if needed. lore that may never make it in: The engagement algorithm being a mode they are in, and acting like they are still in that mode providing the illusion they still have ammo worked best with the controller's planning algorithms (and limited computational capacity) when it came to executing flanks. If they got in the way or whatever then the controller could disable or move them. The AI is being condescending because with out it's planning they would just stand there stupidly.

I'm glad you are enjoying it!
