(I seem to have missed the first post; now starting from the first chapter, putting reactions here as I feel the urge to write them.)

"Besides if I saved their lives they would be indebted to me.": I giggled for a long time after reading this. Mental image: "Okay. We were fighting with other knights who were trying to kill us, and then a dragon just appeared and started swatting them like bugs. Bright side: those knights aren't a threat to us any more. Dark side: A DRAGON JUST APPEARED AND STARTED SWATTING KNIGHTS LIKE BUGS AHHHHH!". Comprehending the concept of debt/indebtedness yet not predicting a 'out of the frying pan into the fire'/'better the devil you know than the devil you don't' reaction strikes me as hilariously naÃ¯ve.

"They had been warned.": when? If it was the danger lines, how could they have recognised them?

Chapter 2, noting a case of 'effecting' used when should be 'affecting', I believe.

Ee-hee-hee. I love this paragraph, combining an internal-modelling-failure and a horror-situation in the form that I also love in Super Minion. ' Oh I had some of that! "There is some extra blood on those machines," I turned on a light to reveal the blood soaked machinery, "I am not planning on using it. It appears to be a sub-par lubricant." '.

Chapter 8, 'loosing control' -> 'losing control. I also love the blithely-unaware horror-scenario in this chapter!

Chapter 9: 'Power I', 'Power II', 'Power X' (rather than 'Power III', and with no elipses or similar indication or held-but-unlisted powers): deliberate or not? If deliberate, how can there be absolute numberings for the chosen Powers..?

Still in Chapter 9, I'm wondering whether I missed the option of collapsing the tunnel on top of the threat...
