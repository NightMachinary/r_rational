New guess: this cabal is playing a game where each person is allotted a certain group of the 100. I imagine the prize depends on the pawns assigned to each player. So if the precognitives are the last ones standing, their patron gets a fraction of what Hannah's patron would get if she wins.

I still think they're extradimensional beings who can't quite get used to existing in fleshsuits.
