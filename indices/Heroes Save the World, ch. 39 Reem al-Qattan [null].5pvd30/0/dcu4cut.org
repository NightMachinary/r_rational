It's the last chapter of the sequence, so you know what that means... Except, it's a little different this time. >:]

This is also an appropriate time for a few public service announcements:

- Feedback is appreciated, especially the kind that tells me what you think I'm doing wrong.
- I love, love, love reviews, but if you want to support this story financially too, then [[https://www.patreon.com/WMBsaltworks][check out my patreon account]] and see if any of the rewards interest you. HSTW is a Creative Commons work, which means that my ability to monetize it in a traditional fashion is limited-to-nonexistent.
- If you were wondering, Heroes Save the World is now ten-percent complete, not counting bonus chapters that may or may not happen.
- For those who are interested, the average word count of Awful Shadow is 1,565 words/chapter, a slight increase from Not Too Small.

Thank you all for reading. The next sequence, /Sharp as Sword Blades/, will begin this Friday.
