I decided to leave it open but I was thinking of a CYOA style scenario where you pick up Metropolitan Man style powers thought there are ensemble works lime Heroes which are interesting.

I use Metropolitan Man to just mean very powerful powers that could change the game nationally or globally though they aren't necessarily used that way, but I don't want to get pinned down to a powerset.
