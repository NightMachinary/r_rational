I'm aware it is a deconstruction. But there's more than one way to do that first off: you could easily work bottom up and show how it doesn't work at all. Start with one flying man, and just show how the sort of status quo we expect would never form

Wildbow took the opposing tact of building the world using certain devices to create the necessary structures, then deconstructing /parts/ of the world. It's a valid strategy but I don't think it's as useful for this discussion given that the series starts out in a similar version of the sort of world I'm talking about avoiding. There's politics but mostly Wildbow has created a darker sort of superhero world.

And that's okay.It deconstructs stuff like "no killing" well enough. But it leans on a lot of the conceits to knock others down.
