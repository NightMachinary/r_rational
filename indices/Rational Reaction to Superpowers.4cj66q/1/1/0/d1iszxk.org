  I will say that Worm (which is the only one I've read) is set pretty late after all that stuff, and kinda abstracts it away (though it deals with some politics) to have a conventional-ish super-hero story.

A lot of the point of Worm is to work backwards from a generally superhero-ish world to the circumstances needed to produce that. Deconstruction and all.
