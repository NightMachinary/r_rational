Thanks for those three.

I will say that Worm (which is the only one I've read) is set pretty late after all that stuff, and kinda abstracts it away (though it deals with some politics) to have a conventional-ish super-hero story.

YMMV on how much the later characterization works but a lot of it and the characters that drive it are mocked for being OP and author devices, and it's partly to help stitch the world together so you don't have to worry about a lot of these concerns.
