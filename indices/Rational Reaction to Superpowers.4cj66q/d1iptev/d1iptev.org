The obvious fiction recommendations are +Ra+ Fine Structure, Worm, and The Fall Of Doc Future.

+Ra+ deals with the Powers of Two line of supers, and eventually with an immortal.

Doc Future doesn't have the coming-out scenario, being set decades after a lot of cape-on-cape violence, but it does show how capes integrate with society and discusses some of the history of the aforementioned violence.

Worm is about an adolescent cape, and how she navigates a world that hasn't docs the best job of adapting to capes.
