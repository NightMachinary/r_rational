I've fantasized lots about which powers I'd want given that the barriers I face in life mostly have nothing to do with things that can be solved by super strength, durability etc. If you have these sorts of powers, the jobs they qualify you for leave you still near the bottom of the social hierarchy. If there's a war, you're a grunt. If there's no war, you're a carny. If you don't want to be simple and blue collar, the main other option is crime.

I think if people started getting these powers, and it was public, not much would happen. There'd be some cool news stories. Lots of annoying celebrity crap to deal with, and then it would fade and no one would care. Finding out superpowers exist would be exciting. Talking to an actual super hero about what they can do would get boring.
