I'm working on this problem as well, although I at least have a few differences from yours.

The powers are potent but they are 'faked' by a foreign technological infrastructure and not necessarily too outside what the world they come to be within is already capable of, it's just that every powered individual effectively has military grade weaponry energies at their fingertips and some down right absurd meta material reinforcement in their bodies to protect them from normal things. This is plenty disruptive before some characters are revealed to be even more potent/dangerous then that.

The other side of it is that the entire population of humanity has been effectively doubled and this is causing problems all on its own.

So the whole power thing is mostly being added as fuel to those particular fires, not getting nice and cleanly isolated as one thing.
