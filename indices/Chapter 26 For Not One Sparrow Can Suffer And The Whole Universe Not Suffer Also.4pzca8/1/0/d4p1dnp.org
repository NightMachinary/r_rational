It might be useful to note that the orchard refers to paradise---Eden. Let's get some flaming swords up in here!

Also, Elisha's justification for Metatron being another god is that Metatron was sitting even though there is no sitting in heaven.

His disenchantment lead him to cease believing in Judaism, but most importantly the afterlife. Perhaps heaven=Eden, which he saw had been razed. I keep getting this vibe that there is no good afterlife in Unsong.
