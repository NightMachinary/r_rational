Not just savvy to a specific genre (shonen, magical girl, etc) but to anime in general. It's like the difference between a character on a standard cop show knowing the first guy they catch can't be the real murderer, or knowing that the title character can't die. One applies to cop shows, the other to (most) shows in general.
