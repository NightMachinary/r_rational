My experience may not be relevant to your situation, so forgive me if that's the case. I come from a Hindu background from India and my parents though moderately religious are also progressive/intellectual. So I met only with mild disagreement when I made my beliefs (or lack of) clear. Also, when I was growing up, identifying as an 'rationalist' was considered a valid political affiliation, believe it or not.

Anyway, it seems to me that among moderate communities, any opposition is more a fear of losing the way of life, than any threat the world views. (Obviously this is false for non-moderate families.). Based on your situation, it might help if you make it clear that you still support your community/way of life, and its only your perception of reality that has changed. Just my 2 cents. Best of luck.
