Could you PM me your email address? I should put you in touch with Joshua Fox of LW-Tel-Aviv. He's from a Kfar somewhere near Jerusalem. He's a cool older guy, great for advice. The community there will also be a good set of people for generally spending-time-around while openly atheist or secular.
