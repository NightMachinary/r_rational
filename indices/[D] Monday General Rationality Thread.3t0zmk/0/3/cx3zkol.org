Standard [[/r/atheism]] protocol is to remind you not to come out until you are financially independent of your parents. The best time to tell them is in an apartment you rent/house you own over a meal you bought yourself. That way, if they get belligerent (or violent) you have every right to kick them out of your abode, and your life if necessary.
