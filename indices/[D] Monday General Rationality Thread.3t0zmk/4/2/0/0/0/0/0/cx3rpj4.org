I'm not saying the people who pull the trigger have no responsibility.

The fact is the US aggressed a region and poured weapons into that region, causing much violence, directly and indirectly. Even the civilians killed by "the other side" would not have been killed if not for US aggression.

This is the reason that in the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_aggression#The_Nuremberg_Principles][Nuremberg trials]], aggression was considered the largest warcrime:

#+begin_quote
  In 1950, the Nuremberg Tribunal defined Crimes against Peace, in Principle VI, specifically Principle VI(a), submitted to the United Nations General Assembly, as:

  (i) Planning, preparation, initiation or waging of a war of aggression or a war in violation of international treaties, agreements or assurances;\\
  (ii) Participation in a common plan or conspiracy for the accomplishment of any of the acts mentioned under (i).

  the chief American prosecutor, Robert H. Jackson, stated:

  To initiate a war of aggression, therefore, is not only an international crime; it is the supreme international crime differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole.
