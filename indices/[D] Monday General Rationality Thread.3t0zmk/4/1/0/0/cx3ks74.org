First: intent matters because any understanding of morality in which intent doesn't matter leads to absurd conclusions.

Suppose person X shoots and kills person Y. Does it matter if X did it in self-defense, knowing or reasonably believing that Y was about to kill him if he did nothing? /Of course it does/. Any other answer here is too ridiculous to contemplate.

Thus the same action (X killing Y) could be either right or wrong depending on X's motive.

Second: like people, governments put out statements about their goals.

After the MSF catastrophe, the US apologized and vowed to investigate what happened and make changes in its operations so that this does not happen again.

After the Paris attacks, ISIS put out a statement saying this was only the beginning; going on to say, regarding that people of France, that "the scent of death will not leave their nostrils" provided several conditions continue to be met, one of which being that "they dare to curse our Prophet."

There is nothing difficult about comparing intentions here.
