No. We judge motives based on actions *and* words.

As I've already pointed out, there is a stark difference when we look at the words.

Now let's look at actions.

If the US /wanted/ to kill a lot of civilians, it could create infinitely more devastation than the destruction of an MSF hospital.

See: Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

At the moment, the US has tremendous destructive capacity at its disposal -- and does not use it.

That tells you something about its motives.

Instead, it uses drone strikes that are targeted sufficiently narrowly to kill specific people:

[[http://www.cnn.com/2013/11/01/world/asia/pakistan-violence/]]

This should be enough information to demonstrate the truth of my initial statement, namely that drone strikes are in no way morally comparable to the Paris attacks. In the latter, ISIS sought to kill as many civilians as possible. In the former, the US did not. Rather, the drone strikes are aimed at military targets. This is not to deny that mistakes are occasionally made, e.g., the MSF hospital, that civilians are inevitably killed in warfare, and there is no suggestion here that the drone strikes are a good idea.

  You're nitpicking with the ISIS statement. Revise my previous comment to

No nitpicking there -- the difference between western democracies & ISIS is the key point under discussion.
