  Any other answer here is too ridiculous to contemplate.

I don't think so. You haven't provided any argument, you're trying to reductio ad absurdum without showing the absurd part. What is absurd or ridiculous about ignoring intent? Self-defense vs aggression matters, but those are different in more than just intent. It is important to understand if force was used as a last resort to protect, or used to threaten and intimidate. I would not call this razor "intent" but rather "aggression." And if X kills Y in self-defense but Z is also killed as collateral damage, then you can see why a parent of Z would not really care about the intent of X.

  governments put out statements about their goals.

Yes. And those government statements will always, 100% of the time, say they did not mean to cause harm to innocents. Since the statement is the same regardless of intent, professed intent provides you no knowledge of the actual intent. "Those drugs aren't mine officer" is not evidence, it's an excuse literally everyone uses, guilty and innocent, and should be ignored as such since it provides no information.
