The Paris attacks are not at all comparable to the drone assassinations.

ISIS /wants/ to kill as many innocent civilians as it can.

The US does not try to kill innocent civilians. The drone strikes aim to assassinate military fighters from the Taliban, Al-Qaeda, and so forth. We may argue whether they are a good idea, but fundamentally they are not unjustified, given that they are targeted at fighters from groups who are waging war against the United States.

Innocent civilians do die in US operations, but this does not mean that those operations are comparable to what ISIS does in any moral or otherwise meaningful sense.

Intentions matter.

For example, you mention (in a comment below) the bombing of a Medecins Sans Frontieres hospital -- the US admitted this was a mistake, apologized to MSF, and promised to hold members of its military accountable if an investigation finds this was anything more than an error (source: [[http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/10/07/us-afghanistan-attack-msf-idUSKCN0S10SX20151007#WeGo8tfDuhPql0SQ.97]] )

TLDR: in judging military actions, it is morally imperative to distinguish between actions which aim to kill as many civilians as possible (e.g., 9/11, Paris Attacks, London Subway bombings) and actions which only kill civilians as a by-product of attacks on military targets (e.g., US drone strikes).
