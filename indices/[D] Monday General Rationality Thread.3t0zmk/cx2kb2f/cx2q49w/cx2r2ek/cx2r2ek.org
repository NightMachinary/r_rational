[[https://theintercept.com/drone-papers/][The Drone Papers]] by The Intercept is a pretty good resource, created after a recent leak. The recent [[http://www.msf.org/topics/kunduz-hospital-airstrike][bombing of the doctors without borders hospital]] in Kunduz is all too typical of Drone assassinations.

As far as comparing death tolls, look at numerous sources. But it's clear that the US is far and away in the lead, take for example Iraq, where 100k-300k civilians have been killed since 2003. That's far more innocents than 200 in Paris or 3000 in WTC.
