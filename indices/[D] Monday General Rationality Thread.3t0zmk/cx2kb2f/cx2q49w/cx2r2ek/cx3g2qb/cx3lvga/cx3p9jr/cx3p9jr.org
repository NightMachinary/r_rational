By that logic, the bombing of the DWB hospitals can be blamed on AQ, as well as the entire Iraq War itself. If we /really/ want to dig deep, we can blame the USSR for invading Afghanistan. But I'm sure they had at least some claimed justification, which means we'd need to dive even deeper down the rabbit hole.

And it would undermine that point if a large or majority of those deaths were the result of sectarian violence, Muslim on Muslim. If Shias killing Sunnis is the fault of the US, but iraq/Afghanistan can't be blamed on Sadaam/bin Laden/etc, that implies a world view that denies agency and full moral personhood to Muslims/Arabs/brown people.
