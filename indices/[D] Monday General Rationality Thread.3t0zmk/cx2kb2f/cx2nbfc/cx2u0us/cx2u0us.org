At the same time, ISIS has a very real track record of wiping out captured males and old women and sentencing young women to Rape&PregnancyForever. For all the faults of the US, Russia, China and even North Korea, I don't think even the wildest conspiracy theories about them are as nauseatingly 'evil' as what ISIS is. War is a horrible waste of money and life, and it would have been so very much better if 'we' had just left Hussein in power, but now here we are, and ISIS is not going to let us just not fight them. They sincerely believe that sky man wants them to murder and rape in the name of god.
