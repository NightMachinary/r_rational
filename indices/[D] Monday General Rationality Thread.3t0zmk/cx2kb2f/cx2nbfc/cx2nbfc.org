On a country level, utilitarianism only matters insofar as your own citizens are hurt. That being said, money spent on this war would save a lot more lives if devoted to researching even stuff like autonomous vehicles to prevent crashes. I don't thing it's hugely hypocritical from a realpolitik standpoint, just laughably inefficient.
