I want to get you rational people's thoughts on the Paris attacks. IMO it's a drop in the bucket of violence that is perpetrated on and by Islam daily, for example [[http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/03/us-led-air-strikes-on-isis-targets-killed-more-than-450-civilians-report][Drone Assassinations]]. While I'm not surprised by the focus of the media, it does sadden me. Our first world countries are involved in perpetrating so much violence, killing innocents regularly. And then something like this happens and we act outraged - it just seems so hypocritical.
