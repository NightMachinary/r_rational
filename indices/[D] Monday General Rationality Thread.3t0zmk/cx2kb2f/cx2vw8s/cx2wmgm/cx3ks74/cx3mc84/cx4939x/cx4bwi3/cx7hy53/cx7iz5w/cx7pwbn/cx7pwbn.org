  The fallacy in your argument is "because the US didn't cause maximal damage intentionally, it hasn't caused any damage intentionally."
#+end_quote

Did I say that?

The question is rhetorical. I didn't.

Please read my last comment again. The logical argument is /obviously/ not that the US has not caused any damage. It is that we can infer something about the motives of the US government by observing just how limited the devastation it causes is -- compared to what it could be.

This is either playing with words, or extremely confused from a moral standpoint. I will attempt to explain one last time.

It is a goal of ISIS to kill innocent people.

It is not a goal of the United States to kill innocent people.

This makes an enormous moral difference.

In particular, drone stroke are not at all comparable to the Paris attacks -- not in any moral or meaningful sense.

Now: innocent people do die in US military operations.

(More generally: innocent people die in all wars.)

The US knows this.

It conducts its operations anyway -- successfully killing leaders of ISIS and the Taliban in drone strikes.

Knowing that innocent people will die.

Nevertheless, this is *completely different* from when ISIS actions kill innocent people.

Because it is a goal of ISIS to slaughter.

Motives matter in morality.

Imagine you could kill the entire leadership of ISIS (say, the top ~50 people in the ISIS chain of command) with a bomb that would kill 50 innocent civilians along with them.

Would you?

I would.

I'm not sure how many people ISIS has killed -- but it is at least in the tens of thousands. The number of refugees it has created is many times that.

It will kill many more.

Being able to put a dent in that by killing its leadership is worth it.

In fact: I believe that killing the top 50 ISIS commanders along with 50 innocent civilians is an act that /saves lives/.

The number of innocent lives you would save by doing this (thus disorganizing ISIS if not crippling it) would likely far exceed 50.

The point: there is an enormous moral difference between attacks which have civilian deaths as a goal and attacks on military targets which also kill civilians.

Now about those drone pilots. No one disputes that civilians die in war, so I'm not sure what the relevance of anything they said is. It sounds like the most obvious thing in the world -- innocent people die in wartime. You can say this means that the US kills civilians "intentionally," but then that statement has no moral force -- it is just playing with language.

  "Mistakes were made" is a phrase that shirks any responsibility, and it's disgusting when used about intentionally bombing a civilian medical installation.
#+end_quote

Whether the bombing was "intentional" (in the sense that the US realized it was bombing a hospital) is precisely the point the US disputes.

Mistakes /are/ made in war. That is a fact.

Once you start labeling arguments which invoke such facts as "disgusting," you are no longer interested in truth. In my view, this sort of thing does not belong at [[/r/rational]].
