The fallacy in your argument is "because the US didn't cause maximal damage intentionally, it hasn't caused any damage intentionally." My argument is not that the US kills civilians intentionally, (though it does, see [[http://www.democracynow.org/][this interview]] with 4 ex-drone pilots) it's that the US simply doesn't care about the collateral damage it is causing. And that deaths from this are just as deathly as deaths from any other source. Incompetence and becoming comfortable with collateral damage is just as dangerous as intentionally killing.

Additionally, there is much evidence to show that the US specifically armed, and armed proximately through Saudi Arabia, the rebels that eventually turned into ISIS. The policies the US has pursued in the region have created a vacuum and an impetus for young men to join ISIS. In the expanded moral context of the situation, this needs to be noticed, and these policies need to be stopped as they are creating more terrorists than they are killing.

"Mistakes were made" is a phrase that shirks any responsibility, and it's disgusting when used about intentionally bombing a civilian medical installation. Read the [[http://www.msf.org/topics/kunduz-hospital-airstrike][report]] from the people affected before you start apologizing for the people who authorized the destruction.
