  And I want to say you can potentially look forward in time a lot further than 30 seconds

If this is in D&D, you only have a limited amount of spells you can cast per day. I think you can fill in slots with lower-level spells, but still, this gives you only a few minutes of foresight a day. Although you can get the information from minutes in the future without actually casting those spells, but I'm not sure you can really recurse Instants like that. Definitely something a GM would curb before it got too far, unless party munchkinism was desirable.
