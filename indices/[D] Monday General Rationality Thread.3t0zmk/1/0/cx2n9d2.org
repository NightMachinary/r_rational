you'd feel bad if the answer was misleading in such a way that you'd regret the answer you got within the next thirty seconds, which could be reasonably quantified as harm.

And I want to say you can potentially look forward in time a lot further than 30 seconds (like in that one story with the pills where the future reader sends data back to himself) but you might be able to elegantly avoid this by treating boredom as harming the asker.

This is actually a really powerful power, but you can probably restrict it by having a very broad definition of harm, making it so it can basically only be used if the person is under absolutely no threats.
