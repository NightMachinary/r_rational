Huh, I'd actually phrased it as harm specifically to avoid using a more general term like negative consequence which could include disappointment. I could probably do with changing that to 'physical harm'.\\
I tend to default to oxford definition 1 when writing rules to try and ensure consistency, but I guess in this case the colloquial meaning is more generic.\\
In the case of harm OD1 is "physical injury, especially that which is deliberately inflicted."
