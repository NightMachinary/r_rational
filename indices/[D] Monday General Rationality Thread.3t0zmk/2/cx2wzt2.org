This was a great weekend for PRODUCTIVITY.

- I did a phone-bank for an LGBT rights bill.
- I got my pull-request and bug-fix merged to the machine-learning project that I volunteer for.
- I had a spare machine at work training its ANNABELL copy for a nice Turing Test.
- I started radically simplifying my proof development in Coq.
- I received the official notice that I finished grad school!

And then today I bought a video game.
