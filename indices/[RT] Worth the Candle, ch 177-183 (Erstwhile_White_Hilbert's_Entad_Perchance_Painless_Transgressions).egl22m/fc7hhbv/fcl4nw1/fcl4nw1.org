My only other thought besides the obvious ones that others mentioned, was that the pain stick makes you act impulsively, or maybe angrily, besides just making you feel pain. I can imagine these feelings helping being used to get confessions.

I say this because Juniper really did act impulsively, in that he was saying fuck everything. It could be that's he's natural response, but it could also be the pain stick's.
