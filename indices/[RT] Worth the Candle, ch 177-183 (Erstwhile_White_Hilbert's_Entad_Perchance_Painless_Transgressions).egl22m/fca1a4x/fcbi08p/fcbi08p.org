The text glosses over it, but this thought has been worming around in my head and won't go away - the input problem for a finitely sized elevator that needs to be directed to an infinitely large list of floors is actually really hard. So hard that I suspect the only real solution is a turing complete language for floor specification.\\
What I'm saying is that this is a really subtle joke about the halting problem.
