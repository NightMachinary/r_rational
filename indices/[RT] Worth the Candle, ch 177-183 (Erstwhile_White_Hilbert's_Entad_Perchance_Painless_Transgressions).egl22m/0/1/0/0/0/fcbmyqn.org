I can sorta see your point. On one hand, using a entad after being warned not to is a pretty clear sign that shit's about to go down. On the other hand, it's hallowed ground and it's surprising that they would risk violence there. Also Joon didn't have much time to think about it. I still think he made a dumb decision but what you said makes me sympathize with him a bit more.
