  Very much agreed. It was so frustrating how he directly says: I cannot allow you to use this entad, and if you use it anyway I'll have to stop you because you're clearly malicious. He's thinking rationally! And then he does the exact opposite for no given reason. Ughhh..

There was a given reason - Yarrow points out that he'd have to act aggressively in a way that presumably compromises Amaryllis's position:

  I'd said no demonstrations, and I'd said that I would attack him, but I didn't know where to draw the line. Surely I would at least have to stop him if he tried to light the pipe. He stopped when the tobacco was in the pipe, looking it over, and then looked up at me. “Have you thought that from my perspective, letting my decisions be dictated by someone who pretends not to have any particular limits on what grievious violence he would inflict means that I would end up ruled by threats, even when those threats would never actually be carried out? It would be terrible policy.”

I.e. Yarrow has a feasible reason for wanting to demonstrate despite the threat (other than actually being malicious), and he declares he will. June is in a position where he can either attack unprovoked (or at least not provoked in an obviously demonstrable way), or allow it. He allows it.
