If Joon had higher charisma he could have done a diplomacy solution. Something like - I'll agree to not chop off your head but also allow you to demonstrate your stupid entad joke if you'll only use the entad on one person at a time, with the rest of the party outside the room and warded, checking in on the person who you used the entad on.

Presumably Joon can even go in and check the soul of whoever (probably Solace) they used the entad on first, which won't be necessary since they'll see she was put to sleep.

There's lots of 'talk your way out of it' solutions here, just Joon's build doesnt really allow it.
