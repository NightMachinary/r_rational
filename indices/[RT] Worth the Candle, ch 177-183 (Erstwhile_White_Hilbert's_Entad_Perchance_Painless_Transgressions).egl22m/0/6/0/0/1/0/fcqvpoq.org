  "I'll agree to not chop off your head but also allow you to demonstrate your stupid entad joke if you'll only use the entad on one person at a time, with the rest of the party outside the room and warded, checking in on the person who you used the entad on."

Yarrow ignores your offer and keeps lighting the pipe, because he has no interest in collaborating.

Joon's "if you ignore my warning, I'm forced to assume this is an attack, so I have to kill you" is as strong an argument as could be made in such an adversarial situation; it's a pretty credible commitment. And Yarrow was willing to take the chance anyway.
