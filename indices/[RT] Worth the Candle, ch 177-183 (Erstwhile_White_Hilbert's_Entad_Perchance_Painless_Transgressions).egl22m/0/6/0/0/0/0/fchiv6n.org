  he knew that the Dungeon Master might try to knock him out with something that can't be stilled, is pretty dumb.

That seems like hindsight bias?

Seriously, this all seems to me like forum thinking, the kind of reasoning that you go through when you have 10 minutes to consider all possible options (and you already know what the answer turns out to be) and you have no pressure whatsoever; I really don't think that's how someone confronted with a high-stake choice in a high-pressure social situation would react.

Like, as the reader, you say "Of course Joon shouldn't rely on stilling magic, it's his most powerful magic, of course the DM is going to set up an ambush that can bypass it!". Except if Joon instead relies on, say, unicorn bones or passion magic or direct brute force, maybe Yarrow pulls out a memetic entad that happens to bypass unicorn bones and passion magic, or maybe the pipe's power is to put you to sleep if you hold it (unless you have a special anti-sleep entad) and Yarrow was baiting Joon to take it from him.

There's no way for Joon to be prepared for every single threat that could possibly come after him, especially if these threats happen to match his weaknesses through +railroading+ dumb luck, especially because if he does find a way to have no remaining weakness, the DM is likely to exclude it.

I'm not saying Joon reacted optimally for this situation. I'm saying it's normal that he reacted suboptimally, given that even very paranoid people don't spend nearly as much time analyzing every situation they're in for potential traps as the average reader does analyzing SI scenes. And even when he /knows/ the situation is a potential trap, it makes sense that he'd be defaulting to his most effective weapon/defense, and that in the rush of the moment he might not be considering every single alternate tool at his disposal in case his most powerful ability turns out not to work.

All of this to say, yeah, I think Joon acted a little dumb, but that seems realistic enough to me. It was basically a confidence scheme, and Joon got sloppy with the time/social pressure.
