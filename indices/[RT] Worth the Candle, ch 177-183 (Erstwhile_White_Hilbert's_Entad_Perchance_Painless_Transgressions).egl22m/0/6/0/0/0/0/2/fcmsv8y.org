The problem is this: Joon defeats them almost singlehandedly when they have time to prepare, significant terrain advantage, and wards set up, without any equipment or his massive Still skill bonuses. Joon is defeated by them at the height of his power with all these bonuses and his entads on hand, with his team intact and anticipating trouble. These two scenarios are not consistent rationally, they are forced by the plot.
