  Relying on Still Magic when he /knew/ that it is his strongest, most obviously important magic for his enemies to counter right now, he /knew/ that the Dungeon Master might try to knock him out with something that can't be stilled, is pretty dumb.

His enemies don't know that it is his strongest magic. In universe, Joon has been an official still mage for roughly 2 weeks. For everyone else, that is maybe enough time to consistently produce some effect with still magic, certainly not enough time to be relevant in combat, and the idea that he is currently a grandmaster still mage is ludicrous to anyone who doesn't already know that he is basically Uther. Hell, even if they do know he's Uther, they wouldn't expect him to be that good at still magic in such a short time.

Similarly, with spirit and soul magic capped out, with blood and vibration magic pretty high, and with a number of other magics under his belt, he is immune to a huge number of effects, and his opponents have next to no way of knowing about those. With all of those magics, he's immune to kinetics, radiation, heat, gaseous attack, attacks against his soul, attacks against his spirit, memetics, antiemetics, and poisons of all kinds. And if he isn't immune to the attack, he's extremely fast, strong, and has a huge ability to dodge or deflect an attack. The amount of things that would instantly incapacitate him with no recourse is extremely small.

Taking out an entad and activating it in front of someone, when you just threatened to end their life, is likely enough to make someone say that their life was endangered, even if the entad you were activating is something used to escape.

Keep in mind that Joon has most of his magics illegally. A very possible outcome would have been that the entad was completely mundane, but Joon reacted and revealed magic that he shouldn't have by imperial law. Then he's in a huge amount of trouble, and makes the whole trip to Anglecynn much harder for himself and the party. Similarly, they might have been trying to bait him into doing something they could construe as assault.

Overall, he wasn't dumb here. He obviously made the wrong choice in the end, but based on the information and time he had available to make the decision, I don't think he could have realistically done better.
