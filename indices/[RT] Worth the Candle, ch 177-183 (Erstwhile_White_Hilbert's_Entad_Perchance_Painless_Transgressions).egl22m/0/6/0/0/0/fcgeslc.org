I feel like the lack of aggression from Joon isn't the issue, it's the lack of defense despite anticipating an attack.

Relying on Still Magic when he /knew/ that it is his strongest, most obviously important magic for his enemies to counter right now, he /knew/ that the Dungeon Master might try to knock him out with something that can't be stilled, is pretty dumb.

He didn't need to potentially start a war just to defend himself in an exaggeratedly cautious way - he'd just need to accept some embarrassment and a potential reveal of some abilities.

Tap SPD / Unicorn just before he uses the Entad, activate whatever Fear is possible (because it was obviously a tense situation), get ready to leap through a window with Blood, have the Vambrace ready for Panic Loadout and Upward Bliss, he had /so many options/ for non-threatening defense.

Worst case scenario, the Pipe screams the words: "I'M SMOKING!" or something and they all laugh about how dumb it is and how paranoid Joon was.
