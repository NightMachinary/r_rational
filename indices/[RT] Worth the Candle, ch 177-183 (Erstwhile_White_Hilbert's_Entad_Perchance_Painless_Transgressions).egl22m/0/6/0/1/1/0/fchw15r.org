In everyday society we typically assume if you're reaching into your bag it's not a gun.

In a court where blood relatives can't meet each other without a security detail and a negotiated neutral ground it's assumed to be a gun until proven otherwise.

So what do you do when you see someone reaching for a gun? Preferably you stop it non-lethally and then call the athorities. In Joons case that just means walking over and firmly taking hold of Yarrow's wrist. And then milking this for all the political capital you can.
