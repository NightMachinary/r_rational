Very much agreed. It was so frustrating how he directly says: I cannot allow you to use this entad, and if you use it anyway I'll have to stop you because you're clearly malicious. He's thinking rationally! And then he does the exact opposite for no given reason. Ughhh..

He should have just taken the entad without harming the prince, it's not even an escalation, just a reaction, and is quite politically defensible.

Great chapters otherwise, I especially liked the fight scene.
