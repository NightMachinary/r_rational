A bit late to the party, but here are my thoughts:

First of all, the chapters following the capture were great. I loved both the snark and the battle at the end, how he used all the tools at his disposal and the constant looping with the unicorn bones. Probably my third favorite fight after the ones with Raven and Mome Rath.

However, the capture itself seemed like narrative induced protagonist stupidity, and I'm interested in whether it was in-universe narrative affecting him, or AW just really wanted to write the next scenes.

I can see why he didn't follow through with his threat of beheading him when he pulled out the pipe, but his only options being killing him (thus causing a major diplomatic incident and having them being fugitives in the short term) or allowing him to use a magic item on him, was a bit of a false dichotomy.

The first thought that came to mind in this situation was Still Magic, because it's so powerful and yet completely non-lethal. Still Yarrow, and if his sister escalates and calls the robots, still her too and destroy/still the robots as they come. They would probably just lose some political capital, and the situation may result in a standoff, but still much better than taking the risk he took.

Alternatively, though that wasn't my first split-second thought, just wrench the pipe from his fingers. Grabbing an unknown magic item is somewhat risky, but Yarrow was already touching it, so it probably wasn't a contact based attack.

Tl;dr June thought that it was bullshit that the DM/narrative came at him with a sleep based attack, but the capture itself seemed even more iffy to me.
