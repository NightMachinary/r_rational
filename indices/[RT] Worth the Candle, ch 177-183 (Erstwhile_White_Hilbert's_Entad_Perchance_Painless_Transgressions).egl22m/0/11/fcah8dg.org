Yeah, I like scenes and the general interrogation / clever escape / tricky combat was great. The writing was great, and I liked getting a bit more interaction with the 'b' team of solace and pallida.

Ultimately my patience for the idiot balling / railroading is rapidly dropping. Certainly there's an in story explanation for the meta game stuff, but it's still wearing very thin. Generally Joon and really all of them are continuously half assing this whole thing. I guess there wouldn't be dramatic conflict otherwise...
