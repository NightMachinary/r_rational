My understanding is that a) the bots would cease protecting her the moment she's declared a fugitive, which hyacinth can do at her discretion. It's only her desire to meet that's between Mary and the law. The will of your opponent isn't much protection. b) Mary says herself they are easy to circumvent or manipulate. H has had more time to prepare. This is her ground.
