It's a common flaw of arguments I've seen on this subreddit that "rational" means "perfect." There is absolutely no action Juniper could have taken that had 0 chance of going wrong - you could construct an entad that perfectly counters anything he could have done, and even taking action against a harmless entad could have spun out of control politically.

More to the point, it really seems to me that you're either using hindsight or your ability to stop reading to decide on an action. I make it a point when I get to "what would I do" scenarios that I am absolutely not allowed to read slower than the action in the story. If they pause, I get a moment to think - but if I can't outthink them /in the time they had, with the information they had,/ then I don't get to claim afterwards that the characters were railroaded. In that moment, it would be genuinely difficult to figure out what to do, and the antagonists rushed the smoke inhalation (by design) to play on that fact.

Because literally any action I would have made had an easy entad-based counter ("pipe of people-targetting-the-holder-with-magic-have-their-mind-read"), I have to acknowledge that the power of the narrative gave me even more hesitation. In addition, he really didn't didn't want to interfere with Amyrillis's plans by starting a diplomatic event. The best I could think of was to have two all-purpose counters ready a deploy in quick succession - which he did, and neither worked in the quarter-second he had to deploy them.

Rational doesn't mean godlike. Just because you have hindsight and the ability to stop time and think doesn't mean the characters did. If you can't think of a better action /before things go wrong,/ then you don't get to complain.
