It was a mistake, sure.

To be fair, Joon isn't an Aerb veteran. He's basically an overpowered Earthling. I think he's still working off a moral intuition of 'cigars aren't weapons', despite the fact that he knew better. It's difficult to change our underlying conceptions of weapons, threat and decorum.

Anyway, he had no way to know that it was one of the things that he couldn't tank, nor did he fully know what was an acceptable thing to do at the court of the Lost King. Perhaps they play games of chicken like that all the time? Perhaps it was reasonable for this fellow to feel like he couldn't give in to a commoner?
