That's obviously not reasonable at all. There are so many downsides I don't know where to begin.

Killing a prominent member of the court in front of everyone and then doing an extraordinary illegal thing, moreso than even murder, is a great way to get literally the entire government and people against you. You destroy Mary's position and kill any hope she has of getting anything it of Anglcyn. You make yourself out to be the villain to every nation and person (terrifying unregistered soul mate). You lose your working relationship with Uniquities.

Even if you had her nailed to the wall with irrefutable evidence, that course of action would be terrible since there's still a procedure to things.
