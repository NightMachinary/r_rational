Hm. Yarrow seems to have implied that there is some hidden consequence to the pain stick, which I imagine is going to back to bite Juniper in the ass at some point, even more than just his turning off of pain will. Also, Zinnia is the name of a character from Pokemon Omega Ruby/Alpha Sapphire, though I imagine it was chosen on the basis of a flower rather than that.

Good to see Juniper kicking ass and taking names again, even if his genuine frustration bleeds so believably out of the narrative that I find myself getting irritated reading it. I think my ideal conclusion to this arc would be him walking up to a Hyacinth throwing political threats against him and handing her over to Amaryllis.

As usual, amazingly well-written. Thanks for the chapters!
