I think it's somewhat unlikely that Miunun has an information leak like that, but it is at least plausible.

Soul mages can't delete memories with that high a specificity, which is one reason why soul fucking is not something you do lightly: once reverted the person can tell the authorities what you did. So if he changed his own values, he would at least know why he did it.

Solace being Amaryllis' daughter and heir to her entads has been mentioned in the discord, and AW said that it's something that the characters know the answer to but hasn't been mentioned in the story. Presumably she isn't the heir, but it's not a certainty.
