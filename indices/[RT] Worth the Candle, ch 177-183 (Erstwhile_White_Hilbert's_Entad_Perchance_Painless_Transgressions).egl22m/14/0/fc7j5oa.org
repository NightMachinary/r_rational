  Ink magic seems really, ridiculously strong. The raw effects are limited in a few ways, but just the ability to basically make entads with specific effects is great. As seen here, you can tailor items to counter specific strategies your enemy has prepared. And fighting against an ink mage must be a nightmare, since they could bring almost anything to the table. Creating synergies with existing entads seems absurdly good as well.
