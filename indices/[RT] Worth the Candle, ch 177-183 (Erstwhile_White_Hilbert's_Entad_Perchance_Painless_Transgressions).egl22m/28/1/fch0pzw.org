I was wondering about that too.

Given Aerb's fondness of soul-powered energy and supposedly-inoffensive uses of necromancy, I could imagine Necrium being a sort of material harvested from death...

Maybe turning Soul energy to matter through an entad, or something similar to what Solace did with a skeleton - tapping the latent magic in bones to craft tough armor on the spot instead of consuming them for stats.

Would make sense considering its use here was described as "claws of polished necrium", in a room full of white stuff.
