You only have to do so once or twice however, then you can potentially raise tamed soulfucked unicorns.

For all the power that the unicorn ability gives them, it is wholly dependent on there being a valid way to escape.

Setting up a no-escape scenario against a unicorn is not easy, but with the resources of a thousand-man company with access to weapons or armor that can completely shut down the unicorn's physical capabilities it's not exactly unfeasible.
