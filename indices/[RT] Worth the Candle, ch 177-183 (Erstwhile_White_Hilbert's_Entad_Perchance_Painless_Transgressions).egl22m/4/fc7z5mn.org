Spiritfuckery is delicious. I loved the "saved at the wrong time" fight scene; really felt like a challenging game where you had to memorize the pattern just right to progress further.

I wonder if it's possible to soulfuck a living unicorn. Turn it into a source of bones, removing them and healing it after.

Wait. If spirit magic can make someone loyal more or less permanently, and no one else knows it at the moment, is it possible to capture and spiritfuck an animal to serve as a mount? The moral side of this is ambiguos at best, but I'd do that, honestly. Especially to a unicorn.

Edit: and explain away with an entad that lets the wearer designate one non-sapient creature as a "familiar", for example. Should be unconspicious enough and just on the right side of a power-up to not be game-changing and therefore worth paying too much attention to and prioritising taking it away. I know this likely won't happen, I just love the idea.
