I think the intended escalation was much less than lethal force. Yarrow was supposed to use the pipe, look into their souls for intel, and keep everyone asleep while Amaryllis had her meeting so she wouldn't have backup to call on.

This plan went off the rails when the meme took Yarrow out and Zinnia immediately escalated much farther on her own in an effort to save him.
