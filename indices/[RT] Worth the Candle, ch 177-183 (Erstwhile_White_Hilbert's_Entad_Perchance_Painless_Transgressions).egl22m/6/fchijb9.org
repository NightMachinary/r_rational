Lot of complaining about Joon letting the pipe be lit, but actually, the thing that gives me pause is.. That Yarrow did it.

Joon is scary. Murderer of titans, decked out to the teeth. But okay, maybe he discounts that, and just sees him as a minion of Amaryllis, a potent one, but a minion. However...

"Hi, my name is Raven Masters, Knight of Legend, founding figure of your national mythos". And he went ahead and broke truce, sanctuary and law in front of her. Which went about as badly as one would expect from his point of view, when she no-sold his bullshit magic entad. Heck, they are fortunate they did not die in the next six seconds.

What, by the dark night of the soul were the siblings offered or threatened with to make them go through with that attack?
