I think the only person who did it with frequency was Amaryllis and maybe Fenn, but please don't quote me on that. It could also be that the "usage" of the guy's soul at least gives them oblivion over the hells.

I was thinking just as much that the guards might have an informal agreement within themselves to soul catch each if some of them survive. I mean I would be pretty unwilling to let a random passerby go to the hells let alone someone that i might be in pretty constant contact with for months at a time you know? That's a good point tho does anyone remember if after the party kills the fireteam they soul catch them?
