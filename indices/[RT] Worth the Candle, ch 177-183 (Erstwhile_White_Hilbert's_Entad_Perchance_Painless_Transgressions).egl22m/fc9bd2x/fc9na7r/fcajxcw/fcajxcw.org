The Pipe Dream not interact with Still Magic was what was surprising to me. I'd rather Joon not have reacted or reacted clearly wrongly than try and fail in a way that seemed to conflict with what I thought I understood about Still Magic.

Is there any exposition about that incoming? Because clearly Joon was under the same impression.

The lead up was a lot of fun, though. I've learned more about aquatic dinosaurs and the etymologies of their names in the past few hours looking for puns than I would have ever done otherwise. No regrets.
