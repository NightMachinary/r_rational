I should say upfront that I really, really hate "character spends lots of time going through their options in a scene that realistically happens over the course of about thirty seconds", not just because I think they're generally boring and unrealistic, but because they're murder on the pacing of a scene and don't convey the actual speed at which things happen and how little time you have in the moment to react.

That aside, most of Juniper's concerns here are /political/. He's worried that it's a trap of some kind, a deliberate provocation that will put him in hot water, deprive Amaryllis of an asset, escalate toward other violence, etc. Almost all the options for stopping Yarrow either constitute assault or aggravated assault by the standards of English common law, or result in only a delay.

Further, Juniper is both confident in his abilities and has a narrow window of weaknesses, meaning that even taking narrative and DM fuckery into account, whatever the pipe does is not necessarily going to instantly incapacitate him, if it does anything at all (which it might not, if it's intended solely as a provocation). The pipe is a trap of some kind, but Juniper doesn't know what kind of trap it is, and a wide variety of actions might constitute walking into that trap. Better to wait to see what it does and react afterward with full moral and legal authority as the defender, especially if the attack surface is very small. Juniper says after, in the blacksite, that he's especially pissed off because they shouldn't even have known that sleep was what he was particularly weak against.

(You could probably do some kind of probability distribution with regards to expected intentions of Yarrow and outcomes, but you wouldn't be able to realistically do it in the moment without pulling numbers from your ass.)

I'm sorry if the scene didn't live up to your expectations for either the characters or my writing, it just felt like a weak place for munchkinry to me, especially when the focus was (in my mind) more on the political side.
