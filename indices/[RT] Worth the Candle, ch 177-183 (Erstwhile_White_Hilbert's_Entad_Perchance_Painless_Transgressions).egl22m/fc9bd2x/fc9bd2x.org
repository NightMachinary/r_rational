Oh, ffs.

[[/u/alexanderwales]], that capture scene was made out of bullshit and railroad tracks. That's the first time in the entire story that I've felt that way; every other mistake that the characters made was perfectly sensible based on their characterization and what they knew at the time, and it added a lot to the story to see the main characters being imperfect. This one was just nonsense. Juniper had JUST SAID that he would take action if Yarrow tried to light the pipe, then Yarrow lights the pipe and Juniper just stands there? His choices weren't "kill the guy" or "do nothing". Off the top of my head, he could have:

- Used blood magic to make a tendril that grabbed the pipe and snatched it away
- Used still magic to prevent Yarrow from moving
- Used air magic to blow out the lighter
- Used unicorn bones to set a savepoint before the pipe lit
- Used passion magic to knock the pipe out of Yarrow's hands
- Used the vine armor (and yes, he should have been dressed for war; he was a damn bodyguard)
- Used any of the ink items that he should have had that would allow him to disable someone
- The obvious one: walked over and physically taken the pipe away. It took multiple seconds to light it, so Juniper had plenty of time.

Seriously. He walked completely unprepared into a dangerous situation with a major antagonist, recognized a threat, warned the guy, then did absolutely nothing to stop it.

His lack of caution in all the other chapters is excusable -- he's probably being affected by passion magic to make him more emotional/reckless and less logical/forethoughtful, plus he was in a very risky situation where time was of the essence, plus he knew he had a lot of ways to survive damage. The capture thing? Unless we get a justification later ("he was being affected by an entad that there was no evidence of") then this was the laziest writing I've ever seen on this sub, let alone from you.
