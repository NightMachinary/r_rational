Yarrow put Juniper in a no-win situation. Joon could either sit back and take the entad attack, or he could do any of the things you suggested and caused a diplomatic incident that would worsen Amaryllis's position (because, no matter how reasonable and proportional Joon's use of force is, Hyacinth is /obviously/ going to spin it as an unprovoked act of assault, theft, and/or vandalism).

Now, if Juniper had known /exactly/ what the entad did and what would happen to his party as a result, he would have obviously stopped Yarrow and dealt with whatever consequences followed. But Joon is operating under uncertainty. From his perspective, it's equally likely that the entad is a weapon meant to damage his party as that the entad is harmless and the /real/ attack is political, a way of baiting Juniper into throwing the first punch. Because he is protected by still magic, among his numerous other abilities, and he has powerful allies in the room, Juniper makes the call to allow Yarrow to make the first move, betting on his party's ability to tank the first hit and strike back from the moral high ground if Yarrow is indeed planning to attack them. Unfortunately for Juniper, the entad /just happened/ to attack him in one of the few ways he is vulnerable to harm. As he correctly notes in the next chapter, this is /bullshit/; there is no way they could have known Juniper is vulnerable to sleep, and the chance that they would /just happen/ to use an attack that bypassed Juniper's defenses is microscopic. Obviously the DM's hand was at work here. Is poor Joon to blame because an omnipotent deity is clearly railroading his life in the interest of placing him into more interesting situations?
