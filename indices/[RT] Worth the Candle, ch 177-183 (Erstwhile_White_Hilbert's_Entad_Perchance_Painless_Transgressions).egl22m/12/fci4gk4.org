I was on Joon's side at first about how much of a DM railroad the pipe sequence was--not only an entad that zeroes in on one of his few weaknesses, but an encounter that, by the equivalent of DM fiat, doesn't let him use any of his game-layer-enhanced social/analytical abilities to thwart it. But by the time he gets around to mentally complaining about it himself, it had occurred to me that

​

- Joon's been "offloading sleep" onto several tuung who don't otherwise have a high security clearance (chapter 179). Presumably Amaryllis /hasn't/, despite her time being otherwise more ruthlessly optimized. So Hyacinth via her at-least-one-spy actually does have a reason to know that Joon, specifically, can but shouldn't sleep.
- Yarrow is a soul mage, which gives him a strong advantage against being read or intimidated. With prep time, he can modify his own soul so that he /really/ wants to light the pipe, even at the risk of his life, but has no memory of why. So it maybe wasn't possible, even in principle, for Joon to figure out what the trap was just from Yarrow's actions and tells.

​

So maybe the DM was playing fairer than it seemed.

​

Unrelatedly, has anyone brought up the possibility that Solace is now a high-ranking Penndraig by the standards of at least some of the hereditary Penndraig entads? The entads judge inheritance by different rules; surely at least some of them care that Solace is the daughter of the most direct living descendant of Arthur?
