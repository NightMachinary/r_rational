As much as I think the scene was made out of railroad tracks, I think the pipe dream is the sensible choice for Yarrow and Zinnia. You have to throw the binder (I think), meaning that Joon could dodge, or you could miss, or he might have a way to escape, or an entad that nullifies it, etc. With the pipe dream, the nature of the threat is not immediately obvious and it's apparently "no save, you lose". Once someone is unconscious they have far fewer options for escaping.
