  I didn't attack him. I couldn't break the peace, not over this, it would be assault by anyone's definition, and it would fuck things up for Amaryllis if I was wrong. I could leave, jump out the window or burst through the door, but I wasn't just thinking about myself, I was thinking about everyone else, and about Amaryllis in the next room.

I'm wondering if it was added in response to comments here. I can't recall whether it was part of the chapter when I first read it.
