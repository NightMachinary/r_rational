So one thing that occurred to me after reading this is that Hyacinth had no reason to sign onto the Yarrow plan or to foment it, because her foe is currently negotiating her surrender. So, since we know that it's from her faction, what if this represents an internal dissent within the faction, and Hyacinth winds up flipping over it?

That would be fascinating, and a great moment for Juniper. By which I mean it would piss him off even more and I would laugh.
