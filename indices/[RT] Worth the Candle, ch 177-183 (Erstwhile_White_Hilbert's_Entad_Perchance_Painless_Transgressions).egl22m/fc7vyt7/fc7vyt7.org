Merry Christmas cthulhu! Thanks for the gifts!

Few theories/observations of the story that aren't connected to the update in particular, but I want to get out there.

1. Fel Seed is Forty-two, Uther's oldest, loyalist knight, and a /Reimer-inspired shapeshifter/. This way he parallels Joon's own creation of Fel Seed in response to losing Arthur. I'd place the portal as linking him to the lowest plane of hell, which grants infinite flesh regen and guaranteed reversal of death, even after total destruction, a unique property that has only been observed outside hell once, with Fel Seed.

2. The elemental planes follow the standard dnd elements, with para- and quasi- elements linking them to each-other, and the negative/positive (N/M) planes. The only missing element is air. There's also the alternative elements of Metal and Wood, which are missing more planes yet undiscovered, and a plane of body. This is important because it seems every plane has an associated magic. Most are obvious, Fire/Wind/Water for example, while others are less straightforward, such as Gem Magic and the plane of light (wards against gem magic are wards that block light), or steel magic and the plane of iron (steel is an iron alloy and so the magic is tied to the iron). This also gives the possibility of a parallel element-set to the Planes of Body: Planes of Mind, inaccessible elemental planes of Spirit, Soul and Emotion could be located. A Plane of Spirit could be the source of Burning Man as a "lifeform" entirely based on spirit.

3. I suspect the Locus cannot be restored, and a core part of its arc is about learning to move on, letting go of the past and finding there is still beauty to be found in the world.
