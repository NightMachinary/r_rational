That's an interesting idea.. On one hand it does seem like the kind of munchkinry that would be punished, but Druids constantly surprise us with what they're willing to accept.

Solace currently has a portion of her soul consumed / replaced by the Locus, and she mentioned that she feels closer to her ideal that way.

Does the Locus actually care about natural / unnatural, as long as it enables the mystical? I'm sure that if Joon / TSE tried to make a /platoon/ of druids, all with the exact same soul/spirit modifications and with exact protocols and labels, the Locus would rebel - but individually changing himself might not be that bad.

...Then again, if he does change himself, he's basically assuming that what he's changing into is the Locus's ideals, which technically does try to put it into a convenient box... Druids are confusing.
