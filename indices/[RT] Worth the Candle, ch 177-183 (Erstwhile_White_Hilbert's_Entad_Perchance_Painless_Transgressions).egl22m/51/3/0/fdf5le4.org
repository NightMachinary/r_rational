  Unfortunately for Juniper, the entad just happened to attack him in one of the few ways he is vulnerable to harm. As he correctly notes in the next chapter, this is bullshit; there is no way they could have known Juniper is vulnerable to sleep, and the chance that they would just happen to use an attack that bypassed Juniper's defenses is microscopic. Obviously the DM's hand was at work here. Is poor Joon to blame because an omnipotent deity is clearly railroading his life in the interest of placing him into more interesting situations?

I think that calls back to the game flashback where the players were up against a guy who was trying to poison them, who didn't know they were immune to poison. Sometimes that works the other way, when they attack you with something silly that they may not expect to work and don't know is your Achilles heel.
