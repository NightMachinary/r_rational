I just want to note that authors of serials are placed in a unique position where they receive a lot of feedback in the midst of their story, and that there's a certain response bias in the type of person and the type of comment they are likely to receive. I've noticed that the author of The Gods Are Bastards has, more than once, tailored parts of subsequent chapters to be pretty direct replies to comments that have bugged him. I'm not sure I love the idea of a vocal minority having that much influence on a writer!

Which is my long winded way of getting around to saying that my read on the chapter seems to match up with what you say you were trying to get across: that Juniper was put in a difficult social situation, which he wasn't really prepared for---worse he fell victim to a carefully planned (and perhaps repeatedly executed) con. That he wasn't sure what the consequences of assaulting or interfering with Yarrow would be, that he was leery of the consequences of outright fleeing and abandoning Mary. That given his defensive abilities maybe the risk wasn't so great. That decisions are tough in time pressure. That social pressure is a real thing, and that it can be hard to push back against people making an effort to be friendly and nice to you, and who have already gotten you caught up in a friendly conversation/game.

Which is my longer winded way of saying that at least some of your readers think the chapter worked well as written, and was consistent with Juniper's capabilities and character.
