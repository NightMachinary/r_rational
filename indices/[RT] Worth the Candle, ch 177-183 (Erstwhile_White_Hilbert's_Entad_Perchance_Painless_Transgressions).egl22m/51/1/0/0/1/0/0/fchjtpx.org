Well, yeah, but what happened was far-fetched too.

It's easy with hindsight to say "he should have grabbed the pipe", but if he'd grabbed the pipe and been captured that way, people would say "Joon had the idiot ball, while would he grab the pipe, the guy was obviously baiting him, he should have done X instead".

Point is, given that Joon didn't know what would happen in advance, and he had less than 10 seconds to react. It makes sense he wouldn't immediately guess the right answer.
