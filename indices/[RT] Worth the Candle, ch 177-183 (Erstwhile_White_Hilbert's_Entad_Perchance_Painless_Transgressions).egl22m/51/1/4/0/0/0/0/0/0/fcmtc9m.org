Air magic would be less politically costly than drawing a sword and making threats, and the odds of an entad being designed to knock out air mages is a lot lower than the odds of an entad doing something bad if it's used on you.

Now if it was an entad that triggered on air magic then

- Joon would have acted rationally since he's taking the most likely safe outcome.
- The sheer unlikelyness could have been explained by more DM railroading
- We get the same prison sequence.

It would be a superior way of writing this chapter.
