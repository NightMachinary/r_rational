Hindsight is 2020. The pipe could have been a distraction while Zinne pulled out the real trap or just an empty threat meant to provoke Juniper into revealing his hand or a clumsy attempt to attack one of his many many unknown defense easily countered and tipping the political negotiations in their favor or a setup for the next dumbest entad demonstration. Yarrow could have been blackmailed into making himself a target, someone publicly known for never backing down from a dare etc. This outcome was /overall/ much more improbable than a fight breaking out in the middle of Caledwich and causing a scandal which would have arguably been worse than what actually happened. Wanting the protagonist to be smart is one thing. Wanting them never to be wrong is quite another.
