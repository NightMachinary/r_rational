Don't worry about it - it's just negativity bias peeking its ugly head out. Even knowing it (like they say, knowledge â‰  immunity), I was disproportionately bothered despite recognizing the legitimate explanation. I think there's a complex cocktail of reasons for the spotlight - besides the contextual stuff I mentioned above, it's a moment that felt inevitable but readers still built up the anxiety of when/where/how and when it finally happens through a fluke and Joon's explicit failure to act, it's like an unsatisfying anticlimax. Readers are invested in Joon and, like passion mages, Joon's subsequent powerlessness and frustration might be getting channeled here.

Re: the 'mistake' - I think the interpretation of least resistance for us readers was a lack of caution. It's a high stakes situation where, if past episodes serve as a guide, there can never be enough paranoia. Besides, there's always a strong narrative preference of action over omission.

Now that you mention it, all the Caledwich entad references (fashion and function) were a really nice touch that sadly went over my head (but it's not too subtle, I just missed it). I don't think it's enough to beat out the other dissonance, but the high variability of entad i-F is also a pain in the ass to write around.

Anyway, sorry about the backseating and harping about details. I support not rewriting because it's not worth the drain on you mentally and time-wise. Maybe someday if/when this is getting published, someone more qualified than us can chime in.

Happy new year. Still in awe that we lucky few have more a million words worth of a great story. Thanks for the marvelous gift.
