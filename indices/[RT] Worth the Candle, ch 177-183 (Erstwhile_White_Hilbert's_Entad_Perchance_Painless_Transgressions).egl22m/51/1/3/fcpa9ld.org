I think people (myself included) are evoking the idiot ball not because it's completely unbelievable that Joon would have a moment of indecision based on political concerns or overconfidence in his own abilities, but rather it wasn't convincingly established in the text leading up to it. What [[/u/eaglejarl]] summarized is essentially a textbook drawback to the protagonist having too many options (specifically including many mental enhancements that are hard to quantify and fairly lend to overestimation). So while there are plausible defenses for Joon's oops moment, it still /feels/ like an unsatisfying idiot ball moment to a higher proportion of readers because expectations have been set and there's a lot of pressure on making every decision nigh unimpeachable. Whether this is fair on you, like we're setting you up to fail as some sort of Pygmalion effect, is debatable, but once you have a big enough audience, you'll naturally have readers who are liberal with backseat-gaming-ish calls of 'this decision was stupid, /nobody/ (i.e. me) would've done this'.

If I had to do an ass-pull probability distribution, it'd be heavily in eaglejarl's favor of Joon using one of his many non-lethal interventions, after weighing the choice points on both sides:

--------------

#+begin_quote
  +Characters don't get to realistically review their multiple choice answer in a split second(s).

  +Juniper has a preference and priority for resolving Mary's business non-violently.

  +Joon is confident in the confidence interval of effects that can affect him.

  +Joon wants the moral/legal high ground.

  +Yarrow outplayed Joon socially with the game.

  +Joon was conservative about leaking information versus the small range of effects that could incapacitate him.

  -Like [[/u/foveros]] said, the false dichotomy stuck out to me. In text, the exact moment is the line "I was, after all, threatening to end his life." Joon had a lot of magical options, but he also had simple choices. 'Fight or flight' doesn't usually mean 'kill or wait'.

  -In text, Yarrow was confrontational from the moment they entered = strong prior.

  -Joon/Raven just brought up the inevitability of narrative railroading in the previous chapter - where is Joon's appreciation for Murphy's Law in a world ruled by narrative?

  -Repeated narrative build-up of not letting enemies have the first move advantage.

  -Joon wasn't born in Aerb yesterday, nor was everyone else in the party. Joon is /the/ entad specialist, but all of the party are experienced and should have a healthy protocol for unknown entads (diffused responsibility during this entad-gun-cocking?). Personally I would've preferred gradual social cues during the game that Joon could've acted on before Yarrow 'blindsided' him with a slow-to-act but high i-factor entad.

  -Other points already raised above

In hindsight, the politics angle might've been a bit of a narrative trap that pigeonholed Joon into forgetting his priorities (value of his life).

But also in hindsight, I don't think this matters in the big picture - the following chapters were a great, immediate leg up and slaking the action drought made Joon's lapse a lot more forgettable. And thanks for slaking the actual chapter drought during the holidays! I really miss the days of a chapter every other day but the chunks have also helped with my reading habits now that I don't have a constant incentive to stay up-to-date.
