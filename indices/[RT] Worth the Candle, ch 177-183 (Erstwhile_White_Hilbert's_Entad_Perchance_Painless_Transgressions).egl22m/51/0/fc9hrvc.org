I didn't read it that way. June is aware of those other options:

  . I'd said no demonstrations, and I'd said that I would attack him, but I didn't know where to draw the line. Surely I would at least have to stop him if he tried to light the pipe. He stopped when the tobacco was in the pipe, looking it over, and then looked up at me. “Have you thought that from my perspective, letting my decisions be dictated by someone who pretends not to have any particular limits on what grievious violence he would inflict means that I would end up ruled by threats, even when those threats would never actually be carried out? It would be terrible policy.”

  I stood where I was and slowly drew my sword. I had other options, like trying to slice the entad from his hands, but he was right that this really wasn't what I was here to do.
#+end_quote

June's concern is that there is a good chance that the play in progress is that Yarrow's trying to provoke him into an aggressive move that would trigger safeguards from the castle robots, or generally have some reputational effects. Once his 'if you still try to do this after my threat, you must be malicious' argument is rebuffed by the 'yielding to threats is bad strategy, so I may attempt to do this even nonmaliciously' counterargument, he really is trapped in a situation which he can't defuse with his low socials.

.. though he probably could have just walked out - but that means abandoning Amaryllis.

Thus he gives permission for the demonstration:

#+begin_quote
  “Go ahead,” I said, with my sword drawn.
#+end_quote

Hoping to react fast enough if it is an attack.
