Chpt. 182: "dividing my tibula and fibula" -> "dividing my /tibia/ and fibula"

(though I'm not 100% sure how this would work -- a plane can't separate them, those bones are too [[https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/human-skeleton-highresolution-model-657a31ed9704423c8c4e752fb2506a74][knobby]] -- so are they being thoroughly disarticulated?)

maybe also the bit about the likeness monster (as I understand it, many taxonomists prefer terrestriality as a hallmark of Dinosauria, with Nessie is usually likened to plesiasaurs)
