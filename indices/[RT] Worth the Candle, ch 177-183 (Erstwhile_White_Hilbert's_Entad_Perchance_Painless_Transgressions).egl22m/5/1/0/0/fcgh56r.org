I'm still hoping the Doe's Twinned Souls is just straight up Druidism.\\
It'd make a lot of sense as a perk for bonding with a Locus, and would /really/ fuck with Joon because everyone knows he'd be a horrible Druid, while also being an important experience to learn from.

Then his challenge would be to grow powerful enough as a Druid to save the Locus with Solace, without accidentally stripping himself of his powers by cynicism and analysis.
