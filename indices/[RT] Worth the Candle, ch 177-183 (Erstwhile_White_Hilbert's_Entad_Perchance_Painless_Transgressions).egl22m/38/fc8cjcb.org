Went in expecting some peaceful diplomatic chapters. What a mess. lots of close calls there.

Just as I finished a reread, I have an idea from which I'm trying to build a coherent fan theory. Do you think the candle in the title could also refer to Candle of Invocation (mentioned by Joon while being drunk on unicorn blood), mirroring a specific method of divine ascension? Gating in the otherworldly evil being, and negotiating with it to grant wishes of both sides, one of the wishes is to repeat the process.

We also have a candle used to contact Uther, and a way to summon a creature of an unknown origin and power.
