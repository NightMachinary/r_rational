Consider the following:

- The name "Arthur" comes from Artorius, meaning "Son of the Bear". Arthur called himself Uther, father of Arthur, conceptually connecting himself to the Bear.

- Arthur has a large presence in conceptual space, and can manipulate his own presence therein and use it to fight other concepts. So these Kabbalah-style connections may be more than simple word games.

- The word "bear" simply means "brown". The proto-indo-european word for bear, "rkto", dissappeared from many nothern languages because people feared that speaking the bear's actual name would cause it to appear.

- Arthur has an entad which teleports him to the last person who spoke his name aloud.

- When Juniper first pumps up soul magic to 100, he notes that he can't change his true name, but that it used to be possible to do so. Arthur is history's greatest soul mage.

- Shia LaBeauf's ability to appear when his name is spoken is not part of the original RPG. Nor is it one of Juniper's inventions. It's something that /Arthur/ came up with.

- We don't actually know what the summoned Shia beast looks like. We do know that he wipes out all witnesses and can become arbitrarily strong to overcome obstacles.

- Arthur was noted to be able to pull new magic and abilities out of thin air to just barely overcome any obstacle thrown at him.

The conclusion is inescapable. Arthur became convinced that Aerb was not meaningfully real. In a desperate attempt to escape from the Narrative, he severed himself from the concept of Uther, changed his truename to Shia LaBeauf and now tries to wipe away all further evidence of his existence.
