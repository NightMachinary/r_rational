  “Yeah,” I replied. “Sorry you don't have anyone to talk library stuff with anymore.” “It's fine,” said Raven. “I just ... had some questions that I'll have to work out on my own.”

I feel bad for Raven here. She has someone who she can be friendly with, who can talk with her as an equal about a subject she likes, and he stripped himself of the ability.

Ink magic seems really, ridiculously strong. The raw effects are limited in a few ways, but just the ability to basically make entads with specific effects is great. As seen here, you can tailor items to counter specific strategies your enemy has prepared. And fighting against an ink mage must be a nightmare, since they could bring almost anything to the table. Creating synergies with existing entads seems absurdly good as well.

The fight, and all the stuff leading up to it, was glorious. Being super snarky about the pain stick, the method used to bypass the wards, "How did you get out?""Magic.", etc.

From Pallida's reaction to to Solace's impromptu osteoectomy, I realized that she is the [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightMan][Straight Man]] of the group. In spite of this character trait, she is a lesbian woman.

The ability to turn off pain seems like it would make induction into fire magic super easy.

For getting out, I think that Joon could use the connection with Amaryllis or Grak and temporarily boost their value of the Spine of the World and Tentar, ways that are obviously artificial and thus can send a message. If Amaryllis periodically heals her skin, Joon could write out more in scar tissue. Possibly, they could get two way communication by both altering her soul's image of her body and writing messages on the skin.

Rosemallow is the first Penndraig not to have red hair. I wonder if this has any significance, though I doubt it.
