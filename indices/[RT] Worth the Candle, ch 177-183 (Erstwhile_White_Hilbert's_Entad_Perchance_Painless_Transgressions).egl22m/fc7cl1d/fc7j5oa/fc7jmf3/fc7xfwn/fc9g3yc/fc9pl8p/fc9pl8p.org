I don't think it applies here. Juniper is pretty explicitly the only one capable of dealing with the Big Threats. If he dies because he didn't escalate against some petty spoiled princesses then everyone loses. Doing almost anything to maximize Juniper's success is worth it in the face of the extinction of all life on Aerb if he doesn't succeed.
