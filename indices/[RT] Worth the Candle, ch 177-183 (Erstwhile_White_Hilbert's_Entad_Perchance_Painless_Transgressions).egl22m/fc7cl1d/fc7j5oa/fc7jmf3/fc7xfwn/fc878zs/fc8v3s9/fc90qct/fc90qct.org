Yeah, except one of the duo explicitly confirmed that they were sent by Hyacinth and then they grabbed everyone but Raven. You know, /Uther's Knight/ Raven. It may not be enough to bring Hya to justice, but it's certainly something.

And then June returns, bloody and angry, and tells the exact same story (including the part about "Hya sent us"), even shows the site it happened at, if he manages to secure it. And everyone gets a message, don't fuck with June, he'll beat you without entads or magic, on your ground, after being tortured and with minimal preparation on his side. It's more powerful than "June can sense an obvious trap but can only respond with violence".
