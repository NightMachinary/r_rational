Well the duo did say that, but then Hyacinth says nuh uh and disavows all responsibility. It quickly becomes a game of he said she said that Juniper can't win being technically a fugitive and all.

I'm not sure sending a message helps at all or that one is even being sent here. Ideally details about how exactly Juniper escaped and slaughtered the facility don't get out because one of his biggest advantages is no one understands just how wide his power set is. What utility does sending a message even has for him? Short of being killed its pretty clear Hyacinth/Larkspur have never heard of the sunk cost fallacy. They just won't give up.
