That transition felt really strange. Not necessarily writing-wise; in-setting-wise. We went from a reasonable confidence that shit wouldn't be going down for plausible reasons to an immediate escalation to lethal force. There was no attempt to bribe, cajole, etc; there was no offer, even pro-forma or false, of comforts or of rewards for cooperation.

I'm sure we'll get reasonable, well, reasons for that, but it feels very strange as it stands.

(Also, Juniper does totally abuse his soulfuckery/spiritfuckery and I'm glad he got called out on it.)
