Mad conspiracy theory: Uther issued secret and complex orders to his robot army before disappearing, contents unknown. If Juniper had walked up to one and identified himself as Juniper and passed some verification checks, he could get admin privileges and become de facto ruler of a robot army in the heart of the Lost King's Court.

Anyways, excellent chapters. Holy shit I sympathise so much with Juniper by the end there.
