I'm honestly surprised he didn't just threaten to leave the guard dudes souls for the hells if they didn't surrender. Like there are references to the soul removing nails and he doesn't just go with i'll leave you all to suffer for all eternity? I mean as far as threats go i'd probably cave to that. Also i like how in the scant seconds that the surviving guards potentially have they spend it saving the other dead guards from the hells.
