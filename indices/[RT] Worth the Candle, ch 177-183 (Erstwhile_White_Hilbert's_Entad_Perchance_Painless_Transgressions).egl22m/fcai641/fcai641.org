these chapters were awesome!

I was laughing at the hotel thing, especially the elevators, and all the security measures the team took.

The whole prison sequence was awesome too. The solace thing really got me (I had to take a break right at that spot, which was bad luck for me.) (BTW, I'm glad you handled that "responsibly" by not leaving "solace died" as an end-chapter fake-out cliffhanger.) but I really enjoyed the breakout sequence with the Joon-Solace-Pallida team, which is a lineup we haven't seen yet. The "bad save point" sequence was sick too.

The whole soul thing was brilliant too - I'm guessing that Y and Z intended to put the group to sleep, check their souls, and then wake them up. They could claim it was a prank, which would give some plausible deniability, or they had some other means of covering their asses. It was the soul-trap then that caused everything to get fucked.
