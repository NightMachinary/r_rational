My thoughts on the Dumbest Entad:

In the moment, I didn't see a way out of the dilemma for Juniper. Doing anything disruptive is fundamentally a political error.

Until the reveal, I thought the joke was going to be a Ren√© Magritte special complete with "Ceci n'est pas une pipe"

This then leaves the possibility for it to be anything, including /nothing/.

After I was done reading, I did think of a third option, to just leave. Per previous points it would be weird, an overabundance of caution that would be presented as paranoia by any opposition.
