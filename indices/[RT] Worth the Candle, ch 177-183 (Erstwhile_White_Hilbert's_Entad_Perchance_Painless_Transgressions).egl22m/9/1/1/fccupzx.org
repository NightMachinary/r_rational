A solution was already shown to us. The wall of keys that moved to reveal more keys. The elevators could easily have a number pad and a display that gets bigger. Or even just shows only the last 10 digits, Or no display at all. Regardless, the elevators are still in some way infinite even if they don't have infinite buttons.

Its a good halting problem joke though! - the only way to check if the elevator stops is to run it, with grim results.
