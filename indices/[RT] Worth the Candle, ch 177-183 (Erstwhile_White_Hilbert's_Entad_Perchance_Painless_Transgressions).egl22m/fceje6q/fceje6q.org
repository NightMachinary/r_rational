This might be a weird detail to ask about, but what is "necrium" in your world?

Googling the term only spits out Hearthstone cards and discussion related to them. In Hearthstone it seems to be a chemical substance that allows one to experience all the positive effects of death without actually dying.

Googling it with "-hearthstone -warcraft" to exclude all that stuff then the only links left are literally the Twitch and Twitter accounts of a guy called Necrium.
