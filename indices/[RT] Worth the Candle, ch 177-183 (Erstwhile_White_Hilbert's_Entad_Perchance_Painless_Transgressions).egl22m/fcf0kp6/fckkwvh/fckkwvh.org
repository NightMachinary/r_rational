Cliff notes version of the last ~25 chapters:

Joon goes to the Atheneum of Sound and Silence to learn Still and Vibration magic. Harold the spirit magic thingy attacks the people of the city with the aid of an organization that wants the world to end. This happens as Joon is finishing his time in the temple that lets you learn still magic. Harold causes large numbers of people to form a summoning choir that immanentizes the Mome Rath. Fortunately, the Council of Arches murders Harold and the end-the-world people with the aid of the unkillable demihuman from Uniquities, but unfortunately, the Mome Rath is successfully summoned. In a really cool fight scene, Joon climbs up on the Mome Rath and uses blood and bone magic to massively debuff it, allowing Bethel to stab it to death. The tuunglings help with the cleanup. During the fight, Joon discovers the Still Magic capstone. When he tries to use the Jenner's eye tattoo to never have to sleep again (allowing him to keep Still Magic 100, and thus Prince's Invulnerability and the temporary soul magic skill buffs, up forever), the DM excludes Skin Magic to within a couple-hundred-mile-radius of the city.

The Council of Arches claims the Isle of Poran and dumps the tuunglings on it, declaring it the sovereign Republic of Miunun. Bethel rapes Joon, who straight up resorts to soul magic to deal with it. The rest of the Council of Arches decides that Bethel is a bit too evil for them, but Valencia figures out how to defuse the situation and left with Bethel to do counseling/therapy/teaching-how-to-be-a-valuable-non-sadistic-community-member on her/it.

The Isle of Poran is visited by dragons, who point out that Bethel violated a flight ceiling dictated by the Draconic Confederacy while fighting the Mome Rath. They want them to kill Blue-in-the-Bottle in two months. The Council of Arches has not made any progress on that front yet. Also, we are abrubtly informed of the Schlossvolk and the lengths that one has to go to to remember their existence for extended periods of time. Also, Joon's bipolar mom teaches him water magic, which is a weird depression metaphor. As you can probably tell, I did not like that update very much.

Via the Warrens, the Council of Arches goes to Anglecynn. Amaryllis's childhood diaries have been published by Rosemallow.

Then the chapters that have just been released.

Ongoing things that need to be taken care of: Blue-in-the-Bottle, Draconic diplomacy, getting a food source for Miunun, industrializing Miunun, Anglecynn political stuff (Rosemallow, Amaryllis's inherited stuff, Hyacinth), Schlossvolk (maybe; not urgent), perhaps some of the lingering fallout from the Mome Rath incident.
