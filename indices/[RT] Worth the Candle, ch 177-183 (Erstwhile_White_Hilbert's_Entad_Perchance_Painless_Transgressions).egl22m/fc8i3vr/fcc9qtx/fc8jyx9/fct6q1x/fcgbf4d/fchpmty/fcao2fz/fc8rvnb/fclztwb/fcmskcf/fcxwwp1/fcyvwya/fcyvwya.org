Except it vastly favors hyacinth. As we learned the bots will protect H and her people but A will not benefit if she's declared a fugitive from the law. It's not neutral if it's occupied by an opposing army, and is home terf for all hyacinths allies. It may be symbolically neutral, but Amy got played hard in terms of tactical considerations. Presumably she didn't think H would make an offensive move when she was there to negotiate surrender, but H has a temporary upper hand and also won't buy that the surrender on uneven terms is real, so must make her move.
