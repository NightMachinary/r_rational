I wonder how the Unicorn bone would've even interacted with the Pipe to be honest... You'd think that it'll work on basically any incapacitation, since it works on death, but Entads are fucky.

I'm also really not sure how limited his bone supply is. A normal horse has 205 bones, though some might be too big to carry or use in most situations (unless they can cut them? even bigger supply then), and Joon should be one of very few people on Aerb that can use Unicorn bones so they might be able to buy older ones.

Well, as they say, hindsight is 2020 - so have a happy new year.
