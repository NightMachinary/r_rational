  That seems like hindsight bias?

  "Of course Joon shouldn't rely on stilling magic, it's his most powerful magic, of course the DM is going to set up an ambush that can bypass it!"

Didn't they literally mention that in-universe? I could've sworn they did, around the time they realized he's untouchable as long as he doesn't sleep. Maybe that was more about Prince's, but my main point here is about preemptive expectations and acting ahead of time.

I'm not as gung-ho about the whole "BAD WRITING! TERRIBLE JOON! OOC!" thing as some of the people here, but I /did/ still expect better of the team from this situation - not because of masterful 30-second reasoning, but because they're the kind of group that thinks these things through and prepares for situations like these.

It's the entire reason he even /has/ a "Panic Set" on his vambrace, which he never used while panicking yet.\\
It's not about selecting one right answer out of a dozen, it's about readying every single tool available that wouldn't have too big a downside when threatened. Protocols and all that jazz.

I'm not trying to ask for the impossible, or to complain about every failure, but I just want to see all of their frequent anxious deliberations and preparation pay off in /action/ instead of just in foreshadowing and thoughts.

It's especially painful in this exact scenario, when he /did/ realize it in advance but didn't act on it in any meaningful way. Reminds me of the hallway with armored statues in the prison, except there's no sobering "I Told You So" here, just torture.

I was a bit disappointed is all, but I can accept that plans aren't perfect and that's just how things went down this time. I just hope this isn't going to be washed away and ignored in the next batch of chapters - I want both this mishandling of the Yarrow incident, and Joon's reckless / semi-suicidal charge against an entrenched Warder to be acknowledged and learned from.

*TL;DR* - They know the rails are there to an extent, but if they keep reacting to them after the turns already happen it's going to get very tiring very fast.
