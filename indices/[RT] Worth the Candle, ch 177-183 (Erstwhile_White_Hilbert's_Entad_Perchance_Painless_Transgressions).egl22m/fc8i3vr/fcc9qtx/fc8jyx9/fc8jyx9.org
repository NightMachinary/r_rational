I think June's dilemma wasn't necessary between lethal force and allowing the entad use; it was between behaving aggressively (taking the pipe away or stilling people would definitely count), and allowing an unknown entad use. He took a risk, not wanting to compromise their negotiating position.

I believe stilling folks would still be an assault that would cause the guardians to escalate.
