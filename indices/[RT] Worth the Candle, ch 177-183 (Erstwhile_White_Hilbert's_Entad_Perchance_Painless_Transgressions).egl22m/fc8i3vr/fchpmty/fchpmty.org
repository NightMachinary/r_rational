I agree entirely. The way Joon got hit by that pipe made no sense.

The moment Yarrow refused to stop his demonstration Joon should have hit them both with still magic, used passion magic telekenesis to snatch the pipe, or something.

A much more logical way would be for Joon to have been captured would be for them to have setup various wards and defences, and for the pipe magic to blast them through the wall and through their wards. It's still GM-railroading, but it would keep the railroading outside of Joon's head.
