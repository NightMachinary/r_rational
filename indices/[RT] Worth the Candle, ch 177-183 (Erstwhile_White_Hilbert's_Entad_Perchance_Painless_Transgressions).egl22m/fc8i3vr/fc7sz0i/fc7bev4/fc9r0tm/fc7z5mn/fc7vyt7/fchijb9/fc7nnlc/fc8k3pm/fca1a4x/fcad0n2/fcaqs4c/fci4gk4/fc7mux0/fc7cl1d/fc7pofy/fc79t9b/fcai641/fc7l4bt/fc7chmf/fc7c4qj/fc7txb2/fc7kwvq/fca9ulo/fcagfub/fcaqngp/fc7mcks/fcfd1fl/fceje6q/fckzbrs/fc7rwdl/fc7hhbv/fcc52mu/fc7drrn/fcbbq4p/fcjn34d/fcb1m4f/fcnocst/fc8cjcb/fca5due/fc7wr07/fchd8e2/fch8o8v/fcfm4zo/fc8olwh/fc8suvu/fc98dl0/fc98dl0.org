It's not stupidity, but I think he's been getting burnt out and reckless throughout book 6. Like, peace wasn't an option there, but he was running head first into suicidal fights instead of even trying to work up a plan, or look for his gear.

By the end he's treating it like a video game and doesn't seem to see the guards as real people. His first thought is to start soul fucking the survivors instead of talking to them, then he mutilates them, and by the end of it his friends are having an "are we the baddies?" moment.
