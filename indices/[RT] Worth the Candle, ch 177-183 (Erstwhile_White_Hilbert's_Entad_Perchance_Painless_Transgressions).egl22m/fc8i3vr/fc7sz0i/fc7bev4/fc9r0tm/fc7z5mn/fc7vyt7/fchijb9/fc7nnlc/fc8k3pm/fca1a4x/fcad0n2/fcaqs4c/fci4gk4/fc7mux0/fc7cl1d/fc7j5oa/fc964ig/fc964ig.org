Good toughts!

I wonder if the "predictive magic" of Rosemallow is Tree Magic (as in, assigning probabilities to branches of possible futures, the thinking being that if Earth Wilson Scores are about probabilities, there's an higher than average probability that Aerb Wilson Score are too), and if so, what it would take for Juniper to learn it from her. Although I have no idea what it would do to give the protagonist predictive magic...
