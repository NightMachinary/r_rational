I do agree that it's much more of a writing failure than anything else, particularly in capturing Juniper's mental state and priorities, and it's unfortunate that for a lot of people, the only takeaway from ~45K words is that one moment. It /is/ meant to be a mistake, just not in the sense that some readers are taking it, i.e. a lack of caution.

I think another part of the problem, from a writing perspective, is that Juniper's gut reaction is right-in-hindsight, which people will find unsatisfying. It should be clear why Juniper made the threats that he did, and also why, when that threat failed, he decided that he couldn't follow through with it. I don't know that this is clear enough in the text right now. Unfortunately, there's also the question of taking some weaker preventative actions, which muddle the issue, and which I didn't (and don't) think would actually strengthen the chapter, except insofar as they would /maybe/ help avoid these kinds of reactions/conversations.

I probably won't be rewriting the scene to help clarify Juniper's thoughts, partly because I detest the backseating (as opposed to discussion of how and why characters make the choices they do) and don't want to even remotely encourage it, and partly because I doubt that I could write a replacement that would actually satisfy both me and the people who are complaining.

(Regarding unknown entads ... there are a lot of them, and part of the reason that Heath/Aster/Basil make an appearance, other than to flesh out the court, provide exposition, demonstrate conflict avoidance through threat, set up some future stuff, etc. is to help show that entads are very common and expected. Yarrow himself is wearing obvious entad armor of unknown function, which has /hopefully/ been shown as the norm, given several examples. Juniper himself is wearing four or five visibly: you can't treat every entad whose function you don't know as inherently dangerous and/or a threat. There /is/ reason to here, obviously, and especially after the fact, but that has to be weighed against the fact that everyone is carrying unknown entads all the time.)
