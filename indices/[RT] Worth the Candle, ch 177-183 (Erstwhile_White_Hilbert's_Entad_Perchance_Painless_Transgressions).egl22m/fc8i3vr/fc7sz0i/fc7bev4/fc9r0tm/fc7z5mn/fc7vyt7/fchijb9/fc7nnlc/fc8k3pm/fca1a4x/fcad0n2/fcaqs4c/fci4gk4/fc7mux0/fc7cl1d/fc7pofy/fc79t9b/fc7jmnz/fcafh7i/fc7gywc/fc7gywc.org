#+begin_quote
  "It was also entirely possible that the trams were some variety of magic, with all the obvious-after-five-minutes problems whisked away without much real effort "
#+end_quote

Not sure this sentence makes sense? It implies that the problems are whisking away the magic, while I imagine you intended the reverse.

#+begin_quote
  "Rosemallow herself looked the same as ever, as though she hadn't aged a day, though for her, it had only been a handful of months."
#+end_quote

Third comma is unnecessary.

#+begin_quote
  "Juniper was given only brief focus, and Amaryllis stonewalled any questions about Raven, whose presence there was no way of adequately explaining."
#+end_quote

Perhaps 'had no adequate explanation' instead?
