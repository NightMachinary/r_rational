I think that can be safely assumed to be a consequence of "entads are bullshit". I can't remember if it was in the story or the worldbuilding doc that it gets mentioned, but some entads, while based on known magics, don't interact with other magic the same way.

I agree it feels a little narratively unsatisfying that Still Magic 100 got no-selled so hard by a mid-tier mook with a trinket, but they had just discussed how the DM was likely to railroad them into conflict no matter what decisions they made.
