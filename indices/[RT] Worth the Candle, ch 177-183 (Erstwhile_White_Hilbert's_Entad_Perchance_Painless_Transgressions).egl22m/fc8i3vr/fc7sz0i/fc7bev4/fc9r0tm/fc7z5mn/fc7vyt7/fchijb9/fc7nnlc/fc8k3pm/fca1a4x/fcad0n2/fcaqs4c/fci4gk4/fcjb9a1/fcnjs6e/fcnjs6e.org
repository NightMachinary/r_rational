Well, that's the thing! It's all definitely internally consistent in retrospect, but it's still very laser-focused bad luck that they used the pipe dream instead of address binder on Joon. Like a tabletop RPG I remember playing in once where another player's PC had the weakness "debilitating phobia of the number 37", and naturally the game master had him "randomly" run into someone wearing a hat with the number 37 on it. The player was, arguably rightfully, annoyed that the game master hadn't, say, rolled a d100 to determine the number.
