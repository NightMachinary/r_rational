It's insufficient. It was clearly an attack from a hostile agent, he should have done exactly one of those things. Either snuff the lighter with magic, or leave the room, then rescue the others after the fact if necessary. At the least shielding himself somehow. The fact that no one reacted was plot induced idiot ball to get to the jailbreak scenes...which honestly is forgivable. They were fun and exciting. It just could have been all circumvented if the guy had been more subtle about it. Why call so much attention to his attack in the first place?
