I feel like given this answer Joon's actions make even less sense than they did when I read the chapter.

If Joon's worried about the political consequences of his actions, drawing his sword and threatening to kill a prince is far far far more politically costly than half the actions on eaglejarl's list. Walking over and taking the pipe (or the lighter if he's worried about touching an entad) out of his hands would be better politically and practically.

He's already got a bunch of political capital from being threatened with an unknown entad; no matter how much Yarrow tries to play it of as a joke we've just had a couple of chapters making it very clear that paranoia is institutional an court politics. Politically speaking that pipe was taking out a gun in what should have been diplomatic talks, Joon was well within his rights to take it and put it on a table then demand concessions for being threatened.
