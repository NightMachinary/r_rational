What felt frustrating when reading the scene was that Joon said, "If you use an unknown entad around me I'll stop you" and then just.. doesn't do it. That's what feels like railroading.

If there had been a paragraph where he pointed out he's bluffing, won't stop the prince for political reasons, and is confident in his ability to resist any harmful effects, then it would be fine.

The problem isn't taking suboptimal actions, the problem is pointing out the right-in-hindsight action and then not taking it for unclear reasons.
