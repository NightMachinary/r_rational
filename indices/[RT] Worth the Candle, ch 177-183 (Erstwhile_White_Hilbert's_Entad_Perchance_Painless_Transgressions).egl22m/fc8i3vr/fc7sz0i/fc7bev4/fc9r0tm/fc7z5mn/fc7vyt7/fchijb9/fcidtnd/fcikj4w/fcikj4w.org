Oh yeah, I had the same reaction.

Like, the very reason Joon is in trouble with the fuzz is because he broke draconic law while almost single-handedly murdering an antimemetic kaiju.

Every single one of these people can murder you in less than 10 seconds, and the only reason they don't is that it would be slightly inconvenient politically to break guest truce, which you're about to blatantly violate.

Reminds me of PGtE, where for a while Catherine's greatest obstacle was the sheer amount of people willing to piss her off despite what common sense, self preservation and basic pattern-matching would suggest.
