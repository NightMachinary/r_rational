On the flip side, Joon's party seems really flippant about letting random guards go to hell.

Like, when Solace does her "harvest you body for armor" bit, nobody comments that /maaaaaybe/ they should check if one of the guards has a spiked bottle in their bag, before the bodies lose their soul.

Kind of seems like something mercenaries and spec ops units would learn as part of professional courtesy.
