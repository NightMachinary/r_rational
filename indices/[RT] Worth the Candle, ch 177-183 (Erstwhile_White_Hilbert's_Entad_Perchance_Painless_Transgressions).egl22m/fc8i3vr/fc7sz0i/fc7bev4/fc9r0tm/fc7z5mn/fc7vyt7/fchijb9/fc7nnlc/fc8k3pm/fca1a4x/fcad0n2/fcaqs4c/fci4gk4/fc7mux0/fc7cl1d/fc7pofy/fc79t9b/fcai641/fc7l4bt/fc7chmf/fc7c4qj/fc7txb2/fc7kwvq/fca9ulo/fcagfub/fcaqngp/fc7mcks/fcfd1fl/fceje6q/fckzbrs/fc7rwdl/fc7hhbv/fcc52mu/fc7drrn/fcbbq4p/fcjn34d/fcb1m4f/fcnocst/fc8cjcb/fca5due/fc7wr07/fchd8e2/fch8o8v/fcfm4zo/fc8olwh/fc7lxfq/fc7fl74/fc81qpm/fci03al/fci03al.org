When they were escaping the prison, Joon was acting very rash and violently. Both of his companions pointed it out.

What if it as a deeper trap, and he was supposed to break out and murder all the guards? They already messed with his mind, using poison or some entad, and they had some way to record everything.

It won't look good at all for them or Amaryllis if his actions are revealed to the public or to the government.
