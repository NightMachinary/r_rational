The naming is probably just coincidence, as it's "necro-" (meaning death) and "-ium", which you use for, uh, abstract nouns. I don't have a working knowledge of Latin, and Aerb doesn't actually use Latin either, it uses a different precursor language that was originally a conlang created by a small but intellectually influential nation of canine Animalia.

On Aerb, necrium is the poop of a now-extinct magical creature. Necrium's chief property is that it starts quite soft and hardens with exposure to the (now excluded) necrotic field effect, which is found most commonly when things died. Hence, working with necrium is incredibly difficult, as it needs to be worked absent any deaths of higher animals within a fairly wide range. Once finished being worked, it can be exposed to NFE and will continue to harden with more NFE exposure with no upper limit (except the practical limits of creating NFE exposure), which is useful in a wide variety of applications. As the magical creature that creates necrium is extinct and the NFE is excluded, it's impossible to make anything out of necrium except via e.g. finding an unworked and hardened supply and then using exotic carving methods.
