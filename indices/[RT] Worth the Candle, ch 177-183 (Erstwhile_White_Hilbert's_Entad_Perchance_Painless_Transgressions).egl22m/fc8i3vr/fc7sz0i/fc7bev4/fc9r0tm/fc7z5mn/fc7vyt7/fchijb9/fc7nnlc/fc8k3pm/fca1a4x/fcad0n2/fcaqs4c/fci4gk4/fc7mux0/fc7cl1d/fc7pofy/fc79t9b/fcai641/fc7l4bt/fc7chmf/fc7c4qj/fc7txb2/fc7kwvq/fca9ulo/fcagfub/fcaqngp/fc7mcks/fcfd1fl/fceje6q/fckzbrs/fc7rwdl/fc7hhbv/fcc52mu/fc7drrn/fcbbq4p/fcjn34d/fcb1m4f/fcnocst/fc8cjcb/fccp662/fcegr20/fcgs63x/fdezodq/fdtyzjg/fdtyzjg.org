Decided to reread the story recently and found this little gem in ch.26: " Strangely, and as one of the grand and impossible things that Uther had made his stock and trade, he had untethered himself from his stockpile [of entads] before his long trip ..."

The man found a way to unbind himself from heirloom entads, which are bound to a person by their identity. One possible way to do that would be to change the name on his character sheet.
