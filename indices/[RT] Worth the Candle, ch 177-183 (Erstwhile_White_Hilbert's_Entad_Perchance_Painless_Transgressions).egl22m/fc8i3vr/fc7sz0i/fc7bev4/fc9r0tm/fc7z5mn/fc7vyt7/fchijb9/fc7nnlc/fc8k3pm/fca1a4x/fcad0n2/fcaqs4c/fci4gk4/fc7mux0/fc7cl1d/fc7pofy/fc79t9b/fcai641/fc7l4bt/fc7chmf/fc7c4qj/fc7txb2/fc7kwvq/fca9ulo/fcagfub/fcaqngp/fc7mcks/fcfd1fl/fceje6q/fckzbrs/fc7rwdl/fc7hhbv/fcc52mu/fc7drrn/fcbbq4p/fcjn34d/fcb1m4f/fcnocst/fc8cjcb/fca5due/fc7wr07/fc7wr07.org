What a fucking rollercoaster set of chapters holy hell. I can only imagine how pissed Juniper must be feeling cause I echoed that sheer rage in what was happening to him. Hell I thought he was playing too nice. No mercy for any of these scumfucks. Every single one of the survivors should have their souls brutally mutilated then be murdered once it's expedient. They were attacked on neutral ground during peace talks, as far as I'm concerned the enemy deserves no mercy. I understand why Juniper hesitated but fuck when I just imagine Yarrow's smug face as he sets up his stupid joke before trying to kidnap and soulfuck Juniper unprovoked I lose any compassion for anyone associated with them. Should have just gone with Juniper's suggestion ages ago and just burned the Lost King's Court to the ground.

Great chapters!
