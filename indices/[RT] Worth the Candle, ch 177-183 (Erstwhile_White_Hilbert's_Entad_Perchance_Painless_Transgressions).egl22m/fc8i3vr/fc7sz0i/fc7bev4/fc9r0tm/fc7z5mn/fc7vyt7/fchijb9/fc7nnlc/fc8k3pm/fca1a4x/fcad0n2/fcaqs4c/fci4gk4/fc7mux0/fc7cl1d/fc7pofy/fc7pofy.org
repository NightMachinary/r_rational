So, for those of you who aren't deep into the details of D&D 3.5 splatbook efficiency rankings, "Monkey Grip" is a /phenomenal/ condescending nickname. [[https://dnd.arkalseif.info/feats/complete-warrior--61/monkey-grip--1978/][Monkey Grip]] is a feat (basically a special character option) that allows you to increase the size of your preferred weapon for a -2 penalty on attack rolls. The typical use would be for a human sized fighter who specializes in something like two-handed greatswords to wield an /ogre-sized/ two-handed greatsword.

Thematically, this is anime as fuck. /Mechanically/, you're burning a feat to go from a base 2d6 damage to 2d8 damage at the cost of a -2 malus to attack rolls - an average increase of 2 damage on a successful hit. This is a trap feat. Even the basic feat [[https://dndtools.net/feats/players-handbook-v35--6/power-attack--2208/][Power Attack]] will turn the same -2 malus to hit into +4 damage, while also being a prerequisite for a ton of other feats and prestige classes, some of which scale even higher, and which can be toggled on or off as circumstances demand. Going this route also means you don't have to specialize in "comically oversized weapons" which are both harder to come by as well as inviting derogatory comments about your barbarian's sexual insecurities.

This means that the guy with Monkey Grip is either a noob fool tricked by something sub-optimal that looks cool, or an NPC adversary that the DM can give a powerful weapon without worrying about what happens when a player picks it up (because it's too damn big for anyone in the party to actually use it).
