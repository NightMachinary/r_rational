I like these occasional fights where Joon gets to go through "ordinary" combatants like a thresher, and they just stand around looking dumbfounded at the end. You have a knack for making them happen just often enough to reinforce Joon's incredible powers, without doing them so often they become masturbatory (especially since, in this case, the fight was the climax to a situation where enemies efficiently put Joon out of commission and in an extremely threatening position.)
