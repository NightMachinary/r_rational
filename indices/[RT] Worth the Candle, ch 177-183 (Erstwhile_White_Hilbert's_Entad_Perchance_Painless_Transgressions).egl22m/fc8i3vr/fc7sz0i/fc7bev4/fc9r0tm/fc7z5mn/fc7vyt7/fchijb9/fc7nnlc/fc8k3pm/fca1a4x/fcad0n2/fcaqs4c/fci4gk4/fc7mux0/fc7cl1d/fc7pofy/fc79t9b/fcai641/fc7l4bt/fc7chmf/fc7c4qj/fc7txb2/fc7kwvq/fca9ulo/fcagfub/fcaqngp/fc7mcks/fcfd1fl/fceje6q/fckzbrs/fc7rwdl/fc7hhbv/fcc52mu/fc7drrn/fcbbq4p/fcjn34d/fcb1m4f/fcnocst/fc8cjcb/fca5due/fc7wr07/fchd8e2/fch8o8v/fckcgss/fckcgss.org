I'm on team "everything is easier in hindsight, and people who try to do the rational thing in the moment still screw up sometimes." But to try to dig down a little deeper here:

Because this was to a large extent a socially oriented con, which isn't really playing to Juniper's strengths. Because he was under time pressure, and he came up with a potential solution quickly and then got a bit fixated on the dilemma between using that solution or letting Yarrow proceed. I think in Juniper's mind the two choices of what was happening was innocuous or serious attempt at attack, and maybe it was hard to dial down to more moderate responses when any response at all is acting on the belief that there's a serious attack underway.

But mainly I'm going with hindsight bias and time pressure.
