the latter would have been brandishing a weapon against an imperial prince in a room with armatures during intense negotiations on hallowed ground, the former would have been the smart move but realistically resulted in the same as Zinne and Yarrow would have accurately claimed that a guy threatening to kill you and then rushing towards you is grounds for self-defence
