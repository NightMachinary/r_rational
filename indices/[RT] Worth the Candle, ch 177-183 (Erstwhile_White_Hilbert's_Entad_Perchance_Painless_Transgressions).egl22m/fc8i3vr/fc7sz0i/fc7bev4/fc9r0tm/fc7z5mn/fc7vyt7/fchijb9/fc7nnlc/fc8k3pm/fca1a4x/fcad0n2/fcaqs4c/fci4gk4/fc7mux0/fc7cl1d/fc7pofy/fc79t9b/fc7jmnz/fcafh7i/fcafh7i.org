The Armateurs are introduced twice, with overlapping exposition. Once in Rosemallow's house

#+begin_quote
  A suit of armor was half-hidden against one wall, which I might have dismissed as more ostentatious decoration if Amaryllis hadn't already clued me in. It was actually an automaton, one made by an entad that had been churning them out at a sedate pace for five hundred years. The Armateur would follow some simple directions and had its own version of the Three Laws, though those laws only applied to Penndraigs rather than all humans.

Once in the castle.

  The Armateurs were entad-made, churned out by an entad that could make one every month or so. I had seen one back at Erstwhile Manor, but it was just one, and here there were lots of them. They were robots, or a magical equivalent to them, without all that much intelligence. In physical appearance, they were like suits of armor, but with limbs and torsos that were so slender they couldn't possibly have held a person. Each had a long, thin sword that was part of their construction, which they would use when they were ordered to, or when something in their internal logic dictated they should. When Amaryllis began describing their rules, I immediately recognized them as Asimov's Three Laws, though adapted so that ‘human' was replaced with ‘Penndraig' (not that ‘human' would have been that much less problematic in a world like Aerb's).
