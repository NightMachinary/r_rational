After several more dialogue/planning oriented chapters, it was nice to get a solid fight scene! (Not that I don't enjoy the slower chapters as well, but I think the higher action chapters round out the pacing). It was nice to see Juniper getting better at leveraging all of his skills, but he still has room for improvement, especially with multi magic synergies and passion magic.

I am ready for Juniper just to take a sword to the Penndraig royalty...

Juniper should use the dead people's bodies for bone magic.

Did anyone think the lack of publication of the Diary in the library indicates clear DM shenanigans? (Long term world building stuff is fine, hints at individual future plot lines are not)

So for those of you who have been theorizing about Amaryliss's resemblance to Dahlia possibly indicating that she is a entad created clone or deaged version of her (perhaps made for purposes of maintaining Entad inheritance), how does the latest reveals about the politicking of Rosemallow vs Hyacinth factor into that?
