There's also the counterfactual case: the entad could in fact have been dumb and harmless. In this case, the point of the bluff is to get Juniper to react aggressively to gain some kind of leverage in the negotiations. Granted, one could probably press the point that entad use is aggressive in itself, but then he'd be pressed on how he knew it was an invested entad and not a pretty gewgaw. That could cascade into revealing that he's a powerful soul mage prettily quickly, and that probably doesn't leave him in a good place, either.
