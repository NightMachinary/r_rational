  I.e. Yarrow has a feasible reason for wanting to demonstrate despite the threat
#+end_quote

I disagree, Yarrow's reason is the exact opposite of feasible. He's in the middle of low trust high stakes negotiations with a potentially hostile foreign power. Any competent diplomat would know that taking out an entad in this situation will be taken as a hostile action, doubly so because he's been asked not to.

What's more a competent diplomat will know that whoever he's negotiating with will know that a prince will know all that; so when he's seen taking out the entad he cannot claim it's just a game or anything like that.

So Yarrow has basically pulled out a gun, Joon reacts appropriately given those circumstances - a warning of violence but no actual violence, and Yarrow's logic was that because he's threatened he has to continue acting hostilely in the middle of a tense negotiation.

It's basically playground level logic.
