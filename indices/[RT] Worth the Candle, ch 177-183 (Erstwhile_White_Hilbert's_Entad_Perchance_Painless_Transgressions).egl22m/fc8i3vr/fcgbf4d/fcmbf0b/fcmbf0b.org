This is the same Juniper who walked into a room of statues and said “these will animate and kill us” and his party went “nah” and then the statues animated and tried to kill them. I call BS. It's the most egregious idiot ball in the whole story now. And let's not forget /all of his other skilled and experienced party members/ who have no input or action or reaction, despite everyone knowing they were in enemy territory and that it wasn't really neutral ground.
