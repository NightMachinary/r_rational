In Joon's defense, there was a whole list of factors than made the attack less probable in his mind, the place being a sanctuary and zero violence prior to that. The political setting OTOH added penalties to any unprovoked violence. And yes, the sleep attack was the DM bs. If you put it in gaming terms, Joon got noscoped lololol 420. You don't expect being noscoped without descending into paranoia.

Reimer and his rogue are slightly vindicated.
