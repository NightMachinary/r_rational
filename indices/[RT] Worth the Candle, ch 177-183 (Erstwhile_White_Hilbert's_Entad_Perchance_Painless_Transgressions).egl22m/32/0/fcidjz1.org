She might have intended for Yarrow to engage in a quick peak and subtle manipulation of Joon's soul, only for Raven to be immune to the sleep, forcing one escalation in that they had to make it a brief kidnapping and then Yarrow to be rendered catatonic making Zinnia decide to escalate even further.

A scenario with Hyacinth turning on Zinnia and Yarrow (and possibly Onion) seems plausible, but I think it would be less she flips in favor of Juniper and more she scapegoats and backstabs Zinnia/Yarrow/Onion.
