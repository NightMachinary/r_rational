It'd be interesting to have reliability as an additional dimension. For example, Region A has moderate-power magic that's absolutely reliable, like mundane-physics conservation-of-momentum your-EMDrive-is-a-stupid-hoax reliable. Region B has higher-power magic that works unreliably but doesn't fail catastrophically, like if you try to enchant a sword with special properties, sometimes you use up the reagents to no effect, and sometimes it works (and maybe imbued properties are then reliable, or maybe not). And Region C has very powerful magic that can fail catastrophically. Which region is the most valuable? It's not clear. This is more interesting to me than a one-dimensional continuum.

(Fire had this a little, where high tech in low zones would flake out and then fail, but not in the way I'm thinking.)

As in the Zones, meta-powers would be extremely valuable. Artifacts or spells affecting power, reliability, or some other property could be used for all sorts of trickery. It would be especially interesting to bootstrap a magical zone, or have a self-propagating spell that can enter an ordinarily mundane area.

The Ethshar series by Watt-Evans (of which I've read The Misenchanted Sword and The Unwilling Warlord, recommended by EY) features multiple sources of magic. At least one, warlocks, have a location dependency (major plot point in Warlord). Very much worth reading.
