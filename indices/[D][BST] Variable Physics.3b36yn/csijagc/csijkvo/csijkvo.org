I think so, but I'm open to not having that be the case. Right now, I kind of think of it like:

- If you have a magic sword, it's not going to work in a non-magical place. If it's been built well, it will shut itself down and then reactivate itself when back in a place with magic. If it's been built poorly, it will catastrophically fail.

- You can use magic to make a better non-magical item. This provides some trade from high-magic places to low-magic (or no magic) places. The exchange would probably be for labor-intensive things that can't be accomplished through magic, in the same way that we outsource telephone support to India.

(And to clarify, "magical sword" can mean a lot of things. Maybe it's only got the equivalent of a +1 bonus; lighter than it should be, well-balanced in a supernatural way that compensates for a lack of skill or makes it a superb fighting weapon for an experienced soldier. Or maybe it's a literally made of lasers, cuts through steel like butter, can be summoned in a handful of heartbeats, and deflects arrows and lightning bolts without conscious thought. Ideally, the underlying physics that govern the setting allow for both types to exist at different "levels", and the super awesome sword could in theory be built to degrade gracefully as the underlying reality changes.)
