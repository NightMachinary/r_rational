Not sure that this setting is the place for it, but "DRM as magic system" just got added to my ideas scratch pad.

Region-locking is fairly straightforward, but you could have limited-license spells that can only be used concurrently by a handful of people, or magic items that bind to specific people like a disc that you can't play on your friend's CD player. Demons with EULAs. Needs some narrative parallel though ...
