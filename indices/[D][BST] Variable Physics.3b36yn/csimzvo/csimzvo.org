One way to do it: Invert the "topology" idea, and instead of having "mana peaks" and "mana valleys", you've got an underlying topology that shapes the manaflow, and mana flows down. You've got a mana cycle, metaphysical weather, occasional droughts or floods, but in general, the "mountain ranges" are low-magic, the "lowlands" are fairly low-magic, but studded with areas of high magic and mana "rivers", and the "lakes" are the high-magic qutopias. The effects leak through in such a way that actual physical elevation doesn't make much difference... and sometimes, there are storms.
