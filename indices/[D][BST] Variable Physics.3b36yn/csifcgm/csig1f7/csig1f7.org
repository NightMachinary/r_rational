That sounds interesting; let me know if you can recall the name. I've seen quite a few places where physics changes from one "world" to another, or where physics changes over time, but physics changing based on location seems far more rare.

One of the things that I really liked about /A Fire Upon the Deep/ was that it read as sort of a travelogue, and that's definitely a feeling that I wanted to replicate; go from one kingdom to the next, and all the sudden there are werewolves. Go further, and there are dragons flying through the sky.
