There's a novel I've been struggling to recall the name of for the past ten minutes where the gimmick was that [[#s][spoiler]]. It was set on a huge tower where the highest parts had a very small value and all kinds of post-singularity stuff worked, as you moved down the tower the highest level of technology that worked was simpler and more primitive. Moving from one zone to another was painful but possible for biologicals, because they were "soft" and could handle slight shifts at the atomic level. Devices with small components physically broke or fused. Down on the plains the zones actually moved, like weather.

So there's something to be said for having multiple boundaries. You could escape an avenging spirit by crossing out of a high magic zone, but now your flying carpet is just a rug and your seven league boots barely manage hundred yard steps.

I wouldn't have wastes where life itself didn't work... just drop back to the level where you're in the mundane world with no magic. Maybe have other high lands, other mountains, where other kinds of magic hold sway.
