Since the region-locking was mentioned, there's a trope when magic is actually remnants of sufficiently advanced technology in a postapocalyptic world. In this interpretation, "levels of magic" can be an actual region-locking from the future (even now we have industrial equipment with GPS locks). Sufficiently advanced DRM is indistinguishable from variable physics?
