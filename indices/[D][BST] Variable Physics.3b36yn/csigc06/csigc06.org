A variable-magic setting like you describe could easily result in fascinating story possibilities. While concentric circles give you a story-point in having an epicentre, I think overall it's more interesting to have a greater deal of irregularity. Something like a magical elevation map. You may have large countrysides that are relatively "flat" in terms of the effectiveness of magic, while other areas have innumerable strange and steep boundaries, making things rather treacherous.

So a fade-type system would be better than a sharp cutoff, so long as the fade's steepness was also variable. There could easily be areas with a steep enough fade to be a cutoff for most purposes. You end up with both a fade and a cutoff available, depending on what works better for your story in a certain region.

The development of civilization in such a setting could give interesting views on the incentives of living in one area versus another. In high-magic nations, magical healing for sickness would be available, and generally the standard of living would probably be much higher. On the other hand, in low-magic nations, the peasants wouldn't have to fear invading lich necromancers or marauding dragons, both of which would either fade or die if they tried to head into a region with magic levels too low to sustain them.

It would also be difficult for a high and a low-magic nation to war with each other. A low-magic nation trying to launch an attack would find itself unable to breach magical defenses. A high-magic nation would need its military to be mainly geared towards combat with its more dangerous magical rivals, and would be inexperienced at fighting using only mundane means. A small high-magic zone within a larger low-magic region could become an unassailable fortress, while similarly a small low-magic zone within a high-magic region would be a risky place to venture. A high-magic nation might have other options though, such as massive magical cannons launching mundane projectiles into a low-magic area, or simply a higher population and army compared to low-magic kingdoms due to magical farming.

Regarding magical items, at first glance the best way to handle things might be a unidirectional fade. Items brought to lower-magic areas compared to where they were created lose their power until returned to a higher-magic area. However lower-magic items do not rise in power when brought to high-magic regions. This way those rare few magic items in the low-magic regions can remain prized and valuable in their home regions.

I mentioned the idea of highly-magical creatures like dragons finding it dangerous or lethal to head into lower-magic areas. In turn, perhaps humans might also find themselves requiring some minimum threshold of magical elevation to survive, with regions even they cannot safely enter due to a lack of the miniscule magic levels needed to sustain them. Similarly, there might be regions of such unusually high magic levels that magical storms or singularities could be found within.

Why is there such magical variability? Many options exist. Perhaps there's some pervasive magical field like the earth's magnetic field, with strength varying due to deposits of a certain mineral. Perhaps there's an underlying "weave" of magical energies that things draw upon, but it is badly scarred in certain areas because of some ancient forgotten war. Perhaps the variances are influenced by connections to other parts of the local cosmology if D&D-like outer planes exist, with those connections either being natural, or intentionally opened and closed by inhabitants on either side. Perhaps the world is being simulated, magic is artificial, and the differences are arbitrarily set.

I hope these ideas gets explored further by a good writer such as yourself, [[/u/alexanderwales]] =).
