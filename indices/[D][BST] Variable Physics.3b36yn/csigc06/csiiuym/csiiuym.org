"Topology" is how I currently have it described; it's good that's an intuitive way of understanding it.

  “Now, imagine a cone on top of this circle, and the whole world laid out on top of the cone. We're way on the edge right now, close to the ground, but those people near to the center, they would be much higher than us, right? Like there's an imaginary mountain whose elevation we can't perceive.” Walkas was watching him, to make sure that he understood. The boy nodded slowly. “Well, the closer you are to the bottom of the cone --- the lower you are on the imaginary mountain --- the less magic works.”

  Dannis mulled this over for a moment while Walkas used his stick to stir the stew. “Why?” he finally asked.

  “Why what?”

  “Why is there less magic as you get further away from the center?”

  Walkas shrugged, but Elnor unfolded himself from the log he'd been sitting on and stood to look over the lines they had drawn in the dirt. “That is precisely what we are here to find out,” he said slowly.

To take the topology metaphor further, there are irregularities in the general shape, divots and ridges, and occasionally avalanches when the borders shift and up-end whole ways of life. Right now, unless someone can give me a good reason not to, the center of the world will have something like twenty different magic systems and a few thousand magical races/creatures, and those will be less and less common as you move towards the outskirts. (I want the center to be this terrible, beautiful, confusing mess.)

There are a ton of ways to model the changes. When I'm making a magic system, I tend to think of how I would implement it in computer programming. You could limit something like "mana", putting caps on refresh rates that get more severe as you move "down". You could limit something like magnitude, putting caps on magical effects as you move "down". You could remove abstraction layers and helper methods from casting, making it like the difference between programming in Assembly and programming in C#. You could add in precursors, so that a spell goes from being freely cast to taking a pinch of bat guano, and goes from taking a pinch of bat guano to taking the blood of a virginal bat. You can have magic require a literal (perhaps godly) connection to a "higher" place, like a lifeline that can be severed.

I might end up going for a combination of these things. I like a messy sort of magic that's got its rules buried under many layers of clothing. It makes it more exciting when you finally see the bare flesh beneath.

(Something that only just now occurs to me is that I can totally justify wizard towers as the logical building choice when you've located a magic "hot spot".)
