I really liked that about /Zones/, and I'm sort of trying to do something similar. This high-level plot is that wizard-scientists from the "hub" of high magic have come down to the area where there's no magic in order to collect some data from a research station, and the general plot flow is that they're traveling to higher and higher levels with every chapter (and in that way, sort of inverting the plot of /A Fire Upon the Deep/). There are certainly a lot of things that you can do with the setting, but the focus on the actual Zones is part of what I liked about /Fire/.
