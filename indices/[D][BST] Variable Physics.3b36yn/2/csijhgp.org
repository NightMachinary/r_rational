An element I thought was compelling in /A Fire Upon the Deep/ is that, if I recall correctly, this feature of the world ended up playing pretty heavily into the plot, and it was even hinted at that it was something set into place by an older civilization. That's a big motivation for me when reading science fiction/fantasy: that the secrets of the world are in principle discoverable or at least hinted at.
