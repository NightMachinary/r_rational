  "Topology" is how I currently have it described; it's good that's an intuitive way of understanding it.

I think you mean topo/graphy/. Topology is about stretching and pulling spaces without cutting them, as a branch of math.

  You could remove abstraction layers and helper methods from casting, making it like the difference between programming in Assembly and programming in C#.

The /Young Wizards/ series always described certain universes as being closer to Timeheart than others, with spirit increasingly dominating matter the further in towards Timeheart you go.

Actually, a setting that relies on simulated environments would have a really easy time reversing that idea: the further Abstractward you go, the more resources are spent on the simulation, and thus the more abstract the models out of which the simulation must be made to be computationally feasible. In direct contrast, the further Concreteward you go, eventually bottoming out in the real universe, the more things stop working in fundamentally mind-y, magical ways and start working only according to strict science and causality.
