So the center of the cone is perhaps where magic was originally created or instantiated - at least in the local region, for certain large values of local? I wonder if it was deliberate, accidental, or the result of a runaway natural process (possibly artificially triggered or accelerated).

Magical field strength topology isn't all that new as a subject; see Terry Pratchett's Unreal Estate near the Unseen University, or any fantasy series set after The Mage Wars (tm), although in those cases there tends to be a standing 'normal' strength magic field interspersed with areas of magic 'radiation' (metaphoric nuclear fallout), which have effects more chaotic than simple thaumoclines. There's also the trope of Underhill consisting of portal-connected areas, each of which has its own magical field of unrelated strength (and possibly other properties).

Things which could give features to the simple conic magic field strength:

- Geography. Mountains, seas, and rivers, and various kinds/concentrations of minerals and/or vegetation could have affected the initial formation or subsequent erosion/thaumoclimate.\\
- The position of the moon, sun, and even stars at the time, if it was largely instantiated in a very short period.\\
- Location of barriers and magical weapons dumps / facilities created by supermages or national teams of mages when the event occured (causing areas of lower/calmer or higher/chaotic effect respectively).\\
- Natural leylines. Did they channel/deflect/absorb/attract the initial event? Have they boosted or drained nearby magic levels since? Were they actually themselves affected, moved, broken, enhanced, even created new?\\
- Artificial leylines. Who knows, there may have been an ancient power grid of sorts. Was it affected when the conic field was imposed? Was it built /after/ the field was discovered, to take advantage of it and carry magic to low-field areas?\\
- Internal field patterns. Is the underlying field completely bland and homogeneous? If so, was it always so? Does it currently, or did it ever have a regular texture (static or variable)? Does it have internal flows? Does it very subtly spiral inwards/outwards? Is is scalloped? Is its average cross-section a smooth line/curve from edge to center, or are there regular cliffs, peaks, valleys, and plateaus?
