  So how is this implemented? Are there certain ways to implement it so that it's more rational?

I once actually wanted to write a story that worked this way. The conceit was going to be that someone invents free-energy generators, and as the generators get increasingly powerful, the violations of physics get ever-more blatant (because once you've broken the laws of physics in one way, it's easier and easier to just find more ways to break them). In fact, eventually it would reach the point of programmable Reality Warping.

The levels were going to run as follows:

- Hard scifi, near-future setting.
- Softer but still Earth-bound sci-fi
- Urban fantasy
- Low fantasy
- Immensely powerful Tolkeinesque/mythic-grade high fantasy. Basically, I was imagining that by this time, the villain would have sufficient power to make the world something like the [[http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Spring_of_Arda][Spring of Arda]] by sheer force of reality-warping energy expenditure.

Weirdness levels /above anime/ are reputed to exist, but without making them too weird to comprehend, it's hard to actually /use/ nontrivially super-anime weird settings /as settings/ without their devolving into, "It just works."
