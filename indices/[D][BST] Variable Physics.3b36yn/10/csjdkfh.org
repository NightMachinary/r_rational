High-magic areas attacking low-magic areas would use something like a sphere of water magically compressed into nuclear plasma, hurled at supersonic speeds. As soon as it passed into an area incapable of maintaining the shield/compression spell...

Also interesting: devices which could use a magical 'battery' to maintain a tiny volume of high-level magic when passing into lower-magic areas. Magical devices could thus last for a certain time before failing. Whether this might be seconds (useful for the water bombs) or months/years (useful for trade items and rechargeable tools) depends on the author. Likewise, items which /suppressed/ magic around or inside them to a certain degree, either to drain local magic or shield something from its effects.
