There's this Polish sci-fi book [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gniazdo_%C5%9Bwiat%C3%B3w]]

It had nested sets of world, each with different (but related) physic and social rules, quite innovative. It also had nested stories using different font to distinguish them. Unfortunately no English translation.
