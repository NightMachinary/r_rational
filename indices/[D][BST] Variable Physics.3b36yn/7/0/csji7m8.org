My first (sort of brainstorming here) answers:

- High levels of magic also mean more magical threats. If you want access to what magic can do, then you also have to deal with dragons, vampires, trolls, and the whole fantasy kitchen sink. If you stay in the low magic zones, you don't have to deal with dread necromancers. Magic is not all upside.
- People /do/ migrate, and populations are higher in high magic areas, which tend to be more urban than in low magic areas because of the kinds of improvements that magic can bring to agriculture, infrastructure, healthcare, etc. This doesn't mean that the low magic areas are depopulated though.
- Magic has a similar effect to industrialization; fertility rates fall. So while the low magic peoples might have to worry more about starvation, disease, etc., the high magic people just aren't having that many children, and the biggest driver of growth in the high magic areas is immigration from the low magic areas. (The question of why fertility rates are lower in industrialized countries is a complex one, but I think it would be reasonable to say that the reasons are mostly the same.)

Probably some combination of all those. My preference is for complex answers to simple questions. :)
