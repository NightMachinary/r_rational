Great explanations! One minor point I'd make is that the threats in point 1 would need to be more terrorizing as opposed to having a real significant impact on mortality rate. That plus distortions in the way news travels could be a significant deterrent. I say this because if it actually increased mortality rate significantly (particularly infant mortality rate), that factor would start to conflict with point 3, since, from my limited knowledge, fertility rates tend to over-compensate. Although, like you said, the reasons behind higher fertility rates are super complex.

Just as an example, say New York had a 9/11 sized attack every 4 years. The mortality rate would remain roughly the same ([[http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/downloads/pdf/vs/vs-population-and-mortality-report.pdf][~.1 pp and ~1-2% increase in mortality rate]]) so I /think/ point 3 would remain intact (though, again, like you said, very complex factors), but at the same time it would likely significantly discourage immigration to New York. Especially if instead of objective-ish nightly news relaying the info, its people in travel taverns shouting over each other about how "Everyone in New Bork was melted by airplanes!"

Two other factors I thought of since I posted:

- The job market (assuming a capitalistic-ish world economy). People born and raised in a non-magic area are going to be trained and spend their time developing non-magic skills. You go try to get the same job in a highly magic area, you'll probably find the job either doesn't exist or offers less pay (since magic equivalents reduce the demand for your skills). I think this is particularly true of segmented magic zones (as opposed to fading-in magic which would allow for small, gradual immigration over time).
- Day-to-day life skills and concepts. Imagine transporting someone from thousands of years ago to a modern city. Ignoring the lack of English, if I told them "Here's 50 bucks, there's a supermarket three block down the street" it would likely be completely incomprehensible. They might not even have the concept of "3," nor how to safely cross a street, nor what money is, nor how to store the food, etc. And that's just survival. More advanced stuff like using the internet is difficult enough for some people born in this world as it is. This even applies both ways too, since I don't think I would fare too well living in a village thousands of years ago. I think its likely these skill and conceptual issues would apply moving from non-magic areas to magical ones. This, too, applies more strongly to segmented, non-fading areas making me think that perhaps that is a more rational setting.

That plus, obviously, all the many factors in the real world that carry over just fine to this one.

Ok I'm definitely on board the hype train for this! Can't wait to see what you write!
