If anyone is diving through this subreddit- this question was answered [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/ebwl77/a_question_about_modesitts_recluce_chronology/fbao28p/][here]] better than I was about to. Tl;dr: Modesitt sent a chronology to a fansite that he sort of endorsed a couple decades ago that whatever chronology you can find today is based on; there's nothing in the books that would nail down exact years for most of it, though the general order and spacing can be figured out through close reading.
