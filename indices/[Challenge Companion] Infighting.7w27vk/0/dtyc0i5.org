(A not-directly-related question: is there any index of challenge winners? I wanted to find a previously-read story about a world where people are beset by a clamouring of voices (of gods?) offering them boons in exchange for sacrifices--I couldn't remember how it ended and wanted to read it again, but I couldn't find a way of finding it, at least not yet.)

Something I've recently found enjoyable, at least in theory, is when multiple characters in a Chinese fiction end up in a 'protagonist-role' and clash with each other.

'Normally', the protagonist is prudent and cunning, everyone else in the world is a belligerent idiot, and the protagonist can flip the chessboard with their mind and their cheat (whether it's future-knowlege or story-knowledge or different-world-technology/-culture knowledge). One can either have one character come up from under another (regarding whether one has future- or outside-knowledge pertaining to the other or not), or multiple characters can enter the same world in parallel, potentially in different ways, neither initially having an advantage over the other. Theoretically, this could allow two prudent, cunning characters to struggle at flipping each other's chessboard, showcasing for the reader schemes and counter-schemes and chessmaster plans that would be a delight to behold. In practice, the 'true' protagonist is prudent and cunning, and the other one is a belligerent idiot in a protagonist-like position.

Clearing my mind, I find myself thinking about Praes of A Practical Guide to Evil, specifically about how infighting and evil-vizer backstabbing attempts have become accepted to the point that abolishing the job of Official Backstabber prompts horror and outrage.

Then to organisations in games, the enjoyment of roleplaying rivalry, the question of where the line falls between grudges that add flavour to a group and grudges that tear apart a group. One group. Is the group weakened by forbidding conflict? Are the weaker ones in the context of conflict sacrificed by permitting a degree of conflict?

Ah. For infighting, 'divide and conquer' can be a nice form--deliberately engineering infighting within an enemy/rival group, without necessarily being caught in any of it oneself, weakening or splitting them to the point where one (/one's group) benefits from it.
