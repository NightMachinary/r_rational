Thanks for recommending Heretical Edge! I started it because of your recommendation and am loving it, I've binged up until arc 26 so far. Isn't quite rational (definitely agreed about plot contrivances), but extremely fun. And an incredibly sweet and rational approach to personal relations, with characters being genre savvy and actually communicating and talking through their issues before they become major problems. And competent and reasonable authority figures!
