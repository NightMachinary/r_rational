  A little girl is kidnapped from her family by unknown assailants, is imprisoned into a gigantic, endless cave filled with ravenous monsters, is infected by the monsters' poisonous blood, the Taint, and dies. When she wakes up again, she's not exactly the same, either physically or mentally. Her only goals in life, now: get out of this cave, and reunite with her family. Oh, and also: slaughter, in as painful a way as possible, anyone who was involved in her imprisonment, anyone who profited from it, and anyone who even remotely gets in the way (plus those people's families, friends, acquaintances, business partners...)
