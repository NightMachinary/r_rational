I think its moments like that that stop the MC from being a Mary Sue, namely when their clever min-maxing and rule twisting and "spacebattles competence" runs into obstacles relating to interpersonal skills or hidden draw-backs/limitations or the reason behind the status quo. I think the author tries to reconstruct the DC universe even as their main character SI tries to exploit it, so the authors goes into worldbuilding to try to make sense of the world and avoid a curbstomp on the SI's part.

The specific example you are complaining about, is, as ketura said, a case where the MC SI was being a jerk, even if they were mostly right.
