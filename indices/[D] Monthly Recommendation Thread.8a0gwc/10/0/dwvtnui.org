march comes in like a lion

Slice of life anime. Rational, not rationalist, but characters always act in accordance with their (very in-depth) characterization, and even when characters do the Wrong thing, it's never frustrating because the viewer totally understands why. And there's a lot of just...people getting better and working their way through really tough problems.
