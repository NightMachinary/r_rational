Been listening to the audio book of Jo Waltons the just city, which is about Athena recruiting classics scholars from across time to attempt to build Platos Republic. This goes about as well as you would expect, but watching everyone try their very hardest to build a scholarly utopia is just amazing. Bought the sequels as soon as I finished, and am hoping the quality will hold up.

Worth the candle is very good.
