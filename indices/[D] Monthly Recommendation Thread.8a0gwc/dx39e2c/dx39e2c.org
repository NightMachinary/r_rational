Does anyone remember a really cold, fucked up Harry Potter fanfic posted here a few years ago, where James Potter 'curses' Harry to be smart/lucky(?) and he grows up to be an extremely cold, detached but also rational(given who he was) Slytherin. His lieutenant ends up sleeping with his girl, and they have a kind of nice messed up poly relationship. The whole world is very dark gray.

The vibe of it was basically like a colder, smarter "The End of the Fucking World" in HP world. I loved that fanfic, but I cannot find it at the moment.
