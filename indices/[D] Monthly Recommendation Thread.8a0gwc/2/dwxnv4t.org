[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-story-only.25076/][With This Ring]] is a sane-itization of the DC comic universe. The main character is a self insert, but this is mostly irrelevant to what makes the story so good. In the past I've been loath to recommend it here, as it felt just a bit too much on the popcorn action side of things, but having just finished a multi-week re-read, I find that I can't avoid singing it's praises.

The biggest thing that WtR brings to the DC universe is a much-needed injection of consistency. One of my favorite such interactions is [[#s][minor power spoiler]]. The work is /filled/ with these sorts of clever interactions, mostly spurred on by the main character taking two existing canon DC concepts and putting them together, no real further fiat needed.

Without spoiling too much, the work also follows an alternate-universe version of the MC as he takes a slightly more...villany-looking path. Ever wished someone would just /take care/ of the Joker permanently? He's got you covered. Each major plot point thus comes up and get handled in two very different ways, one MC punching above his weight class through clever abuse of the world's rules, while the other rolls his eyes and puts a bullet wherever it makes sense. Both are quite satisfying to a comics fan for very different reasons. It never quite gets old, either; eventually the two have branched so far that they have quite different equipment, tech, and contacts available, so you never /quite/ know what either is going to do.

The level of writing skill in this work is very impressive to me. Unlike Worm, which has a similar premise and word count and ratchets up the tension every chapter without any real breathing room, WtR knows how to ebb and flow. One arc we'll be in a frightening fight with demons way above our pay grade, and then next we'll take a break for a few chapters and figure out how to use magic portals to replace and fix the London underground. I also like that he fully understands information that /doesn't matter/; links are provided for one-off side character mentions, the plot doesn't concern itself with pointless or repetitive minutia, and all in all I feel like my time is never wasted on any post.

In short, if you like the superhero genre, railguns, banter, or consistent settings, then I can highly recommend With This Ring. It's an ongoing daily (!) post by post serial work that took me about a month to read spending practically every spare moment to read, and it's all so, so good.
