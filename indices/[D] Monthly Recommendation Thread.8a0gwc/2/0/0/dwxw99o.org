You're remembering correctly, although that event is quite early on. The MC wasn't at fault for hating on "pointy stick launchers" (a view which is only entrenched, expanded, and /vilified/ as the fic goes on), he was at fault for being extremely domineering over it (and taunting her to flash him, behavior which /is/ rather unbecoming of a 30 year old to a teenager). He has to learn not how to get people to change their behavior, but how to persuade them to change what they /want/, and this is a crucial lesson for him to master if he's to make any sort of dent into understanding the orange light.

A big theme of the work is the MC constantly attempting to get everyone to realize what ridiculously overpowered tech is sitting right underneath their noses, which early on is mostly him trying convince Badass Normals to upgrade. If I was in English class I would classify this as a Man vs Insane World sort of work, where the MC must attempt to defy the conventions that everyone else is happy to live with. This is definitely a deconstruction of DC, so any perceived apologism is more likely to be setting the stage.

I would recommend giving it another go, at /least/ until the Ophidian is introduced, at which point this specific concern begins to be addressed in earnest.
