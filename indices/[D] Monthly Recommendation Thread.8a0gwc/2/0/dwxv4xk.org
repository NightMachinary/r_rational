I ended up dropping the fic when it just veered into even more "staus-quo apologism" (for lack of a better term). Specifically, after the MC got into a fight with green arrow jr. about bow being a terrible choice of weapon for someone with her "peak human" powerset. The narrative then implies that the MC was at fault and he apologizes by making super-arrows.

Am I missremembering? Does it get better?
