Thanks for asking. I didn't have time to write a description when I first posted this. It is violent but not as much as that description suggests, and her stated goal isn't static nor straight forward. The story is not revenge porn. Despite the violence I find the tone light-hearted.

It's a fantasy setting with magic, but the magic is researched somewhat scientifically. This is not a big part of the story though, or rather it is important to the story but it's more in the background.

What I like about it the characters have their own motivations that are reasonable and consistent. Basically no idiot balls, though their use of magic/technology seems far from optimized. The main character's naivety is endearing, but she is not 'good'. I also really like the world building, which is revealed to the reader at a good pace. The author combines ideas in a simple but engaging way. There may be other reasons that I can't identify.

The author updates pretty regularly once per week, but she(?) is writing two stories at once so there are gaps of several weeks while she writes Trials.
