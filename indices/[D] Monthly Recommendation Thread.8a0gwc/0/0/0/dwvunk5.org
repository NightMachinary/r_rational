The big problem with the episodes is editing time, which is handled exclusively by DaystarEld (for which he has my eternal gratitude). I think right now there are two episodes recorded, one mostly edited (which I gave a listen to today) that should be posted soon. I've actually got a draft for the next one we'll record, which /is/ something like "Audience Feedback" or interacting with readership, so we're already set on that one.
