The Rationally Writing podcast is awesome. I listened to them all over the past few months, and I really enjoyed it. Not only did it give me a lot of insight into writing, it also gave me a new perspective on the works of [[/u/daystareld][u/daystareld]] and [[/u/alexanderwales][u/alexanderwales]]. My favourite episodes were Magic Systems, Power Dynamics, and Tabletop RPGs and Writing. The quality was improving and I felt they were really coming into their own, it's a shame they mostly stopped doing them.

If they see this comment, consider doing an episode on author/fan interaction. (That would make this comment dangerously meta, though)
