Well, I've been reading several things in the past few months, but most of this sub probably knows the majority of them already. Still, in case you missed any, or haven't checked them out yet, here are my most recent picks:

[[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/][A Practical Guide to Evil]] recently finished its third book, and remains as captivating as ever. The fantasy world in APGtE is a battleground for a meta-war between Good and Evil, where each side has heroes or villains empowered by archetypal Names. The story revolves around an orphan girl named Catherine Foundling, who has grown up in the (Good) country of Callow under the occupation of their (Evil) neighboring country, Praes. Catherine gets an opportunity to take the Name of Squire to serve under Praes' villainous Black Knight, and begins her journey to save her country through practical Evil.

It's a fantastic story with a very active commentary section. Some aspects aren't purely rational - I mean, it literally is "Good" versus "Evil" - but the nuance between "Good/Evil" and "good/evil" is the central theme at play. Lots of great characters, amazing banter, intense battles, and a large amount of foreshadowing that leads to constant threads about what's going to happen next.

Also on hiatus after finishing its 13th book is [[https://tiraas.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/][The Gods Are Bastards]]... although looking at it now, there have been two bonus chapters released recently, so it's likely to start again soon! The story is honestly pretty sprawling and hard to sum up. The world setting mixes genres; early on it mostly sticks to a combination of fantasy and western (the wild west, but with wands and magic), but later adds hints of industrial revolution, steampunk, and sci-fi. The main story revolves around a group of eight freshmen starting at the magical University at Last Rock, run by the 3000 year old elven archmage Arachne Tellwryn. But there are B plot stories, and C plot stories, and throwaway characters... and all are connected in an overarching plot that is slowly drawing them closer together.

TGAB might not appeal to everyone here, but I like it for a few reasons. First, it's a fantastic palate-cleanser if grimdark stories like Worm left you feeling upset. This is pretty much the opposite - yes, the going gets tough and characters face tough challenges and losses, but hardly anyone ever dies. This ties into its major criticism too: because no one ever dies and new characters keep getting added, the character list is ENORMOUS. As such it can be difficult to remember that one character who showed up or was referenced five books ago but is now involved in a later book's plot. The dialogue is also a bit static at the beginning; many characters (especially the non-main characters) all seem to talk the same way. This improves after the first few books, though, so I think it's worth working through. I keep reading it because I love to follow some specific characters (Joseph P. Jenkins and Antonio Darling are the best), but also because I like to see how all the seemingly separate plots intersect with each other. And the worldbuilding is phenomenal!

I also finally, after overlooking it for months, tore through [[http://gravitytales.com/novel/the-good-student][The Good Student]]. The story follows a boy who excels at one thing: studying. And studying. And studying. As a result of his focus, he attains an incredibly high ranking on his country's national exams, enabling him to enter Ransom Academy, the magical school usually reserved only for the rich and powerful. The story involves investigations into the origin of magic, the nature of beliefs, and the true history of his country. The plot takes a lot of twists and turns later on, where you think you have an answer to what's going on in one chapter just to find it completely overturned one or two chapters later. I liked, but didn't love, the author's previous work - but I'd definitely recommend TGS.

As usual I've kept up with [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning][Mother of Learning]] (magical teenager repeats a month over and over trying to discover why while improving his abilities), [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126][Worth the Candle]] (a teenager struggling after the death of his best friend finds himself in the fantasy world of Aerb, which seems to be an amalgamation of all the old tabletop campaigns they used to play), and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9794740/1/Pokemon-The-Origin-of-Species][Pokemon: Origin of Species]] (a rational/ist take on Pokemon - great worldbuilding and very interesting characters). You'll see all three referenced on this sub quite often.

My final recent read is a... different... type of story than we usually see here: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6oje2x/nsfw_the_erogamer_a_quest_about_a_girl_who/][The Erogamer]]. That's a link to an [[/r/rational]] thread about it, because the Questionable Questing website requires you to create a free account, since the content is undoubtedly NSFW. From the context of those last two sentences you can probably guess the general overview of the story: it's a quest story (ie, the commenters get to select different options to steer the plot) about a girl who wakes up one day as a pornographic game (eroge) character. You may have read quest stories, you may have read Gamer derivatives... but I've personally never read something quite as fascinating as The Erogamer. Its tags are roughly Gamer/eroge/transhumanism/existential horror/lovecraftian sex comedy. Book 2 just ended, and I think there might be a brief break, so now's a great time to start reading and to catch up. I also HIGHLY recommend reading the comments in between chapters as well, because the commentary is very interesting on its own, but also tends to get rolled into the next chapter as well. Oh, and the sex scenes are pretty hot (though they don't occur as frequently as you might imagine).

Outside of reading, I've started listening to the podcast hosted by Daystar Eld (Pokemon: The Origin of Species) and Alexander Wales (Metropolitan Man/Worth the Candle, as cthulhuraejepsen), [[http://alexanderwales.com/rationally-writing/][Rationally Writing]]. Only a few episodes in, but I've been liking it so far - great job, guys! And finally, I read an article or two on Slate Star Codex (by Unsong writer Scott Alexander) that make me think I'll be reading quite a bit more. I enjoyed [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/11/21/the-categories-were-made-for-man-not-man-for-the-categories/][The Categories Were Made For Man, Not Man For The Categories]] quite a bit, both for the great critique of transphobic views and for the exceptionally engaging writing style.

Whew... ok, that's all for me. For now, at least!

*Edit: Nope! Forgot one, as I'm still reading it now!*

[[https://ceruleanscrawling.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/][Heretical Edge]] was a series I started up a long time ago; I made it to Arc 19 (I think?) before getting caught up, and recently I went back to it... up to Arc 28 now, and the series is on Arc 33. The story is about a teenager sent to a hidden school that trains Heretics - humans endowed with the ability to cast magic and absorb the abilities of the supernatural monsters they are sent to hunt. When I first read the story I thought it was pretty dark and gruesome, with a lot of family trauma and super violent scenes. Now that I'm about 10 arcs further in, it's still pretty dark at times... but also not as bad as I had previously thought. Many of the tragic backstories are somewhat lessened; characters thought dead are often just out of the picture and show back up later. The story very much is moved by plot contrivance, but there are some really good instances of foreshadowing. A lot of seemingly "background" characters often rise to more prominent roles later on. The plot itself is quite fast-paced, with characters often rushing from one emergency situation to the next (sorta like a Dresden Files book). My only issue with the pacing is that you often have 2-3 chapters and then an interlude chapter. The interludes are all interesting, but I usually found myself just wanting to skip ahead to find out what happened to the main story. Other than that, I've really enjoyed rereading the series!
