[[https://myanimelist.net/anime/23289/Gekkan_Shoujo_Nozaki-kun][Monthly Girls Nozaki-kun]] is one of the best comedy anime I've ever seen. It's up there with Ouran High School Host Club as a fantastic parody of shojo romance manga, but without an overarching plot or character development. The fact that it's /just/ a high school comedy shouldn't dissuade you though, it's freaking hilarious and the best adaption of 4-koma jokes I've seen yet. I'm definitely checking out the manga to get more of it.

I won't spoil what the show is about, it's actually better to go in blind and discover the characters for yourself. They all fall into traditional archetypes, but subvert them in significant ways that satirize both shojo romance and traditional gender roles. I think that's what elevates the show beyond /just/ a parody of romantic plots driven by misunderstandings where the joke is that everyone is smart enough to figure out other people's problems but oblivious to their own, though that's still enough to carry the comedy.

There's also some great jokes about how manga gets made and how the life of the writer often revolves around their creative process. I love the meta-humor about how the mangaka turns all of his friends into romance stories while being utterly oblivious to the actual romance story he's in that never advances. The situation is contrived as all hell, but the absurdity of it just makes it funnier. If you have ever liked a romantic comedy anime, you've got to check this out.
