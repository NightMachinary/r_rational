I'd actually say that FATE suffers from a lot of the same problems, and to a worse degree than GURPS due to its lack of crunch. It takes a lot of work to make FATE into something that has mechanical teeth enough to feel like it's supporting the genre of the game (although see *Dresden Files* for an example of it being done very well).
