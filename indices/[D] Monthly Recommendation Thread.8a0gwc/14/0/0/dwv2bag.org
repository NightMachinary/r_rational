I completely agree. My personal favorite rpg system is [[https://fate-srd.com/][Fate]] because it places the fiction first and has mechanics designed to serve the narrative you're creating together. [[http://apocalypse-world.com/pbta/][Powered By the Apocalypse]] is my second favorite because it is designed for a story to emerge from its mechanics that directly interact with the themes of the genre.
