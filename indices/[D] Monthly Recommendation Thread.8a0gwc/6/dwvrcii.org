I've been absolutely obsessed with [[https://thezombieknight.blogspot.com/2013/04/page-1.html][Zombie Knight]] for the last few weeks. I saw it from a thread on here and was hooked fast, so I recommend going in sight-unseen, but it's a sort-of-fantasy, sort-of-superhero story that comes bleedingly close to being a ratfic. The only thing that I think holds it back is that the world has some ill-defined rules, but some of that could be explained away by [[#s][minor spoilers]]. Also, it's very much a soft system rather than hard, with most of the rules being pretty nebulous.

The other thing I wanna give a shout-out to is 3-gatsu no lion, or March Comes in like a Lion (it's on Crunchy Roll, but I'm at work so I don't wanna link it). It's a slice of life anime about a high school boy that's really good at shogi, and the first season is just like putting some hand warmers around your heart. But the second season (which just wrapped up) goes so much further. Really high quality animation and the characters are /so good/. Seriously, it's some of the best characterization I've ever seen - no characters being dumb because it's on their bullet list of traits, everyone's just trying their best, and the world feels very real (well, it is real, but you know what i mean).
