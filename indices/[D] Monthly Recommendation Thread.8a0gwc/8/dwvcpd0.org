I really loved Anathem by Neil Stevenson, are there any books that are similar or in the same rational, spec fic with an action plot sorta niche?

Alternatively, I've really enjoyed Delphic but after a couple of months giving Worm a go I've realized I don't love the neverending melancholy and poor decisionmaking. Are there any other relatively positive (or just not as negative as worm) super stories?
