To be fair, how many stories on the internet actually finish? I could probably count on my fingers the good, long, completed fanfics that I've read. George R.R. Martin probably won't finish the Song of Ice and Fire books and he's getting paid to do it, it only makes sense that people who are posting their stories online for free don't finish. Most of the quests I've read on SV end up getting abandoned after a while. Authors tend to get interested in a new idea but lose interest after a while.
