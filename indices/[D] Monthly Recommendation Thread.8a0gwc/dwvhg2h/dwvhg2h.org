[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/even-further-beyond.45951/][Even Further Beyond]] is a nice quest on SV that seems pretty rational so far IMO. The premise is that the main character is a human from the ordinary world who, in the afterlife, is commanded by the divinities to reincarnate into a Xianxia-inspired setting and defeat the Heroine, a reincarnated goddess who will bring about the end of the Age of the setting. If he succeeds, the divinities will grant him a wish, and if he fails then he will be given some unspecified punishment. There's a lot of min-maxing involved in how he can develop his magic abilities.
