Well, it does tend to have a lot of low-hanging fruit from combining different schools of magic that other characters aren't able to access all at once. I think Rihaku (the author) is pretty cognizant of most methods of gaming the system so players haven't really come across anything truly inspiring. It's more the main character who acts rationally using his abilities. But it is still fun to read, and there isn't much of a ceiling to the level of power that can be reached.
