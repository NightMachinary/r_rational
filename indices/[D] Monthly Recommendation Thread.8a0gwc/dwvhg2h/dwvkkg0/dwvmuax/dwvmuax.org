I feel that there is a difference in terms here. To me, min-maxing refers to ensuring that your stats and abilities match your character ideal. To use D&D as an example, this would be lowering your Wizard's strength to boost their intelligence.

To me, you are referring to munchkining. As I understand, munchkining refers to using the rules in a way that was not originally intended by the designers, usually to be more effective than usual.
