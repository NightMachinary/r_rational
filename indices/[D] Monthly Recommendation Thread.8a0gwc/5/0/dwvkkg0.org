This may sound a bit pedantic, but is the min-maxing actually any good? Usually when I see these kinds of "use an original magic system to become more powerful" kinds of tales, the actual optimization is just a bunch of obvious low-hanging fruit and not actually inventive or impressive. I much prefer the kinds of characters with outlandish combinations of unexpected abilities to create /overwhelmingly/ powerful synergies. Basically, the "max" is never all that high for me.

Like, Pathfinder allows for a character build which converts alcohol into angel summons, and makes for a defensive powerhouse as well. It's a four-step chain of mutating character resources that transforms consumed beer into myriad celestial allies, and it's /totally unlike/ the sorts of things you usually see in a game which supposedly supports "min-maxing".
