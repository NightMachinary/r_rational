How willing are you to read My Little Pony fanfiction? There's a lot of good stuff, but MLP ain't for everyone. For example, I'm currently reading [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/396744/the-maretian][The Maretian]] which is the Martian, but then ponies are also stranded with Matt Damon for reasons that make sense in-context but would seem nonsensical if I tried to explain them. It's a The Martian/MLP/Kerbal Space Program crossover first contact story, although the KSP part is mostly a holdover from the MLP only prequel.
