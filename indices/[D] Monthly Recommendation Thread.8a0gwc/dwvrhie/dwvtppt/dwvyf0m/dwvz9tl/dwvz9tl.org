Good, that's not a problem. I haven't watched the show in years, and the recs I have reflect that. Note that I'm including both "humans and ponies make /official/ contact" and "humans/ponies wind up in equestria/earth, cultural exchange ensues" stories. I'm not including stories that are just isekai though.
