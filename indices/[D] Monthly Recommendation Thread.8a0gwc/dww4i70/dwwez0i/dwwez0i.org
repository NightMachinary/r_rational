Hulu's got "A Bit of Fry and Laurie" (Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie when they were younger, doing sketch comedy) and "Blackadder" (four seasons all staring Rowan Atkinson, it's just a funny pseudohistorical sitcom with each season set in a different historical period; season two adds Stephen Fry and seasons three and four add Hugh Laurie).

Neither of those is rational in any sense, but they're funny.
