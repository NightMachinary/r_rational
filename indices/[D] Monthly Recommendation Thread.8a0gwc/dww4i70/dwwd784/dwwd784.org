Jane the Virgin - it's a comedy and it's hilarious. It's in the style of a telenovella. Synopsis: a woman who is saving herself for marriage accidentally gets artificially inseminated. It suffers a lot from Hollywood Medicine and Hollywood Police work. My reason for recommending it in [[/r/rational]] is that the /relationships/ are handled very rationally: people talk about their problems to each other and handle disagreements maturely for the most part, which is very unusual for the genre.

Sense8 - it's just amazing. Watch it. It's by the Wachowskis. Not Rational but still really cool. Episode 4 is where it hits its stride. It's a cool scifi premise but also "what if there were 8 really good drama shows happening simultaneously and crossing over?". Amazing characters, including the 8 main characters and the supporting cast. It was cancelled but the outrage about the cliffhanger was so huge that a special finale episode has been ordered and should be released in a few months. If the finale special does well, who knows, Season 3 might even be on the cards.

The Handmaid's Tale - On hulu. Based on the Atwood novel. Amazing adaptation that is faithful to the novel but expands on it amazingly. Really dark.
