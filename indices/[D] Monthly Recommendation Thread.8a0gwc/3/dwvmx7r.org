I recommend two fantasy books this month.

1) [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35530652-grey-sister][Grey Sister]] by Mark Lawrence, the sequel to [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25895524-red-sister][Red Sister]], which I thought was the best fantasy book of last year. Here's the rec I wrote for red sister last year:

  I finished reading Red Sister and I really enjoyed it. The setting was possibly the best part for me. It's set in a ice world which was colonized by four different "races" of humanity, each with their own magical/physical ability. With the aid of a solar mirror their ancestors were able to create a corridor of suitably temperate weather around the equator. The rest of the world is basically just glaciers that are constantly encroaching on this shrinking corridor. The knowledge that the mirror has been slowly falling out of its orbit and that the death of everyone on the planet is inevitable is widespread.

2) [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35437058-master-assassins][Master Assassins]] by Robert V.S. Redick. Don't mind the title or the stupid cover. The book is not an action story, it is not about "master assassins". It's a story of two brothers that get caught up in events way out of their league. They're part of a persecuted ethnicity that has only recently started fighting back, under the leadership of an extremely brutal theocracy governed by a still living prophet. What I really like about the book is the characterization of the protagonist and his companions, and the protagonist's relationship with his brother.
