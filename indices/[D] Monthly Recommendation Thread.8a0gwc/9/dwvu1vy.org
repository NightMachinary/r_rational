I watched all of /Legion/ in this last week or so; it's amazing. Definitely one of my favorite shows of all time.

A decent snarky summary is: "Hey you're crazy!" "No, you're not crazy, you're a telepath!" "Wait! You're both a telepath, AND crazy!" "Wait, that's not a--- !"

Things that stand out to me are:

- the character depths (in all characters, but particularly the main character)
- the range of acting they all get to do (there's a scene where actor does their normal "american" accent, an amazing british accent, and then a /bad/ british accent)
- the cinematography (it's not quite as pretty as American Gods, but close)
- the pacing: It never really slows down, but has 3-4 to-black cuts (for a few seconds) in an episode, which are rarely (if ever) cliffhangers. It's full of easy, natural stopping points, so I felt zero pressure to binge.

I wouldn't call it "rational", but I would call it /amazing/.

Also this has been fun: [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/bunkercore-post-apocalyptic-dungeon-core-original.45976/]]

It's a "dungeon core" (as in Dungeon Keeper / Evil Genius) set in a post-war nano/nuclear apocalypse. World building seems solid and the main character is decently thoughtful about their situation, environment and actions.
