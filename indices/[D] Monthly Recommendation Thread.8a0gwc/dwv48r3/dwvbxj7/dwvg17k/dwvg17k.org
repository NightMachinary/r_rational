The book series is one of my favorites as well, but I had a hard time watching the series (stopped after the first season) because although it deals with the same themes as the book and had mostly the same plot/characters, the television series turns the journey into an "adventure of the week" and mostly makes the plot sillier (the book series also takes some liberties, such as how Quentin swings from being a magical expert to being a dunce magician depending on circumstances). Also, mostly I think the author's prose was half the beauty of the books.

By the way, is there an episode of Rationally Speaking where The Magicians is discussed? Be interesting to see it deconstructed.
