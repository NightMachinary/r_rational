I completed the trilogy, but I found the first two books incredibly frustrating. I think /The Magicians/ is full of examples of characters we are told are clever, and who are shown to do things we are told take a lot of intelligence (i.e. magic), but who rarely act in a clever way when the topic is something the readers can understand. The ending of the first book, in particular, and the fact that [[#s][spoilers for the first book]]

Other examples include that [[#s][more spoilers for the first book]]

Overall, however, I did enjoy reading the series. I really liked the magic system and a lot of the worldbuilding was fascinating, while Quentin's moods were incredibly infectious due to the writing style. When he's depressed, the grey almost oozes out of the page, and when he's happy, it's like a burst of sunshine.
