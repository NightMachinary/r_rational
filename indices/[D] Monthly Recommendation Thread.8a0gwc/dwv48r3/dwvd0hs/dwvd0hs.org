I've just finished the first season of the magicians, and found the ending pretty dark and depressing (especially Julia's storyline), after starting out more upbeat (or at least balanced). Do the later seasons feel more like that, or more balanced, like the earlier episodes?

I'm really not sure if I want to continue watching.
