I've found that while *GURPS* is able to do a lot of things fairly well, it doesn't do as well at evoking theme as a set of mechanics designed for the purpose, since the mechanics shape how you approach and play the game. Using a set of generic mechanics therefore means that you lose some of the "fit" between mechanics and story.

Games like *Apocalypse World* or *Shadowrun* or even *Dungeons & Dragons* are very much set up to generate a particular play experience; they will probably do better at that particular story or genre than any generic system, having been made from the ground up for that purpose.

That said, GURPS is extremely useful precisely because there's such a range and wealth of supplements available, and for an idea where there doesn't exist any system that fits the idea it can be great. The last quote is very true - I've stolen quite a few useful bits and pieces out of GURPS supplements over the years.
