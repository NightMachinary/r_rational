I personally find the game freeform enough to easily suit most kinds of stories, though I see where you're coming from. It really suits character-driven pulp adventures by default, but that's a style of story I really like that you can explore different genres within.

I admit that the core rules kind of expect everyone to think like a game designer, so it's not for everyone, but it's still been the most fun I've had with interactive storytelling. It's also my favorite dice mechanic due to the way difficulty and Fate Points work.
