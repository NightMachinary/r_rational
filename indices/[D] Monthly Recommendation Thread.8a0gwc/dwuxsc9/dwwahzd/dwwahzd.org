I've only had the opportunity to play GURPS once, but it was a beautiful system. To add a bit to the "well-researched and up-to-date" bit, there is a guy I've noticed on a handful of different websites over the last 10+ years, a William Stoddard. The name stood out for being relatively consistent across all of those sites, and always posting some of the most thoughtful, insightful, and educated comments I've ever seen. Years after I'd noticed this pattern, I learned that his side-gig was writing GURPS supplements.
