This is one of my fav RPGs: [[http://suffadv.wikidot.com/]]

I'm a little biased being familiar with the people that wrote it and having contributed to the expansion.

The basic idea is that a long time ago, someone made an achronal artificial intelligence. They left humanity with some cool future tech (nanotech, psychohistory, wormholes) and buggered off for awhile. Now it's the future, the civilizations are cored around deep cultural beliefs rather than geography, and the AIs are back... to run the patent office.

You play "patent officers". But, since your bosses can do something approximating "see the future", you really just get sent interest places to do interesting things; usually weird moral dillemas around technology that would explode or go unnoticed had you not been sent.

Mechanically, the most interesting part is that you, as the player, have plot abilities (balanced against your character abilities); the space amish have amazing plot abilities, the living starships have very little. It works /really/ well.
