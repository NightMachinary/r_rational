[[http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/][/GURPS/]] (the Generic Universal RolePlaying System) should appeal to this subreddit's denizens.

Quotes from [[http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/Basic/][the /GURPS Basic Set/]]:

#+begin_quote
  [The system's designer:] I've tried to make /GURPS/ as fast-moving yet realistic as possible.

#+begin_quote
  [The system's designer:] I'm satisfied that /GURPS/ is the most realistic, flexible, and "universal" system ever developed.
#+end_quote

 

#+begin_quote
  [T]he combat system is "modular"; you can use /all/ the rules for a complex, detailed, realistic combat simulation---or just those in Chapter 11 for a quick game.
#+end_quote

  For the most part, /GURPS/ stresses realism. Heroes can get disappointed, injured, sick, or even dead. So it goes. The GM is expected to stretch realism in an emergency (defined as "whenever realism would ruin the game"), but[,] the rest of the time, realism rules.

#+begin_quote
  The /GURPS/ rules are designed for two main things: /good roleplaying/ and /realism/, in that order.

A quote from [[http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/fantasy-tech/fantasy-tech1/][/GURPS Fantasy-Tech 1/]]:

#+begin_quote
  /GURPS/ is known for highly detailed, well-researched supplements containing a wealth of up-to-date historical and scientific information. These volumes are written by well-read, enthusiastic amateurs and people with real-world experience and academic credentials in their fields, often working in consultation with a range of experts and professionals, to produce works useful[,] not just to /GURPS/ players, but to players of other games and to nongamers with an interest in the subject material.

  This is not one of those supplements.
