Well, that seems to be a surprisingly hard request.

- [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/Luminosity][/Luminosity/]], a rational /Twilight/ fanfiction. Fits quite well, if I recall correctly.

- [[http://www.hpmor.com/][/HPMoR/]], as mentioned by [[/u/I_Probably_Think][u/I_Probably_Think]], but you probably know it already.

- [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twig][/Twig/]]: the main characters usually aim for "immediate survival" instead of "immortality", but the desperate need to prolong your and your friends' lifespan past bodies' natural limits becomes an important plot point later on.
