This is a list of most of the superhero webfiction in order of weekly votes. Ward is the sequel, you can probably skip that. The Zombie Knight is really good but I'm not sure I'd call it a super hero story, the main characters have super powers but it's not set up as a standard super heroes versus super villains story, it's more about rival conspiracies/armies of super powered people fighting each other. I haven't read the others but I think they're Worm-esque universes but less dark.
