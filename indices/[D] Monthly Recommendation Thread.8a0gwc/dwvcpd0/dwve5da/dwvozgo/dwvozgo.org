I think it's totally fair to call Zombie Knight a superhero story; it's just that superhero isn't the only (or even the primary) genre it fits into.

I've read Super Powereds in the past, but it didn't hold on to me. It's actually sorta similar to My Hero Academia if you're familiar with that, but it's not very rational or grounded
