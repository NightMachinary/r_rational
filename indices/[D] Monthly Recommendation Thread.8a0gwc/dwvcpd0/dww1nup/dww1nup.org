If you're not into Worm's aesthetic, /With This Ring/ would be my second recommendation. It's a Young Justice fanfic that at this point is very likely longer than Worm. The author has a few idiosyncrasies, and it's a self-insert, so it's much more a challenge of learning to live with the author's unique perspective, but once you get into it you'll find that it's one of the more engaging takes on the DC universe as a whole. My only complaint aside from that is that some of the fight scenes really felt like they dragged on quite a bit.
