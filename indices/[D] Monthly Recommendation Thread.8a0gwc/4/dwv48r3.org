This season of the Magicians was superb ([[#s][spoilers]]). In general, I've really liked the show, particularly for the pop-culture references, and the way the show approaches the wish-fulfillment/coming of age fantasy it's clearly responding to (particularly Harry Potter and Narnia).

I also had fun with the new season of the Santa Clarita Diet. I think the comedy has improved from the first season -- in particular, I think Timothy Olyphant is carrying the show less than he was in the first season.

Have I recommended /The Fifth Season/ trilogy here? Because those books are good, and are also quite refreshingly different from a lot of other fantasy.

I've read through the first three books of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_Center_Saga][Galactic Center Saga]] so far, and definitely recommend it. There are definitely some weird bits (Bigfoot showing up in the first book, the machine art in the third book), but overall I've liked them so far.

Speaking of weird, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_(novel)][Light]] by M. John Harrison is really weird, but also fascinating and very good. I haven't started on the sequels yet, but I think this book is definitely worth it for any fans of science fiction.

Finally, I just got [[https://www.amazon.com/Grey-Sister-Book-Ancestor-Lawrence/dp/1101988886][Grey Sister]] yesterday, and though I haven't finished it yet, so far it's been just as good as the rest of Lawrence's stuff.
