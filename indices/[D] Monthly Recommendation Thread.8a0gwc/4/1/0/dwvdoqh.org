  I've just finished the first season of the magicians, and found the ending pretty dark and depressing (especially Julia's storyline), after starting out more upbeat (or at least balanced). Do the later seasons feel more like that, or more balanced, like the earlier episodes?

I think the ending of the first season (and yes, Julia's storyline in particular) is probably the darkest the show ever gets. The later seasons aren't all bright and cheery, but they're not that bad (though Julia and Alice's storylines in the second season do get fairly dark). Overall, I would say give it a shot.
