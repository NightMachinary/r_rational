I wonder what kind of plan Norman came up with in his "I won't lose to mama anymore" induced...freak out? It seems like he might have something intense going on. I enjoy how it shows that he keeps calm on the outside for everyone else, even in situations where he's basically going crazy.

Also, the kid silhouette at the end when they discuss their 10 day plan schedule implies they were overheard. I'm thinking it was intentional on Norman or Ray's part.
