Good points. Hurin's accurate guesses are a bit of a leap, I concede. Regarding your other points though, the eleves and the Valar may have superior metallurgical craft, but Rational!Hurin is the first to build hypothesis based on what he observes as opposed to relying on lore. And while the Valar and Maia are magical, there is precious little magic portrayed by Tolkien in actual battle between orcs vs. humans and elves. Whether this is because the range of Morgoth's magic is limited or there's some prime directive imposed by the Valar, I do not know. My familiarity with Middle Earth lore is not a lot, so please forgive any inconsistencies.
