  Rational!Hurin is just magically knowing how science works- he's not doing observational experiments. Logically deducing what we know to be accurate facts isn't observational.

I don't think that I agree. He's been given the observational suite of the lead designer of the universe. It isn't outrageous to think that these observations (which include long-distance high fidelity astronomical data) provide the relevant information, especially when paired with insight from a mortal that lives within creation.

Consider also that there's a specific experiment conducted: the existence of pitchblend is posited and then investigated.
