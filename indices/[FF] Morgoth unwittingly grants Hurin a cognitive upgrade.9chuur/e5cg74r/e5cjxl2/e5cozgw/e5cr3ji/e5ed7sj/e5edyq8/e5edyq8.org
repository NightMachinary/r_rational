Theoretically, the story could have run that way- the Valar have access to vast cosmic power, they could have woefully underused senses that he decided to exploit.

  I remember Sador my house servant who carved intricate wood toys for my son. Ingenious constructs that could be pulled apart and rebuilt into other shapes. So many shapes from building blocks, held taut like a bowstring, just waiting for their bindings to be cut to release the spring. Might not all substances use the same trick? All transient shapes from the same set of invisibly tiny elemental blocks, just waiting for a spark to sever their binding energies and unleash the fires within.

But in actuality, he deduced it because his son had experiments with toys. That is, canonically, how he worked out the existence of atoms.

Uranium is a rare element that is only found at specific mines. Even if he somehow deduced its existence, mining at a random mine wouldn't produce it.

If he wanted to rationally find it after somehow deducing it, I'd suggest using Morgoth senses and statistical analysis for areas with higher rates of cancer deaths.
