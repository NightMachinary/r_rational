Rational!Hurin is just magically knowing how science works- he's not doing observational experiments. Logically deducing what we know to be accurate facts isn't observational.

If he was just relying on observations he might go "I know that the swords of the orcs are crap, and the swords of the elves are awesome. They must either have some special method to produce them, or some superior source of iron. Therefore, we can raid and capture a settlement to test out which!"

Gandalf and Morgoth make extensive use of magic in the fights. For example, Gandalf.

  Just at that moment all the lights in the cavern went out, and the great fire went off poof! into a tower of blue glowing smoke, right up to the roof, that scattered piercing white sparks all among the goblins.

  The yells and yammering, croaking, jibbering and jabbering; howls, growls and curses; shrieking and skriking, that followed were beyond description. Several hundred wild cats and wolves being roasted slowly alive together would not have compared with it. The sparks were burning holes in the goblins, and the smoke that now fell from the roof made the air too thick for even their eyes to see through. Soon they were falling over one another and rolling in heaps on the floor, biting and kicking and fighting as if they had all gone mad.

  "Then suddenly Morgoth sent forth great rivers of flame that... poured over all the plain; and the Mountains of Iron belched forth fires of many poisonous hues, and the fume of them stank... and was deadly. Thus Ard-galen... became a burned and desolate waste... and it was called Anfauglith, the Gasping Dust. Many charred bones had there their roofless grave; for many of the Noldor perished... who were caught by the running flame... The heights of Dorthonion and Ered Wethrin held back the fiery torrents, but their woods upon the slopes that looked towards Angband were all kindled, and the smoke wrought confusion among the defenders. Thus began the fourth of the great battles, Dagor Bragollach, the Battle of Sudden Flame."

  In the gloom they heard the hiss of Wormtongue's voice: 'Did I not counsel you, lord, to forbid his staff? That fool, Hama, has betrayed us!' There was a flash as if lightning had cloven the roof. Then all was silent. Wormtongue sprawled on his face.

  there he made a mighty gate. But above this gate, and behind it even to the mountains, he piled the thunderous towers of Thangorodrim, that were made of the ash and slag of his subterranean furnaces, and the vast refuse of his tunnellings. They were black and desolate and exceedingly lofty

Lore wise- elves can forge magical items with super properties, and may have local magic powers. Humans can have more mild versions, like Aragorn's ability to make super healing herbs. Maia can generally wreck a hundred or so feet of stuff pretty easily. Valar can wreck and produce hills and mountains and continents.

Stronger magical items generally work by investing some of your innate magic in an item (like the one ring) making it super powerful. Morgoth was much reduced in power, because he invested so much energy into middle earth mind controlling people and making monsters, but still at a Maia level of power by the end.
