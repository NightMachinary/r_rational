I'm not especially sold on this. Pure intellect isn't a reliable tool to make scientific deductions about the world, you need experiments.

  “the Valar endeavoured ever, in despite of Melkor, to rule the Earth and to prepare it for the coming of the Firstborn; and they built lands, and Melkor destroyed them; valleys they delved and Melkor raised them up; mountains they carved and Melkor threw them down; seas they hallowed and Melkor spilled them; and naught might come to peace or lasting growth, for as surely as the Valar began a labour so would Melkor undo it or corrupt it."

But Fingolfin sprang aside, and Grond rent a mighty pit in the earth.”
