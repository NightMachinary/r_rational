It's actually not, in that the story has aspects of the masquerade being broken in the climax, but it's just unexplored as the MC is more interested in goofing off and powering up than interacting with literally anyone. Even the characters she's "friends" with are people she doesn't want to interact with if she can.

Not only that, Literally none of the main supporting cast care a single iota about anything but themselves and one or two other things, and because of that, it means they default firmly to jerking off in magic circles instead of being interesting.

The author has vastly, vastly improved so much, and I think the biggest thing to note is that in Vacant Throne, unlike Void Domain, they decided that when they chose their MC, they made sure she wasn't going to spend the entire story only interacting with people to make them go away.
