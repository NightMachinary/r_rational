IT is indeed Void Domain, but the other commenter didn't post a link to it. So here's a link, and also an impromptu review of it for anyone interested (note that it doesn't really fall into rational fiction, more rational/ist/ - rational characters, irrational world type thing):

--------------

[[https://towercurator.wordpress.com/][Void Domain]] is slightly inconsistent in what exactly it's trying to /be/, and as a result comes off to me as being slightly generic. On one hand it's a story about people using magic (a "weak" magic system) to solve problems. Set in the present, it mentions the problem of magic being superstitious and mostly hidden from laypeople, but doesn't really explore it. Similarly, it touches on social acceptance, using demons as an analogue for minorities in a sense, but doesn't explore this theme in a nuanced way. That said the overarching thread is morality, and how that develops in different characters with different motivations (and how different personal systems of morality conflict with each other). It's competently written and moves at a reasonable pace, and is also complete, so you won't have to wait on any cliffhangers.
