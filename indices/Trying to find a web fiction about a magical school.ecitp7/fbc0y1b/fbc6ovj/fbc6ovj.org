I prefer the author's other work, [[https://tcthrone.wordpress.com/][Vacant Throne]]. The MC is refreshingly likeable IMO, and it's a better take on the isekai idea than most. In Void Domain, the whole "magic is hidden from laypeople and nobody really knows about it despite it being extremely useful" turned me off the story a bit, but it was something else I can't really put words to that has made me drop it. Just wasn't enjoying it. Maybe how it was generic, like you say.
