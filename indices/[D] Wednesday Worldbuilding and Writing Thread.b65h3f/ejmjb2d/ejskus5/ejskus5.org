I have a decent grasp of physics, so I can guesstimate a little bit:

- 1/5th gravity would cause the terminal speed to be =sqrt(1/5th)= (~45%) of the normal value.
- Assuming all other things are equal (temperature, atmospheric composition) 2x pressure would relate to 2x density which would cause terminal speed to be =sqrt(1/2)= of the normal value (~70%)

All in all the terminal velocity would be roughly ~30% of that on earth, so for a wingsuit that would be 60km an hour on average (or 15km hour if you were skilled in manipulating it, but that requires it to still work correctly) /theoretically/.

However lift generation would likely be affected by the gravity difference and atmospheric difference, and I don't know enough about that to even guesstimate what direction (better or worse) it would go. For example, part of the way wingsuits generate lift is by using their gravity assisted velocity. Also consider that this will change how fast they can go horizontally, and it may still be problematic stopping in that direction.
