Anyone handy with aerodynamics?

What would the terminal velocity be of a human in a wingsuit, in an environment with roughly 1/5th of Earth's gravity and 2 times Earth's atmospheric pressure? Eg, would they be able to move slow enough to land safely if dropped from a few kilometres up?

(In case it matters, the "wingsuit" would actually be the patagium of a person who's roughly a human-scale geneered flying-squirrel; and the gravity is actually from the rotation of a 4000-km-circumference, 1/60 rpm toroidal habitat.)
