I've been writing a NSFW Gamer/MGE story over at QQ these past few months. I've tried putting in some rational elements (examining motives, self-reflection, communication) and now I've reached the point where I need to straighten out some of the infamous knots presented in the original setting.

The biggest problem I'd found when writing was pointed out by the readers: is KC's setting supposed to be grim? Some of the posters got a spat or two about it.

I figured that KC's intent was to make the MGE universe perverse, first and foremost. Consistency and implications didn't matter so much until people pointed it out to him. So trying to find organization in that setting is an exercise in futility -- and that's okay.

It's only a problem when working the MGE into a story.

But since the setting I'm writing in is supposed to be based on the MGE, I'll need to consider those problems.

--------------

One of the questions I'd seen was if monsters should be people.

I'd say, yes, if “people” means “sentient, intelligent being,” and no if “people” means “moral, humane being.”

The lore implies that the current Demon Lord existed since the previous Demon Lord's time, which means she is a product of the Chief God's creation. Her ideals shouldn't be interpreted through romantic fluff, because it shouldn't exist (unless human-monster relationships existed in previous eras).

So, I'm comfortable with applying a creationist/intelligent design spin in her thinking:

Succubi survive by feeding on spirit energy, which they can get through fluid consumption or sex. This has not changed through any of the Demon Lords.

It's difficult to feed on the energies of multiple men (war, hostility, geographic inconveniences), so finding a consistent source of food is invaluable. That means killing the target is bad. That means cultivation (incubus transformation) is necessary. That means establishing some cooperation or co-dependence (seduction, sexual skill, inviting affection) is a must.

As the MC puts it:

  Paradise for a succubus had to mean something special.

  “Standardize the needs of monsters to simplify her problem set,” I began. “Cultivate men's spirit energy potential to introduce a post-scarcity world. Monsterize women to eliminate reproductive competition. And install herself as the dictator so as to stop divisional problems in the future. That's peace and prosperity in a nutshell.”

There's more to tackle, of course. Competency among heroes, the motives of the Chief God(dess), and the Order among them.

What are your thoughts?
