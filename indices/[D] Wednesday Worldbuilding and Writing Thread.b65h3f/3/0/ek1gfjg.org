  The biggest problem I'd found when writing was pointed out by the readers: is KC's setting supposed to be grim? Some of the posters got a spat or two about it.

This is a decision you've got to make yourself... And frankly, you should have made a decision on the level of grimdark in the setting /before/ you got far into the story.

As someone with basic familiarity with MGE your ideas don't seem bad though.
