Yeah, unfortunately I think if I was reading a transhumanist story and the main character was a wolf-human and the love interest was a fox-human I'd have the furry alarm bells ring. I'd probably still give the story a good chance but I'm not super opposed to furries - I mean it's very much not my thing at all in a sexy way, but if the story's about anthro creatures but otherwise is interesting, whatevs.

I think if you did werewolves that would be fine, though, as long as it stayed clear of the really reviled furry tropes. (Being: "normal human waking up transformed into a furry and being super into it", "sex freely available", "everyone is really sexy").

If you want to do it with GM, could they perhaps be a bit horrific? I'm not sure if you've read /The Hunger Games/ but in the third book there's a character who's been surgically modified to look like a cat and it's described in a very "uncanny valley" type of way.

The other way is to literally sneak a catgirl or two into a story. So have a cast of, I don't know, one person in a robot drone body, someone who inhabits a swarm of tiny bee robots, one person in a natural human body (who is super looked down upon for being boring, natch), a cyborg, someone who has transformed themself into an elephant, and a cat person.
