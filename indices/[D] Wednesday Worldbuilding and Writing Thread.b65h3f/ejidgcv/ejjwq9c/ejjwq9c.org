I think also avoiding the standard "sexy" fursonas will help: so all dogs/wolves/foxes are out. As well as Lucario, Gardevoir, and Renamon.

Why do you want it to be furry specifically? Could you do it "feral" style, like Animals of Farthing Wood, Watership Down, or The Rats of NIMH? If so, then depending on your universe, you could even pass it off as fanfiction of one of the above.
