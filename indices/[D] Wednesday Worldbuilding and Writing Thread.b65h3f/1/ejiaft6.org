I'm working along writing a VRMMO fiction that focuses on a small company that (almost accidentally) creates the first true VR, when they try to build one up around an AI alternative. Mostly going to be a bunch of connected stories about the dev teams building the world and testing different aspects, formed into an overall narrative. There's a lot of Westworld-style ideas I want to apply, and character building I have ideas for, but I don't have a /solid/ outline, really. I mostly just want some fun fluffy writing to put in the rotation of my more serious/drama writing stuff.
