  Genre Savviness: characters are familiar with common genre tropes and try to avoid or exploit them.

So a cat girl - or her companions - would make jokes about her being a cat girl, and she would intentionally act in defiance of those tropes. Make the non-rationalist characters behave in ways where they "don't get it" on all sides of the spectrum (e.g. both overly furry and overly anti-furry).
