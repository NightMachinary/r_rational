The most important piece of advice I know is to imagine dropping humans in place of your furry characters; if the story still makes sense, then it's obvious that it's furry fiction instead of fiction containing some kind of anthropomorphic animal. There are plenty of ways around that: fantasy furries as another kind of elf/dwarf/orc/etc; SF with geneered critters; urban fantasy with shapeshifters; modern social commentary ala Zootopia; and more.

(Amateur authours have been asking similar questions for years about their favoured meta-genres, like the decades-old transformation story mailing list.)
