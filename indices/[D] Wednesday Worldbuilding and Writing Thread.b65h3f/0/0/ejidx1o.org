Don't forget Greg Egan's far-future novels, which feature universal immortality, uploading, and generally enlightened societies with very little conflict. Could be tough to set a story in that sort of setting, though- unless, like Egan, you're mostly just using it as a backdrop for clever thought experiments.

Another, more ambiguously utopian setting would be the pre-Melding Plague Yellowstone system from Alastair Reynolds' novels- which had a post-scarcity economy, ubiquitous transhumanism, and life extension, but also had psychopathic AIs, people trapped in "voluntary tyrannies", and which ultimately collapsed horrifically.
