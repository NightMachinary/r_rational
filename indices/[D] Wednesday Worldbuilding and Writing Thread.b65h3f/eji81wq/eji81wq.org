*Seeking: Eutopias*

I'm poking around with a new story idea, aiming at being more hopeful than my last one. So I'm trying to think up ways to exceed reedspacer's lower bound. I'm starting by jotting down the existing settings I can think of, and what they bring to the table. Can you suggest any ideas I may be neglecting?

--------------

- Iain Banks' "The Culture" (space! Immortality if you want it!) [bleah bored modosophonts] ?The Minds, drug glands?
- "Thousand Tales" (uploading! Immortality! Custom VRs and avatars! Important jobs to be done!) [bleah techno-primitivists, anti-upload terrorists] ?AIs?
- "The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect" (uploading! Immortality! VRs! safety!) [bleah boredom, bleah nihilism] ?PI's value-function?
- "Friendship is Optimal" (uploading & immortality & VRs! Custom communities!) [bleah constant nudging towards ponydom] ?CelestAI?
- Star Trek (space exploration! Strange aliens! Cute aliens!) [bleah hostile aliens, bleah wars]
- the "Bitchin Society" from Doctorow's "Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom" (clone-revival immortality!)
- Spider Robinson's telepathic future (a culture made out of sane people!)
- Elf Sternberg's "Pendor" (Space! Ringworld! Cute aliens!)
- Scott Alexander's "Archipelago" (liberal values! Communities for all sorts of folks!)
- "The Millennial Project: Colonizing the Galaxy in 8 Easy Steps" (space! Easy to start!)
- Varley's "Eight Worlds" (Space! Custom bodies & memory-backup immortality!) [bleah Earth being off-limits]
- Eclipse Phase (space! Tech! Uploading & immortality! Important jobs to be done (as part of Firewall)!) [bleah Titans, exsurgents, corp-states, people stuck in clanking masses] ?Prometheans?
- "Orion's Arm" (Space! Uploading and personal mental upgrading! Strange aliens!) [lots of bleahs: Queen of Pain, perversities, blights, etc] ?Higher-level minds?
- Disneyland (fun! Cute people!) [bleah capitalist-derived exclusivity]
- Oz, ruled by Ozma (fun! Safe! cute/strange nonhuman people!)
- James Cameron's "Avatar" (glowy plants & animals! A close-knit community!) [bleah techno-primitivism, bleah hostile militaries, bleah conflicts]
- "Ready Player One' (fun!) [bleah almost all non-VR life]
- some depictions of heaven (immortality! community!) [bleah exclusivity]
- the Harry Potter wizarding world (a "zeroth world" better-than-first-world society!) [bleah dementors, racism, etc]
