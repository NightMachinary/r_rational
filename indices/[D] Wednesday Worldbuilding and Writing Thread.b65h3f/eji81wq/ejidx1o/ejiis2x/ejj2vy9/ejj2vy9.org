Hard to answer for Greg Egan - many of his stories take specific elements or pieces of terminology from each other, but they don't build up into a single setting. (For one thing, the Earth would have been physically destroyed at least twice.)

Immortality! Uploading! Self-modification and copying, with the attendant existential mindfucks - except in stories where it's just normal. Space travel but no FTL, so people and cultures 10,000 years old with all the stability that implies. Post-scarcity, by the high standards of the main characters. (my favourite: in /Incandescence/, one character's request for enough energy to boost a 1kg supercomputer to relativistic speeds is described as "on the edge of politeness".) A taboo around exponential growth is mentioned sometimes, which might explain how they've managed to not use up any stars over the millenia, but it's unclear if this is something that everyone keeps to or just the characters who bring it up. No super-AI by authorial fiat - one story mentions a "General Intelligence Theorem" stating that all minds of at least human intelligence can solve the same class of problems, and the only real upgrades past that point are in speed and memory space. Ditto for aliens, when they exist.
