The snippet doesn't get far enough into the story for me to judge whether it's in the "furry valley" or not, unfortunately. I think the premise seems interesting/intriguing.

I also think life is too short to worry about shit like this. If it'll make you happy, write your furry story and don't try to hide it, if it's good people here will enjoy it.

  Which of the MC's possible reactions to the transformation would ring alarm bells?

It's more a writing style thing? That said: if the MC doesn't take the transformation as anything other than very, very weird and disturbing, it's going to seem furry. Like, in a furry story I imagine the MC being all "this is weird... but having a tail is neat!" and then doing some random wish fulfillment stuff with the tail or pretending to be a sick puppy and having cute girls pet it, etc.

I'm trying to think of an analogy, and just imagine you were reading a story and they spend a /lot/ of time describing the feet of the characters, and take care to mention shoes even in passing. There's also a scene where one character helps the other put the shoe on their uniform (or something) which seems to be described in excessive detail.

Unless you're into feet, it'll be jarring and make you wonder if something's going on.

But again: write the damn story you want to write. Fill it with yiffing if you want, and honestly you'd probably get a bigger audience on a furry fandom website than on this subreddit. And regardless, if you're good, you'll help make the community here more diverse which can only be a good thing!
