If I had to give you one suggestion, it's that people are very willing to accept furries /as long as they aren't called that./ As long as you call them monsters, as long as you give them weird names or add decorators to their species, as long as you keep in mind that "monster" is just code for "stacked furry" and therefore the furryness is already baked in, you don't have to worry about anything.

Look at [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/20364/chimera][Chimera,]], the MC just goes full furry and it doesn't come off as furry. As long as you stay away from the /language/ of furry culture, you should have a wide latitude to crib the /aesthetics./
