As someone who generally hates furry stuff:

Most furry stuff is in the "funny animals" style, rather than actual anthropomorphized animal style. Most of the weird and strange things about animals get sanded away to make them more appealing to humans. It's much easier to tell visually though, and in terms of text, I'll tend to immediately bounce from any story with anthro animals just because it's so likely to be furry stuff that I'd rather not bother.

(This is pretty common for people who have exposure to fetish stuff that they don't like; if someone gets pregnant in a story, they're much more likely to assume that this is fetishistic than just someone getting pregnant as part of the story in a non-fetish way, and they're leave before the assumed fetish stuff happens. So you've got that working against you.)

As for how to predict whether or not something is fetish material, and therefore disguise fetish material as non-fetish material ... a lot of it is vocabulary, and some of it is just the attention and focus of the prose. Fetish vocabulary often mimics that of erotica in its descriptions of the object of fetish, which for furry stuff is, e.g. tails, paws, fur, etc. All that stuff then gets a lot of description and mention in the prose, much more than you would expect of a non-fetish version. The near-constant reminders are a big signal.

I personally think it's pretty doomed. Furries are a well-known group, and most people will just (correctly) assume that you're a furry if you're writing about anthro animals, regardless of what's in the text itself.
