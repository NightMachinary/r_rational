Its a quest like Marked for death,so you don't make a character ,all the players make one character and vote what the character will do that update.

You can just enter and propose a plan ,or vote current ones (though right now not because I'm still writing next chapter).

So far there is few people and the adventure just started, so your votes can actually change a lot.\\
Wining plans so far had only 2 or 3 votes .
