Oh I love that as an idea. I sort of don't want her to lose the Mantle of Woe, but it makes a lot of sense, would probably bind Akua to the realm and once they beat Larat would leave her as its custodian and guide. Even fits with Liesse being the focal point of the realm.

Edit: also, in losing Akua to an eternity repenting by guiding people through a ruin of her own creation, the Woe loses their placeholder Spellslinging knowledge fountain (and sixth ranger). Which in turn makes room for Masego to re-join the band in his regular Role.

I expect that this outcome is Very Likely, providing that Masego survives the encounter. If he doesn't, then I don't think Cat will give up her bound spellcaster so easily. Roland is great, but I can't imagine him sticking around long term.
