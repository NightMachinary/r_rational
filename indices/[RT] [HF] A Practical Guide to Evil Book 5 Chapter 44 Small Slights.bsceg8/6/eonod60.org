There are now enough extra crowns such that they don't even have to use the ones from the Proceran mobs: Cat, Pilgrim, Tyrant, Spellblade, Thief of Stars, The Good King, Skien, Black Knight, and Dead King. That's 9 right there.

I doubt that all of these super powerful crowns will be even used, but it's an interesting alternative.
