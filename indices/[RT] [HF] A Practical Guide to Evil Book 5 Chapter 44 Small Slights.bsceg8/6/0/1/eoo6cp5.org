I said this in a previous comment, but I think rule is more ambiguous than a title. I think Black would qualify since the legions follow him, although it might not count any more since his encounter with Pilgrim if the prerequisite is 'Able to Rule' and 'Currently Ruling'.

If it's just the former he should still count since I don't doubt he could raise banners and get a fair amount behind him. Not the Praes nobility, or most of Callow, but the soldiers definitely. Probably a lot of Praes's commoners would as well if he's seen as the boogeyman for corrupt leaders.
