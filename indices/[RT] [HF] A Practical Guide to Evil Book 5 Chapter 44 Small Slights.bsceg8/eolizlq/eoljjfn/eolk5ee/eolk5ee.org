Direct intervention to move from one place to another invites them being snatched out of the air (like what happened when the Skein intervened) whereas putting them in a fight against the Dead King puts them on a footing where Sve Noc is the offence, not evasion. There's a Lot more weight behind them intervening here than if she'd done so earlier to teleport.
