I think yes he's baiting this, but in falling for the bait Cat gets to take a page out of Kairos' book. The first step always works. If you play into the Dead Kings bait, you get to use the Good King in conjunction with an army of Callowan Spirits. That lets you fight back all the devils and win this encounter. All you need to do then is Not use the Good Kings crown. Which Cat should be smart enough not to do. It fits her arc better I think to use her own.
