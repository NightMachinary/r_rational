I th√Ønk with this you're not really "moving," but you're getting swapped with stuff. This avoids any kind of relativity questions, except temporal paradoxes(?), because light gets shifted with you. Wonky things will probably happen with photo SN getting chopped up at higher speeds though, but I think that's a completely different scenario than red shift.
