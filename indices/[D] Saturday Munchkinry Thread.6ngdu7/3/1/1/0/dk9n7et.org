  It occurs to me that you could potentially use this to travel to other planets depending on the cooldown and activation process, though you'd obviously require a space suit. If you can cycle the staff at about a billion Hz, you could reach Mars at its closest approach in a little over 30 seconds.

The 0.1s cool-down makes this less effective, but you could probably still get to orbit.

Larry Niven goes into some of the issues with this in /Theory and Practice of Teleportation/. He calls it the "end teleport drive". At least one of the problems (sweeping up hydrogen gas) is solved by the particle swap trick, and at 0.1s cool-down you won't have to worry about your eyes not working because you're moving too fast for the light focused by the lens to reach the retina.
