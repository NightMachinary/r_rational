It occurs to me that you could potentially use this to travel to other planets depending on the cooldown and activation process, though you'd obviously require a space suit. If you can cycle the staff at about a billion Hz, you could reach Mars at its closest approach in a little over 30 seconds.

Landing would be a little tricky. You'd need to cancel differences in relative velocity which would mean you'd need to find the side you're moving away from and then get close to it while still outside the atmosphere, and keep bringing yourself close to it as you slow down. Once you're in the right ballpark, you'd need to use a handheld long-range doppler radar to measure your relative speed and go the surface right as your speed matches the planet's surface. Obviously, adjustment for surface rotation would also need to be considered. It might be easier to start with a polar landing and then gradually work your way towards the equator over the span of a few minutes.

I wonder how much you could get paid to work as a martian repair contractor for NASA?
