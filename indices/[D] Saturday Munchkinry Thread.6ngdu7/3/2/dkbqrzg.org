Hmmm.

Let us say I have a piece of string tied around my ankle. This is thin, ultralight string, and it leads a very long way away (a couple of kilometres). At the end of that range, it is tied to a net, which covers a small object. The total weight of string-plus-object is under the 100-pound limit. This implies that I can teleport - rotating me-plus-staff-plus-srting-plus-object - such that the object instantly travels several kilometres, as long as there is an unobstructed path from me to the destination for the string?

I could, presumably, throw something a few kilometres up in the air this way, for example?
