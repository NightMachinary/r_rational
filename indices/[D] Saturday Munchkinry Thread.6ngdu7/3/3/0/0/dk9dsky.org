Then, including your "effective speed of roughly half the speed of sound" addition, the only obvious to me abuse is to use the staf as a shuttle. That is, transporting things to the orbit. You can probably build a satellite up there, 100 pounds minus the mass of a spacesuit and a parachute at the time.

Also, I assume the teleportation itself actually has a finite sublight speed, because you might crush the universe by using the staff otherwise.
