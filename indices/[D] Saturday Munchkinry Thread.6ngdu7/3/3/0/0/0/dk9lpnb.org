It's not possible to use for putting things in orbit now that he's edited to provide a cooldown. It will let you move at up to 500 feet per second, or 152.4 m/s. Bear in mind that not acceleration, it's just movement. He also didn't state that it does anything to alter your velocity, so presumably you'll be falling as you go up with it.

Near the Earth's surface, terminal velocity for a human is about 54 m/s, so you can easily exceed terminal velocity and continue to climb. Once you reach about 12 km (39,000 ft.), air density will be low enough that your terminal velocity will approximately match your climb speed.

You can still use it to fly if you take a parachute, but space is no longer an option.
