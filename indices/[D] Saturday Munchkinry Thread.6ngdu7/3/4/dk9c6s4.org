So it's basically a 5 foot teleport that can't go through solid objects (unless there's a convenient staff-shaped hole), tied to an artifact that would be difficult to conceal?

The only munchkinry I can see at a glance depends heavily on the rules.

How does it determine what constitutes an object (and what it means to touch it)? If I'm touching a house, can I teleport 100 pounds of bricks with me? Could I take part of a person's body, or some water from a pool, or a portion of a pile of ball bearings?

Depending on the answers there, it might make that aspect of the power borderline useless (e.g. you might not even be able to carry a backpack, because you're not touching the contents and they're not one object).

What is the priority for trying to teleport while touching multiple things with a total weight of over 100 pounds? E.g. if I bring a 99 pound object with me, might I end up naked? If I'm standing barefoot on a table, might it teleport with me instead of something else I wanted? Again, you might run into problems using this ability if the priority isn't easily controlled (though it seems likely to be mental somehow, as otherwise controlling the power /at all/ would be difficult).

Worst case scenario it teleports you without any medical implants (e.g. fillings, hip/knee replacements, pacemaker, sutures), which would be quite bad for your ability to use it.

The last rule says that you can't rotate relative to the staff. Does that mean you and the staff can rotate relative to other things as long as the staff overlap requirement is met?

Finally, is there a cooldown to this ability? If you can use it extremely quickly to more or less fly forward (or even literally fly), that'd be very useful. But if you need to wait even a few seconds before using it again it basically becomes "walking v2".
