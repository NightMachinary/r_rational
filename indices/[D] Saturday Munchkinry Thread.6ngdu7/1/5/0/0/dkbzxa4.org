  You would probably need multiple drop shafts in your prison because humans and food have different terminal velocities.

It only matters if the food goes splat at the bottom if you care about your prisoners. You might very well not.

  Hoverboots don't work, as those only work while they have something solid to push against for the same reason that helicopters produce way more lift 100 feet from the ground.

So you freefall down the shaft until you're a hundred feet from the ground. If your resulting deceleration is over a long enough period, you can still use hoverboots to survive a terminal-velocity fall. (I don't know whether or not hoverboots have a sufficient effective distance to make that practical, and 'survive' would involve doing a lot of bouncing in any case).
