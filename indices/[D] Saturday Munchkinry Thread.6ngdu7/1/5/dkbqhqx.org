If I jump into a pit that has a glyph at the bottom, facing up... at first, the force the glyph exerts on me is minimal. But, the closer I get to the glyph, the stronger the force. If the glyph is the right size (that it causes the average human to float about ten centimetres above the ground at rest) then can I safely jump into the pit and reach the bottom uninjured?

If I have a pit without a glyph, then, can I throw down a glyph (say, on a metal plate), double-check that the light is there, and then jump down?

Or safely jump into a deep pit while wearing my hoverboots?

Mind you, getting out again is a different problem. Actually, that means that this might be how they handle prisons - drop the prisoner onto the glyph, drop food down on occasion, and /maybe/ let a rope down if there's reason to let someone out.
