Power is renewable and cheap. Windmills are useless, because glyphmills are smaller, cheaper, and more reliable. Similarly, plows are fitted with glyphs instead of animals.

Trade is much simpler, cheaper, and faster. Almost every vehicle would become a hovercraft (glyphs sound cheaper than wheels and oxen), and global trade networks would flourish.

Jetpacks!
