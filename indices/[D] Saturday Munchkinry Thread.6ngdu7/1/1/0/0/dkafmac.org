If it's only one city, then having (pseudo) moving sidewalks might be viable instead of vehicles. Simply have a sawtooth pattern with the glyphs drawn on the angled side.

This could be either for major freight routes, or else everywhere. Setup would be expensive, but wear and erosion should be very slow, as nothing actually touches the surface.

Alternatively, just have "Hoverways" that provide no thrust but can go in either direction without friction.
