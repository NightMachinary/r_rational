I haven't worked out exact numbers yet, but you'd need something like a three inch diameter glyph to exert enough force to cut tougher materials, and at that size the glyph is more bludgeoning the material rather than cutting it. Increasing the curve of a parabolic array is considered even greater inaccuracy, so that doesn't work either.

You could create a massive array of small glyphs arranged parabolically, but that again presents the problem of size and amount of labor required to set up the system. Available space isn't infinite in this world.

It might be possible to use glyphs to set up some kind of heat engine hot enough to use as a welding torch, though.
