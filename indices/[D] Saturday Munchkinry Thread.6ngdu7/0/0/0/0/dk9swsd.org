  Six months inside the arctic circle.
#+end_quote

Actually only 48 hours at the edge of the arctic circle (ignoring atmospheric effects). The day before the winter solstice will be a minute long, followed by ~23:59 of night, then /no/ day for the winter solstice, another 24:00 of night, then a minute of day.
