Ok so your first goal should be to accrue resources for the later steps in this world domination plan. Do this by adding some googly eyes to computers and imagining that they are maximally intelligent and loyal servants, who have access to their own source code, think at incredible speed, and are extremely motivated, basically just max out every attribute you can apply to them. If the access to source code thing works then they should be able to figure out how to improve themselves into a FAI pretty quickly given subjective time letting you win in hours or days.\\
Otherwise have your many googly eyed laptops/smartphones take many online jobs each getting you more money which with to buy more laptops to googly eye, basically you'll be making a sort of intelligent server farm. Having hundreds of these diligent servants working on getting you resources they should be able to make you a millionaire (at least) within a year using a massive variety of techniques from the basic online work specified earlier to exploiting their high thinking speed to do high frequency trading, using social engineering to do scams or hire people do various real world tasks, etc.\\
Then you should get bases far into the arctic and antarctic to exploit the months long nights.

Now earlier your servants would have been finding geniuses to hire online (through looking at social media or perhaps by creating an online IQ test that's actually valid and using it to find geniuses). The purpose of this is to come up with some excuse to get them to create something (could be a sculpture, a googly eyed computer or anything really) that they imagine to be totally loyal to their employer and possessing of all the other qualities mentioned previously. You only need to get one genius to complete this weird task then you can ship your creation to you and animate it, and if it has the attributes you asked for then it can create more of itself getting you more servants this time limited to the smartest genius your servants can find. Obviously you can create many thousands of servants like this animating whatever the smallest functional interface you can get for your purposes is.

At this point you are probably starting to realize why I said this is a world domination scheme. Since you can have your army of world class genius servants (you should be able to find one supergenius to do your weird task or who you can bring on board with your plans, motivations not an issue since the only limiting factor on mental attributes is your own intelligence). Now simply have your super fast geniuses work on science and technology and not only can you make more money through shell companies but you should be able to solve problems like safe GAI that would take decades or more otherwise.
