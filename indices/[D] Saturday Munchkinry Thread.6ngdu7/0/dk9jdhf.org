You have a tablet similar to what was shown in the first Night at the Museum movie with some additional more clearly defined rules.

- Radius of effect is 100 m, forming a sphere centered on the tablet location. Tablet is only operational during the night (when the mass of the earth sufficiently blocks some inhibiting influence of the sun). When exiting the area of effect during the evening and when the effect ends during the day, animated objects simply return to their unanimated state.

- In the area of effect, objects are animated based on the intentional/unintentional thoughts and knowledge of their creator. For example, a wax model of Einstein will act as the artist imagines Einstein would act and would only as intelligent and knowledgeable as the artist. Animated objects retain memory from previous animations. Subsequent animation behavior is influenced by this memory and any decisions made. (i.e. personal growth/learning is possible). Objects created without any sort of intent for representation, like a table, will not animate. A motor would not animate, but a complete system like a robot might.

- Objects that were previously alive are also influenced by their previous sense of self. For example, an animated unmodified dead person will act like and have the memories of the person right before they died. However, dead components that have been made part of a larger creation (say, a dinosaur skeleton display composed of real and cast fossils) will be influenced by their previous experiences and the artist/constructor to greater or lesser amounts.

- Deceased organic tissue will return to its living state under the effect. Any additional mass gained is taken from an unanimated mass within the area of effect. Regeneration is limited and whole missing tissue will not reappear. No regrown limbs, organs, etc.

- Animated objects are limited to internal force generation for their motion. No floating rocks and the like. Capability to sense light/sound/force etc. is possible if intended. Object strength is limited to their constituent components. Overall power and energy is not unlimited and is capped at some value each evening (collected/stored/generated by tablet over time).

What interesting ways might you take advantage of this tablet?
