If their power is a camera, then the solution is straightforward: turn off the lights.

Hire a bunch of people to dress up in identical full body gear that covers every part of their body. Wear the same equipment, and all of you walk into a completely dark room. Then walk out in some random order. The people you hire thus become your body doubles, since the "omniscient" person is unable to tell who is who as long as everyone keeps wearing their identical full body gear.

Now if the "omniscient" person tries to attack, odds are high that a body double is attacked, and now you can attempt to trace the attack back to the source in order to reveal the "omniscient" person.
