Well, what can the person actually /do/? Like, are they just a normal human being with a nifty farsight ability? Because if they're actually trying to integrate into society and search /efficiently/, the ability is practically useless without unusual multitasking abilities, and don't have any apparent uses for gaining power other than easy spying for blackmail. And information brokering. Hmm, actually that could be pretty useful.

It's literally impossible to look at 6 billion people's faces in under a decade - there's ~300 million /seconds/ in a year, so they're fucked on their own, and that's assuming you don't go make yourself a hermit in the middle of nowhere.

Aaaand this is getting boring. They build up power, you look for people to build up power.

Actually, scrap that. You get plastic surgery and a reliable fake identity and you're set for life.

...wait, did you say they already know who you are and already looking at you (i.e. know /where/ you are)? Because if so, you're more-or-less fucked if they have any brains.
