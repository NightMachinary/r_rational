Well a text-based game where a 'massive' amount of players can play and interact is something that could be done in a few days if you contract a few coders. I think it is then technically an MMO.

And having stats that have to affect the game in a certain way is really hard to translate into real life I think. I get your point but since this is munchinkry I have to point that out. I could just make one slider on make game's character creation that goes from "Horrible" to "Everything is Awesome" and have to game be really easy and 'awesome' if that is maxed.

About INT and WIS in mmo's. Those are simulating real life intelligence or wisdom. You don't have real life skill checks. So stats would be useless I guess if they don't translate into what we perceive as intelligence, wisdom, strength, health or luck (...).
