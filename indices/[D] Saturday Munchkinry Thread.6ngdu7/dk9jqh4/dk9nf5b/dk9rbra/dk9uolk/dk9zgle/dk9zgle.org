Unless you expect ROB to play admin to nerf anything that might disrupt the status quo, this world won't last long. Assume that you can't just spawn antimatter or black holes or negatively charged strangelets or the up quarks of any substance without the down quarks. What happens if someone runs an infinite loop? What happens if someone runs AIXI-tl? What happens if someone copies the state of the world and runs it in a simulation (which recursively does the same), in order to probably retroactively have been ROB all along?
