  Well a text-based game where a 'massive' amount of players can play and interact is something that could be done in a few days if you contract a few coders. I think it is then technically an MMO.

Probably. But as I said, I meant for the idea to be that you pick an existing IP. It's certaintly an interesting munchkin I didn't think of, but allowing it bypasses the "mmo" part of my prompt, which is the only thing that really distinguishes it from any other arbitrary wish-giving munchkin.

  About INT and WIS in mmo's. Those are simulating real life intelligence or wisdom. You don't have real life skill checks. So stats would be useless I guess if they don't translate into what we perceive as intelligence, wisdom, strength, health or luck (...).

They wouldn't be useless, however-- the mechanics would be copied from the game to real life. So, for example, you'd have a mana pool defined to be some integer, and be able to cast spells using it. Have you read any LitRPGs before, or watched log horizon? That's the basic idea. Now, in some games, having a high INT or WIS actually makes your character smarter, but usually your character is exactly as intelligent as you are. If you can find an MMO with that mechanic, then great. But be wary of the opportunity of choosing that MMO over another one. After all, no game is perfect...
