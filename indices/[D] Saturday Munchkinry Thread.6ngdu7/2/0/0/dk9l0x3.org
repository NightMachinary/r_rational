1. You choose the MMO. I actually made a slight mistake, though-- I meant to say that you told the MMO which ROB to pick, and they'd implement the changes two weeks later. I'll edit that in now.

2. Yes.

3. Doesn't work for two reasons. One, even if that screen did exist, it's hardly an MMO-- there's no multiplayer gameplay whatsoever. Two, if there are no in-game mechanics to affect those stats, they don't actually do anything. Maxing out INT or WIS in an MMO doesn't actually make your avatar smarter or wiser, for example, it just makes it easier to pass some skill checks and increases their mana pool. There are a few exceptions to this (ex. Fallout) but it's not the kind of thing you see in multiplayer games.
