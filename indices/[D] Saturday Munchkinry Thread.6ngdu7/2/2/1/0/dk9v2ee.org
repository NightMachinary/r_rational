Last time I remember grey goo being an issue was ten years ago, about the time they basically nerfed all the scripting. Like the fastest physical movement you can script these days is only about 3 times the speed of light (may actually be as low as 1.2 c now, been a while since I experimented). Not like the old days when you could physical-teleport past MAXINT meters in a fraction of a second - that's "I don't know how high I am because my script to measure my altitude pegged".

And here's me as a cartoon squirrel flying a version of Mehve that I built and scripted several years back: [[http://www.sluniverse.com/snapzilla/image/view/286220/Argent-Stonecutter-Squirl-of-the-valley-of-the-winds]]
