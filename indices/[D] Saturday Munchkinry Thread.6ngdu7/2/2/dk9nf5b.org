  Which MMO do you choose to maximize your own values?

Second Life. Infinite inventory with symlinks, you can change shape, gender, species at will. You can fly and teleport. Programmers are demigods who can create magical items at the drop of a script. Physical damage just doesn't happen unless you forget to fly in a damage-enabled zone, or get hit by a properly scripted bullet (normal impacts don't do anything, you have to fall miles)... and even there the worst that can ever happen to you is teleporting home. It's not respawning, it's just a normal teleport.
