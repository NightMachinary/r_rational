You've been informed by an ROB that it will be choosing an MMO. Two weeks hence, and from then on, anyone above the age of twenty one will get a character creation screen that will imbue them with the same sorts of powers/abilities/mechanics/classes/races/whatever that a character from that MMO would have. The sole exception will be that respawning after death no longer functions (although people will still be able to cast resurrection spells).

1. Which MMO do you choose to maximize your own values?\\
2. What do you do to prepare yourself in the intervening two weeks.

Do note that there won't suddenly be quests or monsters; xp gain will therefore be extraordinary difficult, and no magical items will be dropping (with the exception of items gained through character creation or leveling up).

(If you're wondering, I was inspired by the excellent, albeit nonrational, SAO fanfic "fairy dance of death.")
