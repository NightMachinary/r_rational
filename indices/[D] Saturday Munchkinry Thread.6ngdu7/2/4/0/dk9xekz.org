I don't know about you, but I'd be perfectly happy to self-identify as an F-102 starfighter :P

I don't really think WoT counts as an MMO, but ignoring that for a bit, the "player character" of these games is typically understood to be the person driving the tank or piloting the spaceship. Both EVE and WoT, IIRC, have skills that those commanders can train, which is what you'd get out of the ROB. That being said, you're completely free to pick a game where that's not the case, and you're genuinely a nonperson, but I don't know how much that would fulfil your values.
