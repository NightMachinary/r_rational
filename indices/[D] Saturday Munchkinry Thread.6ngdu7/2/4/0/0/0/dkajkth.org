I'm pretty sure WoT isn't "capable of supporting large numbers of players, typically from hundreds to thousands, simultaneously in the same instance (or world).[1] " They call it an MMO for marketing reasons, but it's just smaller scale, instanced arena gameplay. (unless they've added some persistent mode I don't know about.)
