I wouldn't worry about being found. If it takes them 1 day of surveillance to determine whether or not a person knows about the omniscience, then it would /only/ take 20 million years to check everyone. If you can reduce it to 1 second instead of 1 day, it's just over 200 years instead.

I'm not seeing a solution other than "Nuke the parts of the planet where you aren't".
