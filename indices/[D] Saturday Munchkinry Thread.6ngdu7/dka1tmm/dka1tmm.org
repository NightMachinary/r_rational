You're aware that there's an "omniscient" person somewhere on the planet, but you don't know where they are, nor do you know any identifying details like height, gender, race, age, etc. They don't actually know everything; what they actually have is a power roughly equivalent to an invisible, intangible surveillance camera, a "viewpoint", which they can move freely at will, as well as teleporting it to given coordinates or a place it's been before. They can hear as well as see through their viewpoint.

This person knows who you are and they are presumably looking at you much of the time, because their goal in this "game" is to kill you as quickly as possible. How do you protect yourself and ultimately identify and disable/kill your "omniscient" opponent? First assume that you don't know how rational they are and have to deduce it from their actions, and then assume that they're as rational as you are.
