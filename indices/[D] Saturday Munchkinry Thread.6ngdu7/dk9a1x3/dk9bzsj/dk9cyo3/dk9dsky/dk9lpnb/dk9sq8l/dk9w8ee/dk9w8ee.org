  The artifact doesn't accelarate you, true, but you will still gain speed due to falling between teleports.

Yes, agreed on this point.

  but low orbits should be doable

No. You teleport instantaneously, then wait for a hundredth of a second for the cooldown (falling in the meantime), then teleport again. Thus, although you can climb a total of 500 ft. per second, you will also fall for a total of one second per second. Once your altitude exceeds about 12,000 m, your terminal velocity will just about match your climb speed and you'll fall about as fast as you can climb.
