You have a 5 foot staff which allows you to teleport. There are five stipulations. First, you can only teleport such that the staff's destination position at least partly overlaps with its origin location. Second, you must be touching the staff to teleport, and the staff always comes with you. Third, you can take up to 100 pounds with you, so long as you're touching them too. Fourth, you cannot destroy or alter the staff. Fifth, you, the staff, and equipment cannot rotate relative to the staff during teleportation.

Assume that you have access to more efficient forms of energy than the staff can provide, because I find hooking up magic items to generators to be really boring.

*Clarifying Edits*: Teleporting swaps you with whatever is at your destination. If the density of any possible cubic centimeter of space at your destination is greater than 2 kg/m3 then no teleportation will occur. (In other words, you swap with air but not with water or people.)

Cooldown time is .01 seconds.

Touching ... is a horribly abstract concept. Let's say 1 cubic centimeter of your flesh must be within 1 centimeter of 1 cubic centimeter of the object in question, and your flesh must be touching the rest of your flesh (so no cutting off your finger and setting it down next to a pile of gold, but you could flense yourself and teleport things your flesh whips are touching).

If you're touching multiple things, then you decide what to bring. If you're touching too many things, then you decide that you're bringing fewer things or just don't teleport.

You and the staff can rotate relative to other things.

I am not going to define "object" but a general rule would be that you can't teleport things that you would need much force to remove from other things, so simply gluing things down would stop you from teleporting them, but simple friction would not. Alternately, use [[/u/eaglejarl]]'s "shrink-wrap" rule, i.e. an object is an object if you could completely surround it with shrink wrap. But "what's an object" is too big a question.
