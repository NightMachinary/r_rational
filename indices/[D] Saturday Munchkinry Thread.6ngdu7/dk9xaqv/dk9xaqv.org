There is a glyph you can draw on a surface which, once the central circle is complete, will begin emitting red light. The red light exerts force on matter inside it, pushing those objects away from the glyph. This force is not reactionless, and the energy to do this (plus a little to account for distance) is stolen from the nearest star.

The force emitted by the glyph scales with the size of the glyph and the accuracy with which it is drawn. A small glyph rapidly sketched out in the sand will emit less than a pound of force and probably be obliterated by the reaction force. A huge glyph professionally inlaid in a reinforced steel plate can exert tons of force. The distance that this effect travels scales with its strength, a weak glyph will only extend a few feet as it is attenuated by pushing air, a huge one can go miles. The light cannot penetrate matter which is opaque to light, and it can be reflected.

What are good uses of this power? Assume a Victorian understanding of mechanics and that electricity has not been harnessed.
