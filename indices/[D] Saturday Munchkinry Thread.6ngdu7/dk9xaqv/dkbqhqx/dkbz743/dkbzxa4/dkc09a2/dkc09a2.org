Hoverboots with glyphs small enough to be reasonably called boots won't save you if you enter their effective range at terminal velocity. They can counter your own mass plus a little to produce lift, not your own mass plus 120 mph of kinetic energy.

Edit: also, if you don't care about your prisoners, why are you being kind enough to drop them into a pit with a glyph at the bottom?
