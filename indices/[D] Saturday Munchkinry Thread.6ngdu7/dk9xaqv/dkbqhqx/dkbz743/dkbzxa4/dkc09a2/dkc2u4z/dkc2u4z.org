  Hoverboots with glyphs small enough to be reasonably called boots won't save you if you enter their effective range at terminal velocity. They can counter your own mass plus a little to produce lift, not your own mass plus 120 mph of kinetic energy.

Okay, fair enough. What about if I wear boots which are welded onto large sheets of metal with /big/ glyphs on? Call them "parachute boots", perhaps.

  Edit: also, if you don't care about your prisoners, why are you being kind enough to drop them into a pit with a glyph at the bottom?

Maybe I don't want to personally spill anyone's blood because I'm squeamish, but I don't care about them having to scrape their food off the glyph?
