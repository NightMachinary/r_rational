Hoverboots don't work, as those only work while they have something solid to push against for the same reason that helicopters produce way more lift 100 feet from the ground.

A jetpack designed to produce enough lift that the reaction force on the air is enough to keep you up would work, but those have the problem of being extremely hard to fly. No computers means no electronic stabilization. Also you have to reduce lift as you get close to the ground because you just bounce off otherwise.

You would probably need multiple drop shafts in your prison because humans and food have different terminal velocities. Also, the amount of lift you experience is proportional to the surface area you expose to the light, so that might do strange things to your hover height in the glyph as well.

The glyph drop idea is interesting, but the hole you're jumping into would have to be just the right width that you wouldn't risk falling uncontrolled out of the light column. A parachute or a rope is a better idea.
