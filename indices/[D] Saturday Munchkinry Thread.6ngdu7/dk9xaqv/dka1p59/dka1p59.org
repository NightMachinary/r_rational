Here are the uses I can see for this:

1. For defense: imagine the great Wall of China but with massive glyphs on the side. It would be nearly impenetrable.

2. For offense: These obviously could be used for weapons. Additionally, large mobile glyphs could be used to knock down large swathes of enemies

3. For unlimited free energy: Since this is the victorian time period, they probably wouldn't use it for electricity. However, they could definitely create something similar to a waterwheel or a steam engine using a glyph that take itself apart and puts itself back together again.

4. Hovercrafts/ hover-boots: A glyph that can provide constant force could be used to provide levitation and by angling them correctly, you could change your direction. This could provide free transportation. A sufficiently big enough one could be used as a rocket.

5. As a bomb: put two incomplete glyphs near each other and complete them and you've got yourself something that explodes violently in two pieces.

With creative thinking, the uses of such a glyph are endless. This sort of magic would change the economy and potentially jump-start the industrial revolution.
