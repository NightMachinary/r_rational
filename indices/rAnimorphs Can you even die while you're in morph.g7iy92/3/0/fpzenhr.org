So, I (think I) know that there's a "gate" located on or in a morph construct somewhere, and that's really what real bodies demorph "out" of. That's how the Ellimist transported the Animorphs to the hillside when the meteor struck, that's why it would be a problem to get eaten in morph, etc. Knowing this has helped explain a lot of little things throughout the series, but I'm fairly certain I read it in one of your comments here a long, long time ago, and I don't think it's ever been directly mentioned in the fic. This fairly minor piece of info is starting to feel like a cheat code or something - is it ever gonna be spelled out in the story? Or did I just forget it the first time it was mentioned and then somehow miss it every time I've dipped randomly into old chapters?

Quick edit: Also, ever since the Rachel seizure stuff started happening and I realized the emulator probably saves a copy of your brain every time you're in it, I've been thinking about Cassie a /lot/.
