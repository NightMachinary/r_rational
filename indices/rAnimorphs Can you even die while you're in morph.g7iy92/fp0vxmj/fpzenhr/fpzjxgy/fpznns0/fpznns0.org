Cool.

Also, don't apologise for subtlety! I can't speak for other readers, but personally I kinda /love/ the moments where a thing is said little or lightly or quickly. Every time there's an "I skipped the obvious question" or an "I could tell what she was thinking by the look on her face" or whatever, it's like a little puzzle trying to figure out what's going unsaid. Solving the puzzle is uniquely very, very satisfying - I'm not used to my fiction challenging me like that.

Of course, that's when the hole is pointed out. It's perfectly likely that there are other things going unsaid, but they're things that characters aren't /specifically/ not-saying, so I'm just happily skating along and missing subtext left and right. But I'm not too worried about it :)
