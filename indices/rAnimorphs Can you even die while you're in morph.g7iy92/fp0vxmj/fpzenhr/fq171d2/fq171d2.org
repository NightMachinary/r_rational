  Only six-three-four-eight-one. We do not understand. It is teleportation, but /teleportation/ is only a word; it is not a /meaning/. It is not a /how/ or a /why/.

  [We have the situation under control. Peter Levy and Tom Berenson will not injure Ax. Based on the interlink signals, these others with me are Jake Berenson, Marco Levy, Garrett Steinberg, and the female.]

  We do not understand. Where are their construct bodies?

  [They do not have any.]

  This is not a /meaning/.

  [They are emerging directly from the gate, with no construct to disassemble.]

  This is not a /meaning/.

  [There is no evidence of footsteps or other disturbances to the area around us. Whatever process brought us here likely also brought Peter Levy and Tom Berenson and Ax and the gates of Jake Berenson, Marco Levy, Garrett Steinberg, and the female.]
