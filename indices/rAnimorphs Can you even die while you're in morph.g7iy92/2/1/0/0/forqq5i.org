In canon your body is literally changing into whatever animal you morph. You aren't an emulated mind remote-controlling a construct body, and how you go on thinking with a fly brain is just never questioned.

There's a lot of close calls, but I can't think of an example of someone actually dying in morph. Pretty much every character including the Andalites assumes you would just be dead, though.
