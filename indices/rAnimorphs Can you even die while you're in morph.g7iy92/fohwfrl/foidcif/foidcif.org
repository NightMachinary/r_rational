You shouldn't be able to die while you're in someone else's morph, but I think you can demorph from corpses in general.

“It demorphed. David, I mean. While we weren't looking. Demorphed out of a corpse, turned back into David, and it had a ton of weapons, and it---it shot Rachel, shot Garrett, shot Ax.”

V3 in David's body in dies while morphed as Jake, then demorphs and continues murdering. They didn't have time to check if he had actually died or if it was just a lethal blow though, they called him a corpse but they could just be wrong.

Also, from one of the Marcos on the Hork-Bajir planet:

"You could demorph from a corpse, if your animal body was killed. But if you'd already been eaten---"

This seems to suggest that the body still has to be more or less intact, even if it's dead. Or maybe it just means that demorphing after you've been eaten doesn't really help?

I've been a bit confused about this because it never really comes up and it feels pretty important. They do use morph armor though, I'd always thought of it as for non-lethal damage only but it seems like it would work on actually dying also. That being said I haven't come up with a use for it, aside from death technically just being a KO if the rest of your party wins the fight and controls the battlefield long enough for you to demorph and remorph.
