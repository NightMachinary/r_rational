As the OP points out, we saw Garrett maintain consciousness (or emulated consciousness at least) while in a morph and then having his morphed body itself tucked away inside /Rachel's/ morph.

This was intended to be strong evidence that it is at least possible under /some/ circumstances to remain conscious even if the functioning of the morph body is completely stopped (stasis is different from death, but in some sense they share this property).

We've seen a couple of instances showing that the interface might be susceptible to damage or disruption, though. People below have mentioned the unconscious person who ended up as a Tyagi clone.

And nobody's asked what might have happened to Cassie's mind once the bird body was thoroughly vaporized, including the nanotech that could have brought her back (leaving her true body tucked away in a Z-space pocket dimension somewhere, along with the little boy, with a battery slowly ticking down to zero).
