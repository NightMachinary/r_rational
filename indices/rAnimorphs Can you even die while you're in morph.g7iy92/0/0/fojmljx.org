But why should you ever lose consciousness? Your brain is in z space, not in the fly. Why does it matter at all if the fly loses consciousness, or even is dead? Fly brains are tiny so whatever damage your brain would take through issues with the interface should be tiny although I guess the interface perhaps magnifies them to help you use fly signals better.

I think it would be more accurate to say that you're fine as long as the interface between the fly and Z space isn't squished. If the interface is squished then you can't use it to demorph and pull yourself out of z space.

Hm perhaps the interface between the fly and z space somehow doesn't work unless the fly is conscious. That seems like it would be a design flaw more than anything tbh - why should the fly brain be the middle man between you and the demorph switch? Whatever part of the machinery is allowing your brain to be controlling the fly should also directly control the demorph switch.

In fact, unless somehow the earthly equipment is responsible for keeping your brain coherent in Z space (which would be a fair mechanic, I think) what should happen even if you totally destroy the fly is that you just hang out in the void until the time elapses.
