  RWBY on rails?
#+end_quote

RP thread bad?

Anyway, the RP thread is about an attack at RTX2015 by Cinder and her minions, which is a convention for the studio that produced the animated series RWBY.

The POTUS told us that it was a terrorist attack by people not of this world and announced that they came from the previously-fictional series RWBY.

The RP thread is about commentators reacting to this live event and the aftermath that will change the world.
