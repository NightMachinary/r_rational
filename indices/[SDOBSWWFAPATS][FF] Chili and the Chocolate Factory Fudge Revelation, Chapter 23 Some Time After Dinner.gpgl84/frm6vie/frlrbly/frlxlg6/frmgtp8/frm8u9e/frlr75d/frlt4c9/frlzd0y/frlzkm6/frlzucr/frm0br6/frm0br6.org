oh, well if it's gone back and forth I haven't noticed, but I do remember seeing it still marked as complete a few times even after chapters were posted following 6. I didn't check every update though, so it could have been switched back to uncomplete at some point before switching back to complete for this chapter ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
