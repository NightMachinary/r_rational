It stands for SATIRICAL DECONSTRUCTION OF BELOVED SURREALIST WORK WRITTEN FOR AND PARTIALLY ABOUT THIS SUBREDDIT, a gag that arose during discussion about whether this story is /really/ rational or /really/ belongs here. It at the very least directly and intentionally addresses the elements and style of rational fiction, even if it's not necessarily quite "rational fiction."
