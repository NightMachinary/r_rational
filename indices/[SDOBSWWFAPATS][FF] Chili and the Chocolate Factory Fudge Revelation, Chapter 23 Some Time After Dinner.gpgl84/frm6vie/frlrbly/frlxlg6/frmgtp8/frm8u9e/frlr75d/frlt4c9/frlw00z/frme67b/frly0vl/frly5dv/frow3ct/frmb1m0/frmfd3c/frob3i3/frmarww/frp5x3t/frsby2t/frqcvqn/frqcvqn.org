I think I found a very clever reference at the end there.

There's a book called a Girl named Poison, which has similar themes of a character becoming the world's 'author' and interacting with 'people' she creates.

Much like chili and the chocolate factory, the story went through several huge tonal shifts. It started as a girl running from an abusive household, to a heartwarming adventure with the guy who saved her, to eldritch horror as all the puppets she created as author begged her to take care of herself; since if she dies their entire world ceases to exist.
