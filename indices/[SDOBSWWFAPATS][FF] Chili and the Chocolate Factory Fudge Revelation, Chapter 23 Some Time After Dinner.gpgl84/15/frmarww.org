That was...truly wonderful. It was a wild ride from start to finish, and I think this may be one of, if not my favorite fan fictions I've ever read. I could attempt to nit pick, though most of the story makes no sense, so I really don't think it would matter. My only real complaints is that there's not enough of it, and that there were a lot of unexplored plot threads (Chillenial Lee, the kid who created the AI, the president, etc.). Finally, I'm not sure if I would have had the final chapters...kind of go off the deep end, but it was enjoyable regardless.

Also...how are you holding up Gazemaize? I know you were experiencing a lot of problems, though you deleted the chapter mentioning them so I won't say/ask too much in the way of specifics. Hopefully writing this story and your fan's support helped you get through some rough times, and I hope things get better and you find a point in which you receive some stability and relaxation. Thank you making me feel feelings and for writing such a plexicated and gloriumptious story!
