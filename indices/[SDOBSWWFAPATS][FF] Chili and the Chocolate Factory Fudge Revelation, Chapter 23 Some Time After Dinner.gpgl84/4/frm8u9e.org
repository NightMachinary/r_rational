This has been one of the funnest and most gripping rides I can recall reading. Hot damn. The masterful tone shift starting with the Keerthi chapters, suddenly realizing that you are very much trapped in a cursed mansion under the control of an untouchable lunatic who wants you dead. The contestants struggle to resist until they're picked off, leaving Tide to try her best to pick up the pieces, but of course she can't defeat this almost-empty shell, and all of the masks are destroyed, the endgame has begun. I will admit, the sudden tone reversal into this heroic "all of the contestants are alive and awoke a rebellion throughout the factory to learn his exact plans and try to stop him" stuff, that still felt a bit out of place. Same could be said of this fairytale epilogue. Buuuuut, I can't bring myself to care too much, because seeing the heroes win, and seeing the murderous little fuck from the beginning marry Keerthi, the beacon of goodness herself, and be ashamed of his former self, it just feels very nice. Definitely gonna try to spread this one around.
