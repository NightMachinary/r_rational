Yes, and HPMoR is a bit more nuanced than "everyone else is an idiot". That doesn't mean HPMoR isn't snobbish, or that Ron's treatment isn't part of a larger problem.

(And to speak bluntly, I hate that kind of arguing. Oh, the story says X in chapter Y! That proves you're *wrong*, which you would clearly know if you paid any attention to the story instead of complaining on forums!)
