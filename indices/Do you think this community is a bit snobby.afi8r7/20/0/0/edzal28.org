Finding Ron useless is a time honoured tradition among all the fanfiction communities I've ever had any familiarity with. His up there with Jar-Jar Binks to be honest.

I've seen this complaint about how ratfic is for dweebs who are too full of themselves a lot but nearly everywhere in the internet is full of people who love to hear themselves talk so I don't really understand it. Snobbery happens less here than anywhere else that talks seriously about fanfiction. Mostly I think because there aren't as many actual fans.

In particular I remember how someone complained about the elevator scene in worth the candle where the author explains how elevators work and how the cable is connected to the top. The argument was that since nobody could find this interesting in and of itself the only possible reason to include it was to show off. Thus confirming that ratfic is written by pseudo-intellectuals. This guy seemed entirely serious and nobody disagreed.

Only reason I've ever found ratfic could be controversial is that a lot of it is built on the scary idea that if you never wondered what goes on in a college ethics class you're probably not a good person which I suppose could make people feel threatened the same way vegans do.
