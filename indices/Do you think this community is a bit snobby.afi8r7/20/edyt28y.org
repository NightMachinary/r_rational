You realize in HPMOR Ron becomes a significant part of Hermoine's army later on, yes?

Anyways, every community inherently has a sense of pride in itself. People in the community "get it" and people outside the community don't. This applies to everything from gun owners to shippers to us. The only difference is that since our community is literally dedicated to the idea that fiction should be written smartly, about smart characters, the usual pretense that we don't /really/ think we're better than everyone else is that much harder to maintain. After all, the fact that this subreddit exists implies that the fiction we like is the exception, not the rule. And it is.

I dunno how to end this comment. I guess I'll just say that I, at least, do unironically think that I'm smarter and have better taste than most people, and I like this subreddit because it appears to contain lots of people who aren't most people. If that makes me a snob, then I guess that's my cross to bear.
