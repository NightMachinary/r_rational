I mean a lot of what characters in fiction do is pretty stupid.Most readers don't care that much about that kind of thing and will suspend heir disbelief and pretend it makes sense.And writing the kind of intelligent characters we care about is more difficult , and most people don't really care.The same thing for writing settings that make sense .

So of course most fiction is not optimized for that kind of thing.

We should expect most fiction to have characters acting dumb in ways and stories that don't make sense.Complaining about how specific pieces of fiction don't cater to your specific taste doesn't have to mean you are looking down on people that like that kind of fiction.But it does usually come off as that.

Like [[https://www.reddit.com/user/ArgentStonecutter][ArgentStonecutter]] said there are people that care about about physics accuracy in SF .

Different communities have different tastes in fiction .People like to find people whith similar tastes ,complain about the aspects of fiction that they don't like , and write things that are more optimized for their specific tastes.Snobbishness seems to be about thinking your tastes your tastes are "better" in some people than everybody else's

.Intelligence has much higher status than orbital mechanics , so complaining about it probably comes up as more snobbish.And some people probably do look down on other communities of fiction but ,as you said , most people here are nice.

I suspect rational fiction by virtue of trying to make stuff whith smarter characters is always going to look snobbish , regardless of the actual snobbishness(Not sure if that's even a word) of the people writing it.

The same whith any attempt to make stories better for an specific audience that looks like it's about some kind of general quality of the story.

The zombie thing its making fun of how crazy people usually act in zombie stories.Its not really about making fun about people that like that kind of zombie story.

The writers of zombie stories are usually trying to make thematic points about humanity and things like that.

They aren't trying to write what a sensible approach to the situation would look like.

The same way the writers of a lot of "hard" scifi aren't really trying to make it that accurate.

So its not necessarily looking down to them either.
