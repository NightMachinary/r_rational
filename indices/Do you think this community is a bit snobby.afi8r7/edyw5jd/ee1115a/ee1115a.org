I'm here because I like munchkinry and overpowered protagonists, as long as they're not too Mary Sue. There are two completely different ways that I've seen this done well. Rational fiction is a good way to make protagonists earn their powers by cleverly exploiting whatever world they're in, so it doesn't feel cheap. Alternatively, flawed and ridiculous characters like in One Punch Man or One Piece or The Seventh Horcrux makes it clear that you're not supposed to take the characters seriously or praise how amazing they are because that's not the point of the story.

I like rational protagonists who I can identify with and deliberately irrational protagonists who I'm supposed to laugh at and enjoy the show. It's the uncanny valley in between that annoys me, where they're inconsistent and act normally most of the time except when the plot demands that they do something stupid.
