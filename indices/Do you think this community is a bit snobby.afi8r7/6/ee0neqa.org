I've been considering a post asking folks to stop complaining about works that other people like, and focus on praising things that they do like instead.

(/Harry/ doesn't see a reason for Ron to exist. He exists in Hermione's universe just fine, and also in Ch. 88. And from a Doylist perspective, HPMOR should always be considered set against the universe of Harry Potter fanfic rather than the originals, and for the characters themselves to be struggling against the fate that HP fanfic tries to assign them.)
