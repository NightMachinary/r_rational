heck, sometime you can pinpoint that single moment in plot where there is an obvious idiot-ball handed to a character for the sole purpose of screwing them over to move the plot along. an action that seems out of character with how that character has been shown in the story thus far. like the author just gave up at that point.

other times, you get a charcter who is, on close examination, a specific kind of idiot throughout the entire story (Merlin from the Amber series books 6 through 10, for example). oh sure, genius at some things, no bloody common sense otherwise. if written well, you may not even notice it right away.

now, the idiot MC can be a good story and very interesting, but it is a very different sort of story than one that focuses on the competance of the MC to move the plot.

in general, i prefer stories where there is some thinking going on. plots that revolve around being clever, or that explain new concepts that i had not heard of before, are good things. i detest stories where the plot revolves around ignorance, and the author never explains anything either so the reader is in the dark to things as well (and yes, i have seen that in a novel, it was very bad).
