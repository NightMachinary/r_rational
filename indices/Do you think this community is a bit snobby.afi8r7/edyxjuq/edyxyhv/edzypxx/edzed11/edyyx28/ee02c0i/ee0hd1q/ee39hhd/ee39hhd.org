It's more about both intelligence and consistency. It's great when characters make believable mistakes, but it can be grating when a character makes a mistake that any reader can immediately point to and come up with a better/in-character solution using only the knowledge available to the character. And it's very hard to write a character that's more intelligent than you, so as an author, your best bet is just taking some time to think through the character's actions and their consequences.

Of course, rational fics want the protagonist and possibly antagonist to be rational, but not every character in the setting. And all characters can be rational but working towards opposing goals depending on their experience and outlook on life. It has its flaws, but it's just another structure for a story. And perhaps to a greater degree than many other types of fiction, rational fiction is about diving down and addressing story tropes- sometimes playing them straight, but sometimes deconstructing them in interesting ways.
