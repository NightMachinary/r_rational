  I think that the case could be made for the genre of contemporary drama merely being science fiction that takes place in the present which lacks self awareness of ongoing technological and cultural change, and which focuses primarily on "normal" people doing "normal" things, or what their societies consider to be normal, anyway.

Not really. I mean the case /could/ be made. Like, technically. The way the Bible is sci-fi about a weird simulation on Yahweh's computer. Or a dictionary is fantasy, but only including supposedly real stuff and written in a really really dry and boring way.

Science fiction is, afaik, defined by the introduction of speculative science and/or technology into the fictional story in question.
