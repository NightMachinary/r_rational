If we say that Ward and Worth the Candle are probably the two best web serials around, then you're right that they're pretty close to some of the good genre fiction. However, I think that if you expand that out to the next rung of quality, it drops off pretty hard. Maybe UNSONG might be up there? Other than that, it's all fun and good but also clearly very pulpy.
