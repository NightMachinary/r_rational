Yeah. It's part of being adjacent to the rationalist community. As far as group vices go, it's not so terrible. The community is otherwise pretty great, and has even more strengths than what might be immediately obvious.

I also feel like that sort of condescension is something more for people newish to discovering the rationalist-sphere and you don't see it in more mature work. You might spot that attitude in discussion, but the top current stories don't exhibit it.
