Good point. Tbh I'm not entirely sure myself whether rational fic counts as a genre or whether it's just a style like "literary fic" or "genre fic". I think it kind of blurs the line between them a bit to be honest. Of course that could also be because a lot of rational fic is written in the same or similar clusters of genres, and if we got more people outside of this community writing rational fic they would write rational mystery, rational romance, rational family comedy etc. rather than the rational scifi and fantasy we usually see. Perhaps rational fiction. Perhaps the whole reason we have trouble telling whether rational fiction is a genre or merely an overarching style is because there simply isn't enough rational fiction and not enough rational fiction authors for the full shape of the cluster structure of potential works in rational fiction space to emerge.

That being said, I think that the case could be made for the genre of contemporary drama merely being science fiction that takes place in the present which lacks self awareness of ongoing technological and cultural change, and which focuses primarily on "normal" people doing "normal" things, or what their societies consider to be normal, anyway.

And the case could be made that the mystery genre isn't really a genre either, it's just all the stories that are about solving crimes, which is a very specific subject matter and arguably one not broad enough to be an entire genre of literature on its own, but rather a subgenre of "drama" with a focus on law enforcement and criminals rather than on "normal" people living "normal" lives.

I could probably go down the whole list of genres like this, but I won't. Genres are just a way to organize fiction into categories, and those categories will naturally tend to be constructed based on cluster structures in the interests of readers. If you try to rigorously define such categories, they break down.
