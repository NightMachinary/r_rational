Arcane Ascension doesn't label itself as LitRPG, and the only place that "LitRPG" appears on the Amazon product page for Sufficiently Advanced Magic is a little note that the author added to say:

  For those of you that are checking this out from the "LitRPG" community, this is not a pure LitRPG - it's more of a mix between a traditional fantasy novel and a LitRPG. There are no user interfaces or chat logs here - this does not literally take place within a video game, just in a world that is intended to /feel/ like a RPG world.

Arcane Ascension isn't pretending to be something that it's not, so I don't see why Ramon would have a problem with it.

I think Arcane Ascension comes up a lot in LitRPG circles because it's good at scratching that particular itch for a "progression" system where a character is gradually becoming stronger and mastering more skills in a fantasy setting (usually manifested as leveling in LitRPG stories), and I've seen Mother of Learning come up in the same context for some of the same reasons, but that doesn't necessarily make it LitRPG, when someone asks for LitRPG recommendations it's the kind of story that might fit their intention without necessarily fitting the strict definition of LitRPG. In the same way, if someone came to a community like [[/r/rational]] asking for "movie recommendations for hard-SF about astronauts that has an optimistic feel to it, something that scratches the same itch as the Martian," I might say, "Oh, you would probably enjoy Apollo 13," even though Apollo 13 isn't actually sci-fi, because even though the person asking for recs might say "hard SF" their post makes it sound like what they're really looking for is stories about astronauts and engineers solving problems in space, which Apollo 13 does deliver on.
