Actually i disagree, you can write an entire scifi story with only currently existing tech. I've been working on a rational scifi adventure series which takes place on an alternate earth from 2020-2022, and theres literally only one example of tech that doesnt exist yet and it's not used or even revealed until book 4. After that there isnt any more new tech shown until the final book which is kind of an extended epilogue.

Edit: forgot that self driving cars are mentioned in book 3. So technically there are just two examples of new tech in the story up until the end of book 5.
