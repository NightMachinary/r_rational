For a bit of a point of comparison, I'd put forth the LitRPG community, and more specifically, one of its biggest ambassadors, Ramon Mejia, who hosts LitRPG Podcast and does several book reviews per week.

From everything I've seen, Ramon is a very friendly and positive guy who is incredibly generous with his time: because he's such a lynchpin of the LitRPG community, a lot of self-published authors ask him directly for advice about how to label and market their books -- and he nearly always takes the time to provide direct (and sometimes detailed) answers to their questions. And one of the things that he's most often asked by authors is, "Is the story that I've written LitRPG? Or do you think I should stick to using a GameLit novel or something similar?" I'm not sure that everyone would consider Ramon Mejia to be "the face" of the LitRPG community, but if he is, I don't think you could ask for a more friendly and welcoming representative.

That being said, with LitRPG being a very fast-growing label in the Amazon Kindle store, there have been a lot of self-published authors who have been labeling their stuff as LitRPG simply to show up in search results. There are also slightly less shameless versions of this, where people will take an existing work, spend a few hours adding the bare minimum of elements to be considered LitRPG, and then re-release it under a new title to find a new audience. And then you have the more earnest version of this, where people say, "Hey, this seems like a cool community that is hungry for more content!" and they start writing LitRPG stories (perhaps even in a way that's well-intentioned) without taking the time to read in the genre and acquire a basic understanding of what LitRPG is.

One of the things that Ramon has been pretty adamant about on his book review podcast is calling out stories that are not LitRPG despite being labeled as such. He gives each book a numerical score on a scale of 1-10, and anything that is not really LitRPG frequently gets several points knocked off. Some of these reviews even praise books for being well-written but then give a score of 6/10 because "not LitRPG." I don't think Ramon has a problem with these kinds of stories existing; he wouldn't take a book like The Hobbit and say "6/10, not LitRPG." But if you label your work as LitRPG, you are asking to be judged by a certain rubric, and part of that rubric is, "Is this delivering on the basic expectations of LitRPG readers?" If the answer to that question is "no," then that's fine, but don't come to LitRPG communities expecting people to respond favorably to your work.

I don't think that many people on this subreddit have a problem with, say, Marvel movies. I myself quite enjoy them, and I think most other people here would say the same. But if you posted a thread on [[/r/rational]] for "[RT] Thor Ragnarok" I think you'd have a lot of people who would say, "This doesn't belong here." I don't think that makes you a snob, any more than pointing out that, say, using [[/r/lego]] as a place to discuss K'NEX is probably not in line with the spirit or intention of of what that subreddit is for.
