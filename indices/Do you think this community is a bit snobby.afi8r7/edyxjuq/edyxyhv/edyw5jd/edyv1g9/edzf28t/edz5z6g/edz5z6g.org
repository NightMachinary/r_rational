I feel like you'd enjoy [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6178036/chapters/14154868][CORDYCEPS (Too Clever for their Own Good)]]. It's a great horror story that also pokes a bit of fun at the ‚Äúsnobby rationalist‚Äù stereotype. A lot of people here enjoyed it, and I think that shows that at least we're willing to laugh at ourselves too. üòâ
