I've noticed that some of the community as a whole seems to treat rationalism as a sort of religion, and things that don't adhere to it are often treated as 'lesser' rather than different. There's a certain atmosphere of superiority, though it's rarely direct or obvious in individual posts. Obviously rationalism has been a big part in many of your lives, but some treat it as gospel, to the point of alienating others.

Some of the community seems to be made up of people entirely unable to enjoy non-rational media, and that bleeds into a lot of the content the community consumes. Furthermore, some enjoy content exclusively BECAUSE it's rational, with no regard to quality, pacing, or anything else that traditionally good fiction is built on. There's nothing /wrong/ with that, but some of the praise/criticism I see for certain (off-site) fictions is almost jarring. It's important to remember that being rational does not mean objectively good, which some of the community seem to forget at times.

I'd very much be interested in an official stickied survey on the demographics present on the sub, because this community feels like a few /very/ specific types of people. Hell, I'd even like to see a Myers Briggs Test (Not as a scientifically valid test, but just to compare to the general population).

[[/r/rational]] is a cool community that I spend a lot of time in, I'd hate to see it become (more of?) an echo chamber.
