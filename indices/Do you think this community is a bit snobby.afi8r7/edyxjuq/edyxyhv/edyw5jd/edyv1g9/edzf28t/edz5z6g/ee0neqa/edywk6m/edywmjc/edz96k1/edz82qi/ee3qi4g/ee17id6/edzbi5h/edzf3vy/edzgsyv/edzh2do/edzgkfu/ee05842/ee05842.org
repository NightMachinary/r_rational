Yeah, I definitely agree. Most of the books I read are traditionally published works by veteran authors where it would be /really/ surprising if they hadn't gone through multiple drafts and multiple edits. Serial web fiction? /Some of it the author doesn't read a second time before posting./

If I can speak with some measure of authority, as someone who writes (and has written) more than a million words of web fiction posted to this subreddit in the last few years ... yeah, most of it is held to a different, lower standard, and all of it would be massively improved by the traditional publishing process, assuming that there were no hack frauds involved who wanted to make everything generic and juvenile (or juvenile in the wrong way). /Editors improve books/, that's their job. They do copy-editing, line editing, and structural editing to smooth things out and make things better.

Now, that said, I do think that there's a good chance that the top 1% of web fiction might beat the middle of the bell curve for published fiction, but that's Sturgeon's Law in action, and whether it's even true will depend on sensitivity to the specific errors and problems that editors and a review process are most likely to catch.
