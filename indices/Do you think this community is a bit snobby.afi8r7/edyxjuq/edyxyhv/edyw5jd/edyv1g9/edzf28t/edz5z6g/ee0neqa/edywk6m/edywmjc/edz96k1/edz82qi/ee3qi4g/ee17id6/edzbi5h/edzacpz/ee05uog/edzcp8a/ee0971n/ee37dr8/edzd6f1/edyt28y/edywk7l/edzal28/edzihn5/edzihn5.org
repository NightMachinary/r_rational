I get where you're coming from! Like, a lot of this thread is turning into a political debates, like "X isn't true because I have examples of not-X here, here, and here", but really, it's not that black-and-white.

Rational fic, like all fanfic genres, has its pitfalls and creeping problems, and an overfocusing on "I am too smart and people around me can't understand my genius" types of characters is one of them. Still better than the average Spacebattles thread.
