  Part of it is that it feels like the author changed course, rather than that this was the driving point of the scene in the first place.

Yeah, I got the same sense. It seemed like those scenes were intended to be read straight, at least early on. Maybe I'm being too harsh on EY here and should give him the benefit of the doubt---but he /did/ write that rambling Facebook post about how people who think Harry's a snob are just having an irrational reaction based around an emotion he is biologically incapable of feeling.

Plus, if Harry being a total dick /is/ a result of EY trying to write a relatable character for nerds (as opposed to a literary failure of not adequately demonstrating in-text why Harry is wrong)... Well, I think it partially explains why HJPEV's character development is so incomplete---I mean, is he really a substantially different person by the book's end?
