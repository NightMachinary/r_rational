  It's just that, the longer I'm around this community, the more I feel like the main purpose of this is to look down on every other community of fiction.

The purpose of this community is to find/share/enjoy fiction that doesn't have the particular kinds of gaping plot holes that we're hypersensitive to. Unfortunately those kinds of plot holes are extremely common even if popular, otherwise well written fiction.

Other people are free to like (or not /dislike/) other fiction for the qualities they care about. But so long as other fiction has the flaws we don't like, we're going to sneer at it a bit. I don't think that really makes us 'snobby' because we're not excluding people--merely defining what our group is and why we like it better than other places.
