it depends on your standard. 500000 words of a unique plot, free? that's amazing. it's understandable not to look past that, although i cannot personally bear to.

but many of the most commonly posted stories here are simply not publishable (i mean because of quality not because the publishing industry isn't a fan of web serials). they have plot holes, terrible characterizations, verbosity, internal inconsistency.... some of them are flat poor: ungrammatical, strangely-worded, etc. i do think most if not at all rational fiction posted here lives in a bubble.

it also depends what you're comparing them to. comparing hpmor to any other piece of harry potter fanfiction? it comes out way ahead. comparing it to published, polished fantasy literature? half of it needs a rewrite, although that doesn't take away from the readability. and note that hpmor is the gold standard.

so i don't consider you guys snobbish. i consider myself snobbish.

what's essentially happened is web serials have become synonymous with genre fiction. no one's writing a web serial that resembles a cormac mccarthy or thomas pynchon novel in any way. and as usually happens to genre fiction, the stuff at the top is unforgettable and everything else is mediocre or worse. so my answer to your question is --- almost all of them.
