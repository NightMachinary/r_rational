My first reaction to OP was that they had just finished reading HPMOR and perhaps skimmed a few of the top 'all time' posts because there experience with this sub differed so much from mine. Then i saw this and figured that you're more on top of this sub than I and not prone to exaggeration so there must be something to the claim, and then EY has replied and implied this is an issue the sub has as well and i'm wondering what on earth i've been oblivious to all this time.

I'm not asking you to single out any specific users/comments but do any examples come to mind of problematic posts/threads in the past that are representative of the sort of issue you're speaking of? I'm baffled at what i've been missing but clearly i'm missing something.
