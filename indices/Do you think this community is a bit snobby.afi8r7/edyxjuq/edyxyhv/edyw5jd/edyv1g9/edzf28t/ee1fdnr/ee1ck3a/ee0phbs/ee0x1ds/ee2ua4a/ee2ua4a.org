I've always thought that different stories usually have different strengths - characters, world building, plot, etc. If you try to do a bunch at once, you might end up with an epic - a big book with lots of characters, a lot of different countries and people, and multiple stories going at once. Comparatively, a good tragedy only needs a few characters, and a few locations. (And the characters usually have flaws because that's where the story comes from.)
