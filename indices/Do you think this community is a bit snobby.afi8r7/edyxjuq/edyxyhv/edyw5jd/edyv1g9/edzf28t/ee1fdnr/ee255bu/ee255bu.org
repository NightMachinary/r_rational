I think it's useful to divide the community out into the the commentariat and the writers, because they have very different roles, and each contribute to "the community" in different ways.

For writers, the thing I'll see most often is a snide contempt for the source material, namely by having characters point out how stupid some thing that happened in canon was (even though it's not canon in their own work). This is similarly the case when there's a Lone Sane Man who is the only point of departure for the work, and who spends most of his time "satirically" pointing out everything dumb in the world with very little charity given to the original worldbuilding/plot. This, I think, has tapered off a bit with time, but a lot of the 2013-2014 era stuff was in that vein, and I still see it from time to time. I don't tend to find it particularly clever, in part because criticism by way of exaggeration and denigration doesn't seem (to me) like it takes too much work or thought.

For the commentariat ... I actually would say that it's gotten better over time, but it's really hard to judge. What I mean is mostly comments in the form of "that's dumb, why did X not do Y?" without any actual consideration for why X didn't do Y. It's not so much the criticism, I guess, it's the format of the criticism and the feeling that whoever is doing the talking went in with a negative mindset looking for things to complain about, regardless of whether those complaints were actually grounded in cogent thought. To give some analogies, it's like a hard scifi fan picking up a soft scifi book and picking it apart piece by piece, or someone who's really into wine picking up a ten dollar bottle to mercilessly mock its quality.

There's a lot of that stuff all over the internet. "People complain about things" is a cottage industry where you can make good money. It's not that it doesn't have a place, it's just that it seems to me that it's pretty low value, because it doesn't take much effort and doesn't tend to produce good content. I'm much more of the mind that "rational fiction" as a genre should be about creating new things or exploring old things, not simply being negative about works that are outside the genre and don't live up to ideals that they weren't even aspiring to.

(The extent to which the above actually matches to "snobbery" is up for debate, as is the question of to what extent it's actually a problem present in writers or the commentators.)
