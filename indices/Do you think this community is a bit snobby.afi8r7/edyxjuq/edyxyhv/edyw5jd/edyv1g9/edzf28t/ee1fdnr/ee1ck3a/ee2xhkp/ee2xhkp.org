I think the important (and bad) part of the easy, mean-spirited approach is that it's /just/ pointing out flaws, rather than providing constructive value of its own. You could definitely call HPMoR mean-spirited in parts, but I think it did an excellent job of reconstructing various aspects of the setting, and creating consistent rules to explain things like Time Turners and Transfiguration. So I think it's actually quite a good example of the second category, of rebuilding a premise with more nuance and thought, and that's one of the things I really loved about it.
