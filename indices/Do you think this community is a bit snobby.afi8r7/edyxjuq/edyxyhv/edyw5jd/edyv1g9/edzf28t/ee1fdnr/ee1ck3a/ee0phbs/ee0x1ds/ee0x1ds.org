Nah, I'm a literary snob. Not /that much/ of a snob, but a bit of one. I like my stories to have themes, to not meander too much from their central conceit or plot, to have strong characterization that ties in with the plot in some way, flaws that get overcome, etc. Good prose too, though I'm a little more lenient about that if the pacing is good.

For a lot of people, none of that stuff is really vital. It might be nice to have, but if it's missing, eh, so long as there's a lot of it, that might be fine.

So I'm a snob in that sense.
