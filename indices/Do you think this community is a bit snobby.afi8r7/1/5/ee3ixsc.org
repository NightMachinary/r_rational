I think that the key problem is, if you care about the details - like SF physics - then watching a story ignore them /breaks suspension of disbelief/. It jolts you out of enjoying the story and /reminds/ you that it's fiction. Of course, everyone has different pet peeves, so not everyone cares about the particular traits that this subreddit wants to fix.

Given the above, it's understandable, I think, that many community members seem annoyed at non-rational fiction. The non-rationality has spoiled their reading/viewing experience.
