  I feel like the main purpose of this is to look down on every other community of fiction.

So, like, in science fiction fandom there's a subset of the fandom that is really into diamond hard SF... that's what they're into. They get upset that the video version of /The Expanse/ has this illustration of the intercept of a spaceship with an asteroid and they get the orbital mechanics COMPLETELY WRONG. Like don't they even know Newton's three laws? Sheesh. And don't get me started on Gravity.

This is basically the same kind of thing for character and narrative. People here don't care if the story is hard SF or not, they just care that /given that you accept the backstory/ the narrative actually makes sense, and the people in the story live up to their characters.

And just as most SF (particularly most media SF) isn't really hard SF, it turns out that most supposedly intelligent characters are not written intelligently. So it gets on the nerves of people who care about that stuff.

If you're not someone who cares about that stuff, you probably won't dig it.
