  Or with the third highest upvited post on the sub, where a character in a zombie apocalypse repeatedly goes:\\
  "Oh God, you're so stupid, Oh God, you're so stupid, I'm so fucking intelligent and you're so stupid"
#+end_quote

Actually, that personified our frustration perfectly. Ratfic was born out of frustration. Too many fictions left plotholes untreated. So, when a fiction point out something, anything, being stupid, we rejoice. Because, for once, a character can be aware of stupidity, either in their setting or in other character. Of course on that example the stupidity is exaggerated so you might find it insulting. But well, that's that.
