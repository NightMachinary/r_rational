It's the whole truth vs beauty thing, isn't it? Art is a set of psychological manipulations to make things interesting, sheer unadulterated communication of truth as you see it is best reserved for academic papers (and even then learn to write engagingly, please!). That's why I love Blindsight and the Masquerade series so much. They're beautiful, and teach you something useful along the way.

You could say the same of stuff like HPMoR and The Waves Arisen, honestly. For all HPMoR's flaws, it had one of the best antagonists I've ever seen in fiction. The character writing for Quirrel was superb, and the writing style was sugary and delicious.
