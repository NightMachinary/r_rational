Your second example is probably not great because some of the best sci fi of all time is soft sci fi. I would even argue that the sizable majority of the best sci fi, from like a critical/literary point of view, is soft sci. I think a lot of the [[/r/rational][r/rational]] community views fiction as being essentially a manual or set of instructions rather than as an artistic device. There are a lot of reasons why this is the case but I think that kind of attitude lends itself very strongly to the type of piecemeal criticism that used to be common. I will say that the community is mostly just [[/r/goodwebserials][r/goodwebserials]] at this point, though, so maybe these criticisms of the community in general are a little mistimed.
