I've always been drawn to it (when reading physical books) because, all else being equal, reading a good book which is longer is better. Sometimes an author didn't feel like splitting up one story into separate volumes, and instead of a series, there's just a stand alone book and it's great and it has less of that problem. I've only read one epic I didn't enjoy (and finish reading) and it was the Wheel of Time - 12 books, each super long, and the author died before writing the last book, which ended up getting published as 3 books, and that really should have been my first clue.

That doesn't mean writing a good book that's longer is just as easy, but as a series goes on, it seems to happen naturally.

EDIT: What did you think of Lord of the Rings?
