Yes, it's a persistent problem with the community, and has been pretty much since its inception. Part of the problem is that mean-spirited "parody" is a lot easier than an honest attempt at deconstruction and/or reconstruction. It's easy to laugh at some dumb thing a writer did because they wanted to move the plot along and not ask questions, but it's /hard/ (or at least takes /effort/) to follow a premise through to its natural conclusion, or to rebuild the premise so that it's got the same conclusion but with more nuance and thought. So people will just do the mean-spirited pointing-out-flaws thing, because that requires little effort (and frankly, little intelligence).

For my part, I try not to do that kind of thing, because I think there's way too much of it, both in this subreddit, and in the wider culture. It's a tough battle though, because one side is spending more time and effort than the other. (And I will grudgingly admit to not being perfect, as well as being a snob of a different sort.)
