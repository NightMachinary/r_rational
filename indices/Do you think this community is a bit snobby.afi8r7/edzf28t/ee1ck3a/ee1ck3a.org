I have to say, the only fanfiction on here that I remember that took the easy, mean-spirited approach was HPMoR itself. And that was still popular enough to codify this genre and inspire enough spin-offs to birth this subreddit.

But maybe my standards are lower than yours. Which stories that are or were popular on here are you thinking of?
