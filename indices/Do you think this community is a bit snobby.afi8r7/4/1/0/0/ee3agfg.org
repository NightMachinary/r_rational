With HPMOR, one problem that it faced is that there's a whole host of good Harry Potter fanfiction that's long since dived into and deconstructed magic in different/interesting ways, or delved into the characters/Voldemort in particular. There are some thing HPMOR does particularly well, but also a fair chunk of things that weigh it down.

As someone who got into it from the "Harry Potter fanfic" side of things, it does a lot of pure rewriting of the magic, which is one of the factors that makes it "feel" less like Harry Potter- these rules works well in fiction where you get to purely establish the setting, but less so when you're changing an existing one and your character's exploitation/munchkinry is effectively only possible because you created rules that allowed it. You're literally rewriting existing rules by author fiat, which is fine in most fanfiction, but feels out of place in a self-proclaimed "rational" fic. For transfiguration, canon HP transfigurations do not actually run out of magic and revert. In comparison, I've read fics like Taure's "The Power He Knows Not" that capture that magic and have prose that feels familiar to the series.

And of course, it feels overly bloated- much of Hermione's adventures, the actual battles post part 1, etc. Or for another example, the idea of magic being stored and transferred for potions with acorns is a common idea in HP fanfic. But HPMOR presents that and other ideas/innovations only up because Harry thought about it without experimentation, offscreen. The magic is only narrated to the reader directly before the event and generally only shows up when he needs that bit of magic.
