This is why most epic fiction written nowadays is kinda bad. They all try to be the story of ten different people and end up being ten bad stories. The reason why epic poetry works so well is because it's the story of one person in many places or else one place and many persons. Trying to tell the story of many persons in many places undermines each individual story you try to tell by drawing importance away from that story.
