When I say "prose" I usually mean the sentence-to-sentence particulars of the text, how evocative the sentences are, how well they flow between each other, how smoothly each sentence flows, etc.

When I say pacing, I usually mean the scene-to-scene particulars, how well each scene accomplishes what it needs to, whether plot points lead into each other and are resolved in a timely manner, etc.

(I /think/ that's more or less orthodox.)

So you can have good prose, in that the sentences are pleasing enough, and they each accomplish something, but /terrible/ pacing, where resolutions aren't given enough time to breathe, where plots spend too much time brewing, where entire scenes composed of pretty sentences are functionally pointless to the plot ,etc. In web fiction, bloat is pretty common, and while there's nothing wrong with a leisurely pace, it can really kill a story for me if what's supposed to be a narrative just turns into slice-of-life. (And there are other ways that pacing can be bad than just 'slow', naturally, but bloat is one of the big risks for web fiction.)

Alternately, you can have weak prose, but with a cracking plot that moves along with energy and vigor in spite of that. There, I find that I can usually get into a mindset where I'm ignoring the poor prose and just moving along without examining it or reading all that closely, and so long as things are happening at a good pace, I can keep up that ignoring indefinitely.
