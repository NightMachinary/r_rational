I mean, yes? In the same way small brew beer folks are snobbish, or indie music fans, or wine people; I'm also snobbish about chocolate (I know how to spot the good stuff!) and board games.

In all these categories, even the ones I'm not into, I really do think the snobs are right, it's just that either most people don't care, or care about different things. And, as another poster said, your taste in X doesn't really reflect on you as a person.

But maybe no? Wine snobs, AFAIK, both won't even touch not-fancy wine, and (stereotypically) judge wine not on quality but on cost/rarity. I feel like most people on this sub read non-rational fiction (it's just usually less satisfying), and there's no rubric for what makes good rational fiction outside of the content itself.
