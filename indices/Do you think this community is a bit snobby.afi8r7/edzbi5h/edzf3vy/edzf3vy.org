I'm interested to know what fiction you think is so poorly written here? I can't think of any that are regularly posted but maybe the whole echo chamber community has gotten to me and I basically commented thinking the opposite: that we post on average better works even if they aren't to my tastes.

If you don't want to post it here a PM would be appreciated.
