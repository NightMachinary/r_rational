Like you said,

#+begin_quote
  20000 people have favorited hpmor and 20000 completely different people have favorited a draco malfoy and hermione granger romance novel.

And even that kinda shows that you're not familiar with Draco/Hermione not being all too uncommon.

The demographics of people who enjoyed HPMOR don't necessarily line up with the HP fanfic community at large. In online discussions about HPMoR back when it was being published, there were a large number of people who said that they had never read another HP fanfic and weren't ever planning to read another one. And of course, popularity doesn't equal quality- robst writes some of the most popular Harry Potter fanfics, but they're all literally the same fic repackaged.

It's just another subset/bubble, but look at HPMOR recommendations on the main Harry Potter fanfiction subreddit: [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/169NVDxmtgDuwB7O1rZenT_WfKWTJqs-k-cdxd37xHWw/edit#gid=410390511][it's up there in terms of recommendations, at 41st place, but definitely not even close to the most recommended fic.]]

For some good fics that I enjoyed more than HPMOR: Seventh Horcrux, To Shape and Change, The Sum of their Parts, Stages of Hope, Magicks of the Arcane, Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin, Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time, Forging the Sword, On the Way to Greatness, What you Leave Behind, Like a Red Headed Stepchild, The Changeling, The One He Feared. Victoria Potter and Taure's canon magic document/analysis are great to dive into as well.

Short fics/oneshots aren't in the same category and aren't really comparable, but there are also a ton of one-shots that can very much hone in on and develop a single idea: Cauterize, one about Harry using the Resurrection Stone and falling prey to it. The landscape is so vast, especially if you're looking for a specific subset. People who like HPMoR generally like the well-written super/munchkin-type fics, which exist in abundance, i.e. Harry Gets Motivated, The Greatest Minister of Magic. Or fics that focus more on Voldemort, like There is Nothing to Fear, which the author posted about here on [[/r/rational][r/rational]].

I also greatly enjoy fanfiction more for the interesting ideas it brings up, so I have a soft spot for fics like 0800-Rent-a-Hero or Percy Take the Wheel, which both look at characters in a new way and introduce/vastly expand on magic while still making it "feel" like it fits in the world.

The aforementioned Nightmares of Future Past is basically apocryphal (IMO hasn't aged all that well), Isolation is a more recent popular fic. HPMoR is still great, and is actually complete in addition to being edited, but it's also good to read other stuff in the genre rather than just saying it's better than literally any Harry Potter fanfiction. I think there will certainly be people who will read all this other stuff and still consider HPMoR the best, especially on this sub, but that's far from the general consensus.
