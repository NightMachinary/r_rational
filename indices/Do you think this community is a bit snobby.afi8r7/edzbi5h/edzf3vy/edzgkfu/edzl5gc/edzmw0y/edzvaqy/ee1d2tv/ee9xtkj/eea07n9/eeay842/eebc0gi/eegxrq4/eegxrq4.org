Off the top of my head I don't think so. The story literally takes place on an alternate earth very similar to our own, and starts only about a year or two from now into the future. Or wait, there's the obvious example of using those programs that let you make videos which mimic the likenesses of real people. Those already exist and in the story they become a bit more commonly used. Aside from that though I'm not sure.
