You know that you can just go to a library or book shop and get more books right? I don't mean to be rude, but you're not saying that book length is an issue, you're just saying that either you don't have the ability to purchase books or you don't have the ability to go to the library. If it's neither of those, then you're just saying that you don't want to ever finish a book. That's a position you can have - but reading pace has nothing to do with it.
