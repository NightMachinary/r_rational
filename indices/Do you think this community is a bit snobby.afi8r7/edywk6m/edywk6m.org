Community as a whole? Probably. Individual posters? Not so much.

I think it's partly the "atmosphere" of the place, where people that like well constructed stories can hang out. A lot of the time, we go out with irl friends to see hollywood movies or something, and it's a bit jarring when they enjoy all the lights and colours and you're just shaking your head at how contrived the story is, or thinking about all the ridiculous plot holes/lack of continuity.

You might try to discuss this with them, but the reply will usually be "it's just a movie, lighten up and enjoy it".

So this is a safe haven to discuss works that have, a "higher" level of story construction, amazing foreshadowing, and all around enjoyable stories that don't have too many writing issues common to mass works.

As such, a /slight/ bit of snobbishness at works that "normies" watch and enjoy is kinda expected (even though no one here will say it out loud).
