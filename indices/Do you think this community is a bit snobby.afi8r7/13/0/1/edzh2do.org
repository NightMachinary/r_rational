My guess is they mean vocabulary, literary writing (as opposed to functional), good description, etc. Some of the books here are definitely kind of sloppy on that, like Mother of Learning, but as flagamuffin says people don't care about it here, while publisher's offices would.

I've seen a few books lately that have made it to the mainstream in that form though, like The Martian, so maybe things are changing. I definitely care more for a good, consistent plot over literary constructs.
