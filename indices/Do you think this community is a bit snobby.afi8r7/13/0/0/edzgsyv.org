remember what you're seeing is the result of anyone being able to publish anything. and remember that every publisher's office has piles of dead manuscripts (or word docs nowadays) mailed by hopefuls. it wouldn't make sense at all if [[/r/rational][r/rational]]'s quality was consistently very high, given there is no barrier to entry. so if that's what you think, it may be worthwhile to recalibrate. i am curious how many people who read rational web serials regularly are also reading so-called “real” books.
