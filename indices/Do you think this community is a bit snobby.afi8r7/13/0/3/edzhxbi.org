a third comment, because this is really interesting to think about. subreddits are /so good/ at assembling related content that they crowd everything else out (people tell me twitter is similar). i frequent sports subreddits because they actually save me time and effort despite the hours i spend reading them. it's like the netflix algorithm was applied directly to me, for baseball, and the result was that i never have to go to espn.com or sports illustrated or whatever, ever again. those were imperfect sources of knowledge/news/data, but the sports subreddits aren't.

i could see someone feeling the same way about the stories that get posted on [[/r/rational][r/rational]]. maybe that could create a bubble.
