HPMOR is amazing at it's best, kinda decent on average and terrible at its worst. The whole thing is in dire need of polishing, but it still manages to be a masterpiece despite that. Also, HPMOR is not the gold standard of quality rational fic. It was the first rational fic and it began the genre, but if you're looking for a gold standard it might make more sense to read Luminosity or Pokemon: the Origin of Species. I will note that Luminosity is better written than Twilight, and yet Twilight is on book shelves while luminosity is not.

As for barriers to entry, being at all interested in rational fiction is a huge barrier to entry. Most people don't know the genre exists, and even when they do it's a really hard genre to write in, and many people probably are hesitant to share their work because their attempts at rational fic don't hold up when analyzed by people on this sub.
