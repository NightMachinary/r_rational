i thought about this all day at work (slow day) and decided it basically comes down to different definitions of what readers want/expect in terms of harry potter fanfiction.

1. just stories set in the harry potter universe; in this case hpmor is somewhere in the top .01 percent but not at the top. i would put life and times first, if pressed. a long journey home second. stages of hope perhaps third. i actually think the vast majority of this category is taken up by pre-canon stories by people like cgner and whoever wrote the shoebox project, who have an actual writing style.

2. or is the goal to extract real actual "literature" (in the vaguest sense)? because if so, hpmor is just about the only thing that even qualifies. i am not comparing hpmor to tolstoy; that is not what i mean by literature. it's probably the wrong word. i am commenting on the fact that of all the people i know who don't care about harry potter and don't live on the internet and are "serious readers," etc -- /some of them sat down and read all of methods when i mentioned it to them/. if i sent them stages of hope afterward they would be completely nonplussed, despite the fact that it is also grammatical, has a tighter plot, and doesn't have any obvious shortcomings like methods does. stages of hope is certainly a more enjoyable story.

the plain fact is that hpmor is in a different category. it's a category that i value more (and [[/r/rational][r/rational]] values more, and people who aren't mostly teenagers on the internet tend to value more), so it's... better. for a given definition: the second one. if i had to try to quantify why it's better, which is always a disastrous endeavor for opinions, i would say it's got more going on under the hood than fanfiction is supposed to. there are thematic elements, big ideas and fascinating plot points that just aren't present in "normal" fanfiction, even the best. this is what makes it worth spending time to read in sort of the same way tolstoy is worth spending time to read, although that's a comparison that will no doubt get me in trouble.

my original point was about the contents of [[/r/rational/top][r/rational/top]] though. most of that is crap because people on [[/r/rational][r/rational]] will accept subpar writing quality if the characters think like they think, often /ad absurdum/. this is different from the upper range of harry potter fanfiction, which is definitely superbly written, just suffers from a category error.
