I agree with you. Unfortunately my love of rationalist fiction also coincided with a period in which I dove deep into breakdowns of story tropes. The effect seems to have compounded.

I'd also further delineate rational fiction into stories with either a rational protagonist and/or a rational world. I like a rational protagonist trying to makes sense of a seemingly irrational world (Practical guide) or a somewhat irrational protagonist trying to make their way in a completely rational world, although this is rarer.

As for mysteries, I've never liked them unless they're very off the wall (Commander Vimes or Dirk Gently). Strangely enough these also seem to be quite rational.
