For me personally this genre made it harder to enjoy thinking about and theorizing about less rational protagonists. Good literature and media that isn't very rational is still enjoyable to consume, but thinking about it during the process and trying to make predictions is less enjoyable since you're likely to be wrong for dumb reasons.

There's also two levels of rationalist fiction in my opinion, the first level is just characters and settings that a trying to be realistically consistent and the second is where characters actively break down their thought processes as a focus. I'm not a huge fan of the second level so maybe that makes it easier on me.

Another factor is that I believe stories that are rational are more likely to be good, authors that think hard and plan things out tend to make more rational works and better authors tend to do those steps better, so we kind of get spoiled here.

I do wonder how people who like mystery/whodunit stories get effected by this community. I never really liked the genre before and this community encouraging deeper examination might have made it worse for me (not counting the cool rational ones where they actively try to be solvable).
