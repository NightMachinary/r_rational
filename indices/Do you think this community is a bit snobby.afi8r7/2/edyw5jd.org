I know that after finding out about this genre and thoroughly loving it I've found it difficult to really get into books without a rational protagonist. But I personally don't look down on people with different tastes or those tastes themselves.

I've got two roommates, one is a medical student and the other is a doctor. One loves the shit out of cringe comedy (Inbetweeners and Blue Mountain State) and hated Mad Max Fury Road. The other is a huge fan of dark comedies with stupid death scenes and laughs long and hard at them. Otherwise both are incredibly intelligent and great company. in my view a person's taste is a bit like their fetish. It rarely impacts who they are outside of that taste. I don't like it but I respect it.

tl;dr: to each their own.

But that's just me.
