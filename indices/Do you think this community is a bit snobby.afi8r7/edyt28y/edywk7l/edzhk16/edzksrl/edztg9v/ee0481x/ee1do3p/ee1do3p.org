Is a story supposed to clearly show that the viewpoint character is currently wrong?

When I read Worm as a teen I was following Taylor's thought process pretty uncritically, seeing a beat down girl with heroic ideals struggling against an increasingly unfair world. Only upon maturing myself and reading alongside various internet analyses I see just how flawed she is herself.

Same goes with Luminosity, where I was cheering on the (in hindsight megalomaniac) protagonist with every step. I like that story /because/ of the twist in the end forcing me to reevaluate the whole previous story. If there had been constant author commentary on just how wrong she is it wouldn't have had the same effect.
