It depends on the story and what it's trying to achieve. The risk that you run is that some people will just not understand the actual message, and go off with a warped view of what the work was attempting to say, sometimes with the opposite message the author intended. There are /still/ a bunch of Taylor fans who didn't actually pick up on a lot of her characterization (and some more fans who see that characterization as positive, which is a separate issue).

I suppose you could argue that in HPMOR there's plenty of impetus for a re-evaluation due to later events, and the Ron-bashing is meant as part of set up for that ... but it /still/ feels like having your cake and eating it too, in a way that doesn't really work for me.

(It's a fairly common problem with villain protagonists and anti-heroes that the cool thing about them is how they violate norms and do things that are beyond the pale, but the justification for why it's not just revenge porn or a dark power fantasy is that it's nominally condemned.)
