Well, I've never read a statement of authorial intent on the matter, it's just that every time I read through HPMOR (about three times now) I note that the scene is lacking a lot of the things that would traditionally signal "protagonist is making a mistake here!", in terms of how the encounter is framed by the narrative. If I stopped reading there (as a fair number of people do) I would just assume that it was typical Ron bashing, because there's nothing in the text of the scene that suggests otherwise.

(This is all true regardless of what the authorial intent was.)
