  The problem with a lot of HPMOR's criticism is that the story is kinda bad early on at showing that Harry is meant to be wrong and make mistakes very often, even if he's smug and the scene doesn't end with him being punished for it. Critics often just drop HPMOR before it becomes obvious that Harry's supposed to be kind of a dick and that his character development is related to that.

Part of it is that it feels like the author changed course, rather than that this was the driving point of the scene in the first place.
