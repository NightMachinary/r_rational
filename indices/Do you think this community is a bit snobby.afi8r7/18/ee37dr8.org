A bit is probably an understatement.

But it's not so bad in small bursts, and the stories themselves can be really good. I have a lot of gripes about HPMOR, but I followed along with it as it was being released (from ~2012 onwards). I enjoyed Luminosity, and I thought The Waves Arisen had its share of highs and lows. I've been a fan of Mother of Learning for well over half a decade, now, but more from being a fan of nobody's Naruto fanfic.

But if I didn't come back here for the recent discussion threads, I wouldn't have gotten into Worth the Candle or Alexander Wales' other works like Metropolitan Man, or A Practical Guide to Evil, which are three works I've enjoyed immensely.

There's also something to be said about exposing yourself to different styles of tropes/writing over time. I love to read. I've had two or three phases where I basically tried to down everything in [[/r/HFY][r/HFY]], which itself is a subset of sci-fi fics- there was an EY story linked from there called Three Worlds Collides, which effectively led me back to this sub just a few weeks ago. I've had a few focused phases with fanfiction from several different fandoms, a few phases focused on more traditional fantasy or mystery books, a few phases where all I read was manga and Japanese light novels, and a few phases that branched out to light/web novels from Korea and China. So even the stuff that's solidly middle-of-the-road here can be fun to read because it feels fresh/creative.

The kind of thing you're describing, like cutting Ron and Hagrid from HPMoR, is definitely one of the things that turned me off HPMOR on a second reading. The snobbiness and whatnot bothered me a lot less when I was a young teenager, less emotionally intelligent and less critical of its faults. I already wasn't a fan of many of the author tracts, though, and while I didn't agree with much of su3su2u1's rant on HPMoR, it brought up a large number of valid points/problems I had with the story.
