  video version of The Expanse has this illustration of the intercept of a spaceship with an asteroid and they get the orbital mechanics COMPLETELY WRONG

Did they? If it's the scene I'm thinking of, I presuming they can just burn retrograde /really/ hard. The orbital mechanics are a bit different because they're burning at like a half-g all the time.
