I'm not concerned about whether the Nauvoo's orbit was realistic because they have the bullshit physics spacedrive. I'm talking about the geometry of the impact itself.

Look, here's a whole thread analyzing the impact in detail:

This is the image I'm talking about: [[http://i.imgur.com/5h7vTQj.png]] - this makes no sense, to drop Eros into the sun they would need to be travelling significantly faster than the asteroid (since there is no way the Nauvoo had anything like the same mass) and in a vector that was pretty precisely opposite to its orbit, not coming in from the countersolar point like a big baseball bat. That would leave it still in orbit, with a lower perihelion and a higher apohelion and possibly in an Earth-crossing orbit.
