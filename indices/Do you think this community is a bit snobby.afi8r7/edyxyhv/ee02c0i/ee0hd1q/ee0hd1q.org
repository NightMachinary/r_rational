This mischaracterisation is common. Perfect characters are shit and probably Mary Sue's. Intelligent characters are not supposed to be flawless, they are supposed to make /believable/ mistakes and they're supposed to show their intelligence by making actual intelligent decisions, the thought processes for which we have access too, not by telling the reader that they can speak fifty fake languages or beat other 'intelligent' characters at 'fantasy-chess'.
