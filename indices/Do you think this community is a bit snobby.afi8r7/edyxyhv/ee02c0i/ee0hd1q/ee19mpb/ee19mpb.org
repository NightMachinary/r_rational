Here's a good example:

In With This Ring, early on the character gets an orange power ring and, because it runs off desire and the OC lost money in the recession, the ring disintegrates money (and credit cards) on contact. The OC got around this by carrying gold coins certified by the US treasury. In retrospect he could have just taken the stupid thing off whenever he went shopping, but he was so caught up in having super powers and high on the orange light that it never occurred to him. That's a /believable/ mistake. On the other hand, if the character never bothered to check if it worked on credit cards and he went around bumming money off people for the rest of the series, that's an immersion-killing mistake.

One follows character flaws, the other just doesn't bother figuring out how things work.
