See the assumptions:

#+begin_quote
  Juniper doesn't die from lack of PHY/MEN skills ... and events tend to play out similarly despite the different build (e.g. no non-canon companions, no completely different plots).
#+end_quote

Juniper looks more effective here because you don't see the scenarios where he dies to the Coterie, dies to the zombies, dies to Fireteam Blackheart, etc., and the plot doesn't substantially change because this is "full railroad" mode, where decisions matter, but the Stations of Canon are roughly the same.

Without those stipulations, then yes, you could have things like Juniper deciding not to go to Comfort at all on the theory that too many other people were going there, some of them violent, and instead trudging through the countryside to a different place, eventually making it to the border wall where the Host is waiting with open arms, at which point the story becomes about Juniper adapting to being a low-level conscript in the military of a foreign government, with none of the characters we're familiar with, and presumably new companions ... which is less fun.

Or, once they get to Silmar City, they never run into Fireteam Blackheart, meaning that Fenn is out of the picture, thrown back into prison at best and dead at worst.

Or people keep dying because Juniper can't protect them (or more accurately, pull his weight), leaving him jaded and alone, without much in the way of resources or concrete plans.

(This all sort of rests on the question of who the Dungeon Master is, what he wants, and to what extent he interferes or retcons, which is unknown in the story at the current time, and which I'm not spoiling here.)
