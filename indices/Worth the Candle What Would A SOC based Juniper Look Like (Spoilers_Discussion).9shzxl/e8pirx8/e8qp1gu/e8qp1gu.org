I find it kind of eyebrow-raising (in a compared-to-canon way - obviously this story would work fine as a standalone) that Juniper seems strictly more effective here / this mostly describes Juniper /winning/ via SOC, but at no point did the plot change due to /losing/ one of the many violent conflicts he found himself in under the canon plot due to insufficient PHYS

Also I think changing June's role to be less Tank and more Face changes party balance a fair bit. Amy is arguably now the main tank. Also Amy and June are sort of both sharing Face roles now. Due to their overlapping main stat the stat boosts from the soul bond thingy don't particularly strengthen either of them now (though Fenn and Grak still provide some benefit).

Valencia's demon SOC still overpowers June /and/ Mary when it comes to manipulation, and Valencia may actually trust Juniper /less/ when he has higher SOC (because she can /see/ the higher SOC). Also, there is probably now not a single member of the party who could defeat Valencia in combat, so she is a much bigger threat before they trust her. Grak probably gets a much bigger role since June will be better at understanding him. Fenn..I guess either the relationship is saved, ends more amicably, or June doesn't enter the relationship to begin with due to seeing what Val's SOC allows her to see.
