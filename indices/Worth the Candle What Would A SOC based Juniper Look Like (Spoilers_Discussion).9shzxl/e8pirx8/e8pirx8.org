Assumptions: Juniper doesn't die from lack of PHY/MEN skills, he goes the "Full Disclosure" path, and events tend to play out similarly despite the different build (e.g. no non-canon companions, no completely different plots).

Juniper drops down into the Risen Lands, and, once he's past figuring out that he has a game system attached, he immediately dumps points into SOC instead of PHY, MEN, or LUK, on the basis that the zombies don't seem all that fast or difficult, and he's going to need SOC when he meets someone.

He heads to the nearest town, Comfort, and ducks into an automotive shop, where he meets a pretty girl who, as her first interaction with him, points a gun in his face and starts asking questions, thereby justifying his decision to put points into SOC. He tells her that he's got no idea where he is or what's happening, and when he says he's from a place called Earth, she starts to believe him. She sends him on a fetch quest, assuming that he will likely die, or at worst, draw someone into the ambush that she's preparing.

Juniper fumbles his way through Comfort, somehow, collecting the seven souls. He eventually meets up with Becca, Sly, and Poul, other survivors, and with better SOC, is able to form more of a bond with them. Sly still doesn't make it (he was bleeding out when Juniper found him), but by talking it out, he discovers that everyone would prefer if he took Sly's soul. With closer coordination, Becca survives, meaning that Amaryllis is presented with three people rather than just two.

The soulcycle does not fit four people; in fact, the soulcycle doesn't fit three. If it were /just/ Poul and Juniper, Amaryllis could kill Poul and be done with it, given his crimes, but with two others, it's not so simple, especially since the crime Becca is in the Risen Lands for is relatively unobjectionable reason (partly accessory to her father's criminal business, but mostly the fact that she didn't flip on him). Because four is too many for the soulcycle, the group decides that they're going to have to get/fix a car instead, which gets confirmed by quest pop-up.

After some looting and killing, they leave Comfort in a car, whose tank is filled with additional gathered souls from members of the Coterie. They have an argument about whether to go to Silmar City or to head out to the border wall where they will be inducted into the Host, until eventually Amaryllis reveals the existence of the teleportation key and promises riches if they can retrieve it.

They make their way to Silmar City, which is a bit easier with four people. They go over the wall with a ladder they took from a farmhouse and strapped to the roof of the car. They encounter Fireteam Blackheart in the middle of the city streets, and have a calamitous encounter that kills Quills, Becca, Poul, and Carter. The survivors (Tova, Leonold, Fenn, Amaryllis, and Juniper) declare a truce and agree to mutual cooperation, since it doesn't seem like anyone is getting an extraction, and they still need the teleportation key. They go into Sorian's Castle together and ride the elevator up to the top floors, which is where they have a second, inevitable confrontation. Juniper, having put all his points thus far into SOC, convinces everyone to stand down and work together, convincing them to "switch sides" after the clusterfuck of a mission they'd been given.

End Book I.

--------------

They go to Barren Jewel, where a more socially-conscious Juniper is a help with gathering information. By the time the Risen Bile become active, he's learned that a helicopter makes infrequent trips out to Caer Laga, which is highly suspicious. This leads to Aumann, and highly suggests that the team acquire the skills of a warder, which leads them to Grakhuil Leadbraids.

Grak is willing to practice his trade in exchange for money, and is also in favor of pulling one over on Barren Jewel's resident gold mage. He agrees to come with, at which point Juniper gets a loyalty notification.

Tova's skills are particularly worthless in the desert, and six is a crowd, so she stays behind in Barren Jewel with a classmate from the athenaeum. The other five trek out into the desert. The first time, Amaryllis falls and twists her ankle, necessitating a teleport back to their hotel room in Barren Jewel. The second time, the thaum-suckers find them early and they have to teleport back. The third time, they make it without much incident, save at the end, and slip within the wards, collecting all of the entads and supplies that are stored there, breaking the ward that Aumann's warder put around the place, and teleporting out without anyone being any the wiser.

A couple things are different by this point. Tova and Leonold are both in the party, for a start, but Amaryllis also hasn't contracted rat rot, which means that she needs some other horrible disease or poison that can't be cured by anything short of a unicorn, if we want to do that arc. Juniper is probably able to navigate his way through some friendship development, but SOC just makes you better at that, it doesn't necessarily change your placement on the introversion/extroversion scale, nor does it necessarily give you any desire to delve into the past of someone you don't care about. The other big difference is that without Amaryllis captured by Aumann, he's either out of the story, or needs to get worked into it somehow. (And though it won't really rear its head for another few books, Juniper hasn't had cause to burn his own bones, because he never had to use the rocket to cross the desert.)

If you want to follow canon but with a more social focus, you would probably have Grak suggest that they still hit Aumann's tower, or possibly reveal that had been his plan before, if Juniper didn't know that already. It's attractive, because Aumann is a shitbag and it would only take a single lightning-quick strike to make vast sums of money ... but it's a "let's just rob this mobster" plot, which is questionably intelligent, especially since (unlike canon) there's no worry that anyone knows Amaryllis is alive. Perhaps the Risen Bile plotline actually ends up going somewhere, and ties back in to Aumann.

But depending on what you'd do from there, it could become a totally different story unless thrust back onto the rails by a DM that really, really wants things to go a certain way.
