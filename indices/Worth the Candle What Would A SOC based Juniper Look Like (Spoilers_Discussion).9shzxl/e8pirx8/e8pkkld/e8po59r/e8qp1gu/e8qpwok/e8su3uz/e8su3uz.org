  Juniper looks more effective here because you don't see the scenarios where he dies to the Coterie, dies to the zombies, dies to Fireteam Blackheart, etc., and the plot doesn't substantially change because this is "full railroad" mode, where decisions matter, but the Stations of Canon are roughly the same.

One factor that might make that more reasonable is the most of the magical skills are MEN/SOC. A Juniper that focused on MEN/SOC could still be combat effective.
