I think the opposite. Using SOC to pick up on problems earlier would be helpful, but being good at hiding your true feeling and at manipulation would give you a worse reputation and create new problems. Conversely, being unable to do so makes you easier to trust.

Bethel dislikes Mary partly because she clearly has the skill set of a scheming noble. I would think a more smoother Joon would also rub Bethel the wrong way.

I also think Mary would grow to trust SOC Joon a lot slower given what we know about her.
