Joon is a force multiplier. His own power, though strong, is not what makes their party scary. That's people like Val and Bethel, who are both world-endingly powerful, and majorly fucked up in the head.

Joon needs to be like Jack Slash in that he is moderately powerful alone, but massively powerful when orchestrating others. He needs to delicately tend to the mental health of his team, ensuring they do what he wants, and don't get into unwanted trouble.

Effectively, it's not that Joon is powerful with a SOC build. It's that without one, his team is ridiculously inefficient due to their various hangups. If he was able to trust them all, and they him, everything would be going so much faster.

Imagine if he convinced Bethel to go with them to Scrutiny, for one. Or made a stronger connection with the locus. Or could find a way to turn Grak away from suicide. Or was able to actually trust Val to use her devils.

The art of overpowering SOC is no longer needing to take human mental limitations into consideration when it really matters.
