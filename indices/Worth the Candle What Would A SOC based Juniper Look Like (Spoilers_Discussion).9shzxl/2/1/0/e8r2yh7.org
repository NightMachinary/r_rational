is this really that good of a comparison? I kind of get it, in that he leads a party around, based primarily on some weird charm rather than physical threat but that's... kind of where the comparison ends.

I think "like valencia" is a better comparison. "Toddler with a railgun" and all that. A devastating social power that he doesn't really know how to wield for good (despite wanting to).

Honestly, I think "toddler with a railgun" applies to Joon somewhat even in canon, where he has immense physical and magical power that he (again) doesn't have the maturity to wield properly (again, like Valencia).

What I think the Jack Slash comparison misses is that Joon would still try to be a good person.
