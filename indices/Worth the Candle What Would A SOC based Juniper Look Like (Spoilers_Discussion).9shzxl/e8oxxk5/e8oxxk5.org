It's entirely dependant on how the stats actually affect him, for instance the simulation he's in crashes when he maxes out his inteelignce(though it's never clarified whether that's due to max Int making him realize he's in a sim that crashes it, or the sim crashed because he exceeded a maximum stack value ((how smart he can possibly be))thus causing an overflow), so it's implied that the stats don't add new abilities just enhance them.

Junipers strength stat allows him to bench press a truck, but doesn't give him the durability that should be needed so his new muscles don't tear his own body apart, because amaryllis punching him still hurts him.

So it depends on whether the game layer would allow it to

1) exceed June's native abilities ie more socially capable then is humanly possible(like Sherlock but for emotions)

2) improve or reduce the impact of june's Actions depending on his intent( a modifier for people's reactions to him)

3) raise a flat value for How positively he's viewed by everyone who he talks to or is viewed by.
