interestingly the plot simply doesn't allow for this, because any rational actor who has to prioritize immediate survival in a deadly environment will pour stats into strength and so on.

i guess in theory he could now rearrange his stats completely, now that most of the threats are somewhat known quantities. (although i tend to glaze over when aw talks about the details of this, so i'm not sure what's possible.)

sorry this is tangential to your question.
