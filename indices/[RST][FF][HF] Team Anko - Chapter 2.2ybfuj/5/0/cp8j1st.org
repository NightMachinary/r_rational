[Shino is the heir]

Can you provide a citation for that? It isn't mentioned in [[http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Shino_Aburame][his entry]] on the wiki, or [[http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Aburame_clan][the Aburame clan's]] entry, and [[http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Shibi_Aburame][his father]] isn't listed as the head of the clan -- just "the pride of" the clan. (Also, Shibi was sent on missions, which doesn't sound very clan-headish.)

  Also, it's the land of Rice-paddies, not the land of Sound. Hidden Sound Village is located in the land of Rice-paddies.

[[http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Land_of_Sound][The wiki disagrees.]]
