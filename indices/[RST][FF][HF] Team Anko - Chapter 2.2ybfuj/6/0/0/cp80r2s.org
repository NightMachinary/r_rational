  I think you should reread, because you are misunderstanding several things and making a lot of assumptions that are not supported (or are contradicted) in the text.

Assumptions regarding what? The population issues? I think I read it fairly carefully, and I even read your glossary of terms, and I still can't make it work out inside my head.

I'm not going to do a reread immediately, but whatever it was, it certainly wasn't obvious to /me,/ though I'm perfectly willing to admit that I could be wrong, or have missed it.

If you could point me at the general gist of the misunderstanding, I could probably do the rest of the inference work myself, without any need for you to write a long and detailed outline. I am honestly curious.
