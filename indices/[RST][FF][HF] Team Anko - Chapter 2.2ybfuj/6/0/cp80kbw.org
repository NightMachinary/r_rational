Meh. I had a long post here, but the details don't matter. It all boils down to "I think you should reread, because you are misunderstanding several things and making a lot of assumptions that are not supported (or are contradicted) in the text."

As to IFF and appropriating your ideas / reading your mind -- definitely not deliberately. I read IFF a long time ago and then skimmed it again after your mega-review on 2YE. Very little of it has stuck, so there's certainly no deliberate theft going on. I suspect that a lot of the points of congruence are simply because the ideas are pretty obvious -- canon!Konoha has no revealed tech base that would support radio headsets and satellite dishes, so they must be coming from elsewhere. The tech is rare, which probably means expensive, which probably means the source is a long way away. What kind of country would have a higher tech base? One that didn't have chakra, so had to focus on tech. What government structure best supports tech development in the real world? Democracies / republics.
