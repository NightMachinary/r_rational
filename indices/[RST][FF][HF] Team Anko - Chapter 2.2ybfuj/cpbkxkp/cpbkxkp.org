So how often are you going to update? I just read the first two chapters in one go. I really enjoyed it! Like the way you got Shino to lose his cool.

Are we going to find out what the limit of Naruto's chakra capacity is? I feel like it is a HUGE advantage.

Also, they gonna work on inventing jutsu?
