Consequences must be upheld. She used cleaning the grease trap as an incentive to get them to go all out in not getting to the rooftop last. She got to see what they could pull out in their desperation.

If she did not follow through on that it would be much harder to enforce discipline upon them. I know they act more maturely but they are still JUST 12 years old. They're used to cushy academy training, not the real harsh world of ninjas.

Another reason to make Naruto do it so early would be to get him used to being unprepared. This ingrains the lesson with him and his teammates, especially with her little speech as they left the village so early with no gear. Certainly the best way to enforce that you should ALWAYS be prepared to go on a long mission would be to suffer through one after being unprepared. Especially since this probably won't go smoothly.
