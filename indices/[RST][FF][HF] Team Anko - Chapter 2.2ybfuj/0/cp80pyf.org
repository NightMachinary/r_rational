Mean~ I wanna know what the Daimyo is planning, and you just had to leave off the reveal, didn't you? :D

Interesting chapter, overall. A good summary of the political climate of the Naruto countries, as well as an explanation for their strange technology level - anything we'd consider beyond middle-ages in tech is imported from another country across the ocean, with a monopoly being held on goods from Lightning. Thus resulting in any goods being rare and very expensive, and thus not generally used in everything. Also could be taken as a valid explanation for the end of Naruto canon, where they get technology good enough for laptops and such.
