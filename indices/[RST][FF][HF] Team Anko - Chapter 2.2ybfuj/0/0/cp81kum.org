Yep. :> Admit it, it was more engaging this way, wasn't it?

[tech / politics]

Yep, that's how I see it. I did a bunch of research to figure out what the tech level of the Republic needed to be; the main thing I learned is that tech advanced at a TERRIFYING pace between 1800 and ~1920. Which isn't to say it's slowed down since then, it's just that I was looking to place them somewhere in that window of time. I eventually just chose a point and decided that their tech development tree wasn't identical to the real world, so they have / don't have certain things we had at the time.
