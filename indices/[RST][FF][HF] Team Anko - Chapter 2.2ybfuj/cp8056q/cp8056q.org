A solid chapter by all accounts, very solid indeed! I quite liked it. I found a lot of the hints you're beginning to lay out very interesting.

And I am also very happy that you made the thoroughly sensible choice to stay far, far away from anything related to Wave and pursue your own, more interesting plot line. And it does sound very interesting - not quite like anything I've seen before. And I liked your versions of shadow clones. However, you've not nerfed them particularly hard, it appears, in the purest combat sense. I trust Naruto won't inexplicably forget that he can spawn an army at will, like he does in canon - he really is quite powerful, already.

I have to say, my previously expressed worries regarding character expression and humour have been somewhat alleviated by this chapter. Anko's scene with Naruto definitely had me giggling at a few points. The Hokage /felt/ like the bloody Hokage. There wasn't a single thing that I considered objectionable. Perhaps, it was more the unique flavour of 2YE that made it like that. This looks like you're turning over a promising new leaf (heh) so far, anyway.

I think your Naruto is quite, well, off-flavour from the original (stupid) canon character - but I also trust this is intentional. I'm honestly not going to complain - canon Naruto is just horrible most of the time, until later in the series when he grows up a little bit. Your Naruto feels more like a more intelligent/less actively dumb version of late-Shippuuden Naruto than it does the dattebayo-spurting dimwit from early canon.

I do have a few minor quibbles, though I'm not in a hurry to have them addressed. As you promised, I trust you've got some twists in mind to explain away the worst inconsistencies.

My most major quibble, really, is that the characters don't really act like twelve year olds. They act like young adults (14-18) - who are generally much more interesting characters to write about. Don't get me wrong - I think trying hard to make them act like actual twelve year olds would be a horrible mistake. I just prefer to be able to also picture them as young adults in my head, when emotionally and narratively, that's what they feel like. It's not that big a deal, I guess, and perhaps changing the ages was too big a change, since you're playing canon /mostly/ straight so far.

I also still can't think of an explanation for how the puny numbers of ninja matches up with country-to-country warfare. It sounded like your Land of Fire was about a quarter to half the size of France, which implies a population at the very least well into the millions at this technology level, unless it's just barren forests and supports a far smaller population than one might think, for some reason.

Considering how canon ninja match up to normal civilians, it seems unlikely that "normals" can match the power of even a few ninja by fielding regular armies. So either you must have thoroughly nerfed the more powerful ninja (so Kisame couldn't casually destroy an arbitrarily large army of normals with a moving sea, for example), or the fact is that ninja really are so overpowered that only they truly can wage open war, even though they are so few in number.

And I might be convinced of the truth of this if ninja were portrayed as being such an incredibly important elite, but they're not. Academy training appears to be appallingly lacking and the Konoha Academy is, at the very least, not the /ultra elite super star academy/ it ought to be in such a case, and ninja are not, so far as I know, treated as the ultimate saviours and guardians of the nation, nor as their all-powerful all-dominating tyrants.

There must be some balance of power that prevents any slightly ruthless Kage from simply deposing their nation's daimyo or turning them into political figureheads for the people. It's not like anyone can do anything to stop a ninja anyway, unless they are one. Wealth only gets you so far, and ninja don't appear to be incredibly wealthy, either, so that's not the balancing factor.

Ninja have been around for a while. If the village-daimyo system has been around for a while (long enough to be stable across multiple generations) and is practically universal, as you imply in your map post, there must be some incentive to keep it that way, and to have made it that way in the first place.

I can't for the life of me think how that works out at all with things as currently portrayed, but I shall keep my mind open.

As a last aside note, I see you're doing the "technology advanced far-off country" thing as well. Good move - it does go a long way to explain some of the worse technological quirks of the universe. That's a big part of the reason I decided to do it myself.

(Worse, you made it a bloody republic, too. Are you reading my mind?)

Eh, I ramble again.

TL;DR - good job! I've a few worries and some things puzzle me, but I'm more speculating out loud than actively complaining, right now. I genuinely look forward to reading more.
