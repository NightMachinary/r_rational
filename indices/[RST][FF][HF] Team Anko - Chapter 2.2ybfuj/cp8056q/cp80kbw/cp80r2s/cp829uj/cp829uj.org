(We actually just discussed all this on Skype, but for everyone else's benefit I'll put it here as well.)

Things I haven't covered yet:

- How many ninja there are
- What warfare looks like in this world
- Why the political situation (Kage + Daimyo) works the way it does

And you're right, the genin don't act like 12-year-olds. For a lot of history, kids were apprenticed at 8, married at 13, and had kids by 14. Also, these are child soldiers who grew up with adult ninja as role models. They are mentally much older than an equivalent modern Western 12-year-old would be.

As to nerfing shadow clones -- in some ways I gave them a boost, by saying that you can make them human-solid. On the other hand, I nerfed them by saying:

- They don't give you their memories when they pop, so they don't provide parallel processing for thinking or training. That's the big one right there.
- They aren't fanatically loyal / obedient, so they won't do anything you wouldn't be willing to do (unless you make them really stupid, anyway; the ones with the IQ of a dog will happily dive in the septic tank for you, but they lack any ability to think their way around unexpected events). If you make them as smart as you are, they may go off and have a barbecue instead of doing your hunting for you.
