Thanks!

I'm just trying to be optimistic. In a realistic setting I assume many ninja missions would have parameters with non-ideal settings and conditions. Let them get used to surprises and un-optimized settings so they're not totally thrown when the come up against a non-planned one. At least that's what I'd do.
