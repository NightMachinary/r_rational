Also, just because I feel obligated to say it as this is [[/r/rational][r/rational]]; her decision to fight a possibly giant lizard was a bit at odds with the pragmatism she's shown throughout the rest of the story. It's somewhat easy to accept her bikini chainmail; the world convention she lives in literally stops her from getting anything else. But, based on how intelligent she's been, I find it doubtful she'd one on one a lizard larger than herself while blindfolded. Especially considering she doesn't have all that much experience fighting blind.

Just a small nitpick. Still a great read though :)
