Can't believe I'm overthinking /Twilight/ stuff... but Luminosity and Radiance were pretty good so I don't feel too bad.

Issues I see:

1. Volturi have vamps with powers. Can't recall if they have as many in the original series as they do in Alicorn's stories, but at the very least they have a mind-reader, a shield-generator, an illusionist who can cause blinding pain, another that can cause sensory deprivation, and probably others. They might not have pre-cognition, but Alice does - and there's no telling if the Cullens would approve of your plan. Almost certainly not, since you're literally building up an army of new vampires to overthrow the old order.

2. Newborns are feral as hell, and much much stronger than older vamps. Hell, Jasper is like 160 years old and still has trouble controlling himself. It's quite possible that they would accidentally tear you apart as soon as they were turned (though the more preparations you make and the more successes you have, the lower the risk of this). There's also no guarantee they'd agree to your plan after turning - it can drive them insane. And the smell of humans may turn them frenzied for decades after - the smell of blood can do so even after a century (again, Jasper).

3. There's no guarantee that years from now the Volturi won't have made up some counter, or that the plan is still feasible. The problem with playing the long game is that technology is increasing so rapidly that parts of this may be obsolete by the time you're ready to start. You could try and use newborns and move up the time frame, but that risks them going crazy with bloodlust in a city. And the Volturi have dealt with newborn armies before.

I almost feel like the best way to wipe out the Volturi would be to study nuclear physics, learn to create a bomb, and wipe out the entire city with it. Hell, or find a way to steal or buy an old Soviet bomb. Horrific, inhumane, will throw the entire world into shock... but less risky than using an army of new vampires with flaming shotguns and combat training. Plus then there's no question of what to do with your army of vamps after overthrowing the vampire world order.
