I read them all too. The plots were so stupid and the romance was creepy, but I just couldn't overcome my brain boner for the cyborg-like vampires. I would have loved to have their physiology. Luminosity/Radiance was total wish fulfillment for me because I spent the entire canon series like "aaarrrghhh just TURN HER turn EVERYONE oh my GOD"
