So they didn't quite run around slaughtering people, but they caused a significant amount of death. That doesn't... invalidate the whole plan in theory, but it does change my calculus slightly.

Honestly this is the kind of thing I'd just wait for technology to fix. In an increasingly CCTV filled world, eventually a young vampire will show up on camera, and another, and another. It goes out on liveleak or youtube or torrents if those are compromised. Can't stop the signal, not forever. The masquerade crumbles and while the vampires are very strong, they are few. Humanity is many. I prefer my chances as one of a group of more sympathetic vampires helping the humans more than I like my chances in going undetected long enough to make an overwhelming alpha strike. As time passes and cyber prosthetics become an option the advantages of a Vampire over a human become fewer and lesser. Eventually all they have less is the magic. At some point they either stop eating people, or they die.

Messier, yes. I am simply not self-sacrificing enough to go for the other option, though. Perhaps a nuke to that city in Italy would be cleaner.
