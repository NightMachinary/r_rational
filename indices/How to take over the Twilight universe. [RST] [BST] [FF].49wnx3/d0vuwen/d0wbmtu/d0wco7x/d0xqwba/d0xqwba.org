I have read canon twilight (including the Bree Tanner side story) and can confirm that pretty much everything he said in that second comment was right. The newborn army gathered by Victoria was housed in a city (San Francisco IIRC) and, in very relative terms, didn't do that badly. There were an upswing in vicious murders (classic for newly born vampires that aren't as in control of themselves as they should be) in the area, which is how they were noticed in the first place, but still not enough to warrant immediate Volturi action. At least not for a year.

That being said, even your average vampire needs to feed, so you're still going to have issues with that, as the more concentrated your force is, the easier it is for the spike in kidnappings to be noticed. I say kidnappings because it should be very obvious that leaving the victim behind is an idiotic move, as you'd leave a bloodless husk. Something pretty noticeable and indicative of vampires.
