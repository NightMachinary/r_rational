I just wish we had better numbers on how durable Twilight vampires actually were. Their skin's compared to stone a number of times, and the sparkle makes me conclude that the vampirization process changed their skin into some sort of crystal-like lattice. But I still don't know how durable they are. Are they bullet proof? Even if they weren't completely, they're clearly resistant to pain and seem to be fast enough that, even if you shot them once, you wouldn't be able to shoot them again. In addition, the Quilete wolves' claws and teeth have some magic that lets them break through the vampire's skin, so can we harness that? Can I extract the claws and teeth of a werewolf (I'm assuming it'll just grow back since they have healing factors) and tip bullets with them, making insta-vampire killing weapons?

Also, random ass side note, the only saving grace for humanity in twilight against the vampires spreading is how out of control newborns are. Hence they're unable to turn people since they just outright kill them instead. Plus the Volturi's self-interest leads to them policing the supernatural world for us.
