Unless the Volturi were involved with controlling nuclear warheads, I don't think it would be that hard for a few vampires to acquire one. Especially if you happen to have some sort of mind control power.

I also don't think flaming shotguns would even work. Vampires need to be dismembered before they're burnt, because their pieces can still move and can escape from the flames. They're really supposed to be quite hard to kill.
