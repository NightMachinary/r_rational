I forgot about the witches. If someone is found with powers and surrenders then I would offer them extra money, or power. I'm also hoping that they would stay loyal to their maker, aka me.

I'm going to do some basic math and see how often witches actually do pop up. Although I'd only be sampling from the list of known vampires in Twilight it should give me some sort of statistical basis on how many witches I can expert per vampire.

I'll be omitting Victoria's army from my calculations.
