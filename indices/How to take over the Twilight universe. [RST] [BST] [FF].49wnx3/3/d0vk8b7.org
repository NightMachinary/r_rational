Uhh how do you deal with the witches? Forget defeating the Volturi (who iirc have a shielder vamp in their retinue), how do you stay God Emperor if you are willing to turn people you consider to be desirable? There's no reason they can't end up with really OP ant-you powers. Also why do you expect that some of the soldiers wouldn't have anti-brain washing powers as well? Even if witches are relatively rare (in Luminosity they are, but in canon Twilight most vampires we see have some power), you still are talking about >200 total vampires (assuming that you consider >60 scientists etc. as desirables).
