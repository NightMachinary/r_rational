It's a web novel. On the one hand, the novel is excellent, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4zncxn/forty_millenniums_of_cultivation_%E4%BF%AE%E7%9C%9F%E5%9B%9B%E4%B8%87%E5%B9%B4_rt/][for reasons well put here]]. On the other hand, the early English translations are not fluent, the story starts out weak, it can have atrocious pacing at time, and it's not completely immune to the tropes from the genre it tries to reconstruct.

When the story is good, it can be very strong. Thoughtful villains, trope awareness, sophisticated worldbuilding, machiavellian plots, genuinely clever tricks, thinking out loud, utilitarianist themes, economics. [[https://www.facebook.com/yudkowsky/posts/10156763190259228][It has Eliezer's recommendation.]] Just don't expect this to mean you'll necessarily enjoy it. It depends on your tollerance of the negatives.
