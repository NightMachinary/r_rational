It's primarily a chinese webnovel, being translated into English on a daily basis. The manga adaptation is a long way away from approaching where the webnovel translation is currently at.

Instead of reading on webnovel.com, if that's where you found it, I recommend sites like [[https://www.wuxiaworld.co/Forty-Millenniums-of-Cultivation/][WuxiaWorld]] or [[https://novelfull.com/forty-millenniums-of-cultivation.html][NovelFull]]. From everything I've heard, webnovel's administration is pretty scummy, so I have no compunctions with reading on an alternative site.
