I write RE: Trailer Trash, a do-over story about someone in 2045 having their mind sent back into their thirteen-year-old body in 1998. At the moment, I'm juggling all of my subplots, and struggling to give readers a satisfying enough look at one before I have to throw it back up into the air and catch the next one.

I'm tempted to say I can gloss over the police shooting fallout at this point, because without social media everyone she knows isn't going to find out about it right away. That way, I can focus on the school drama subplot and the subplot involving her relationship with her mother. I feel like it might annoy readers who want resolution to one thing at a time, but on the other hand Tabitha's supposed to be feeling overwhelmed in the story right now.

Tough call on what would be the most satisfying to read, since I can't assume the subplots will be seamlessly woven together.
