Hi everyone! I'm a fan of Miraculous: Adventures of Ladybug and Chat Noir, and working on a (long, complicated) fanfic for it. The primary antagonist is a terrorist weaponizing negative emotions to obtain a pair of McGuffins that, when used together, can rewrite reality, at the cost of a balancing sacrifice. For example, an AI can become human, but it would cost the humanity of the AI's creator. The (emotional terrorist , Faustian) villain wants to save the life of his comatose, possibly dying wife.

This sounds like it has MASSIVE potential for a Rationalist AU, but I'm struggling with the morality of the (creative) protagonist to just use the McGuffins to eliminate Death altogether for humans (it would probably mean a genocide for some other sentient species, which is deeply out of character for her).

I would also love advice for writing villains that can read the protagonists' minds/emotions without much effort.[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18637792/chapters/44197456][Echidna]]
