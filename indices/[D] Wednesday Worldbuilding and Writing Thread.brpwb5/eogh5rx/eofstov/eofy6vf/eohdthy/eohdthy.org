I've been listening to the Writing Excuses podcast since a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/anr7hw/12part_lecture_on_novel_writing_by_brandon/][post]] about it here a few months ago. One thing Brandon Sanderson says often is that one of the most important facets of good fiction writing is /keeping your promises/. That means that you have to be aware of what expectations you create in your story and at least address those expectations, if not satisfy them.

So if you think your readers are expecting a resolution to this subplot then you probably do need to give it to them, either that or subvert that expectation in an interesting way. (I personally hate anti-climaxes outside of comedy, but that's just me)
