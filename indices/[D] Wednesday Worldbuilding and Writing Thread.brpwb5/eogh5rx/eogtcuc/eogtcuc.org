One of the runabouts from Deep Space 9 would be a good early project as it's relatively small, but the onboard transporter and replicator will have countless applications including solving a lot of your resource problems for future construction projects. I'd have recommended one of the TNG or Voyager shuttles instead as they're even smaller but i'm not entirely sure they canonically have replicators.
