I'm writing a Worm fanfic where the main character has the power to build space ships. Basically, imagine any space ship from any setting, and she can build it. There /are/ limits, though.

---Due to a conceit of the setting, superpowers (including the main character's ability to build and understand her space ships) fade as they travel farther from Earth.\\
---Advanced tech takes time and resources, depending on my arbitrary judgment. Essentials such as anti-grav, inertial compensators, strengthened frame, rudimentary autopilot, and point defense are simple, but a shield generator takes a huge ship with a lot of space and power, and is a vastly complicated piece of technology.\\
---Every piece of tech is completely integrated with the space ship it's built into. You can't rip out a shield generator or cloaking device without breaking both the ship and the generator, and neither can she just build one separate from the other. If a super advanced ship contains a cloning bay, the only way to get the cloning bay is to make the /entire ship/.\\
---For balance reasons, harvester and fabricator ships are huge and expensive pieces of technology, as is the kind of ship that would include automatic repair systems. Without attention, ships will break down, though not without warning.\\
---A created being called the Simurgh, an Endbringer, is on the lookout for any large-scale technological uplift or space development, and will brutally put down anything that can destroy her or other Endbringers, or is a symbol of hope to humanity.
