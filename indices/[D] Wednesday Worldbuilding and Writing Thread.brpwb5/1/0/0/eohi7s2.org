I don't know whether it's absolute or subjective value, since the canon is abundantly clear that using the McGuffins to make this trade is Immoral and Must Not Be Done Under Any Circumstances. But the Fullmetal Alchemist instinct is absolutely a good point and I'll think on that as I try to recalibrate where I want the story to go (canon moves the plot so seldom that every time it does, everyone is surprised)
