Very interesting premise. I don't know anything about the setting, so I have some questions.

Do the McGuffins work based off of system of absolute or subjective value? Would the cost be the same if the AI creator wanted to become a machine, i.e. would it be possible to engineer the request so that the sacrifice is desirable? If the villain and the hero ask for the same thing would the sacrifice be the same?

Have you seen or read Fullmetal Alchemist? It's a great (and mostly rational) anime/manga in which Alchemy works similar to these McGuffins, as you describe them. The rule that governs how the exchange works is "[[https://fma.fandom.com/wiki/Alchemy#Equivalent_Exchange][Equivelant Exchange]]"(don't read further on this page if you don't want to get spoiled) and it's definitely rational. It might serve as a guideline for your own story.

As to the villain part, these two posts from the last few weeks about rational villains are pretty good, and had some interesting perspectives and discussions about the subject:
