I mean he sort of defeats his own argument.

He admits that what matters isn't realism but consistency, and that the abilities of any character in a game depends on the sort of feel you're going for. He never justifies why the feel he likes is superior to that of other tones, other than claim that it's more "serious" and "gritty" while what he doesn't like is "silly."

Then he brings up Lord of the Rings as being more serious, but it has a bunch of comedic moments and non-magical people performing superheroic stunts.

He never explains why a table should adhere to any value of seriousness beyond his personal tastes. His constantly bringing up "silliness" is an emotional appeal, not a rational one.

Then there is the slip into passive sentence structure. "...when the world has presented itself as gritty..." Except the world doesn't exist and does not present itself.

In DnD, the setting and its people are created by the interactions of the DM and the players. We're a bunch of people sitting around the table (or our webcams) for hours on end having a conversation.
