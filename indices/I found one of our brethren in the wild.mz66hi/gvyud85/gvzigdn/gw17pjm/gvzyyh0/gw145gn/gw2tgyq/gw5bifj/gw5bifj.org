Not really, which is kind of the point.\\
Memory is also very hazy, so I might be totally butchering the LOTR plot.\\
Just remember that the books made a left turn from the story and the Hobbit gang chilled with a mysterious, friendly demigod with reality-bending powers called Tom Bombadil.\\
And I think they also sang songs (they really like doing that...come to think of it, LOTR hobbits must have inspired the Smurfs).\\
If you're friends with a mysterious demigod, I'd assume it would have been relevant, when you're trying to do the ring quest.\\
But he was like...never brought up again.
