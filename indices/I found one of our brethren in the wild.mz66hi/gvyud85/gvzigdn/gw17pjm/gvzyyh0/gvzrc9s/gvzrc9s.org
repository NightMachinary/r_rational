It kindof falls into a trap that you see a lot in highly upvoted reddit posts, ie, The Impassioned Argument for Something Everyone Agrees With.

Everyone likes stories with consistent rules, of course including 'magic' doesn't mean that suddenly anything is possible. Yes, LotR and TPB are tonally different. Yes, it wouldn't make sense for Aragorn to pull out a gun. It's a winded takedown of a strawman that no one would argue for.

The real issue here (I think) is something a bit different: what do you do when the DM and the players have different ideas of how to play? The DM wants to keep things grounded, while the players want to have fun and try to pull off some ridiculous stunts. There are different values at play here in what makes a good game of DnD, and questions of what weight to give aspects such as storytelling, player choice and creativity in a game where everyone needs to work together in order to make a story.
