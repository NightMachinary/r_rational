I think you are missing their point. They are refuting the argument "Dragons and magic are not realistic, so nothing else has to be realistic. Therefore, I should be able to do a quadruple backflip for no in-story reason"

Their argument is that internal consistency is a thing, and also that when a dm is going for a certain tone, players shouldn't be like "eh, magic exists so this is a silly world anyway, let's do whatever". Both good points.
