  This is how I feel about my fantasy reading material. I tend to do a lot of theorycrafting while I read and inconsistencies end up being frustratingly immersion breaking. There's actually a whole community of people who love reading books with internally consistent worldbuilding over at [[/r/rational][r/rational]] and [[/r/HPMOR][r/HPMOR]]. If you're at all interested in reading a fantasy story with an internally consistent magic system and a world that has been drastically shaped by said system in believable ways, I highly recommend checking out [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21220/mother-of-learning][Mother of Learning]], which is considered to be one of the best works in the genre. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/fuiikt/recommended_fiction_list/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf][This post]] has a big list of similar stories.
