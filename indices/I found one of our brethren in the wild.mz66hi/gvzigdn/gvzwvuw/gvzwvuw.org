Realism and consistency are not really different, except in degree.

Also, while the LotR movies have some superheroic stuff, I don't think anyone but Gimli who does anything of that kind could be reasonably described as nonmagical. And most of it is absent in the books. Elves literally see the world as flat, Aragorn is a relic of an ancient part-Elven bloodline with a number of understated magical relics to his name, Frodo and Sam have the Ring when they pull off their stunts (and the phial of starlight).

And even given their advantages, they still are much more consistent about their rules than the Princess Bride, which makes no attempt whatsoever to have internal consistency.
