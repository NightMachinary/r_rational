He was brought up again. In the council of Elrond, someone was like "could we just leave the Ring with Tom?" and they received the answer: "Sure, but that wouldn't stop Sauron from taking over the world. And having conquered the world, Sauron could deal with Tom eventually. Aaand Tom might just lose the ring anyway, he has trouble paying attention to that sort of thing."

But this doesn't invalidate your larger point of LOTR only making narrative sense, though I would say it is very consistent about it. The Nature of Bombadil determines what he will and won't do, as do the natures of all other things in the story. Anyways, I'd argue all this is moot, as the OP was more about magic not forcing you to a light tone, and LOTR is tonally very consistent.
