In the books, there was Tom Bombadil.\\
Completely took me out of the story.\\
After that anything could happen at any time, with no explanation given.\\
LOTR never felt consistent to me. I'd place it firmly in the Marvel-movie class of storytelling.\\
EDIT: This isn't meant to sound overly dismissive.\\
Marvel is very good at storytelling.\\
I just prefer stories that make actual sense, rather than just narrative sense.
