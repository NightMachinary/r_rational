Yeah, when I DM I tend to make things fairly "anime" with levels of exaggerated action and ability. That doesn't make them "more unrealistic" it just means the tone is different. Arguing for internal consistency is good, but arguing that "internal consistency" means "gritty" or "realistic" is absurd.
