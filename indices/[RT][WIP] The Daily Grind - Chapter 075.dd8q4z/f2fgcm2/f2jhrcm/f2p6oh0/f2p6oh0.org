Sounds like me for sure. Eventually, we realize it's our thoughts stressing us out, not the things themselves. Which doesn't help much since it's hardwired :p The best way to hack that hardwiring is meditation via this seculr book [[/r/TheMindIlluminated/]].

That book is a bit of a favourite on lesswrong, starslatecodex, and here but other people probably have other methods like stoicism or lifestyle changes.

Ignore this advice if it will result in you getting less words down please. I'm selfish, and I want more daily grind :p Who ever heard of a happy fiction writer?
