I've still been thinking about circular narratives because of the previous chapter.

Maybe I'm overstating it, but it feels like there was an emphasis on how a key feature of the two we've seen (the mural, and the manuscripts) have no beginning, and so you just have to pick a random place to start.

We're dealing with a loop story though, not a circle (or are we?). Since it's a loop story it's almost the opposite of having no beginning, there's a specific beginning that you keep going back to. Tradionally the whole point is trying to resolve whatever circumstance is causing you to go back to that beginning, to escape the loop.

...huh, well, if you wanted to be cheeky, being stuck in a three day time loop that resets almost all memories is technically a really shitty version of phoenix immortality. Abusing a time loop to stay alive instead of trying to escape it is also a thing, especially if you're stalling to find a better solution. And if you were going to pick a spot to cause a time loop until while you did long-term research on immortality, the Conclave is probably the best one.

But anyway, more importantly, would Sekmeht have gotten a profile if those were still a thing? Would Eshmun have gotten one? Would the presence and/or lack of presence of a profile spill the beans on whether or not they're people?

And what happens if you give Sekmeht one of the circular manuscripts? It sounds like a terrible idea but hey what's the worst that could happen?

Do rampant AI stories still exist in this setting? If they don't I guess she gets a pass for not being genre savvy.
