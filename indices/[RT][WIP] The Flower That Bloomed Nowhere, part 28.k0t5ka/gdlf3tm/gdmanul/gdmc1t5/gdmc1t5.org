I will point out that "time loop mystery", doesn't necessarily imply a Groundhog Day/Majora's Mask/Mother of Learning type scenario of procedural recursion and advancement. Just a mystery centered around a time loop.

That's not to say this /isn't/ that, strictly speaking. But it's something to think about, I guess.

They probably do? But I would say Neferuaten is teasing Ran a bit through most of their dialogue in this chapter. She is, for whatever reason, not worried about it herself.
