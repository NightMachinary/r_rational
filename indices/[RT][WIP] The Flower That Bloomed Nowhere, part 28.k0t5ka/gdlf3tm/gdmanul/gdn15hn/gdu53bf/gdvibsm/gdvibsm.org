Sorry, I try to only post here every other update to not spam the subreddit.

I assume you're referring to the blocked out text. It is a precedent set up a few chapters earlier that Su "blocks out" her grandfather's name whenever it's spoken.

As for the meaning of "scriptwriters", that was explained in chapter 26, at least by implication.
