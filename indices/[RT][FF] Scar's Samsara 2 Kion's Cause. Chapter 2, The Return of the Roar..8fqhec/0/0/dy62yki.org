Regarding character description, it would be great if you could make it more obvious in the text which character is which species, since it's much easier to identify “the hippo is doing this thing” and then later associate the name with that character. This is especially true at the beginning of a fic like there where you introduced a bunch of characters (from the show) who are new to your audience.

Regarding update speed, I'm happy either way. Once a week is still much more frequent than most fics I read. Do whatever will make you happier and less likely to burn out.
