  In the city-state of Roulettenburg violence is non-existent and everything is settled through magical gambling. When Leo, a low-born tutor for a noble family, visits for the first time with his patrons, he realizes that not only does he love gambling, but that he can finally pursue the one desire burning in his heart. Unfortunately, fate has other plans for him in this tale of friendship, teamwork, addiction, and love.

If anyone's interested, I'm gonna post the second chapter this Friday at around noon EST. One of the most common complaints when I post here is that my stories don't have enough munchkin moments even though they have rational characters and themes. I think it's because my settings, despite being internally consistent, often border on the irrational, so this time around I'm going to focus on world building something with rigid rules that can be exploited in fun ways. So yeah, if anyone has any questions about the setting feel free to ask!
