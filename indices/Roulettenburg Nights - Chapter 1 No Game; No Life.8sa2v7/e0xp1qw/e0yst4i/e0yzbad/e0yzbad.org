Yes! They're all in my subreddit, [[/r/WeirdEmoKidStories]]. You can find all of my short stories there and also my book [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tN6g1hdiHl0BYGk5hQjtfyZwK1SnPNM7qsDLexIBDIQ/edit?usp=sharing][Lain's Number]], if you're interested in a really unconventional horror-fantasy. I've been told it's very easy to binge. Fair warning, I've improved a lot since finishing it last year and I'm currently in the middle of editing it, so I can't promise it being up to my current standards. There's also the fact that it touches on some sensitive topics that I don't feel I handled as well as I could, but a lot of people still enjoyed it, so maybe this is just me being an insecure perfectionist.
