Very nice.

The world building shows through really well for a first chapter, and your character descriptions get across exactly who we're dealing with.

Something to be careful of: the prose gets a little purple in places. Now, don't get me wrong; I /like/ purple prose. But there's a time and a place for it.

When you're describing a dazzling place like Roulettenburg, going into extended metaphorical imagery suits the story well. At other times, it's distracting, like "An intrusive aura of malice saturated the room with its crushing weight, seeping outwards from Mister Astley and crawling all over Leo's skin."

It's just too much; I have no idea how Leo feels at the end of all that.

But, again, where you're describing the actual city, the imagery and metaphor of the descriptions convey how impressive the city is quite well.

I'd also tweak that back-cover synopsis you've given. To be blunt, it sounds more like you're trying to imitate a generic synopsis than trying to actually sell your story to a prospective reader, and so the description comes across as trite, and the story as probably uninteresting (I was pleasantly surprised when I started reading it and it turned out to be so well-written).

This is a story about gambling; how about having your synopsis hint at the stakes?

I quite enjoyed this first chapter, and I'm especially impressed that I don't know whether Leo is going to win or lose this first game. The first few chapters of a story are meant to break the status quo of a character, and either being left temporarily destitute or learning he's enough of a gambling prodigy to beat an experienced card shark would accomplish that.

I'm looking forward to the next chapter; keep it up!
