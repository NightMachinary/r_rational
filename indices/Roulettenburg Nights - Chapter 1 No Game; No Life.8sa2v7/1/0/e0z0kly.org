Thank you! That line in particular was one I considered removing because you're right, it /does/ feel too vague. I usually write simpler prose, so I'm still learning when to amp up the purpleness and when to reel it back in. As for the synopsis... yeah, it's terrible. I wrote it with little thought put into it, but my intention was for it to be a generic place-holder while I come up with something better. Again, thanks for the feedback. One of my goals was to make the outcome as uncertain as possible so I'm really excited that I managed to accomplish this. Hopefully I'll won't screw up further along!
