I don't actually know the answer, so read on if you wish to know what my guess is.

................

I'm guessing that the numbers themselves aren't important. I believe the numbers are a location/coordinates in the memory space. This would make sense because according to some quick googling, a qubit can be represented by a real number (which indicates an angle in a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloch_sphere][Bloch sphere]]?) and two complex numbers which correspond to a column in the matrix. Please note that I know very little about quantum computing and could be completely wrong about qubit representations. Of course, I have no clue what the poem has to do with anything.
