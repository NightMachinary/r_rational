Finished.

I enjoyed this more than Crystal Society. It felt shorter, though I haven't compared to see if that's true (I read the first online and the second on my Kindle app, so can't simply compare). It was more abstract and inhuman, with some delightfully creepy bits. I appreciated that the author took pains to make this feel different from Crystal Society, though I expect that will cause some negative reactions as well.

Given the state of things near the end, I have no idea what Crystal Eternity will be like, and that makes me happy.
