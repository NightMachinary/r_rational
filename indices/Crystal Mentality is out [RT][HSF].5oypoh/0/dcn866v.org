For anyone who is wondering about the website, only the first book is free to read. Guy needs to make money somehow!

Just to let people know, Amazon only provides a mobi format for $9.99, while for a one cent higher price on Gumroad ($10) you can get [[https://gumroad.com/l/CrystalMentality][Crystal Mentality]] in the following formats: epub, html, mobi, pdf, and txt.

Also I /think/ Max gets a higher cut of profits on Gumroad, but I'm not too sure about that so don't hold me to it.

PS WOOOOOOO-HOOOOO!!!!! I'm not going to sleep tonight with such a good book ready for reading!

EDIT: Amusing piece of information I had to share. In the book, Max says the book will be released into the public domain on January 1, 2039 which makes sense since that's the year the story starts in the book.
