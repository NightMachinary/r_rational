What do you mean? The first book's free on the website, so it's not on Gumroad at all. There's only the [[http://crystal.raelifin.com/][website]] itself and [[https://www.amazon.com/Crystal-Society-Trilogy-Book-ebook/dp/B01AYT6A3C][Amazon]].

EDIT: [[/u/Terkala]], I made a mistake before. [[https://gumroad.com/raelifin][Crystal Society]] /is/ available on Gumroad. But it's the same thing as on the website. Free with a name your price to buy it in all five formats.
