You guys probably remember the [[http://crystal.raelifin.com/][first novel]], Crystal Society, about a group of AIs with different goals sharing a body, which EY [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/42o6x5/rthsf_crystal_society_rationalfic_web_novel_from/czbvylr/][said]] was one of the most realistic depictions of an AI in fiction. Well the sequel's out!
