  what do you want to accomplish?
#+end_quote

Bunny's long-term goal: Survive indefinitely. (Ie, pick a year; Bunny is attempting to avoid permanently dying by then.)

Bunny's relevant sub-goal: Convert certain civilians into potential replacement protagonists, so that if she dies again (or otherwise becomes hors de combat), they can keep on trucking.

Bunny's current tool: The university's physical library and digital archive.

Relevant constraint: Any method that requires the exertion of willpower is less likely to succeed than one that doesn't. Thus, pieces of data that are entertaining and fun to read are more likely to be remembered at a point where they could positively influence behaviour than boring instructional methods.

(One of Bunny's secondary goals: Pick up useful tidbits of advice for herself.)

  Bless your ruthlessly pragmatic heart.

An /interesting/ comment to someone writing a wild tale about a talking rabbit who has a better daily exercise routine than he does, but I thank you for the sentiment. :)

  Merry Christmas, Mr. Boese.
