  For example, item 34 is "I will not turn into a snake. It never helps." Which makes sense in video games and The Silver Chair (C.S. Lewis) and Final Fantasy VII, because going into Sephiroth-mode is always the prelude to the protagonist smiting you. But in Real Life, there's no reason whatsoever that becoming a one-winged angel won't help you slay your foes more effectively or whatever.

I've always figured One-Winged Angel mode is just one of those things like laughing maniacally or hot-blooded speechifying: not necessarily helpful, but so /enjoyable/ that once you've gotten up to the "I did it 35 minutes ago!" stage of your plan, you just /have to/ try it.
