Okay...

I think that things like the Evil Overlord list are humerous as far as picking out common villain tropes, but it's not entirely applicable in Real Life. For example, item 34 is "I will not turn into a snake. It never helps." Which makes sense in video games and /The Silver Chair/ (C.S. Lewis) and Final Fantasy VII, because going into Sephiroth-mode is always the prelude to the protagonist smiting you. But in Real Life, there's no reason whatsoever that becoming a one-winged angel won't help you slay your foes more effectively or whatever.

Similarly, some of the advice here is actually mixed: Murphy's Laws of Combat (I don't know if these even have any practical value) are a bit at odds with some of the things in /Art of War/.

That said, aside from the advice to not do things just because it rarely works out in fiction, what do you want to accomplish? If the goal is Winningâ„¢, what does that entail? Is this advice that Bunny is giving other people, or that she's trying to take? (I assume that you're asking for the purposes of /S.I./) War, politics, plague, dealing with sentient computer programs/malignant nanomachines, obtaining eternal life, and the net reduction of entropy in the universe all require different mindsets.

Things on practical philosophy include [[http://www.amazon.com/Thus-Spoke-Zarathustra-Thrifty-Book/dp/1604598824][Thus Spoke Zarathustra]], /The Enchiridon/ (a condensed version of which is currently on this subreddit) and [[http://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/2862yb/how_far_does_my_hero_rational_man_with_shotgun/][Rational Man with Shotgun]], supposedly based on Rowling's comment that a wizard could be killed by a rational man with a shotgun.

Merry Christmas, Mr. Boese. Bless your ruthlessly pragmatic heart.
