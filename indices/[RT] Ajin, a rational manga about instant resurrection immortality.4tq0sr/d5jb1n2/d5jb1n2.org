As someone who's only seen part of the anime, I have to ask, in addition to the obvious which is better, are the old guy's motivations ever actually explained? Similarly, is the initial public opinion on ajin addressed? I'd understand vaugely derogatory sentiments, but outright calling them subhuman p-zombies has to be engineered.
