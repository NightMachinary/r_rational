I do the Rattle Fiction podcast and I am looking for works of rational fiction to narrate.

Most helpful would be responses from authors themselves suggesting stories and giving permission to narrate. PM is also ok.

I strongly prefer stories that are

- shorter (<50K words )
- finished
- have not been voice narrated before
