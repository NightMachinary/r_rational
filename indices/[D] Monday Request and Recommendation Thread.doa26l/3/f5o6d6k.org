I'm looking for written fiction featuring protagonists that have unusual or *alien value systems*. Examples are [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/8894/everybody-loves-large-chests][ELLC]] where the MC is a mimic, and [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21410/super-minion][Super Minion]] where the MC is created in a bio-experiment.

I find it amusing how such MCs consistently subvert expectations and break with the tropes I'm used to seeing, and the outside perspective on humanity is often funny. Any recommendations?
