I know what you mean, so it isn't a perfect example. There actually is a Warcraft fanfic that fits better, but I can't find it.

That said, his knowledge initially even confuses him and also later on he seems to only remember stuff that the author himself remembers before looking it up, though his OP ring powers give him perfect recall of previous knowledge or something like that, which paves over the fact that the author will of course not be able to simulate what he'd actually remember if he hadn't also been researching DC lore for years to write this story with a daily schedule.
