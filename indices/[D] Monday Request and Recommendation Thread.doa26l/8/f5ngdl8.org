[[http://golem-studios.com/prae.php][Prae]]. A work in progress table top gaming system. The designer is focusing on less 'rule of cool' story telling and more on gameplay. The setting integrates magic into the worlds economy and reduces its scope compared to games like D&D.

Mana is a resource that people receive each day while sleeping. Spending mana creates a localized magical debt in the area. Debt can be paid down by offering prayers of mana to one of three presences. No one is sure what they are and different cultures have different ideas about what they represent and which ones they should be offering prayers to.

If debt is not paid down over time monsters are created. The cultures in the world developed different ways of deciding structure societal mana use. One is nomadic as mana debt is localized to a geographical location. Another has high percentage of warriors to fight off the monsters. Another creates laws around who can use their mana and developed a temples to create social pressure for the average person to offer their mana as prayers.

The system is structured without dependency on the setting, so if you wanted to make your own you could create a cost for mana use other than monsters.
