Not quite what you're looking for, but it's so good I'm gonna recommend it anyway: [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26974/apocalypse-born][Apocalypse Born]] explores an IMO really interesting aspect of the apocalypse (a System apocalypse in this case): what happens after the initial wave of suck? What happens when everyone starts building towns and having kids?

The main character is one of the first children born after the apocalypse, and it follows him as he figures out what to do in this still dangerous but kinda explored world.

More in line with your request, there's [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/23018/life-of-numbers][Life of Numbers]] which also has an interesting twist - it's not quite a system apocalypse, it's more of a system reset apocalypse. There was a very lightweight system before the story begins, but then all of a sudden everyone's stats reset and everything goes nuts.
