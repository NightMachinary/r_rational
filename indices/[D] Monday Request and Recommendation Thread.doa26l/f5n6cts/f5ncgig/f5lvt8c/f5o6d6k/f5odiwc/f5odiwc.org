Well-written dungeon core stories might scratch your itch? [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/27261/thieves-dungeon][Thieves' Dungeon]] for instance, is based around a core who might have been neurotypically human at some point but is definitely a psychopath now, and [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/20846/the-concubines-tomb-a-dungeon-core-novel][The Concubine's Tomb]] has a definitely human-based dungeon core who doesn't really want to fight the insatiable bloodlust inherent in his new state.

Also, there's a bunch of stories with theoretically human people but who have particularly alien value systems. For instance, the main character of [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/10703/the-godkings-legacy][The Godking's Legacy]] is theoretically human-ish (she's a squirrelkin) but has a decidedly atypical view of reality; it's mostly a joke story, though.

There's also [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21623/the-perks-of-immortality][The Perks of Immortality]], where the main character is kind of in a time loop (it's complicated) but he has all sorts of perks that greatly distort his values compared to normal humans.

Edit: Oh also I totally forgot about [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26534/vainqueur-the-dragon][Vainqueur the Dragon]], which hits all of your points; one of the main characters is a dragon, who obviously has an entirely different value system than everyone else.

Edit edit: Also I didn't forget this one, but I thought it'd been abandoned until it was updated today: [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26127/a-beginners-guide-to-napping-sunbathing-and-slaughtering][A Beginner's Guide to Napping... &c]] features a house cat protagonist who gets his fuzzy little ass isekai'd, and proceeds to terrorize the local wildlife. It's mostly told from his point of view. He's very similar to Vainqueur, now that I think about it.
