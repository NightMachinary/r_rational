I liked [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/17051/bunkercore][Bunker Core]], it's by the same author as Threadbare.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25082/blue-core][Blue Core]] is also fairly good, though there is a dose of NSFW consentacles.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/27287/heather-the-necromancer][Heather the Necromancer]] seems to be heading in a dungeon building direction, though the "dungeons" are actually extensions of some character classes.
