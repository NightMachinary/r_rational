Yes, you don't know which plants have the blight on them, some won't be visible yet, so they all have to go. The rot especially shows during storage: the mold loves cool, humid environments and is able to move and spread on it's own. You then have to wait for the spores in the soil to die off or they will just infect the next crop and keep reproducing. The mold isn't very good at surviving outside of host plants so a year without hosts(of any kind) will clear the area. Fallowing it might be dangerous though, any potato plants left behind will keep the disease alive on them.

Your second question is too vague. Potatoes and tomatoes are from the new world, in the real world.
