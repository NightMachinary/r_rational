30% of the worm fanfics I read are isekai though I can't think of any that I would recommend. [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/any-means-necessary-selfish-manipulative-si-worm-fate-eventual-multiverse.49938/][Any Means Necessary]] is one I am reading right now though it feels like the MC is doing the 'accumulate power for the sake of accumulating power' thing which I am finding bland.
