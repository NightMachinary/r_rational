  Mana is a resource that people receive each day while sleeping. Spending mana creates a localized magical debt in the area. Debt can be paid down by offering prayers of mana to one of three presences. No one is sure what they are and different cultures have different ideas about what they represent and which ones they should be offering prayers to.
