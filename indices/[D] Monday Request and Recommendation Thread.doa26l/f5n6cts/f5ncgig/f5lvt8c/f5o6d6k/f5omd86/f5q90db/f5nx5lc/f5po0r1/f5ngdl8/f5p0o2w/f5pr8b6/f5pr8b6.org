The adventure I was apart of an adventure centered around taking back an old keep from some monsters. Previously one of the nomadic tribes was at war with a medieval Europe analogue. The nomadic tribe just dumped a lot of debt near the keep then backed out and waited for the monsters to soften up the target. That the debt primarily cares about a region certainly makes war with a stationary culture interesting.

Mana is also transferable between creatures and objects that can contain it. So it can essentially be money. However the human capacity is 3, which is how much they regain each night. Finding gemstones, called Tears in their world, that can contain a lot of mana is important to storing mana over time or from a group to cast large scale rituals. Thus villages are limited in by both having access to Tears (mana batteries) and by how the they control spending it as not to attract to much monster attention.
