I've been looking for some apocalypse survival series. I started [[https://ruinsaga.com/][/R U In?/]], which is pretty good but isn't completely rational.

The "dropped in the middle of the wilderness, have to make my way home before I starve/freeze" survival, like /Hatchet/ by Gary Paulsen, or /Dear Chloe/ by Matt Stephens (the latter is a web series but also published on amazon) is good too. Really just something where the MC or a group use their wits to survive without having to really on too many tropes.

+e: linking isn't working but here's the site for the first series - [[https://ruinsaga.com/][ruinsaga.com]]+
