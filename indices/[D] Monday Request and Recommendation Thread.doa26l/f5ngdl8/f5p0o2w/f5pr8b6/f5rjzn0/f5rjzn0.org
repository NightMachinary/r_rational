  Mana is also transferable between creatures and objects that can contain it. So it can essentially be money. However the human capacity is 3, which is how much they regain each night. Finding gemstones, called Tears in their world, that can contain a lot of mana is important to storing mana over time or from a group to cast large scale rituals. Thus villages are limited in by both having access to Tears (mana batteries) and by how the they control spending it as not to attract to much monster attention.

Of course you could weaponize mana debt for fun and profit. Mine a bunch of gems. Charge them up a ton each day, and choose not to care about debt. Kinda like how in the WtC guide it talks about weaponizing the exclusion principle.
