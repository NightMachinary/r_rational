For all that QI is incredibly powerful, he is still just one mage, trying to hold together an invasion force that is severely outmatched by the defenders. If it wasn't for him, the defenders would have won quite easily. I imagine he decided those 3 wouldn't be enough to pierce the barrier protecting the summoners and that their mind defenses would be enough to hold Zorian.
