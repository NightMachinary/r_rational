No. 5 points to Zorian's initial location. I think QI would connect to Zorian based on what happened when and where he first appeared and the awareness that's likely required for battlefield teleportation. Determining the origin of mind magic isn't too hard; who has well made mental shields, isn't doing much else noticeable and is probably visibly seen reacting quickly to things hidden to most or all other senses.
