How do you all suppose QI knows to go after Zorian?

Zorian's actions:

1. Spell absorption cubes.
2. Creating a boom to let people know QI had arrived.
3. Mentalist attacks against enemy mages.
4. Telepathically tracking flank attacks and QI's movements.
5. Anti-teleportation field that both succeeded in preventing QI from teleporting (which shouldn't be easy, and which was done thanks to Xvim's dimensional training), and succeeded in withstanding QI's initial dispel (again, thanks to Xvim's training).
6. Mind-controlling the giant lizards.

Except for numbers 1 and 2, none of these things point to Zorian, unless . . .

1. QI can determine the origin of mind magic.
2. QI's dispel told him who cast the teleportation ward.
