One possible solution:

Zorian makes sure every mage has a teleportation ward. This time, the wards don't have to be made hastily and so might be able to resist the information feedback property of QI's special dispel and be less easily destructible.

In addition, ZZX(A) can carry several well-made anti-teleportation wards, each with slightly different properties. During the main battle, Zorian can experiment with activating different ones and see which wards QI cannot punch through.

Next, they teleport to the ritual site and QI can't follow.

They teleport in, drop the invisible grenades as a timer, offer token distance to the RRs, teleport out like they're retreating. They reengage QI, meanwhile the grenades blow up. It's a two-fer.

It's also possible that the ritual site had powerful anti-teleportation fields too. That may be why QI didn't follow.
