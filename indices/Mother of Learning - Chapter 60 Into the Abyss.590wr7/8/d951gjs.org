Now, they can just teleport to the site of the ritual. Zorian, Zach, Xvim, Alanic can teleport as soon as QI engages.

I suggest Zorian gets Xvim's help in creating an explosive cube with the most advanced invisibility magics on it, place the cube at the center of the ritual site before the shield goes up, then the cube can explode on a timer.

Even if the explosion just disrupts concentration or vaporizes the ball of blood, then mission accomplished.
