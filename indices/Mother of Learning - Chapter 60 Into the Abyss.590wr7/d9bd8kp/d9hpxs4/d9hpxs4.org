On the subject of ambient mana - I'm a little surprised that Xvim apparently ran out of mana and just used his body as a shield, while standing /inside the Hole/. You'd think that in such a rich environment, already committed to defending Zorian with his life, he could keep using mana until he either finished off the cultists or collapsed from the toxicity.

And if you make a single mistake, you're likely to shatter your own mind. Which will have lasting consequences across restarts. And Zorian has no-one to tutor him; none of his aranean tutors even mentioned that such techniques exist.

This is incorrect. Taiven indicated that using ambient mana in an emergency may put you in bed for days with a fever. It definitely poisons the body.

That's basically what the existing assimilation techniques already do, but there's no indication that instantaneous assimilation is possible. And I'm sure that plenty of mages have been foolhardy enough to try.
