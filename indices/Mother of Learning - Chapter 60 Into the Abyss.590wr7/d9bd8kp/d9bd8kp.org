Many here are feeling that mind magic had reach a plateau in term of offensive power. I feel that mind magic have the potential to be the single most OP power in the story.

Previously we learnt that many aranean settlement's matriarch had focus their mind magic abilities inwards to make better decision making and finer control over their memories. Shouldn't zorian be highly focusing on this? If he increase his own memories and critical thinking to a higher level on par with a supercomputer, he could have easily learn and /master/ powerful spells in mere days, having finer control of his mana.

Furthermore, in the previous chapters mentioned that using ambient mana as an alternative source of power will corrupt host mind to be insane while the soul and body will be relatively safe from corrupt. If zorian could tune his mind to be like a transformer for power stations. he could be the single most powerful mage in the story. Throwing unlimited artillery spells with a single flick of finger as long as there are high ambients.

This is just a theory of the potential of mind magic

Curiously, i like to know whether mana shaping allows you to feel, contain and concentrate ambient mana with your own personal mana. The higher the concentration, the faster one could regenerate mana. If zorian could create a layer of ultra high density of mana around him,solving his mana reserves problem. This might need insanely good mana shaping and perception skills of the likes of xvim or even better.

In short, how does ambient mana be converted to one's own mana naturally? Is sitting down and wait really just a natural way of increasing ambient mana concentration in the surrounding of the host?

Lastly, do you age inside a black room? its seems to slow down time and not slow down biological age. Wouldn't the drawbacks of multiple uses be huge and taxing on the host body? And could a pure soul be anchored inside the black room for necromancy training?

TL; DR mind magic could use to turn the brain into super computers and transformers for unlimited firepower. shape mana like a container a gas can for better recovery rate.
