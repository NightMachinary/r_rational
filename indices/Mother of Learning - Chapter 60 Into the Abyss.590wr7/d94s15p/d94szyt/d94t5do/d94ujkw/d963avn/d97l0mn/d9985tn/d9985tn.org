Close. I think, more specifically, he made Sudomir flinch and lose control, then took control himself and /piloted/ the dragon into the ground.

Eventually Sudomir recovered enough to regain control (because he had more equipment), which is when the dragon started struggling against the living metal cords.

Taking control of the dragon might indeed be feasible, and would be quite awesome, but it would first require getting past whatever security is on the thing. Zorian's previous expeditions didn't even reveal its presence.
