  You have the choice between someone who has spent their entire life as a battle mage, fighting in combat day in day out working closely with other mages to combine spells and work in coordination perfectly.
#+end_quote

Recruiting truly great mages isn't exactly easy, they tend to be doing their own thing and would just refuse you.

  Or you can have someone who teaches students at a secondary school/university and has barely no experience in combat against equivalent foes by comparison, has never worked in combat with large battle groups and oh wait never mind he's better than every battle mage and he's perfect for Zorian.
#+end_quote

Hadn't realized you'd acquired Xvim biography, care to share? And their coordination was hardly perfect. Also he's really not perfect for Zorian.

  Strong because of having large mana reserves, fine. Strong in combat? No, the granny would not be capable of coordinating with others because she has no experience in a combat environment.
#+end_quote

Unless Granny used to be a powerful mage before she retired.

  People who are good at combat go into the combat life, people who don't want combat become teachers so they can rest their feet.
#+end_quote

People who want to get into the combat life go into the combat life and it's not like they'd all choose to be battle mages employed by the state. You're treating at the Academy like high school teachers, they're not.

  Yes of course if I'm paying for an army I'd hope it'd be beaten by teachers from the enemy nation.
#+end_quote

Except he's not just a teacher, he's an Archmage.

#+begin_quote
  Ah, well, if it's boring then I guess the army would never train people to do boring stuff.
#+end_quote

Time they're training is time during which they're not working and few have the talent or dedication necessary to become very powerful, not to mention that they'd have to get a teacher willing to train them.
