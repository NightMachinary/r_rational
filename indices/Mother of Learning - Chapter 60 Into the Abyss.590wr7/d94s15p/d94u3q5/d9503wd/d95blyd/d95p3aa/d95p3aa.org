  In Chapter 2 it states that the academy says they are an elite institution thanks to the excellent quality of its teaching staff so it doesn't seem weird to me.

You have the choice between someone who has spent their entire life as a battle mage, fighting in combat day in day out working closely with other mages to combine spells and work in coordination perfectly.

Or you can have someone who teaches students at a secondary school/university and has barely no experience in combat against equivalent foes by comparison, has never worked in combat with large battle groups and oh wait never mind he's better than every battle mage and he's perfect for Zorian.

  Also, this is a fantasy world full of magic. As far as I'm concerned some random granny of the street might turn out to be really strong and it wouldn't be to unreasonable.

Strong because of having large mana reserves, fine. Strong in combat? No, the granny would not be capable of coordinating with others because she has no experience in a combat environment.

  It's not like all the strong talented people are going to choose the military life. I mean why should they? If Xvim wants to be a teacher even if he is better a combat then teaching that is his business.

People who are good at combat go into the combat life, people who don't want combat become teachers so they can rest their feet.

  Why are some people in this world better at combat magic? Maybe because they had the right teachers, were born with better talent/potential and/or are more dedicated. Their is no reason why all battle mages need to be a supper skilled arch mages like Xvim.

Yes of course if I'm paying for an army I'd hope it'd be beaten by teachers from the enemy nation.

  One thing to consider Xvim is willing to dedicate vast amounts of time to shaping exercises that most people would consider extremely boring. I imagine not many people would have that dedication.
#+end_quote

Ah, well, if it's boring then I guess the army would never train people to do boring stuff.
