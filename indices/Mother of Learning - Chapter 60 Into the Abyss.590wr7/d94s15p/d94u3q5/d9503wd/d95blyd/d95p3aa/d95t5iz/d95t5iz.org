You seem really obsessed about this for some reason. I think you are trying to apply things into a magical world that just don't belong their. Your concept of what makes some good at combat and reality in this fictional world are not the same. People in this world have magical power. Even if you have zero combat experience if you have awesome magical powers you are still going to be dangerous. Also how do you even know what people have had combat experience at some point in their lives. Frankly I don't think you have no basis for the things you are saying.
