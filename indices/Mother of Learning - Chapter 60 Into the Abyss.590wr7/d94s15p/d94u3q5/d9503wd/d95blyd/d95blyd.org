In Chapter 2 it states that the academy says they are an elite institution thanks to the excellent quality of its teaching staff so it doesn't seem weird to me.

Also, this is a fantasy world full of magic. As far as I'm concerned some random granny of the street might turn out to be really strong and it wouldn't be to unreasonable.

It's not like all the strong talented people are going to choose the military life. I mean why should they? If Xvim wants to be a teacher even if he is better a combat then teaching that is his business.

Why are some people in this world better at combat magic? Maybe because they had the right teachers, were born with better talent/potential and/or are more dedicated. Their is no reason why all battle mages need to be a supper skilled arch mages like Xvim.

One thing to consider Xvim is willing to dedicate vast amounts of time to shaping exercises that most people would consider extremely boring. I imagine not many people would have that dedication.
