I wouldn't say he is generally more capable. He specializes in all forms of magical defense, which necessarily includes knowledge of spells that are very good at piercing defenses. Everything he showed in this chapter was either some form of magical defense, or a spell that specializes in piercing defenses. He didn't show any spells like huge animated fire animals or beams of destruction, which the regular battle mages did. I don't think he actually killed anyone until he landed on the ritual site, just defended the battle mages against attacks and occasionally broke their shields.
