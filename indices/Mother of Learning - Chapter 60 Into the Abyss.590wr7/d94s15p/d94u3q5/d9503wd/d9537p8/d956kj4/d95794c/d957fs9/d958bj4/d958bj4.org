I agree that large groups should have dedicated defensive people, I'm just postulating Xvim is on another level to the point where it really makes a difference. Alanic specializes in fire magic, and while other people may be really good at fire magic, he is so good with it that he can make gigantic birds of flame that act of their own accord, or make bullets that burst into intense fireballs.

I'm not sure that a defensive mage who spends their time in a combat role would be better than a professor of the same specialization. During the assault on Iasku manor fight, that special wall that was made of gel or something came up. It could block every attack to at least some extent, which for someone tasked with defending a group is better than narrower spells that block only certain types of attacks. So a defensive battle mage would focus on shields that work against lots of attacks, can form quickly, and are hard to dispel. Xvim, on the other hand, can spend time to learn shields that are extremely effective at blocking a narrow range of spells. In a large fight, he focuses on negating the especially powerful spells, while the regular battle mages soak up most of the damage with shields that can work against basically anything.

He can also spend time casting the more specialized shields, because he doesnt need to maintain the larger ones. In an army, it's better to pour all your effort into making sure the main shield stays up rather than trying to block every single attack in the most efficient way.
