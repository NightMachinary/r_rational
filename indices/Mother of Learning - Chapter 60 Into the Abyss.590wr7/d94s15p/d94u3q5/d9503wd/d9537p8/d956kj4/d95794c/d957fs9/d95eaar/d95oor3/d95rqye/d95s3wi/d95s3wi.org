If he's not old then it's even worse since older mages are always superior to younger mages except in physical fitness.

And yes, I'm comparing him to full time battle mages, even if he was a retired battle mage you think that you can just go into combat after not being in it?

Anyway I don't need to assume anything, if the story wants me to believe that not only Xvim is the perfect mentor, perfect for time travel, and perfect at combat it's up to the stories job to make me believe that it's totally reasonable that not only does Zorian just happen to get the soul marked Zach has but his mentor also just happens to be the best mentor in the universe.
