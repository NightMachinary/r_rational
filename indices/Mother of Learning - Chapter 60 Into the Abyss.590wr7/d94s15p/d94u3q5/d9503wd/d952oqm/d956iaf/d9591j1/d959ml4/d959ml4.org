My point is that Xvim is 90 offence/100 defence/50 teacher.

My viewpoint is that a battle mage group of 99 full time battle mages and Xvim would beat a group of 100 full time battle mages (from the description).

Who is in charge of designing the mage army? Explain to me why spending time teaching students and being stuck with the abundance of menial administrative duties of a teacher is beneficial to being good at combat magic. How often do teachers get to practice combat against people of similar power level and above?
