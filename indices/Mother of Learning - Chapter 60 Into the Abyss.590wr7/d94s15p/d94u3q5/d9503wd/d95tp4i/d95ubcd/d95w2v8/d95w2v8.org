  This is what I wish was conveyed, even a single sentence (or maybe it was and I missed it).

Previous chapter puts Alanic clearly in command, and Xvim maybe second. That doesn't necessarily correspond to skill, but I wouldn't be surprised if more capable mages had equal/higher ranks relative to Alanic/Xvim and wouldn't likely be placed under their command.

More impact if he wasn't alone with Z&Z - and Zach resting for half of it - and Zorian gathering intel half the time, yeah - certainly. But he still died. At least he died doing what he loved, defending against magic :)
