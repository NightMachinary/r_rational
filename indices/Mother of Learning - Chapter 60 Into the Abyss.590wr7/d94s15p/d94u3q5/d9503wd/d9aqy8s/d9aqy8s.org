Nothing is, of course, but I've been re-reading (to proofread), and I think the author actually /did/ address all these issues pretty well in chapter 2.

Ilsa talks about how unstructured magic is the ideal, maximally flexible, but much slower and harder to learn, so they teach structured spells. Then Kyron talks about how he isn't even going to teach combat invocations, because they're too slow; for him, combat magic is all about channeling lots of mana quickly through a spell formula.

Xvim is what happens when someone is dedicated enough to actually learn unstructured magic properly. Instead of chasing low-hanging fruit, he has pursued skills like raw mana sensing, which, he explained to Zorian, will gradually improve every kind of spellcasting. His shaping skills are pretty much unrivalled as far as we know. All of his spells appear to be cast with an ease that is normally associated with reflexive magic.

But that kind of standard is so demanding that practically all of his students hate him.
