I agree that the older the student population the more likely the researchers are to be among the best in the world.

I don't remember where the Academy ranked among the global population but I would maintain that professors in our world lack a civic counterpart dedicated to battle. There's no professor of being a sniper for example so it's difficult to continue the analogy. But I would imagine any such professor would not be equal to someone who does it as part of the SAS.

Edit: How is this not relevant to discussion? What's with the downvotes?
