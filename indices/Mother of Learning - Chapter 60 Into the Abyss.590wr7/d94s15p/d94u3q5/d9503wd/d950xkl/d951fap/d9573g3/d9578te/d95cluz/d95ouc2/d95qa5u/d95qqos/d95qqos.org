Well I've said in another comment but in the real world most of the stuff people do research on is economically inefficient and so of course no one will privately pay for someone to research full time. I think that in places where there are privately funded research, like medicine, Professors are not at the cutting edge of medicine, private companies, ie full time researchers are.

Also, the military is the foremost in many tech fields, and the military is the best analogy for combat magic in my opinion.
