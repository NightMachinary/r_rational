  The story demands that the mentor dies
#+end_quote

I disagree. The story is all about resetting the consequences of the Controllers' actions each month. Zorian himself has died horribly on a number of occasions. Xvim wasn't really sacrificing himself, in the usual sense; he was aware that he would be reset, and he simply did his best to help the Controllers learn more before that happened.

  it would be strange to keep repeating that for the next iterations
#+end_quote

Seriously? Repetition is /never/ strange in this story.

I wouldn't be at all surprised if this assault gets retried several times, like Zorian's infiltration of Iasku Mansion, learning more and progressing further each time.

  the ability used by QI interferes with the reset mechanism
#+end_quote

It wasn't even QI who killed Xvim. And there were no signs of soul magic. And the random cultist who cast the spell surely wasn't a Controller. So we can be quite confident that the Gate will make a fresh copy of Xvim without any trouble.
