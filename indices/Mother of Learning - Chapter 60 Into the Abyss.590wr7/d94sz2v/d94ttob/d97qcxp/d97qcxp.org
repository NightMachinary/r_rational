If there was more time left in the loop, I'd easily see some nerfed down version of what Sakura does in Time Braid: medical ninjustu/magic that records the state of your body allow you to restore it. That would allow Zorian to improve his physical abilities despite the time loop (train during the loop, record the state of his body at the end of the loop, restore at the beginning, do it again).

But it doesn't look like he is going to learn healing anytime soon.
