But a bullet can.

There was a time when Zorian toyed with the idea of enchanting the projectile and came to conclusion that it was too hard at the time. It may be from hard to impossible to make truly potent explosive ammo due to size limitations, but the soul coin is a low-energy project. It could be fit in a high caliber ammunition. The gun itself could be enhanced since it is not constrained by size, namely the barrel could be reinforced and gunpowder alchemically boosted.

The benefit of a gun is that it is /really/ fast. You can dodge arrows and magical projectiles. Firearms can't be dodged, not without preemptive temporal acceleration. That moment when he spotted the lich in the beginning of this chapter, he really could use a sniper gun.

Worth a shot, at least.
