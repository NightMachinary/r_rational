Zorian won't become a shifter because of the soul influence, but even if he did the grey hunter would be a ridiculously poor choice all around. Magical animals have a much stronger mind than a normal animal so the instincts would carry over more strongly. There's a reason shifters choose normal animals. Grey hunters are ridiculously aggressive and territorial by default. Do you really want to turn Zorian into a hermit when this is all over?

I've always thought it would be a good idea to learn transformation magic from Lukav though. He's in an ideal situation to practice, and while it doesn't come with the instincts or the easy transformation it doesn't have the demerits either.
