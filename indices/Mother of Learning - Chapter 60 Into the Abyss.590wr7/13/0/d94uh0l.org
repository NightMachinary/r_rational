The author has stated that a Lich needs a magical construct brain in order to function, so I imagine that it is "readable" by a mind mage like Zorian. The problem is that Quatach-Ichl is centuries old and certainly know his fair share of mind defenses, so much that even the Aranea didn't dare trying to read him.
