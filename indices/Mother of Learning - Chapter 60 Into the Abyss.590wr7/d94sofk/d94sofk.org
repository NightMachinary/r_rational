Now that was an intense chapter. Looks like the golden fire that damaged the Lich on that previous restart had come from Alanic (or maybe someone from his order, I'm very curious about them). Xvim simply backhanding the Lich's spell was particularly badass.

Now, I hope Zorian managed to get at least something out of his red robed target, cause it would be really disappointing after all this effort. Still, looks like the high echelon of the Cult are really powerful mages.
