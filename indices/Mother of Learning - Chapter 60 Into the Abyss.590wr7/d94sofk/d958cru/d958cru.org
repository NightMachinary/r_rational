  I hope Zorian managed to get at least something

Oh, it certainly wasn't wasted effort. They've learned a lot:

- The location of the ritual platform. Maybe they can come sooner next time, and with more numbers.
- The value of a robust anti-teleportation ward for fighting QI. Booby-trapping it with soul magic is a great idea, [[/u/Cheese_Ninja]]. Also lots of general tactical information about what worked against him (absorption cubes, Xvim's drill) and what didn't (they need to find a counter for his temporal acceleration).
- The names and addresses of two of the shifter children. The more of them ZZ can protect during the month, the harder it will be to make the ritual work, and the more likely that the cult will overextend itself.

Plus, of course, next time Zach will have better soul defences, Zorian will have a better idea of how to quickly break into the summoner's mind, etc.
