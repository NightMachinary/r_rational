Removing QI from the loop would be /highly/ counterproductive. They need to learn everything they can about how he fights, so that they can beat the real one.

I suppose, if it came down to "soulkill the lich or you won't get the keys in time to escape", then they'd have to do it, but that would mean that they'll really struggle in the real world. And he's likely to have impressive soul defences, too. Besides his ability to teleport in the blink of an eye.
