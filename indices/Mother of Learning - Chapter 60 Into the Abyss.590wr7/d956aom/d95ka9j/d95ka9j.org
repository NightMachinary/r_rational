They'd still have to fight him in the real world, so meta is not that strong here. The final boss fight is inevitable.

It is still a great idea. If they ever manage to master the soul eject button, they should use it whenever they don't feel like wasting time while getting the keys. If the dragon Zach killed in the first arc (and wasted ton of restarts) has a key in his treasury, instead of fighting it again just soul eject it and get whatever you need. Same with Q-I, as well. Suppose they get good enough to fight the lich, but he keeps fleeing whenever things don't go his way, and therefore the crown remains unattainable. At that point it is very sensible to use the eject switch.
