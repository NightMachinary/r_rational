RR doesn't even need to craft it, as long as he got in good with the Dragon Cultists' high mages in one of the loops to find out where they stash their identity-obscuring robe, he's just a teleport away from acquiring it. RR might have to bypass some security, but that's a non-issue at this point. Granted, crafting might still be the easier option, depending on the complexity of the robe and RR's crafting skill.
