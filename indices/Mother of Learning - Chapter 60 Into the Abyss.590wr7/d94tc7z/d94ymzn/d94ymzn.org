This is probably the only real new piece of information we've got from this chapter. At least until Zorian expands on what he managed to mine from the cultists in the end.

It makes sense, though. Red Robe sure posed as a cultist, and was apparently treated by the Q-I as one. If Red Robe is Veyers, it is most likely a disguise. Maybe someone from his house is a high-ranking member and thus he had a bit of advantage.
