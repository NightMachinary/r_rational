I actually think you may be onto something now.

16000 loops is ~1333 years

The loop is supposed to operate for '11 lifetimes' under normal circumstances.

1333 รท 11 = ~121

The average lifespan of a mage is much longer than an ordinary person.

121 years is a number

3 is also a number

Illuminati confirmed.
