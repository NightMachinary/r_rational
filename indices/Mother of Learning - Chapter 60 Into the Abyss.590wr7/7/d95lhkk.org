Why didn't the lich go after them to the ritual site? He's obviously stalling to protect it, 3 of the MVP's rushing off in a hurry highly suggests that they're trying to go straight to it not just going to wherever.

Some reasons might be :\\
- he can't teleport in the hole though that shouldn't matter much, I'm sure he has some way of going very fast like Zach did.\\
- he can't communicate with the ritual squad because of the hole's interference and if he left in pursuit he would leave his elite mage squad for dead. Why should he care? well suppose Zach just flies around while the lich is in pursuit, the mage squad dies, the whole good guy squadron moves into the hole and apparently the lich isn't confident he can keep it at bay on his own.

So kinda makes sense but kinda feels a little off that it was that easy to just bypass him, couldn't he just move his whole team to the hole entrance? that seems like a much better defense spot
