Yeah, I keep forgetting that distinction. Most of the time my mind just labels them all as "invaders, acceptable targets", but they actually have quite different backgrounds and motivations.

Perhaps I should think of them like Imperial troops and bounty hunters, in The Empire Strikes Back. Loose allies, both dangerous, but with no love for each other.
