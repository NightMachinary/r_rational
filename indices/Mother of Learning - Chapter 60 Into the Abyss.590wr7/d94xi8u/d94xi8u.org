Guesses:

- Xvim might have been soul-killed. If so, the assault will be way harder in future restarts. Don't think this is likely (soul-kill is probably the loop admin power), but I can't look up the description of RR's soul-kill on the Aranea to confirm/deny

  - It seems likely the inner circle mages have some sort of soul magic anyway, which may require special consideration

- The ritual may be to contain the Primordial. Alternatively, disrupting it while it is half-complete could create a disastrous backlash (i.e. they need to stop the invasion way sooner)
- Zorian is going to finally make an enhancement potion to shore up his physical shortcomings
- If Zorian or Zach learn even one of Alanic/Xvim's tricks from this chapter, holy hell are they gonna be powerful
