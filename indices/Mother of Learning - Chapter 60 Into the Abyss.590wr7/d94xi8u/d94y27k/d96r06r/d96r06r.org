The story demands that the mentor dies. The chapter has been climactic enough to give him a proper send-off, and with such focus on Xvim as in recent chapters it would be strange to keep repeating that for the next iterations.

Ultimately the story comes first, there surely will be some way of handwaving "the ability used by QI interferes with the reset mechanism", in line with QI's ability to affect loop mechanics in the first place (including Zorian).
