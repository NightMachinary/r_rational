Not sure how much Zorian managed to get before the end, but as long as he got a bit of stuff like the guy's name and address, he can probably track him down in subsequent loops.

The lich ended up being an even bigger obstacle than I had expected. If Zorian ever repeats this he should leave one of Kael's coins lying in the middle of the teleportation ward, that way if the lich literally tries to punch through it again, it could possibly disable him.
