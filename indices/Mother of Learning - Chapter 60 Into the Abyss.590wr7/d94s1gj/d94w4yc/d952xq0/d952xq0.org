When they explored the black room facilities, there were a few rooms dedicated to plants and agriculture I think. It's possible one room has some dirge moth crysalis' inside as well? I'll have to re read.

Edit: "There were three main portions of the facility. The first was a series of three Black Rooms -- the first and smallest was reserved for experiments on plants and animals, while the two bigger ones saw human use. The second portion dealt with combining alchemy and temporal acceleration in various ways."
