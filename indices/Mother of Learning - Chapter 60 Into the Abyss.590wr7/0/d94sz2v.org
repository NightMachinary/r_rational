Really good chapter. Worth the wait. I particularly enjoyed how well Xvim did against every attack thrown at him. And the shield breaker spell he used seems really useful if it isn't extremely hard to do.

More generally: what do you think Zorian should do next to improve his magic? Personally, I think he should learn the Force Lance spell well enough that it becomes nearly invisible like he did with the force bolt. He doesn't have much mana, so making a spell designed to destroy shields seems important. Another thing is he could try to make that hexagonal sectioned shield Zach taught him to spin. The spell he was taught remains static when one of the panels goes down, meaning it's relatively simple to aim for that hole. Making it spin could mean that any holes would be incredibly hard to hit. The spell is less useful against omnidirectional attacks, but judging by this chapter those are rare to be used on individual people.
