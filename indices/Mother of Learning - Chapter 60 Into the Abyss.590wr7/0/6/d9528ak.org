Good question!

1. *Simulacrum:* He should ask Xvim and Alanic about the simulacrum spell. It may or may not help in the fight, but it may be very economical in terms of time to have an extra Zorian to assist in crafting, etc.

2. *AoE Mind Blast:* If he could target ten or more people at a time, he would have a way of knocking out large numbers of enemies in one go.

3. *AoE Mental Suggestion:* If he could cast one spell that made a large group of people fight each other, that would also be helpful.

4. *Multiple Anti-Teleportation Formulae:* He could give everyone a half-completed teleportation formula, then any time QI tries to disrupt the anti-teleportation field, a new one would get placed.
