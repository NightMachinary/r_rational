Seem like it might work although a gun might be too harsh and damage the magical item used. Other options could include a sling shot or air gun. I wonder if there is some length of time the coin need to remain in contact with the lich in order to work, or if maybe the lich protects his soul better while in combat situations. At any rate he should talk to Kael about it, maybe do some tests and get Kael to write down the designs and results in his notebook.
