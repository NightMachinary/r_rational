I definitely think he needs to look into becoming a shifter/transformation mage for physical abilities, he's just so immobile. He also needs to learn how to make that coin that Kael made.

As for pure magic, it has to be learning dimensional spells. Even though they are expensive to cast he is really good at spell formula which can offset the costs dramatically by creating a hasting item beforehand.

Being able to properly defend himself also looks like a priority, and unstructured magic too as he could use that while transformed.
