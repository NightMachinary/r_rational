I did call it a dream scenario. I know it doesn't actually fit into the story for various reasons. I just had fun imagining how it would complement his power package. Although I wonder if it's possible to compensate for the instincts using Aranean mind enhancements/alterations.

Transformation magic is certainly more realistic. I'm definitely hoping that Zorian will turn into a spider of some kind at one point.
