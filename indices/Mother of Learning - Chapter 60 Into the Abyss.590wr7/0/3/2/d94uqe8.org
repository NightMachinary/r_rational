I believe the coin has been discussed before. The thing about spell formula is that you can't make an object to do something you can't do yourself. The coin involves soul magic, and Zorian only knows soul perception and defense. IIRC, the only way to gain soul sight, the prerequisite to learning soul magic fully, is to either be born with the ability or take that one potion with the ingredient that only occurs every other decade.

I agree about getting better mobility. He can't really gain muscle mass while in the time loop, so a mobile transformation form would be very useful. Even a potion would be decent.

I don't think we've really seen the type of spells dimensional magic gives, aside from variations of teleportation and the one redirection thing Xvim did.

Better defenses if definitely important, and he can ask Xvim about it, but it's a little non-specific. He doesn't seem to have any glaring weaknesses in the defense category, and I'm not sure of any low hanging fruit he could grab to make himself even better.

Ooh, just had a thought: sound seems to travel normally through most barriers right? Or at least around them? Maybe he could weaponize sound waves for a method of making people deaf.
