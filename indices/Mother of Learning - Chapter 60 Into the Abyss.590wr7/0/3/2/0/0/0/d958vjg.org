  I think he's getting to a point of diminishing returns...time spent for combat magic should focus on other things

But for Zorian, mind magic /is/ combat magic. It's his strength, and most enemies' weakness.

Yes, he can break through anyone's shields - if they're a sitting duck. 30 seconds is unacceptable in combat, though. And after breaking through, there's the matter of efficiently utilising the puppet, doing as much damage as possible before they get taken out. Or multiple puppets; surely he can handle more and more of them as he continues to practise?

Then there's his mind sense. It was indispensable, this time around, in detecting invisible/underground foes. Does its range increase with practice?

If Zorian does fall back on Xvim's notebooks, he'll want to be able to read people's minds efficiently and as non-destructively as possible.

And what about Zach's mind? /If/ Zach ever lets him in, he'll need as much skill as possible in handling memories. And if RR left any mental booby traps...

Mind magic still has a fantastic ROI, in my opinion.
