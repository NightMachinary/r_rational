I'm not sure about continuing to focus on mind magic. Yes, it has innumerable uses, but I think he's getting to a point of diminishing returns. Right now, he's a better mind mage than any human he's ever heard of. He can take down people who have invested their lives in defensive magic in a few minutes, and he broke through the shields of the most heavily defended non-psychic he's ever seen in what, 30 seconds? At this point, in term of combat, I'm not sure what else he has to gain beside taking down shields quicker. While the non-combat uses could still use honing, for combat I think he's about as good as he's going to get, and time spent for combat magic should focus on other things.

Also, spending more time on combat magic means he can make spell formula to cast those spells. Easier to make an elaborate offensive or defensive spell into an item rather than spend time to cast it in combat.
