I'd say as long as he could get the design for the coin from Kael, Zorian could mass-produce them most of the way and have Alanic or Kael put the finishing touches on it.

This chapter has highlighted that while Zorian isn't bad at anything in particular, there's still a lot he can learn from the likes of Alanic, Zach, and Xvim. But I think he'd still be best off focusing on his mind magic, outside of certain opponents with immunity/high resistance, it stills gives him the best result for its cost. And his experience with the Aranea shows that he still has room for advancement.
