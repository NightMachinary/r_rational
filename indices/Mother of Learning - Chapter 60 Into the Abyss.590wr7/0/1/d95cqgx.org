I mean, hunting down the cultists, Veyers and the keys to the Sovereign Gate strikes me as more of a priority for now.

As for cool magic though, I think most of Alanic's spells would require too much training and mana (fire bird, fire bullets) or soul sight. The big exception, of course, are those golden orbs that can actually affect the lich. But if they scare Quatach Ichl, there's probably some soul magic component to them, requiring soul sight.

Xvim's spells on the other hand, seem really useful. Those shield-breaking blue bullets? The dark green 'sticky' shield? The dispel-resistant explosive orb? The way he slapped away the lich's spell? The dimensional gate? The dispelling barrier? They're probably all very specialised spells and not easy to learn, but it certainly wouldn't hurt to have them in a fight. (Also, did anyone else notice Xvim didn't use any gestures when he created the gate? He cast the 'pinnacle of dimensional magic' either reflexively or with an unstructured spell.)
