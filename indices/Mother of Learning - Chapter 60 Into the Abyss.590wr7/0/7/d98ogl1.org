I'd like to see more improvements on his unstructured magic.

Isla commented at the start of the book that in an ideal world all magic would be performed in an unstructured manner. Structured spells are more convenient.

Look at what Xvim was able to do with his mind shield. A structured spell isn't capable of self repair like that. If Zorian was capable of making physical shields with unstructured magic he'd be able to reinforce and patch any holes as they appeared.

I'd have mine up all the time like a flexible second layer of skin.
