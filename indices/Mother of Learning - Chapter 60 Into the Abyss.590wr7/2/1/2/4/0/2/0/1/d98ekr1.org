Also, Xvim is a defensive specialist. Defense is a subset of combat magic that requires an in-depth knowledge of offensive tactics, so it may be that Xvim /does/ have ties to the military, especially in an R&D capacity, or at least be heavily involved in dueling magic.

Also, he might train, or might have trained, special forces for all we know, and it might be an aspect of his career kept mum.

In other words, I'm thinking of Xvim as a sword duelist and the soldiers as . . . solders. The duelist is likely to be better in certain ways. Whose better? A guy who views his job as being a soldier, or a guy who obsessively researches and practices combat magics, focusing on what makes combat magic work at a fundamental level so that he can hack offensive spells, rendering them useless? That's what a defensive specialist does, yeah?

Also, if the soldiers in MoL are anything like soldiers IRL, they work eight hours per day, and only some of that time is spent on combat training.

A few friends of mine are veterans, and they said that often times, they work eight hours a day or so, and there's a lot of time spent on cleaning, loading, transporting, guarding, etc., and only some time spent training and conditioning. They said basic training is like a bootcamp, whereas being a soldier was like having a 9-to-5 job, at least when on base.
