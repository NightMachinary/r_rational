It's not like battlemages are training every moment either. They have mundane duties as well. We have no idea what Xvim was before he became a teacher, but considering he was famous enough to get a job there and have the faculty put up with him he must've been a pretty big deal.

I don't doubt there are some battlemages focused on defense, but Xvim is an archmage and has access to tons of exotic shields and spells a normal battlemage would never focus on. It's not strange he has some tricks they don't.
