Of course, what would battlemages need defence for?

Battlemage are surely specialised in combat, I'm totally willing to accept that some burdened with the task of devoting their time to mentoring random secondary school/university students could be at the cutting edge for some other task which is more research and less result focussed, but anything combat related?
