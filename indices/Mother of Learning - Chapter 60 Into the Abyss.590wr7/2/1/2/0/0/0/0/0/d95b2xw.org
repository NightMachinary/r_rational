We can only go by what we've seen. We don't know much about Xvim's past and I doubt that he was always a teacher. He's an old man with an entire lifetime of experience that we don't know about. His situation is comparable to Kyron's.

These battle mages have less years of experience and I agree fully trained ones would have more firepower than Xvim.

I guess I just don't understand because to me it's fitting that he can hold his own in a combat situation and make full use of the specialty he's trained his whole life.
