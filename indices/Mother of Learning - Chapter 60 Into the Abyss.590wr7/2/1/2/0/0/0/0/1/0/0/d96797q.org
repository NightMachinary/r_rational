HPMoR had a good explanation. Powerful mages are the ones who know ancient rituals. And to learn ancient rituals you have to search for them instead of just training. Also Xvim could be a veteran from the last war. Having tons of actual combat experience I strongly believe counts much more then having been training for a long time.
