What do you mean no one is designing the mage army? Why wouldn't the states have standing magical armies?

Salary is not a motivator for effort, the battlemage has more time to learn than the professor. Unless you're implying that just be happenstance Xvim's natural ability dwarves the battle mages. If anything going to teaching would be a decision to move away from battle so you'd expect battle mages who took up a cushy Professorship to be even more out of sync in combat
