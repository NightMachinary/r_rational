  I'm applying what happens with real soldiers to a fictional story.

I don't think that's what you're doing. What if . . .

Xvim's daily schedule:

- 1 hour teaching.
- 8--13 hours on research and defensive training.

Soldier's daily schedule:

- 3 hours training.
- 5 hours working for the government on various things, assisting the mundane soldiers with magic, guarding areas, etc.
- 8 hours free time, because maybe they're just salary people.

That would explain it.
