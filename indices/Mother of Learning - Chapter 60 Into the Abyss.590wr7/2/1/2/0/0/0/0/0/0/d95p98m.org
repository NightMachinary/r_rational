  We can only go by what we've seen. We don't know much about Xvim's past and I doubt that he was always a teacher. He's an old man with an entire lifetime of experience that we don't know about. His situation is comparable to Kyron's.

Old men are almost always better battle mages than young men, except in terms of physical fitness. Which I will give points that Xvim also drank, it's literally his single downside.

  These battle mages have less years of experience and I agree fully trained ones would have more firepower than Xvim.

Why do they have less years of experience? Surely the best of the best would be chosen to defend the country from a primordial. And they would want the best of the best to have a better chance of seeing the ritual.

  I guess I just don't understand because to me it's fitting that he can hold his own in a combat situation and make full use of the specialty he's trained his whole life.

I didn't say he shouldn't be able to hold his own. He is not holding his own he is performing twenty times better than any other battle mage. He is changing a death rate of 20 to a death rate of 2. Consider the impact of losing that many in a battle, the rof goes down, so you lose more, and it's a feedback loop.

Why wouldn't I hire 100 Xvims? There's no downside.
