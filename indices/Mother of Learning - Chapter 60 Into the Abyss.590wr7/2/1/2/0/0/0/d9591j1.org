I'm saying that Xvim's role in the battle isn't far fetched at all. He stuck to his specialty in the same way Zorian did.

If a battlemage was 100 offense and 90 defense Then Xvim would be 90 offense an 100 defense (To be incredibly simplistic about it)

In a one on one fight against someone like Alanic he might very well lose. I don't understand your viewpoint because Xvim played a support role in this battle and he has been portrayed as extremely capable and dedicated the entire book.

His biggest downfall as of this chapter seems to be his mana reserves.
