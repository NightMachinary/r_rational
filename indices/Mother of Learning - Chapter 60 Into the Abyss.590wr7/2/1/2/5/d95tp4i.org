I agree that Alanic, Xvim, Zach, and Zorian are seem to be doing surprisingly well compared to all the rest of the battle mages.

Plenty of comments here arguing plausible because Xvim is awesome. I don't disagree with that. But there are other possibilities why the rest of the battle mages seem less capable:

- There is an invasion going on elsewhere. Maybe the Army's heroic tier battle mages are elsewhere fighting the rest of the invasion force.

- Maybe they chose mid tier battle mages for this mission. If there was some other heroic mage who didn't know about the time loop or understand the mission, and he started taking charge that could be a disaster.

- There is still an army of enemy mages in the battle as well as QI. The rest of the Cyorians were probably under orders to continue fighting them, while our 4 heros took on QI.

- The narrative focused on those 4. It didn't really show the others being particularly effective or ineffective. No one in the group was taking much damage until QI entered the battle. Maybe our four characters just seemed better because the none of the other battle mages cool stuff was highlighted.

- Maybe the Army does have a defensive specialist mage for important missions, and maybe his name is Xvim. Maybe if he wasn't already involved they would have called him up to fight a lich. Quite plausible they decided he wouldn't be needed for Sudomir earlier because he is a necromancer.

And to make the capability gap plausible from a different approach (making it smaller); Xvim died. There would have been plenty of Cyorian Army mages still alive and fighting.
