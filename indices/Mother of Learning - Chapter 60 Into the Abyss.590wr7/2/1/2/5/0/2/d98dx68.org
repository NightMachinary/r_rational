I totally agree that it would have been nice if many of your concerns had been addressed and rationalized within the story, rather than us having to speculate.

I hope these kinds of questions will come up in the next chapter, so I'm very glad you're bringing up this topic.

I think the reason why you're seeing a lot of backlash, though, is because there are a lot of potential reasons to justify the chapter. I just wish these reasons were made a little more explicit, but in the context of an action-heavy chapter, I don't think it would have been appropriate to slow down the plot by explaining everything.

Of course, Zorian could have been written to wonder about the power imbalance to lay the seed that answers would be forthcoming.
