I think I'm starting to understand where you're coming from.

The best in universe explanation I can come up with is that the army is not at full potential.

Their military forces have been crippled by the Splinter Wars and the Weeping that followed. Zach and Veyers both came from strong military families and they weren't the only ones that were mostly wiped out.

The politics are much different too. It's only very recently -thanks to the mage academy - that the central government has as much power as it does. So they don't have full control over the military like our governments do.

This was the first opportunity for many first generation mages to be trained properly, and the majority that go through the academy will side with the government rather than the interests of a Noble house they don't belong too.

Noble houses had a lot of influence, and while they each contributed to the military, they would not have shared their house secrets or abilities for general use by other military members.

Alanic was a warrior priest so even the church has it's own independent military force.

Mages don't share knowledge very well. I'm sure there were quite a few specialist houses that are now lost. The black room training facilities are probably the only reason their military is as strong as it is now.

Edit: Again, to reinforce my earlier point. Xvim was awesome but he isn't a powerhouse that outperforms the Cyorian army.

"You know, you and Xvim are pretty much no use in this fight, except as damage magnets," Zach said. ..."And I reckon Alanic and his men could hold their ground without me."
