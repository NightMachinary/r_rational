  I agree that Alanic, Xvim, Zach, and Zorian are seem to be doing surprisingly well compared to all the rest of the battle mages.

Well I'm glad there's someone else who at least shares some what of my perspective, I was beginning to believe I read stories in a unique to everyone else here.

Your other comments are more of what I was looking for in terms of rationale. I will try to make it clear that it's not that I think that none of those aren't true, it's just that to me it was not conveyed in that manner.

In particular the importance of the push to the ritual I was believed (and of course I could read this wrongly) to be the primary purpose of their goal. It makes complete sense even if people don't believe about time travel to attempt to focus on the primordial ritual.

  Maybe they chose mid tier battle mages for this mission. If there was some other heroic mage who didn't know about the time loop or understand the mission, and he started taking charge that could be a disaster.

This is what I wish was conveyed, even a single sentence (or maybe it was and I missed it).

Your last comment I would say that it would have had more impact if he wasn't alone with Z&Z on the place at that point, had he died with the Battle group I would not be feeling like I felt.
