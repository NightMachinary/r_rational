There's no mention of the quality of teachers that I recall, but the War College from The Practical Guide to Evil is sort of like that. The primary concern in magical instruction is making sure that as many people with The Gift as possible can manage a basic fireball and heal. It's simply easier to train up 20 people able to cast an /ok/ fireball than to train up one mage with genuine power to throw around.
