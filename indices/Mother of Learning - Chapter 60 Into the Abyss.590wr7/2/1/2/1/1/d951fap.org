Well what is true in magical fiction and what is rational aren't overlapping circles on a venn diagram. If they have massive armies of battle mages they should be better than teachers, maybe Xvim is a special exception and it's just pure luck.

Aurors in Harry Potter strike me as another example.

Regarding your last sentence I would say that most magical fiction has magic as scarce and powerful so of course it would naturally be more similar to prestigious secondaries than not, but even then the best teacher at secondaries are never the best in the world.
