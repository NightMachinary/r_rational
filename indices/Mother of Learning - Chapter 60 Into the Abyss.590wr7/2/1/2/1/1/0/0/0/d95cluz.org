While it would be highly effective if you could do it, the method is (or appears) non-obvious, is extremely time intensive, your troops cannot be used as expendable except in the direst of circumstances and would have to stay in the force for a long time to get a good return on your investment. Additionally, this may be the case in groups that aren't available for recruitment by Alanic and Xvim. I can see this with some top level black ops type group, perhaps with Black Room access.

Far more affordable and reliable to teach it in schools and recruit, or closely watch, those who have the dedication for it.

Those around Xvim, especially his direct students, will be aware of both his skill and his inclination toward shaping but I think his brash manner is a barrier for most people without Zorian's dedication in seeing the value of such intensive shaping practise (from Xvim, anyway). Peers of Xvim also aren't going to have the time or interest, already being highly skilled themselves. I think Zorian was reading a book at one point on shaping indicating that few people master more than a handful of shaping exercises.
