The time investment makes them far less expendable than average. Not every mission has good Intel or odds. Even if they'd be better for a task, they may be held back to be used more reliably elsewhere. Your battle mages here are going to begin with some level of education cost offset by their schooling. I think you're underestimating the time cost on training these mages in Xvim level shaping. As [[/u/afronerd]] pointed out, it may also be far less efficient and much harder for someone already trained in structured magic to learn to use unstructured magic so efficiently. That 10% survival chance increase also requires a significant cost of time. Remember, Zorian has taken his shaping seriously for a at least a couple of years now and has the required motivation and dedication. He's not as good as Xvim, nor is he likely to get there without further years of training.

  the battle mages seem completely pathetic and useless compared to Xvim who is superior in every way. I would have thought that working with a group of mages day in day night would give you coordination benefits

Well they did have coordination benefits. The battle mages aren't getting the spotlight for this story so you're not getting told everything. One coordinated manoeuvre that is described is the front-shield rear-attacks then switch, which is noted as being well executed and effective. They are also described as better than the bulk of enemy battle mages. Again, this group may not be the top-notch, finest soldiers around.
