Battle mages would rarely be used as expendable. The amount of energy and resources put into a battle mage is far beyond the amount put into an average soldier.

Someone who turns your Â£3 million supersoldier's into a 10% better chance of surviving just made the state so much richer.

I'm not talking about just shaping, I'm talking about defensive spells and combat capability in general. For people who've spent every waking second of their life in active combat duty the battle mages seem completely pathetic and useless compared to Xvim who is superior in every way. I would have thought that working with a group of mages day in day night would give you coordination benefits but silly me I'm applying what happens with real soldiers to a fictional story.
