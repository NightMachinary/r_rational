  Battle mages seem to prioritize shaping large amounts of mana very quickly

This.

Consider how Xvim talks about the state of magical education. Sure, some of that is just his drill-sergeant approach to the first few months of mentorship, but I'm sure that it's partly sincere. There aren't many mages with the dedication to reach Xvim-like skills.

To make matters worse, we know that large mana pools make shaping harder - and battlemages are likely to have high mana pools, on average, because it's generally a big advantage.

So, your typical battlemage is going to have a fair bit of mana, enjoys blowing things up, and focuses on quick casting and group efforts. Perfectionism, precision and subtlety are not in the job description.
