Well, if I look at some of the teachers I had at university. They teach 8 hours a week and spend the rest of time researching, so they have a lot of time to work on research.

I'd imagine that any full time battle mage would also spend a lot of time working as a battle mage (more than 8 hours a week) and while they get experience when working, they don't necessarily get the time to be more creative. There's also the question of talent, someone who rises to be a teacher at the most prestigious university is usually an extremely talented researcher. In the case of Xvim, they clearly didn't chose him because he was a great teacher but because he was very good at what he does.

It's entirely possible that there's a huge variation in individual skills between mages and that Xvim is far ahead of the bell curve. In that case, someone with his talent is more likely to do some prestigious work than be a battle mage. So there may be a very few battle mages with his talent but they'd be in demand and not necessarily available
