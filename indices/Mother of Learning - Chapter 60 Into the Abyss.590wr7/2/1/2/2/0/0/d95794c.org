Xvim could just be exceptionally good, which seems reasonable given everything else we know. There may be other battle mages that excel or somewhat specialize in defensive magic, but Xvim takes it to another level.

Or maybe the extremely potent defensive spells require shaping skills so good that battle mages never bother reaching that point. It's no secret Xvim is ungodly good at shaping. Battle mages seem to prioritize shaping large amounts of mana very quickly, not shaping skill in general. So if the upper tiers of defensive magic are gated by the extreme amounts of shaping skill required, a battle mage would never get to them, or those that do would be obscenely rare. Alternatively, it may just be really really hard to get the spells to be quick enough to be useful in combat.
