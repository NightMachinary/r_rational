From what we saw of Xvim in combat I find it hard to believe that a dedicated defensive battle mage would not be beneficial for the vast majority of battle groups and armies.

With that in mind a full time battle mage should have vastly more time than Xvim (who has to spend time with who knows how many students) and be more than capable of surpassing someone who is doing exactly the same as they do except they also have a burden of teaching.

Unless we're missing some special R&D that means that Xvim supremely benefits from educating children I don't see how it's a better scenario.

I said else where that I could reasonably expect that a Professor of X, where X is a non-combat field, could understandably be on the cutting edge of magic and surpass any other mage. Basically cases where it's economically disadvantageous to be fully up to date and without any state pressure in doing it anyway (as with military tech) I would expect those teaching to be ahead.
