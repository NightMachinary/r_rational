If we take X hours in a week, battle mages have X, professors have X-8.

  I'd imagine that any full time battle mage would also spend a lot of time working as a battle mage (more than 8 hours a week) and while they get experience when working, they don't necessarily get the time to be more creative. There's also the question of talent, someone who rises to be a teacher at the most prestigious university is usually an extremely talented researcher.

Xvim does not lack coordination, coherence or communication, or anything that you would expect from not working with battle mages day in day out.

Xvim happening to not only be incredibly specifically useful for Zorian but also fantastic in combat even though he hasn't fought in battle in 50 years or whatever but it doesn't matter because he's just naturally talented.
