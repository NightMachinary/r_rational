I read through the conversation and I have to say that you made me reexamine the battle again. This time looking for inconsistencies in power levels.

And while I agree that Xvim is basically described as equal to Zach/QI(each in their respective field), to me it seems entirely plausible.

This answer got to long... and probably not very coherent as it's already late... but I might as well finish it:)

--------------

Lets talk about IRL army first. You seem to assume the a random soldier has more time than a random teacher. This is simply not true. During my time in the army intelligence forces I can without a doubt say that 99%of the combat forces, have less free time than the a random teacher. And rarely is there any individual training as most combat will be done in large groups. Nonetheless, in the few times there is free time or individual training it is usually used for lazying around. Only in the movies is the regular G.I soldier actually motivated or focused on getting better/stronger/faster.

The only soldiers who focus on individual training are the 1% of specialized forces,the so called elite forces, who are rarely combat oriented.

The few times I experienced combat I had to focus on my specialization while the rest fought around me. And I was always supersized how unsupervised I was the moment gun fire started, leaving me to do what I do best.

So going back into the story, lets assume that while the battlemages gathered were not elite soldiers, they were still better than the average battalmage. I asume that because elite forces rarely work in numbers as large as a 100 or more. Usually teams b/w 6-12. This would mean the battleages gathered are strong as a group and not individualy. Which is clearly demonstrated in the initial assault on the Hole before QI joined the battle, where they show themselves to be very well equipped at handling anything thrown at them.

However being army trained... they shouldn't be expected to be able to deal with exotic magic like the one QI uses. As army training focuses on the most efficient and effective way to fight, everything other then the norm and you call in the special forces for the task. So while real life has anti-air forces, anti-tank, sniper units and etc. QI being the litch that he is, is the equivalent of Iron-Man suddenly dropping down and wrecking havoc. No army trained personnel is trained or equipped to handle something like that.

Xvim on the other hand... being the Defensive/Unstructured magic expert/Archmage... is the perfect counter to QI. So while fighting against a large group, Xvim didn't really shine... when there was only one opponent for him to focus on, his specialization let him outperform any above average battlemage.

Now about the end fight where he died... I think it was because he wasn't afraid of dying(he does know about the loop after all) allowed him to take risks any other battlemage wouldn't and this let him be matched against the opposing mages. Or at least help enough until Zach recovered.

Another thing about Xvim being so much stronger than the rest, as has been mentioned by many before me, it is the result of the unstructured magic he is so good at controlling.

An army trained battlemage would have only a set amount of prelearned spells that are supposed to serve him in as many situations as possible. An army trained defense specialist would be the same. The army can't afford, money or time, to make each individual mage their own personal training program. You either fit in the mold or you are kicked out. Personal styles have little to do in an army setting.

This also means that compared to Xvim who works to master his craft an army defense mage would have to master working in formation. That means most of his time would be dedicated to team maneuvers and group exercises instead of individual polishing of his spells.

So Xvims prowess lies in his focus on unstructured magic. Something the army simply doesn't care about as all they care about is... structured magic that they can train as many as possible in.

Look how much stronger did Zorian become because of learning unstructured magic. If we assume that due to the loop he is as old as your average battlemage, he is clearly much stronger that a whole squad of them. Why? Mind magic obviously... but even w/o it Zorian has enough weird spells/formulas/tricks to take out large numbers of opponents time and time again.

So from what I've read so far during MoL fights, unstructured magic & thinking out of the box is stronger than structured magic. and good teamwork. This however, is something not suitable for the army. As forcing the army to focus on maximizing individual strengths is not something it likes doing and is the least of the problem.

So its not that Xvim is suddenly so much better then everyone else. It's that when it comes to defending against exotic opponents he always was the best and this was just his first opportunity to shine.

Also, I think that this is supposed to be a very sudden and unexpected fight for the reader. And while for us who wait three weeks b/w chapters it doesn't seem so, for someone who is binge reading the whole book from scratch this fight will have popped out of nowhere. The first mention of it was at the end of the last chapter I think and then suddenly this chapter happens. Talk about a climex:)
