Well I'm glad the later comments are the best quality.

#+begin_quote
  Lets talk about IRL army first. You seem to assume the a random soldier has more time than a random teacher. This is simply not true. During my time in the army intelligence forces I can without a doubt say that 99%of the combat forces, have less free time than the a random teacher. And rarely is there any individual training as most combat will be done in large groups. Nonetheless, in the few times there is free time or individual training it is usually used for lazying around. Only in the movies is the regular G.I soldier actually motivated or focused on getting better/stronger/faster.
#+end_quote

Well, I don't think I'm saying that the average soldier has more time than a teacher, I'm saying that an average soldier has more time for soldiering than an average teacher.

Well, individual training sure, if there's no such training then I would expect more description of amazing group defences, since two mages should be better than one as good as he is. Especially when that one is not conveyed to be in practice with battle groups.

#+begin_quote
  The only soldiers who focus on individual training are the 1% of specialized forces,the so called elite forces, who are rarely combat oriented.
#+end_quote

This is true. I view the soldiers involved in this push as elite forces due to the importance that it was built up.

#+begin_quote
  The few times I experienced combat I had to focus on my specialization while the rest fought around me. And I was always supersized how unsupervised I was the moment gun fire started, leaving me to do what I do best.
#+end_quote

If that's the case for magic too then I would expect defensive specialisations. If it isn't the case then I would expect more group work.

#+begin_quote
  So going back into the story, lets assume that while the battlemages gathered were not elite soldiers, they were still better than the average battalmage. I asume that because elite forces rarely work in numbers as large as a 100 or more. Usually teams b/w 6-12. This would mean the battleages gathered are strong as a group and not individualy. Which is clearly demonstrated in the initial assault on the Hole before QI joined the battle, where they show themselves to be very well equipped at handling anything thrown at them.
#+end_quote

I agree with this, I would have expected the larger company to be divided into platoons.

#+begin_quote
  Xvim on the other hand... being the Defensive/Unstructured magic expert/Archmage... is the perfect counter to QI. So while fighting against a large group, Xvim didn't really shine... when there was only one opponent for him to focus on, his specialization let him outperform any above average battlemage.
#+end_quote

100 people should reasonably have a variety of defences no? Xvim was basically the sole person who countered any of his spells. I don't understand why if you make a battle mage group you don't include defence specialists similar to Xvim.

#+begin_quote
  Now about the end fight where he died... I think it was because he wasn't afraid of dying(he does know about the loop after all) allowed him to take risks any other battlemage wouldn't and this let him be matched against the opposing mages. Or at least help enough until Zach recovered.
#+end_quote

This is a good point I didn't think about. It could be better conveyed, it is only really done at the end and that's way after I felt like he stepped out of his bounds into an amazing OP role I find hard to believe.

#+begin_quote
  Another thing about Xvim being so much stronger than the rest, as has been mentioned by many before me, it is the result of the unstructured magic he is so good at controlling.
#+end_quote

But if unstructured magic is so good at combat why doesn't everyone learn that?

#+begin_quote
  An army trained battlemage would have only a set amount of prelearned spells that are supposed to serve him in as many situations as possible. An army trained defense specialist would be the same. The army can't afford, money or time, to make each individual mage their own personal training program. You either fit in the mold or you are kicked out. Personal styles have little to do in an army setting.
#+end_quote

Why? Why would I design an army that can be beaten by people who aren't even professional soldiers? Where are the army defence specialists? I'm not saying all of them should have been, I'm saying where is theirs? Also no, your description of a magical army is absurd, a magical army would be nothing but specialists. If you build your magical army with 500 people with the identical spell selection it gets countered so absurdly easy.

#+begin_quote
  This also means that compared to Xvim who works to master his craft an army defense mage would have to master working in formation. That means most of his time would be dedicated to team maneuvers and group exercises instead of individual polishing of his spells.
#+end_quote

Seems like it is worse though. Xvim is better than the formation defensive guy. So why master formation defences when single target is clearly superior?

#+begin_quote
  So Xvims prowess lies in his focus on unstructured magic. Something the army simply doesn't care about as all they care about is... structured magic that they can train as many as possible in.
#+end_quote

Not true as I've said. If you put Xvim up against two of those battle mages.

#+begin_quote
  Look how much stronger did Zorian become because of learning unstructured magic. If we assume that due to the loop he is as old as your average battlemage, he is clearly much stronger that a whole squad of them. Why? Mind magic obviously... but even w/o it Zorian has enough weird spells/formulas/tricks to take out large numbers of opponents time and time again.
#+end_quote

Zorian is directly prepared in a way that Xvim did not appear to be. Zorian didn't seem more powerful at all outside of mind magic. He had cubes specifically designed to counter, why the army don't run those also bothers me.

#+begin_quote
  So from what I've read so far during MoL fights, unstructured magic & thinking out of the box is stronger than structured magic. and good teamwork. This however, is something not suitable for the army. As forcing the army to focus on maximizing individual strengths is not something it likes doing and is the least of the problem.
#+end_quote

So why do battle mages use structured magic? Focus on maximising combat capabilities is what they do.

#+begin_quote
  So its not that Xvim is suddenly so much better then everyone else. It's that when it comes to defending against exotic opponents he always was the best and this was just his first opportunity to shine.
#+end_quote

I didn't say he was, this is our first real show of Xvim in battle and all I said was it weird that a dedicated teacher who puts up with how many students other than Zorian is as good as people whose full time jobs is being good at combat. Of course maybe you're alright with Xvim being perfect for Zorian in every single way.

#+begin_quote
  Also, I think that this is supposed to be a very sudden and unexpected fight for the reader. And while for us who wait three weeks b/w chapters it doesn't seem so, for someone who is binge reading the whole book from scratch this fight will have popped out of nowhere. The first mention of it was at the end of the last chapter I think and then suddenly this chapter happens. Talk about a climex:)
#+end_quote

Sure.
