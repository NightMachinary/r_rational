I think the key distinction here is /group/ vs /individual/ tactics. The army focuses on group tactics - and this chapter has evidence that they're good at it. QI and Xvim, on the other hand, are exceptional individuals, one because he's a thousand years old and the other because he's a perfectionist with a killer work ethic (and a fair bit of experience).

Remember how Zorian gave Kirielle a mana absorption cube for training? Apparently the academy doesn't use them - because instead they mass-produce the glass spheres, which are more economical.

I remember, back when I played Baldur's Gate, one of the unimportant books around the place mentioned the existence of a mercenary army in the region - wearing studded leather armor. Now, why would they do that, when full plate - or even regular plate - is much more effective? Well, it's probably because studded leather is much more economical /en masse/.

What makes sense for one is different to what makes sense for many.
