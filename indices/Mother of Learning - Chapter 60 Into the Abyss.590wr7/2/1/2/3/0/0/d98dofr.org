  He had cubes specifically designed to counter, why the army don't run those also bothers me.

The cubes are likely very expensive, and on such short notice, Zorian wasn't able to make that many. I expect next time, they'll be able to equip their force with more specialized gear.

Also, it's worth noting that if QI hadn't been present, these types of battlemages would have done a fine job.

Lastly, even Zach points out that Xvim doesn't do much in the way of delivering damage; he mostly soaks up damage. So, I don't think he'd necessarily outclass those battlemages in damage output over an extended period of time. I bet you most of them have large mana reserves and less fine control.
