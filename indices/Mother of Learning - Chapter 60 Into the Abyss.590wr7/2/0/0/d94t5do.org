For the next try on the invasion, maybe he should try to get some minions under his control. The iron beaks are decent, but something with more punch would be nice. Golems seem too expensive in time and lacking in magical ability to be efficient.

Also, maybe he could try keeping a few of those fancy black cubes on his person, so that disintegration beams fail to kill him without the source of that failure being obvious.
