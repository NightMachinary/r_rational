Pretty sure it's evil. (That is the thing - one could say "Anti-evil means they want good to win, but are willing to use evil to get there." This doesn't sound like a perfect name for that, and there's probably a better name out there.)

Uses:

1. As a deterrent*. (I think historically, some rulers had people executed then had the bodies put up on display after making it look like they were tortured then executed.)

#+begin_quote
  The issue of torture efficacy is an empirical question.

2) To get information. (Some people do try to make a case for this.)

*There is the issue of magnitude to consider. There's also tit for tat logic - "Murders should be executed, Torturers should be tortured (then executed), etc.".
