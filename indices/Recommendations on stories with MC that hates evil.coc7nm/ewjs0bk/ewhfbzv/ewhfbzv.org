Guessing you've heard of both of these, but just in case...

Maybe [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goblin_Slayer][Goblin Slayer]] depending on exactly what you're looking for? Goblins are pretty awful, but it's more of a inevitability of their species than individual goblins doing awful things. The protag is very single minded about goblin slaying though, if that's the main thing you're interested in.

I haven't seen [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexter_(TV_series)][Dexter]], but the premise is a serial killer who only targets other serial killers. I think it's more because he enjoys killing than because he wants to stop murders, but I don't know any details about the show so I may be wrong.
