There's a lot of great brainstorming here, I love reading posts like this!

My favorite explanation is that invoking magic requires a certain level of information density backed by properly formed willpower/intent. Your magical 'bandwidth' is all about how much information you can modulate into your spellcasting actions. It might be technically possible to conjure a fireball in conversational English or non-verbally with pure mathematical symbolism, but learning a conlang with vocabulary and conjugations specifically designed to communicate elaborate magical concepts lets you take a lot of mental shortcuts and cast the spell more reliably/quickly. The conlang can also include a sign language to further improve the modulation rate and let the practitioner convey more information per word.
