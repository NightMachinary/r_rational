There is an intelligent reality-shaping entity/force inhabiting the local solar system. Magic is performed by having a debate with it, trying to convince it that you have a good reason to break normal physics. Over thousands of years and billions of mages holding trillions of debates, it has grown exasperated with the whole process, and what once took a day of complex back-and-forth discussion has shrunk to the point where you just have to say "fire", and with an air of "ugh, not another one", fire /happens/.

A fight between wizards, then, is mostly them arguing why the other's spell is a bad idea.

It's a bit of a silly idea, and justifying why such a force both exists and doesn't just make those pesky humans disappear and leave it in peace might push the concept into a less-rational genre. Still, hopefully an amusing enough idea to be worth sharing.
