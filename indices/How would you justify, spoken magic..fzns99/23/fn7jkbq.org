In the Abhorsen series there is "Charter Magic" which is rule-bound and relies on incantations, and "wild/free magic" which is much more powerful but also much more dangerous and seems to operate on belief power. During the series prehistory the "charter" was established to force a system of control on the wild magic to stop it from ending the world.
