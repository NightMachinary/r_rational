If magic is art, the speech involved is part of the experience of the caster and the audience. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings is the archetype of this. The world and all upon it were created in a grand song. All subsequent magic's are merely lesser echoes and variations on this act. Also, all art is magical.

If magic is a science, magic will involve binding forces, or even beings, to focus items and acts. Verner Vinge, who wrote of magic that inspired D&D, and by extension many tabletop and computer games (and derived litRPGs), conceived of a byzantine system of technology cobbled together over millennia by various sorcerers, many alien in nature. In this situation, words act as markers upon reality, drawing the magic and instructing it in a way like computer programming.
