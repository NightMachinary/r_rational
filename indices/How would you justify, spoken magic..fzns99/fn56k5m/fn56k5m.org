1) something that understands the incantation is listening

2) magic responds to focused willpower and speaking or gesturing in a specific trained way triggers the correct associated neural pathways

3) do deaf folks who perform sign language have the ability to do magic?

4) the magic is internal and pushing the words out also pushes out the magic

5) the "magic" phrases aren't a language but the soundwaves/internal magic interact with the external world in specified ways that have specific results, like making an "ooo" sound in the direction of paper makes it catch on fire or whatever. Like interruption in standing waves
