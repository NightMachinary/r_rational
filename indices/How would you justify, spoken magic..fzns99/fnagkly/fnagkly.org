Hpmor kinda meta spoilers:

I always found the "computer program" explanation for the purpose behind incantations and wand movements pretty compelling.

The theory goes - the universe was once filled with magic. Mental entities could make things happen just by wishing for them. At some point our material world was formed with the rules as we know them - as an experiment, pet project, or mutually agreed upon equilibrium. In order to protect this semi stable subset of reality, magic was locked off, unless you knew the code. Certain people had access to magic in their DNA, and could execute commands built into the "source of magic" (really more like guardian or gatekeeper of magic) to grant limited wishes in pre defined ways.
