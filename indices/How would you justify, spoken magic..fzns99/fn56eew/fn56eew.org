Both yours are good, I have a few more if you want.

1) Spoken is a crutch. Merely thinking of the spell is enough for a trained wizard, but to a beginner, silent magic is hard, so speaking it out-loud is easier for novice wizards.

2) Magic is ancient tech. Not really different from your 2, merely flavor, but the ancient chanting triggers the precursor satellite to do whatever the spell is, and hypothetical root access could fix that. Think a smart-house, and fragmented bits of English getting it to do things in a post-apocalyptic future.

3) Specific words are special. The Unsong approach, basically, the fabric of reality is specifically designed such that the specific word triggers an action.

4) Magic, or magic combat, is a game. Calling out your moves as you do them is considered fair play, like pokemon moves or whatever, it's not required as such but it's the rules imposed by the Game Master.

5) Magic has a willpower component. The act of focusing and screaming out the word can help you concentrate and focus on the spell output. Think Kamehameha.
