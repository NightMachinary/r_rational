What if it functions as a locking method keeping something else from using magic? This could be a cultural thing ([[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q57FRfFlnQ][like this]]) or a physical/biological thing, and you could use pitch or specific phonemes ([[https://www.quora.com/What-sounds-are-not-found-in-the-English-language][unused in a given language]]). You could set this up so that magic is gender/culture-specific among humans - if you've gotta cast spells in mezzo-soprano, you're not going to get many dude-mages.

Obviously that would have to fit within an existing backstory (where magic is invented by someone who wants to restrict it to certain people) and might have downstream effects (if there's a group locked out of using magic).

​

[1] - Good candidates would be the ʒ (ZH) or ɔɪ (OI) phonemes, since [[https://cmloegcmluin.wordpress.com/2012/11/10/relative-frequencies-of-english-phonemes/][they're uncommon in English words]] (and thus unlikely to trip you up). You'd just say that whichever folks are being kept from magic just don't have that sound in their language.
