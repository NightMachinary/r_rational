Im vaguely working on some HP worldbuilding, I wrote something more detailed here a few times but I kept doing something else and losing it. magic starts out as wordless, wandless magic, when spells are done repeatedly similarly they start leaving an imprint in the "weave"(what exactly the weave actually is is unclear but it's agreed it's a useful abstraction for most basic magical theory) and becomes associated with certain words and actions and over time casters improve on the spell, like a shared skill and it becomes easier and easier to do. The spells usually sound latin due to their culture of spell creation and modern spells tend to sound latin-ish as they're more likely to be picked up. It's possible to alter it more directly, for example the Taboo is done by making a word a spell that can be done accidentally. Of course the weave is not clearly partitioned and is more like a landscape built up over millennia of magical history and magical theory tends to be more of a soft science than a hard one.

Secondly there's my DnD headcanon: spell words are mostly arbitrary, they're triggers for spells that have already been mostly cast ahead of time.
