In Bakker's setting The Second Apocalypse magic requires extreme and precision of thought, all magic is therefore performed in long dead languages so as to not muddle the meaning of the words by associating them with the kind of flexibility demanded of a language in use. The mage also simultaneously speaks a 'mental' incantation, further fixing the meaning of the spoken incantation. The gift of magic is the ability to make the universe hear what you are saying. I have always liked this explanation.

This is a variation of 1, but the more demanding you make the practice the more necessary you make the incantations, thereby making them less of a placebo. Under such a system a lot of the 'skill' of magic can be about your internal incantation and not the external incantation.
