I think this was one of Harry's hypothesis - but I think the Opinion of God (not supported by text) is that this universe is simply /like that/ - the laws of the universe itself really care about things like how you say words and there's no deeper technological explanation underlying it all.

But I don't have a link to where he said this handy, and anyhow this doesn't influence the meaning of the story.
