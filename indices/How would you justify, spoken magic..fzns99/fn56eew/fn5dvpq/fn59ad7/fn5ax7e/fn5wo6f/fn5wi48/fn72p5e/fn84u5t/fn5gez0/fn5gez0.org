Magic responds to vibrations in the air in complicated ways. In principle, any sound might be used to cast a spell. But people have only figured out the ones that are actually pronounceable. Though this would imply that tape recorder could cast spells, so I'd avoid the explanation in settings that have tape recorders. You could say that you need a human there for other reasons, but then they could use the tape recorder while doing the other stuff on their own.

Magic is powered by belief, and people think incantations matter.

Magic can only be done with rituals, but you can set them to go off after some trigger. Incantations aren't the only choice of trigger, but they're an easy one that gets used a lot.
