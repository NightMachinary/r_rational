Reductionism is wrong, the laws of physics actually include ontologically basic elements with mental characteristics. Thaums can be angry, fire can be hungry, words are not made up by humans but are the pre-existing communication mechanism used by the fundamental particles (words are the fundamental forces). Magic is just invoking those communication mechanisms in a non-standard way.
