Mentioned in another comment, compared to a 'top-down' system of someone listening and obeying, I rather like the Type-Moon universe (specifically Kara no Kyoukai I believe) explanation that many magicians can cast exactly the same magic(?), but use different incantations, because the spoken incantation is like an autohypnotic suggestion to automatically carry out the rather complicated non-verbal contortions(?) that bring it about--though that doesn't explain why the words have to be spoken with the voice rather than only subvocalised. In any case, those who use shorter incantations for the same spell are treated as more impressive because they're successfully associating greater numbers of spell-actions into each line(/word).

Though this could be broken easily I imagine, I'm having a little fun imagining right now a system whereby microbes in the air release different types of magic (maybe with different delays) according to pressure waves that they're subject to--specifically I'm imagining someone making a 'laser' in which someone's voice is amplified and shot down a long long hard tube with little fading, so that more and more magic builds up by the time it gets to the end. Ah! However, the magic release would be slower than the sound propagation speed (and thus mitigate the usefulness of this), so easy short spells would be near-instant, whereas with long spells you could be crafting the later bits of a complicated spell after the first part started! (Like 'wind cyclone' and 'freezing cold' one before the other for 'Blizzard'.) And for cold spells say, the spell would still affect anywhere the sound reached, but once quiet enough there would be a massive reduction in effect and so just a slight temperature falling or air-stirring... presumably a louder volume could make a spell larger in scale but not in strength, and for larger in strength you'd need either several people (like in a formation) or curving sound back to get different sections of air releasing power which then combines when focused on something..?

Hmm, that's also an interesting approach--"The hard part isn't freezing your enemy into a solid block of ice, the hard part is freezing your enemy into a solid block of ice WITHOUT freezing yourself too along with all the surrounding space within 30 metres". Ahhh, yes, that 'affecting oneself' concept is fun... now I'm imagining incantation-bombs, maybe produced by speeding up vinyl-like recordings recorded at lower frequencies than the dangerous ones, or amplifying a whispered recording...
