Interesting and accurate! Although, you get into semantics a bit because to some degree this is true for our universe as well

E.g. if our universe only had one charged particle, that would be entirely different from if we had _two_ charged particles, for reasons that no amount of deduction regarding the first particle would ever reveal.

So when I said "it only means that in that universe, the biggest conceptual unit that things can be reduced to are bigger than they are in our universe" I mean e.g. "the universe cares when you say 'Wingardium Leviosa' and the fact that the universe responds to that cannot be reduced further - but that doesn't mean you shouldn't still reduce things as much as you /can/"
