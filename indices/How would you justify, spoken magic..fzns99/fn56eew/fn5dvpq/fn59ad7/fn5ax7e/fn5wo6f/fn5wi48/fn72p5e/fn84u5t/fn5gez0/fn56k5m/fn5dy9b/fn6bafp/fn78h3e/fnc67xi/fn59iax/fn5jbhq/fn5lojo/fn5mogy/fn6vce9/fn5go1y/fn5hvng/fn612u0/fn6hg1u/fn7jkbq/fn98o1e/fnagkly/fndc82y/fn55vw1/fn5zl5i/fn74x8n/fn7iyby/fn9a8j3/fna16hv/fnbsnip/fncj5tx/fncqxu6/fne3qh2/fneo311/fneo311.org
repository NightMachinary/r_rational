The Dresden Files aren't particularly rational, but they have a neat take on this. In that world, the incantation literally doesn't matter. Magic is nothing but the control and shaping of energy through willpower. Channeling that energy, though, is dangerous, and so words are used to isolate your thoughts from the energy as you would probably fry your brain if you tried to cast without some kind of insulation. It's also why they tend to be in ancient languages; you get less leakage of the power if the words aren't associated with something besides the spell you are using.

Though this isn't always the case. The main character has a cute little spell to light candles or small objects like a cigarette with. His incantation is "flickum bicus", which is both easy to associate with what he wants to do but also the pseudo-Latin helps him to isolate even though the association is obviously there.
