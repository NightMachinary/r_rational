Haven't seen this sort posted yet. The pattern completion style. Magic is a sort of field that builds upon patterns of repetition. The spoken magic isn't a requirement for magic use, just a common pattern.

One of the earliest forms of magic was to symbolically recreate the events of a natural magic and with each use that wore the pattern deeper than before. As practitioners found the magic responding to less strict representations and simplified these rituals which slowly allowed the magic to respond to only that which was easiest to recreate widely as those patterns were able to be preformed more often.
