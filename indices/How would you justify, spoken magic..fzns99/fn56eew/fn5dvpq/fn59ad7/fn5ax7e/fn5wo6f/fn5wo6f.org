You're asking why it so happens that the thing you need to do to summon fire is chanting 'fire' in an appropriate ancient language? That question has causality going in the wrong direction. The reason that the ancients chose that word for 'fire' is that it's one of the noises you need to make to actually summon fire. The entire language was designed that way.
