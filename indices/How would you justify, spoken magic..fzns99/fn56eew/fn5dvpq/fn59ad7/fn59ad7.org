In the beginning, the magical fields that permeate the aether were manually and laboriously manipulated with arcane rituals involving the manipulation of magical reagents. Merlin devised a stable, programmable field effect which allowed him to produce many of the same effects using only a single reagent contained in his wand as a trigger. Over the years, small iterations on Merlin's genius field-effect technique allowed for improved ease-of-use and a wider range of effects. Still, loss of wands posed a dire challenge for wizards, at least until Rasputin devised a voice-activated Merlin field effect, though unfortunately, he only begun to unlock its potential when he had to heal himself repeatedly as Russian nobles repeatedly dealt him fatal blows to keep his method from spreading. It wasn't until the senior clergymen of the Catholic church took an interest in his research that the yet-to-be Pope Benedict XVI ultimately rediscovered the Rasputin variant of the Merlin field effect and used it to pursue world domination. While his plans were ultimately thwarted, the use of the Rasputin variant of the Merlin field effect leaked to the world and it is now becoming increasingly commonplace among elite magicians internationally. Public attention has finally begun to pick up on how the world is changing in ways that are strange and unpredictable, but few would ever guess that all it comes down just to increasing ease-of-use with voice-activated Merlin field effects.
