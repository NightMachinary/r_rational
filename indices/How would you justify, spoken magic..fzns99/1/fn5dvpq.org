Depending on how sensitive the mental act of casting a spell is /not/ having a vocal or somatic component could be anywhere from reckless to suicide. I've seen this featured in a few otherwise bland stories and really enjoy the flavor aspect.

For example: if the purely mental act of casting a fireball is the same as remembering how it feels to cast a fireball then anyone without an unreasonable amount of mental discipline is going to launch one off accidentally a few times over their life. If you instead mentally link a short series of made up words (or words in a language you would never need to speak) to the act of casting a fireball it becomes much more manageable. As an additional plus side you also get an excuse to have spell names that would otherwise be silly or out of place.
