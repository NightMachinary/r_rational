It's a user interface for some software that implements the magic. This doesn't mean you're in a simulation or that there's some superscientific computer handing out the magic (though there's a lot of stories with that setting). There's possibly some lower level programming interface (primordial magic, etc) that earlier mages used to create it because primordial magic was too complex to do off the cuff. Alternatively, the word is just a cue to activate a spell that the mage himself set up in meditation or other plot bunny that's too time consuming to use when you just need a fireball NOW.
