Magic is a mystic force that is not really understood. But it is known that the act of casting a spell is basically a very focused and powerful way of expressing your thoughts. Powerful enough to alter reality.

When a magician utters an incantation, it's not just a word, it is backed by his understanding of magic and the abstract concept of the effect that he is producing. These incantations are not just sound waves, they flow trough meta-reality and bypass the material, like some sort of left over residue of the spell. When heard by humans they can often sound distorted, dreamlike or spoken in a different voice, always conveying more meaning then what is just encoded in the words.

It is also not really required to use the same word for the same spell. It only matters how the caster conceptualizes the effect that the word captures. But of course, one tradition can standardize these words as they are very likely to work more or less the same for the casters of the same culture.

Same rules are also applied to the gestures and other acts that can help in spellcasting, but master archmages are so advanced in their understanding of magic that they don't need anything else except their thoughts (at least for simpler spells).
