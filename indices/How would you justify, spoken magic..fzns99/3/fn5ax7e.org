Point 2: An idea I've used is that the incantations are ritual prayers to higher entities, but the higher entities themselves mostly respond by subconscious reflex /especially/ to repeat castings, in such a way that the incantation must be in the entity's native language, as a justification for why the caster casts in a language they don't speak, but can be shortened/abbreviated as the entity gets "used to" a specific caster.

Other ideas:

1. Technological aide. Your incantation is the filename of your spell on your Intelligent Device.
2. Magic is mental and perceptual. Your incantation is a trigger-phrase embedded in the mind of your target, but with greater and more interesting effects than one usually sees in spy novels featuring brainwashing.
3. Magic is ubiquitous but application exceeds diagnostic power; ie, in a civilization of magic users it is polite to announce just what you're doing with the whirlwind of deadly mana you're gathering in an inhabited city.
4. Matter has memory. Either by hidden tech or cosmological fiat, consensus reality imbues language with meaning where that meaning converges. Shouting a word then impresses that concept directly on existence.
5. Gatekeeping. Magic has been locked down by the precursors to ignore you unless you know the right passphrases.
6. It's not actually linguistic at all, its /sonic/, like the opera singer and the wine-glass but with far greater axis of resonance. Like in the old Dune movie.
