Reading through other peoples' comments inspired in me another solution which makes for an interesting setting

- After a mage invents a spell, they decide on a casting action and anyone can use it if they copy the mage's actions
- Mages want to preserve their copyright, so they make the actions highly specific
- On the other hand, if they want to share it then they need something easy to duplicate

So they make it unusual strings of syllables: Hard to stumble across, but so easy to teach that they can write it on paper. This would mean spoken words are used in the most commonly shared magic, but other magics can use any form of gesture.

Either mechanic

- the first time the spell is invented, is the only gesture it will have
- the more a spell is cast, the stronger it gets

Can justify using spells in ancient, dead languages.
