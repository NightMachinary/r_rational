I'm not invested enough. Feel free to use what I've written if you're incline to though. It seems like it's suppose to be a lighthearted slice of life fantasy story. There's potential there to turn it into a more rational fiction but I don't think the author had that in mind when starting it.

My opinion: I'm biased since I had different expectations going in. It seems like a fun enough read, similar to other Isekai lightnovels, that I'd might have picked it up had I been looking for something like it.

I do think forcing a change in the character's behavior without believable explanation will work against the story unless he wants to revamp the entire thing. If you really want him to update his mc maybe have the author consider introducing a digital bug, hardware damage, software update through skills, or increased INT stats to show how his thought patterns change over time.
