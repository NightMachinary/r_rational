I'm fine with the mc not being super rational. It's mostly the voice of the mc that is off putting but his choice of skills was the tipping point.

I mean he(she/it) complains for two whole chapter about how he doesn't understand anything or how to check his stats and how nothing makes sense but when he finally gets a chance to do just that he dismisses it. Maybe it's suppose to be humorous and I'm not getting it but if that was the case I think it would have been funnier if he did get that skill only for it to actually be disappointing.

My first complaint is that he thinking too much like a human and at the same time not enough. He doesn't really accept his role as an advanced guard tower but he's doesn't fully make comparisons to his current situation and former human experiences.

For example, he realizes that the world only responded when he used computer-like terminology, e.g. [System Diagnostics] and he either doesn't truly experiment with it or the author poorly express the extent that he tried. There are other questions too. Why does he get headache due to the difference in vision. He's not human anymore, so where does the headaches come from. If he gets headaches are there other bodily functions? Does he get hungry? He's notices the passage of time but does he get tired?

The mc also isn't experimenting as much as I'd expected. All he does with the camera is attempt some makeshift binocular vision (which seems kinda stupid and unnecessary). I would have like to see if the cameras operated with multiple functions (infrared/ultraviolet/lidar?) or how far/close he can "see". He praises the human eye and forgets how terrible human eyes actual are when compared to technology that could see both telescopic and microscopic. He's not limited to human biology so there's so many ways for him to take in his surrounding and non of that even passes his mind.

He admittedly did start experimenting with his weapons but it was mostly a waste of time and we don't get a peek at his train of thoughts through that process. We're only told what happened and his conclusion that we simply have to accept it. I mean he notices that using ammo consumes mana. I would have then wondered if using mana was somehow creating mass from an unknown replenishing energy. I would have tested to see if the used bullets remained or disappeared shortly afterwards. At the minimum, he should at least attempt to figure out the rate of mana regeneration (but that's probably going to be given to him or ignored completely).

Lastly, and more importantly I have no connection with the mc at all. More than being an actual character, it's safe to say that the mc is simply a self insert of the author (which is fine) but I don't know a thing about who he is. All I know is that he used to be human (or at least know of human anatomy and experiences) and knows of C&C. Why isn't there more questioning about his situation. And I mean actual questioning, not his statement of observations. Lizard people were introduced but he doesn't seem curious at all. Heck the ants interesting in their own rights and what does he do? Kills them and ignores them. There's no attempt at even trying to figure out his situation at all.
