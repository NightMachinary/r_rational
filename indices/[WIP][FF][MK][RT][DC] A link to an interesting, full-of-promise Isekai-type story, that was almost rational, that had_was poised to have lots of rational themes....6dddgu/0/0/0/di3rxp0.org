Ok, I've read it to the most recent chapter (1.17), so here's my two cents.

MC isn't a tower of deadly lasers, but is close enough. However, since military might doesn't really threaten the MC, the author has chosen to go for political intrigue instead, with new factions popping up all over and trying to manipulate the MC.

Which means it doesn't really belong in this subreddit, since the most rational thing to do in a political mess is to be irrational so you are less predictable and manipulatable. I.e., unlikely to be a rational fic.

Overall, the story feels like it's still in the prologue stage, or rather, the preliminary clue-gathering stage for a lengthy mystery novel, which makes it hard to determine whether it will be good or not. I will continue reading as more chapters come out.
