  I love cadmium, such a niche power but so useful in certain situations--aided by the fact that it burns so slowly.

Yeah, I always thought Marasi was selling her powers way short. Even if you just care about the punchy fighty shooty stuff (as the people in the books tend to do), you just need allies. Cadmium lets you turn a 3v3 fight into a 2v1 and a 3v2 fight, which is a tremendous tactical advantage.

  For instance, set up shop within view of an interesting geological formation and spend 40 subjective years studying it while several hundred pass in real time, or set up outside a city and have regular census data mailed to the bubble for a long-term demographics project.

The problem with that is that you only get useful information several hundred years later, when the need for that information could easily already have become obsolete.
