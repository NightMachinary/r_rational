I love cadmium, such a niche power but so useful in certain situations--aided by the fact that it burns so slowly.

Recently I had the idea of a research enclave contained within a large cadmium bubble, either made by a few powerful Pulsers or with strategic use of ettmetal generators. They'd have to be ok with leaving the outside world behind, so I'm imagining an Anathem-style monastery where the scientists study any phenomena that they want to watch over a long timescale. For instance, set up shop within view of an interesting geological formation and spend 40 subjective years studying it while several hundred pass in real time, or set up outside a city and have regular census data mailed to the bubble for a long-term demographics project.

Also great for long travel, boring waiting rooms, etc. I imagine an airplane with a First Class section covered by a cadmium bubble. The rich might also pay Pulsers to extend their functional lifespan.
