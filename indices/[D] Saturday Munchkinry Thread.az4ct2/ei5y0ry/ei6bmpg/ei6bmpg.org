So my understanding is the actual power is being immune to this anti-meme? There's anti-memetic info, in this case one kind, out there that you're immune to. I'm going to call this info the A pattern for ease.

I'd also like to point out that in real life I don't think specific anti-memes are very threatening, unless they are conceptual or generally self censoring, we'd be able to it into the parts before it's triggered relatively quickly. If it can be represented as a number for example, you can have a computer add numbers until one output doesn't work, then learn that z is anti-memetic for x+y=z with x and y being knowable but z isn't. Descriptions of the power in binary for example.

Using the anti-meme:

Perfect self encryption - if you write a program to pattern all your memory in the A pattern, and another to read it that way, anyone else trying to load it causes the memory to perfectly scramble even if they use your read program.

True random generator - use the A pattern to create truly random data when sent to another person, which is valuable. (Or would this just roast their computer?)

Cloaking/mind blank tattoo - tattoo yourself with the A pattern to have skin blurring at a distance, and to constantly mind blank people looking at you and trying to read the writing all over you.

Killing? Does telling it to someone, like number 5 says you can, kill them like the nerd or just make them instantly forget it?

Counter -

If there's a serial killer with the power and you have it too you're the only one who can hunt them down and defend against them effectively. Hide your power from them, only trust yourself and physical defenses. Once you find the serial killer you need to kill it or be the personal jailor of a serial killer for the rest of your life. (There's some interesting ethical arguments to be made if their crimes aren't so great but they are still such a personal and societal threat)
