[Anti meme]: This power causes anything that contains information of the function of this power, with the exception of the holder of this power, to be destroyed.

Some examples of it in action:

1) A recording from a camera that is saved to a hard drive. The hard drive is fine but the video file is desolved into a static mess.

2) The holder writes down their power into a diary. The ink runs into the paper makeing the words illegible.

3) Some Internet nerd comes up with a power that erases all information about it's self. Even though the information is hypothetical that is an enough for the power to trigger and the Internet nerd mind is destroyed, rendering them comatosed.

4) A super intelligent AI looks though all the information on the internet and figures out that this power exist. It crashes and it's engineers are forced to reset the servers to the last back up a week earlier to get it to work again.

5) The power info is spoken. The sound waves travel enough for the information to be transmitted but they start to experience interference and become illegible much sooner than you would expect.

How would you use this power as serial killer if a group of 5 superheros, 1 of whom was imume to your power was investigating you?

If you were the super hero who was imune to this power and we're beginning to suspect what it was how would you go about stopping the serial killer while protecting your friends?
