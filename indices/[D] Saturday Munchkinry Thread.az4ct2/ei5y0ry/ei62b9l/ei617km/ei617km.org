Does the serial killer know the powers of the heroes? I would absolutely try to incorporate that aspect into my plans. Especially if the hero that's immune to my powers lacks enhanced durability. I'll carve the truth of my powers (in what is my pre-planned, shortest possible sentence that would result in an activation) in a crane or a load bearing wall or something. I imagine the structure would begin to decay around my message, so if done right, I could collapse something onto them, as part of a plan. Scrawl the sentence in big letters with the exception of punctuation or something, wait for the right time, dot my I's and cross my T's and let the thing begin to tumble.

If I were a hero beginning to suspect someone of having an antimemetic power that didn't work on me? First, buy a bunch of goldfish and establish the vaguest possible description of the power I could without killing the target. The I'd let that shit be known, inasmuch as I could. Go on tv, declare myself Scorching Fire's (or whoever's) personal nemesis and completely untouchable, bent on bringing them in, caution everyone to report them, etc. Try to shape the public narrative and eventual confrontation. Assure my friends and fellow heroes to the extent I could and have them wait in the wings when the time comes, with the knowledge that they should be able to handle any direct confrontation so long as they cover their ears and only communicate with signals, etc.
