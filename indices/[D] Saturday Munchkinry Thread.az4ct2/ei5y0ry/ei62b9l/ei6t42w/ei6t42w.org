The audio combination is a great idea! You could also apply this to other media, like making a crossword describing the anti-meme to kill all who solve it!

Instructing your fellow heros on anti-memetic tactics is a fast track to them dying from it, since they will be trying to figure out why you want them to do this and for what threat, and if they guess it they die.

I don't think cellphones are a threat though since the info should destroy itself on the way to them on the multiple steps and conversions sounds go through before it gets to the receiver.
