From the perspective of the serial killer:

How you take out the heroes depends a lot on the specifics of situation and the powers of the heroes (there are a lot of situations where a gun is the most more appropriate way of killing them), but if you have to use your powers the safest way is probably to walk up to there loved ones and explain your powers to them. Then leave plenty of clues lying around about your powers so the non-immune heroes start to figure it out on their own.

You could create two audio files that when played simultaneously sound like an audio file that describes your powers, if that works you have an untraceable way of killing anyone you can get to listen to it. That's probably unnecessarily convoluted though.

From the perspective of the immune hero:

Instruct your fellow heroes in anti-memetic tactics. Explain to them that your current opponent is dealing with memetic hazards and give them the choice of following your orders blindly or take their loved ones and dissappear until this is all over. If any of them stay, keep any information on the case need-to-know and only use the other heroes if you need the muscle or if they have relevant powers. Get new cellphones and only let them give the number to you (and maybe each other, depending on how much you trust them to not exchange information on the case). Then get each hero to find an out of the way hiding place that is far away from other people and doesn't have internet access where they can stay until you have done the legwork on finding the killer (or until you need their powers for something).

Any further plans depend largely on the specifics of the situation.
