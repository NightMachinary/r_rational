It's the economy class section of the airplane that could use a cadmium bubble most. If a 3-hour flight becomes 10 minutes long, well - there's a lot of conditions people will put up with for 10 minutes but not for 3 hours. You could just about stack them up like sardines. (And you definitely don't need to give them snacks.)

Come to think of it, cadmium also drastically reduces the need for food, drink, and many other supplies during long trips of all kinds.
