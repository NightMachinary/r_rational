  You've got it backwards. If you used cadmium on a plane it'd turn a 90 hour flight instead!

Uhm, no they didn't. Cadmium has less time pass inside the bubble than outside. If your bubble slows time by a factor twenty, then for every ten minutes that pass inside the bubble, three and a bit hours pass outside. A three hour flight would seem like a 10 minute flight to the people on board.
