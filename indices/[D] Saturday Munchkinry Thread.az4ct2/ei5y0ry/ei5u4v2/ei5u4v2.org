*Mistborn Munchkinry Miniseries Part 13: Cadmium*

Ok, week thirteen of the mistborn munchkinry miniseries, for a general overview of the magic system, see [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9zz4sa/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ead595h/][part one]]. I strongly recommend reading the first part of that comment if you weren't here for the past weeks and aren't familiar with the mistborn setting. Parts 2 through 11 can be found here: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/a23pe3/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/eauwn90/][2]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/a4be9x/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ebcx4eg/][3]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/a6ftyl/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ebuo08h/][4]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/a8lgsu/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ecbqhr8/][5]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/af85cz/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/edw9q7a/][6]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/ahmsgc/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/eefzs0m/][7]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/ak1kjr/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ef0o7jj/][8]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/ametuf/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/eflf195/][9]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/ar9jrc/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/eglnl2s/][10]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/atwc86/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/eh4l3jc/][11]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/atwc86/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/eh4l3jc/][12]]

/Spoiler note/: I will avoid things that I consider excessive spoilers, but the exact workings of the magic system are moderate spoilers themselves, so if you intend to read the books and are sensitive to spoilers you should probably skip this one.

This weeks metal is cadmium. As always we're interested in what a cadmium twinborn compounder can do, both here on earth (where they are the only one with this powerset) and in Era 2 Scadrial.

*Allomancy*

When burning cadmium a translucent bubble pops up around the allomancer. Inside that bubble time passes slower than normal. From the perspective of people outside the bubble the allomancer and anything caught in the bubble with them appear frozen, while from inside the bubble the outside world rushes by incredibly quickly.

The allomancer can control the size of the bubble up to a maximum size based on how powerful they are. For an average allomancer, the maximum size for cadmium bubbles is roughly enough to envelop a large building. The extent to which time is slowed down in the bubble also differs per allomancer, but the effects are quite dramatic, 20 to 30 times slower than normal is not unreasonable.

A bubble cannot be moved once it's created, it anchors itself to the nearest object of sufficient mass. Typically this is the ground on which the allomancer is standing (in which case the bubble maintains its position relative to the planet as it rotates around it's axis/the sun), but sufficiently large vehicles can also be used to anchor a time bubble to, an allomancer burning cadmium while inside a train will see their time bubble stay in place relative to the train, rather than the ground. When the allomancer stops burning cadmium the bubble immediately seizes to exist and it takes a few seconds before another bubble can be created.

Small objects like bullets can pass through the edge of the bubble if they move quickly enough, but are knocked wildly off course in the process. Larger objects pop the bubble entirely if they move through its edge. Objects are always effected by the time dilation entirely or not at all, depending on if more of their mass is inside or outside the bubble. Whether something constitutes one object or multiple depends on how it is presented in the cognitive realm, which roughly corresponds to how most people would view it. Moving objects that cross the perimeter of the bubble for longer periods of time (eg. a stick that you wiggle back and forth while it is crossing the edge) pop the bubble.

The edge of a time bubble absorb some, but not all, of the sound going through it. Sounds from inside the bubble are almost completely inaudible to the outside world as they are dampened by crossing into the bubble as well as spread out over a much longer time than before. If you amplified it to a reasonable volume you would still only hear random noise, though, as the same effect that knocks bullets off course also distorts sounds.

Inside the bubble sounds from the outside world will be a constant, white noise hum (being amplified and compressed by time dilation and then mangled and dampened by passing through the edge of the bubble).

Light passes through time bubbles unhindered and the magic compensates for the fact that fewer photons move from inside the bubble to the outside world than vice versa as well as for any redshifting or blueshifting those photons would undergo. The result is that both sides of the bubble see the other side completely as normal, other than the fact that time is sped up/slowed down.

*Feruchemy*

Feruchemically, cadmium stores breath. While storing breath, the feruchemists body needs more oxygen than normal, leading to rapid breathing and the feruchemist feeling like they're constantly out of breath.

When tapping the resulting metalmind the stored oxygen is released back into the blood of the feruchemist, allowing them to survive without needing to breathe. In addition, tapping more breath allows the feruchemist to supply more oxygen to their body, leading to minor increases in stamina and physical strength.
