So, time bubbles, arguably allomancy's most physics breaking feature. I'm sure there are tons of edge cases that I missed in the above description, powers that mess with time tend to not work nicely when you start examining them in any kind of detail.

Speculation notes:

- The stuff about how sound interacts with time bubbles is extrapolation from the fact that bendalloy bubbles cause a noise to be heard in the outside world (which can be masked by coughing, so it's not super loud).
- The 20 to 30 times number is not really based on anything other than the fact that it seems to line up roughly with the fight against Miles.\\
- As with Electrum, we don't actually have any source for what feruchemic cadmium does other than an in universe source that has proven to be unreliable.
