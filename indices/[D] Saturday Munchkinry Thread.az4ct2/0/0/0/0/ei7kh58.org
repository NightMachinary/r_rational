This is a pretty basic anti-memetic device. Does that mean on the day that the power activates a bunch of people who'd already thought of this drop dead, with a bunch of media (say, something similar to the scp wiki) suddenly dropping off the face of the earth? How much information needs to be known about the power? For example, does the information that sound degrades quickly with distance need to be known, does the information that there a 1) unique 2) human immune to the power need to be known? This is in contrast to, for example, a cult that can induct immunity, or an intelligent octopus that holds immunity.
