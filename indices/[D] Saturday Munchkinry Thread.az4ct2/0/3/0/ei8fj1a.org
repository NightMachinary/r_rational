There's a number of issues with the idea. What makes a number associated with a concept? If an idea can be represented using the binary number b, then if one creates a different binary system where 0 means "1" (in the old system), and 1 means "2", and so on, then instead of "b" representing the idea, it's b-1. This may be done any number of times, so why doesn't the "power" crash all computers?

More straightforwardly, from the perspective of information, what makes a list of forbidden numbers different from a list of all numbers which aren't forbidden?
