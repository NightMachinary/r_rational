The problem with the pocket universe with periscope concept is that it still doesn't address how the your bubble interacts with the rest of the universe. Yes, you can allow light in through a narrow opening, but what happens to the other force carriers? Do gravitons propagate through the neck? If so, then the neck region will appear to contain the full weight of your pocket universe. If the opening is too small or the amount of mass in your pocket universe is large, its weight would cause it to sink through whatever floor you are on.

If you have control over the shape of the manifold(s) dividing your pocket universe and the rest of the universe, you might be able to get around this by increasing their surface area. If you have a large enough surface area spread through a large enough region, you would effectively be spreading your interaction with the universe over a much larger space, making you much harder to detect. Though at this point you're more of a human blob or man that can turn into "fog" than an invisible guy. The topology theory required to find good manifolds and calculate the manipulations needed for continuous time transformations between manifolds while ensuring the laws of physics are obeyed at every point (and avoiding destroying things through tidal forces) gives me a headache, and that's before we even consider the energy and force requirements to create and maintain such a manifold. /edit/ And you may want to wear a spacesuit because the pressure at these interfaces would be inversely proportional to surface area. With the kind of surface areas you would need, you're effectively operating in vaccum. Also since radiative flux is proportional to surface area, so things could be interesting.
