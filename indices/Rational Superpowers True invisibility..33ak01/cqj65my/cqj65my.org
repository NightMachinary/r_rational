An alternate version, which seems more "true" to my mind (in that it's less of a hack and more of an elegant extension of physics): imagine a spherical shell, with you inside. On the surface of the shell is a (two-dimensional) "white hole" coming from an alternate reality that is in all respects the same, except that there is no shell there. (If it helps, imagining an infinitely-densely-packed array of micro-white-holes, each of which comes from a separate copy of said alternate reality, thus negating any impact of the holes on one-another's input energy.)

So, imagine the shell sitting on some grass. Looking at the bottom of the shell, the grass being packed down by the shell resting on it would be obscured (imagine a perfectly black circular void)---and from the surface of the shell, light energy from a world where the grass is unbent would be emanating (replacing said void with what you "should" be seeing.)
