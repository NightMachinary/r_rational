Interesting numbers, though unless i am misunderstanding something they seem to imply that the CO would kill you first, though the oxygen would probably impair your judgement and hurt your performance first. Basically oxygen would cause you worse symptoms at the beginning, but would take a bit of time to kill you, while CO2 would only be mildly annoying at first but would kill you after a while).

Anyhow the end result is that using an oxygen tank will not truly help you because after a short while the CO2 would be poisonous.

I mostly remember the thing about CO2 from an old Discovery\NG\whatever show about submarines and about how they needed to use chemicals to take the CO2 out of the air as it became the issue very quickly after you started getting extra air\oxygen supplies.. Unfortunately though i don't remember anything too specific so i might be wrong..

*edit*

just noticed

#+begin_quote
  78.04% nitrogen 13.6% - 16% Oxygen 4% - 5.3% Carbon dioxide 1% Argon and other gases
#+end_quote

how could the O2 be 13.6%? 78.04+13.6+5.3+1=97.94%, if we go with the 4% CO2 then it ends up being 96.5.. it seems the numbers are only possible if the O2 is 15.5%~17%
