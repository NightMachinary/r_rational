[[http://qntm.org/invisibility][You may be interested in this write-up from Sam Hughes]] which goes into some details of how he solved this problem to his satisfaction.

So that aside, the big problems are:

- Heat
- Air
- Blindness
- The interface between the ground and the cloak

You can make a field that "bends" all light around it so that any laser that goes through it appears straight to the outside observer. But you still need to figure out what the invisibility does when someone is standing on a patch of grass, or tracking their way through flour - is this a known weakness?

For air, you're looking for respiratory minute volume. It's about 12 liters of air per minute during light activity, so depending on the size of the field you might start running into problems pretty quickly. A sphere two meters wide has ~4100 liters of air in it (minus however much your body takes up) meaning ~342 minutes, or ~6 hours. You can breathe air that you've already breathed, but I'm not sure how much you get out of it. Either way, this is pretty easily solvable with an oxygen tank. Varies a lot depending on what you're doing.

For heat, the human body produces about 100 watts, which isn't getting vented or conducted to anywhere. It takes 4.2 joules to raise the temperature of a gram of water by 1 degree (Celsius). The average man weighs 80kg, and is mostly water. So given that, it takes 336,000 joules to raise the temperature of a person by 1 degree. Since watts are joules per second, that means 3360 seconds to raise temperature 1 degree, which comes out to be about an hour. Obviously this is going to be variable depending on activity. Hyperthermia (> 37.5 °C) in ~1 hour, Hyperpyrexia (> 40 °C) in ~4 hours.

Edit: I'm a software engineer, not a physicist.
