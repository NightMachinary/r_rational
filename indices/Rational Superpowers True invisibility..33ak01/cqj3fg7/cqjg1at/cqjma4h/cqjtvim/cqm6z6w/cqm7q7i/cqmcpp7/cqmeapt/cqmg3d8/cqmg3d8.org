Hmm. Now that I look at it again, why would our body exhale ~4% more argon than it inhales? And how the hell is there no CO2 whatsoever in the air we inhale. Along with the aforementioned lack of any other gases. Either we are missing something substantial or that Wikipedia article has a major mistake.

Edit: I figured it out. Both sets of air composition are just approximations. And to make it more confusing they were both done independently from each other, the second one (exhalation) being 1 order of magnitude more accurate while the first one (inhalation) being artificially and inaccurately rounded up to give exactly 100%.
