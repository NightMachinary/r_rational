Changing the speed of light affects lots of things in non-obvious ways. For example, the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativistic_electromagnetism][strength of magnetic fields is directly related to special relativity]], so you just turned off Earth's magnetosphere and killed everyone. Well, magnetism also affects how molecules go together, so there probably isn't anyone around to kill.

The speed of light also factors into allowing the Sun to shine. In classical physics, the Sun's gravity is not sufficient to slam hydrogen together hard enough to fuse it. Quantum physics lets it cheat: even if the nuclei shouldn't hit each other, sometimes they will quantum tunnel into each other, if they have enough energy. The energy they need is related to the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamow_factor][Gamow factor]], and the actual equation has c /in the exponent/. You've just made the necessary energy incredibly high, stopped tunneling entirely, and turned off the Sun.
