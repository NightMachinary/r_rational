That's true if we can measure the time it takes absolutely accurately and noise in negligible.

But human technology has finite accuracy. The faster the speed of light, the more accurate you need to be to discern the difference in latency.

Going off [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_rangefinder][wikipedia]]

If the speed of light is 30 million times faster as I suggested, then time-of-flight rangefinders wont work for much under a kilometer difference. (they already can't use that technique for anything below millimeters)

Triangulation and refraction based methods are more accurate, and I'm not sure how the increased speed of light would effect them.
