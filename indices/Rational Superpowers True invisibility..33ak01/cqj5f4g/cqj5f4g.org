  Generates a field in a limited bubble around themselves that curves all energy radiation around them, causing any form of detection (heat, light, etc) to notice nothing wrong.

This would defeat casual observation, but it's not difficult to see straight through it anyway. The basic problem is that it takes radiation 1.6 times as long to go around you as it would take it to go through empty air. Most sounds would be delayed enough to be noticeable to the unaided ear - if you're in front of a wall, everyone would notice the anomalous distorted echo. If you're lucky, they will just "feel a presence" instead of consciously notice the oddity, since those kinds of distortions are exactly what lead to that sensation, but you won't fool machines. Or bats, for that matter. You could fix that by modifying the speed of sound, but you can't modify the speed of light without breaking physics entirely. A laser rangefinder would detect you as a meter deep pit in whatever is behind you.
