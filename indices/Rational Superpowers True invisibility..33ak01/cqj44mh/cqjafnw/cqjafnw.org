If you make someone invisible to visible light, you can detect them with other wavelengths. If you make them invisible to all wavelengths, the electromagnetic force stops working causing all the chemical bonds holding them together to fail along with the force that keeps them from falling through the grand. It would be useful for some kind of disintegration ray, though.
