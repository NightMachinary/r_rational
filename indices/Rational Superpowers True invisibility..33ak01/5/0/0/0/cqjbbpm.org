How does it break thermodynamics? It breaks special relativity, but you can basically do that with general relativity if you have negative mass. In any case, you're far from being "on your own". Only on the boundary of the bubble does physics have any real change, and as long as you don't do anything too destructive there, it shouldn't matter that much. Making it so you don't interact with photons completely removes the physical interactions that hold you together.
