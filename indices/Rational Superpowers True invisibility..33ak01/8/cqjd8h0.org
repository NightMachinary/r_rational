The bubble is impermeable. Otherwise you could simply exchange air with your environment, thus bleeding off heat and getting as much oxygen as you require. (And that would offer three additional ways of detecting you: rising CO2 levels, heat dissipation, and air movement. As if we needed them -- but those are effective against any attacker that defeats your light-based detection.) So you're not passing kinetic energy through or anything. But perhaps you're simply saying that smacking the bubble with a baseball bat will move the bubble (along with the person inside) rather than stopping the bat dead or functioning as an immovable object.

If the ball is rigid, you're in a giant hamster ball, rolling it into things, probably smashing everything around you. Your biggest weaknesses are doors and stairs: you can't fit through doors or climb stairs, and descending a stairway would be harrowing. You can detect two types of objects: the ones that go crunch underfoot and walls. Oh, and you can detect precipices leading into yawning abysses. But only after the fact.

If the ball is not rigid, you might end up with a non-convex shape. I don't think this is a problem... Anyway, it does let you sense your surroundings a bit better, especially if you paint the inside of the bubble and have a lamp. You can see a distorted outline of anything you're rolling over at the moment. But you can only detect things by rolling over them, so you're not exactly stealthy. This does let you enter codes in keypads and type on keyboards.

In either case, you can communicate via sound. Either vibrations outside your bubble vibrate the whole rigid bubble, or the bubble's surface is a membrane that can act as a speaker when something vibrates against it. This works both ways, of course; everyone can hear you.

Alternatively, let's say the bubble is not a physical surface and in fact permeates solid objects. Everyone can detect you instantly because they see a moving circular depression in the ground. When you go through a door, part of the doorframe disappears.

I don't think this system is particularly practical. The form factor is a serious problem.
