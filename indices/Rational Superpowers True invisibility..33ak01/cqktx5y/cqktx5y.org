You have a field around you, perhaps nearly skintight. The boundary checks incoming photons to see if they would hit you. If they would, it clones them, and with speed of light delay teleports one of the pair to the other side of you to continue its journey. The boundary checks outgoing photons to see if they were reflected from you. If they were, it negates them and stores that energy for the next time it needs to create a photon.
