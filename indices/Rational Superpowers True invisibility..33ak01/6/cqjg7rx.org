Wouldn't it be "easier" for such a power to work instead by acting as a dimensional shift? instead of bending light which as mentioned already would be detectable the bubble(alternatively in such a case the field could just form around the person and their belongings or any other shape), would shift object through a different dimension so for you wont need to break physics by changing the speed of light, but the light would still take just the same amount to travel through the field. same for sound waves, and it would make it easier to define the interactions with the outside world.

Though it might be somewhat overpowered when i think about it..
