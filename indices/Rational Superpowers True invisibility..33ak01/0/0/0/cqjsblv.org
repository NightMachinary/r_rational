What happens to the universe if you just assume the C constant has always been higher that in the story's universe? It would convenient to a good number of narratives for the speed of light to just have always been something like 9 trillion kilometers per second, But off the top of my head It would definitely impact the number of black holes, the possibility of using gravitational lensing, make laser rangefinders far less accurate, and... I guess do something terrible relating to E=MC^{2.}
