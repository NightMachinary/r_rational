I thought you were trying to make it so light can get around the bubble fast enough. You were actually trying to break laser rangefinders. I guess that works too. Although you could just say that laser rangefinders don't exist in that universe and not go into why.

I think microwaves could still detect you.

If you want to move a wave around an object, you have to mess around with how fast it goes. If you have a speed limit so you can't do it the nice pretty way, you're going to have to split the light into little pieces and redirect them individually. It won't meet up right at the boundaries, but as long as those little pieces have a much larger diameter than the wavelength of the light, the boundaries won't do much. But if you're dealing with light where the wavelength is measured in inches, that won't work. The bubble will break up microwaves, so you can use that to detect them.
