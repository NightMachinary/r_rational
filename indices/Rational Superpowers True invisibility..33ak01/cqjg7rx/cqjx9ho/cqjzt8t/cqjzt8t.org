I just don't see any "realistic" way that something like this would work that doesn't rely on subjective modifications. i.e. invisibility based not on actual properties but on concepts, so its not that people will not see you, but instead they will not be able to perceive you, same for any kind of recordings, but that requires a subjective, as opposed to objective, universe.
