If everything is being curved around the field, then you're basically stretching space to remove a bubble from spacetime entirely. Or possibly you just have such a tiny connection that it goes unnoticed.

When you talk about "kinetic" leaving the field, what does that mean? Physical objects passing through the field would be problematic, since they're held together with the electromagnetic force, which is mediated by photons. Do you mean that you can use the field like a hamster ball?

What happens with sound? Does it alter the properties of nearby matter to allow sound to warp around it like light does?

How effective of a shield is this?

Humans generate about 100W of heat. It looks like it would take about 40 minutes for your temperature to increase by on degree Celsius. The air would take about 40 seconds to heat up, so it would probably get uncomfortably hot very quickly. That being said, if you bring your own heat sink, such as some ice water, you could probably last quite a bit longer. Air becomes uncomfortable after about 13 minutes, and dangerous after about 2 hours, but you can bring your own air. A rebreather lasts about one to six hours.

There might be problems opening the field of air pressure has changed. Does it release slowly, or all at once? You might need ear protection to avoid going deaf.
