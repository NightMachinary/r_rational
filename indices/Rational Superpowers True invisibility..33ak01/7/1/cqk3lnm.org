  There might be problems opening the field of air pressure has changed. Does it release slowly, or all at once? You might need ear protection to avoid going deaf.

This was my qualm. If you bring along an oxygen tank, you're going to be increasing the air pressure inside the bubble. Rather defeats the purpose of active stealth if turning it off sounds like a gunshot.

A rebreather system would be a good way to get around this.
