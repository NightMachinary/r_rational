This sort of fantasy trope exploration is initially why I liked the webcomic Goblins. (I still read it, but it has deviated from its initial story arc of rationalizing the CR 1/2.)

I notice that "To rid the world of existential threats" (i.e. humans) is not on the list... why not make Orks the fantasy version of UFAI?
