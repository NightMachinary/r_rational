Seems like this falls into the trap of assuming that "everyone is the hero of their own story" means that everyone is /actually the good guy/.

If they're motivated by Pure Evil, why do they have to be mindless? Why can't they be like Pact's Imps, killing and maiming in order to weaken the greater fabric of society/reality/what-have-you? Why can't they be pursuing some utterly alien goal that requires getting humans out of the way so they can't oppose it?

If they're motivated by greed, why should they have been "duped"? Why can't they have been hired by a neighbouring Evil Empire? Why can't they have realized that raiding and plundering has good returns, like ugly green Vikings?

If they're motivated by revenge, why should humans have invaded them first? Why wouldn't it be based on a cycle of mutual aggression, us raiding them because they raid us because we raid them, like most such conflicts in real life? Heck, why can't they have a completely alien concept of "Justice", attacking us because we refuse to move our villages and let them take over in the traditional nomadic way, or because we've offended against some religious or cultural /more/?
