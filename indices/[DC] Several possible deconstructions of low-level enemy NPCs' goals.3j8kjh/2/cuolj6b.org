I ran a one-off that turned into a three-off about a group of goblins, exiled from their tribe for political reasons, taking up residence in a haunted barrow. The players were their gang's leadership: The mightiest warrior, the old chief's witch, and the old chief's daughter. They set to rat hunting/trapping/farming, exorcising the zombies and skeletons they couldn't use as de facto guards, dealing with a yellow mold infestation, and trading with the greedy, stupid, racist kobolds who lived in the connected natural cavern.

Then the (staggeringly powerful) level 1 adventurers started showing up... and the goblins had to come up with plans based on superior knowledge of the map, relationships with its hazards, and what patchy information their scouts provided.

I cannot recommend it enough if you've got a crew who'd go for that sort of thing.
