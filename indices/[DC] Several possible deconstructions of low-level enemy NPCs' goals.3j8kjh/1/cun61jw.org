What /do/ orks want?

- *To be evil:* These Orks don't have names. They don't have personalities. They don't have hopes, dreams and aspirations. They're fantasy filler. These Orks have no plan or strategy except to hook up with some bigger creature, like the mini-Boss Ogre, and kill.

- *To make cash:* Someone is paying the Orks, and paying them enough not only to stand the infinite boredom of waiting for the young Murder Hobos to come along, but to get slaughtered at their hands when they finally arrive. Hiring bands of Orks isn't cheap. Someone is getting a decent rate of return on the investment for his goals.

- *Justice and vengeance:* The Orks launch invasions of villages from their marginalized existence to wrest back what was once theirs. They invade dungeons to right their ancient wrongs, and take mini-bosses with them to kill any who try to stop them.

- *To settle and farm:* When the Orks find a place that's good to farm and not yet inhabited, they found a new village and move their farmers. If the good place to farm is already inhabited, the Orks plot how they're going to take the village. To them, the current residents are simply in the way; the Orks need to feed their people. Food is a greater motivator than glory or power or conquest. Nothing else matters.

- *To build empire:* These Orks burning far-flung villages are not the main bulk of the Empire's army. They are scouts, probing and sending back reports on defenses. The true army--the dangerous army--is a world away, with thousands of armed Orks laying siege to isolated, culturally-remote golden Elven cities. And, when those cities fell, the Orks sacked the buildings. They moved in and began ruling over these Elves. They assimilated Elven understanding into their own Empire.

No one is what he seems, and everything has little pull-able threads that unravel into a tapestry of background, story, and tale.
