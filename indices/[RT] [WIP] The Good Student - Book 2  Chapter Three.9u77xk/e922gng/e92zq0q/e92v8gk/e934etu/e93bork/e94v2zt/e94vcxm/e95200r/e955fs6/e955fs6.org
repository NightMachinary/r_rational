Funny enough I remember coming across that post when I was reading it the first time through and being annoyed that no one confirmed or disputed anything there.

"Nic had been groomed for the other realm his entire life ^ ... by the crazy demon and librarian"

These two in particular i'm not entirely sure about - granted, it's strictly on fuzzy memory and nothing there setting them off. I'd have to go back to my original question of why? If, by crazy demon, you mean the original demon who opened the door (or created it? Or whatever) in the pyramid, I'd have to say this doesn't seem correct? Just because the demon did not seem familiar with Nic at all and actually did not like him as a "material."

If not, which crazy demon did you mean? Apart from that, what was their motivation for choosing Nic? Kind of a shame this is a summary. If you're keeping track really, maybe go back to this post every time you come across info and add in the chapter it appears in?
