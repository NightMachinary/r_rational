I can't speak to this as there was a LOT of really abstract stuff that was kind of incomprehensible to me towards the end of the first book. I want to say that sounds familiar but that also might be me mixing it up with the MC from Worth The Candle.

Off the top of my head I can't remember how a demon would be mixed up in his early life, but you either remember better than I do, or you covered this more recently than I did. It's honestly been a very long time.

Can you go into the reason behind this? What was the point of causing this infatuation with her?
