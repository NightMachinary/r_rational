I'm very aware of what she's trying to do. She didn't need to explain anything as it is - this is something she more or less talked about in the last quarter of the last book. Either way, I don't think there's anything hidden behind her words or motivations in this case. She flat out stated that it should have been her in the last book as well.

It's nothing recent, on my part. I've always hated her character AND Nic's general interactions with and feelings for her. I'd have to admit he's also a part of why all her scenes have become so taxing. Inevitably, something to endure and plod through. Part of the problem I have is that I feel like I'm reading the exact same scene every time the two characters interact.

The other part is that the longer his feelings continue, the more bizarre and jarring they become to me, as a reader. At first it was hopeful, then it was sad. Eventually, it became weird and disgusting, especially considering all the events that have occured in the middle of this.

He's not particularly old, I don't believe his infatuation (or is it limerence?) should have lasted anywhere this long. It's very clearly not love (I don't even think romantic love should be possible given his age at the time of meeting and his subsequent history with the girl in question). I don't know what the author intended to add to the story with all of this, but I think it ran its course a long time ago and it has only detracted from it since, as far as I'm concerned.

EDIT: I should probably mention I have a small issue with how she behaves in general as well, given what we've seen with her and the rest of the people around her. She has never not come across as some sort of vengeful bully who operates on fear. The incident with the sausage in this chapter is indicative of that, and it's just one of many instances. So yes, while the MC's interactions with her contribute significantly to the unpleasantness, she's still just sort of odious all on her own.
