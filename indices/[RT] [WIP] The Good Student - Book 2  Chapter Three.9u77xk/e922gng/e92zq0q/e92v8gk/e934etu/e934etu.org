I think she's intentionally trying to put personal feelings aside and become a major player. Its possible her unpleasantness to nic is a calculated counter to nic's infatuation.

When she says "what good can you possibly do?", I think that's a face value question about how ridiculous it is to her that large scale events are in the hands of someone who optimized for studying in order to get closer to his crush all his life.

She is outwardly a bitch, but I think that that is a good place for her character to be for many reasons. I feel like a lot of fics invevitable priotitize their worlds and outcomes being likeable, but this is a good way that the story can remain good with some counterbalance to that kind of plot sugaring
