A theory I had was that Nic's obsession could be much more mundane than demons. Perhaps Dizzy's father did some kind of low level compulsion/brainwashing to make sure Nic respected Dizzy without ever being able to take it too far. Perhaps Nic's presence which is inexplicable otherwise given the status difference was meant to inoculate dizzy to experience with boys.

​

Along those lines perhaps as mentioned the goal was to get Dizzy's father in the position we saw him at by the end of book 1. There was no way to directly influence him but they tried to get at his daughter. And thus they manipulated events to ensure they'd have an agent of some kind (Nic) preloaded with various compulsions to stay near the family.

​

The librarian certainly seems to indicate she'd foreseen Nic or Dizzy possibly stepping up to the role. It's also clear that the mages including the archmage are likely aware that Winnum Roke was the figure meant to come back. Now that we know all the demons have crossed over and have been making mages for thousands of years that kind of long term long range planning from rogue demon factions unhappy with the stopgap measure put in place could have orchestrated events the culmination of which involve nic being who he is.
