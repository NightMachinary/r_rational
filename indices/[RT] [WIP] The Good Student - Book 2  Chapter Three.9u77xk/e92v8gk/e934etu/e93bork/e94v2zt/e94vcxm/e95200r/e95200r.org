Started a reread very recently and I'm not there yet so it isn't super fresh. I think it's because Nic was always supposed to be the door according to the librarian's plan, and the manipulation was purely to bring him to Ransom and get him isolated and within the librarian's power frequently. (There may have been a part where Dizzy was part of some other demon's plan, so Nic would always go after her and be the door instead, but this one is less fuzzy.)

IIRC, Dizzy is actually not even particularly pretty. Like, she's /alright/, probably not even one of the prettier girls at the school. She's just a 25 out of 10 to Nic.
