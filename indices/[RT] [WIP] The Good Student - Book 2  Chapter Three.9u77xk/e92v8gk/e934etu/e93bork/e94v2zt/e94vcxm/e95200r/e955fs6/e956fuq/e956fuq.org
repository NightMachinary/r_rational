Haha, me too. I was hoping to get support, have other people throw out theories too, or even get countered on points. Bit disappointed it didn't generate any discussion.

I call the crazy demon the one that some people thought was the All-Mother and was captured by the government, then ended up sacrificing herself to become the door. You're right that she told him that she didn't like him at all, but I think that was before she went, "psyche, that was all just a double bluff to get you to consume me!" So my assumption is that she was lying before and really did plan it out.

The motivations for why they chose Nic in particular are either not revealed yet or hidden better than I can discern.

(EDIT: My only theory is that Nic /had/ to be the one, because killing a demon is hard and only so many people have the mindset to do it. He was born/prepared to have the rare combination of booksmarts, outlook on life, ability to figure out what it would take to kill the demon, while not being aware enough to understand the motivations.)
