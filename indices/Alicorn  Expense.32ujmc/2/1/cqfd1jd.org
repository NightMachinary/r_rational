  taking a coma patient.
#+end_quote

We don't know everything about the mind transfer; it's possible that a coma patient would stay in a coma.

(It's also possible, depending on whether the superpower came with a user manual, that she doesn't know and doesn't want to take that chance.)

Also consider that all coma patients are monitored (else they would be dead). /Someone/ is going to notice that the body is missing, or that the patient had a literally miraculous recovery.

Suicidals should work though.
