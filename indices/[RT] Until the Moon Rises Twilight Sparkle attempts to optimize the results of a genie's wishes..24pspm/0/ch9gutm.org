I really enjoyed the characterization of the genie and Twilight in this, and while it is a one-scene one-shot fic, it's a lot better written than simple talking heads fic.

The story is told from the genie's POV, and the dramatic reading linked at the bottom of the description is great quality for amateur voice actor/audio editor.

As a side note, it's perfectly readable if you're not familiar with the series.
