Thank you for the praise! I was kind of surprised that you praised the pacing in particular, because I really have no idea what I'm doing in that regard :)

Regarding your issue, there will be an appendix listing all the works (with a short review of each work of origin by m1k). It just feels weird to post that appendix before posting the final chapter.

Given that you're asking me, though, I might as well tell you. /Ashes on Mars/ (title by me) is from the movie /Mr Nobody/, which is just about my favourite movie. I highly recommend it, even though Mike thinks it's an overambitious mess :)

The Dragonsong Series is from Mr Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore, a quaint little novel about an international bookstore conspiracy. A fun read.
