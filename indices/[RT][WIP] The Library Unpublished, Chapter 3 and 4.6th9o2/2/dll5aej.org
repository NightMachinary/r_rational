The chapter was very well written with a nice steady build up of tension. Too often it's too quick or too slow.

The only issue I have is not being able to know the books where the meta-fictions are used in. For example, the Chesscourt series is easy because The Northern Caves are mentioned in the text, but I have no idea what book Ashes of Mars is in, nor the Dragonsong Series.
