Just found this story, and I love it so much! Hits a lot of my buttons, given that it's somewhere between Homestuck, TNC, and my own internet habits.

I appreciate how willing the characters (and author) are to just sit and think/talk things out. It reminds me a bit of [[http://curioustale.org/the_curious_tale/after_the_hero/prelude/prelude_introduction][Prelude to After the Hero]], which, though a lot more action-packed to start with, is centered around one big planning session. Hypotheses are raised, plans are suggested, and they're shot down or tweaked or rendered irrelevant by flashy interruptions. It's great.

We are seeing a bit of "action" in this story too, now. If sein is malicious then I feel like they must want to be caught for some reason, given how they basically just screamed 'HEY I LOVE MANIPULATING AND LYING TO PEOPLE'. Given that, I feel like they've gotta be a mostly-innocent goofball. (Okay, mostly because I love my Dave Strider types and I want them to be buddies with the nerdy MC. So sue me.)

I've also been getting a lot of weird, possibly-completely-baseless suspicious vibes.

On first read something made me think they might've been replaced during or right before the "vacation", but I can't remember what.

Also, I feel like there's a deeper point to both this

  I shared my findings with _sein_, and _sein_ downloaded the Dragonsong Series for me. They were quite fun. The third book was supposed to carry a hidden message, but I didn't even notice. The author must have been a very clever man to fold his cipher into the text in a way which kept his natural style intact. The books kept me entertained and occupied for two days.

(some kind of brainwashing??) and this:

  On the second day, a package from the TorrentLord arrived. I had assumed the TorrentLord lived overseas, based on the fact that he, according to _sein_, frequented a Russian torrent server. It seems I had to revise that assumption, but I also felt that it didn't matter. Somehow, I felt as though the TorrentLord's role in this mystery was over.

but I'm not sure why. Just the kind of tone that authors take when there's something going on behind the scenes, maybe?
