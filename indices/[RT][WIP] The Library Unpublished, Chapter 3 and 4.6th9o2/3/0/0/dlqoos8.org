Thank you for the kind words! I really like knowing that my stories resonate with a few people, because there's this feeling that we share an absurdly specific interest, and that makes me feel all warm and fuzzy.

  I appreciate how willing the characters (and author) are to just sit and think/talk things out.

This story is intended to be very much in the vein of The Northern Caves, where online discussions are the entire point. If you'd like to read something similarly detailed, but more introspective, you might like my Harry Potter fanfiction [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/9829580/chapters/22071191][On The Continuity of Consciousness]], in which there are entire chapters of Luna just thinking about things in her own peculiar way.

  I feel like there's a deeper point

I don't know if you want Word of God on that, so I spoiler-tagged it.

[[#s][WoG regarding the first paragraph:]]

In general, though, I like it when people suspect things that aren't there. If everyone could perfectly predict the story's path, these discussions wouldn't be remotely as fun :)

  is Cio's name inspired by

Yes, she is inspired by a character from Kill Six Billion Demons. When I started writing The Library Unpublished, I started with the first dialogue between _sein_ and m1k, and soon realized that there would have to be a third character, and that she would have to be a fanfiction writer. When the time came to give her a name, I did the obvious.

To anyone who hasn't read K6BD, Cioci Cioelle is a blue-skinned demon who literally introduces herself as a fanfiction writer, confusing the main character (who's a closeted nerd) to no end. K6BD comes highly recommend for its dense worldbuilding featuring a blend of Gnosticism, Hinduism and Buddhism served with an nice amount of absurdly epic action. If all of that doesn't seem idiosyncratic enough, let me just mention that the comic is named after its main character.

  her fic looks /inspired/

Thank you :)

From time to time, I write a particularly metafictional fic and think that Cio might have written that, and it's not impossible that I might post some of those in the future. Who knows, I might even write parts of something she's already written. (Except the xkcd one. I don't write slash.)

However, if anyone who reads this wishes to defictionalize one of Cio's ideas, thereby creating fanfiction of The Library Unpublished, I heavily encourage it! Send me a link if you do :)
