Also, I have to know, is Cio's name inspired by the [[#s][comic]] character of a very similar name, who also happens to be a fanfic writer with straight black hair? I'd be flabbergasted if that's a coincidence.

(Also, her fic looks /inspired/; wish I could check it out.

... was the intent to inspire defictionalizations? because these totally need to exist. you sly dog.)
