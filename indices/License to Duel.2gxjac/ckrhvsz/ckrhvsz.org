I'm thinking about how the puzzle's invincibility applies to Yugi's strength. If he's invulnerable, what's the mechanic? Does he have a second skin clinging to him, that's just a hard layer nothing can bypass without permission? And how does fighting work? Assuming the 2nd skin thing, then do his punches feel like he has a fist of diamond hardness? I know his strength is still limited, but will his limbs now be essentially the hardest bludgeons in existence? Can I put him in a cannon and use him as the hardest cannon shell ever? Also how transitive is this? Is his clothing invulnerable? If it is, can he make objects and people he hold invulnerable as well? And what decides this? Is this a puzzle mechanic that filters through yugis mind and what he identifies as his body? Or does the pharoah decide?

Obvious "counters" to the puzzle are targeting Yugi through the people he loves. Psychological warfare. Imprisonment (assuming his strength is still just that of the teenager he is), Starvation (assuming this isn't covered by the puzzle) Suffocation (that seems like something covered by the puzzle, almost, so can Yugi now survive underwater? Or in space?)

Also, on a related psychological note, can I break Yugi mentally? As in drive him insane through years of mental and sensory assault, so that I can convince him to "allow" me to harm him?
