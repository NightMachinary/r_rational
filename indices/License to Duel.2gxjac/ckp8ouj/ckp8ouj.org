  PS: We learn that the Puzzle cannot be harmed by anything. It makes its wielder impervious to any harm without permission: it is still possible for its wielder to get a haircut, but only if the barber has permission, otherwise even the hair is invincible.

It makes you immune to being harmed without permission. My inner munchkin tells me that a rigorous definition of "harm" is called for. Are you immune to ageing? Starvation? Can you eat an unhealthy diet for years and not get fat? Are you immune to hair dye?
