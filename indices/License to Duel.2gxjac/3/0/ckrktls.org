I thought a lot along those same lines. I feel like the puzzle is going to work on a combination of Yugi's subconscious definition of harm and his allowances of "harm". Otherwise a villain could say "Let me kill you, or I kill Gramps, Tea and Joey" That seems a too-obvious way to cheat the invulnerability. So I feel like, for a decent sense of true, tangible invulnerability, the sensation has to pass two checks before the puzzle can let it through.

1. Does Yugi allow this change to his physical state?

2. Will this physically harm Yugi based on his subconscious definition of the word?

The sensation has to get a pass through both questions to be let through. That's the best way for that mechanic to run, I feel. Otherwise, as I said, it's much too easy to be bypassed by villains through the use of proxies.
