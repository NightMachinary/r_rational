Challenge accepted. Also, when the pharaoh is talking in the last paragraph, there are italics around the word "is" in "Life is the struggle for life" line which do not italicize the word.

It seems okay so far, but there is not nearly enough content to form an actual opinion and the admission of the first chapter being too hard to write is rather worrisome.
