Knowledge of Yugioh is not required to read.

Chapter 1 was too hard to write so I just made a placeholder for now. Chapter 2 is still too short but hopefully it'll be enough to give a taste. I'd appreciate any reviews / advice / etc. I admit I'm mostly posting this to positively reinforce progress on writing actual words instead of hyperdesigning every detail. If you want more than a taste you'll have to wait.

Challenge 1: what strange things have not yet been explained?

Challenge 2: name all departures from canon so far.

Challenge 3: come up with clever applications of the Puzzle's powers.

I'm trying to make Yugi not just "generic rational fanfic protagonist" and retain as much as possible of his original personality but it hasn't shown yet. He's in unusual circumstances.
