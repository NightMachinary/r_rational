As another poster mentioned, you might want to scan through some of the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/monthlyrecommendation][monthly recommendation threads]]. Posters usually post a brief (or sometimes not so brief) description of what they liked or didn't like and why.

Rational/ist/ fiction is far less common than /rational/ or rational-adjacent fiction that often gets posted here. Besides Pokemon: The Origin of Species, I can't think of too many rationalist fics with teams of rationalists. There are plenty of rational or adjacent fictions with teams that work together or collaborate, though. Hero's War, Practical Guide to Evil, Worth the Candle, and to a lesser extent The Gods are Bastards (they have teams, but aren't always rational) and Mother of Learning (protagonist is rational, but usually solitary or working primarily with one other character).
