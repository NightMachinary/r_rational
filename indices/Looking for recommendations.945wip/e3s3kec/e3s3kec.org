I really liked Archimedes for that reason too, that and the relentless work ethic (of which I'm rather envious).

I have a question about Origin of Species: I have no familiarity at all with Pokemon, and not a lot of interest in the concept (which seems to be a few degrees of separation from dog fighting). However people have said it's quite educational, and I'm wondering if it's worth reading because of that?
