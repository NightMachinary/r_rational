I just binged through the series and think a lot of my enjoyment came from reliving my childhood imagination. Don't get me wrong - it's still a highly entertaining story and great concept, but the premise of the story is "how do we make the pokemon game world more feasible to exist"? If the pokemon world of fantastic creatures with powers doesn't interest you, it may be a bit of a drag for you. In my opinion it's still worth reading because the characters are likeable and the story is fun and educational.
