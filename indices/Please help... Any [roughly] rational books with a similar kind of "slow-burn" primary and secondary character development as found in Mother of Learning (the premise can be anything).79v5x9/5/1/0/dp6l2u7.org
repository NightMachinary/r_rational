It's xianxia, so no. Xianxia characters tend to have a "might makes right" philosophy, xianxia antagonists tend to be two-dimensional, and xianxia protagonists can generally be spotted by A) some bloodline or artifact that allows them to gain power at a higher-than-normal rate (often being mistaken for a once-in-a-millennium genius), and B) nobody giving the protagonist any face, which is used as a justification for the protag to kick ass and not feel bad about it (see the previous point about "might makes right".)

It can be entertaining, but it's very much the literary equivalent of junk food.
