I assume that everyone subscribed to this sub has read Worm, but that fits perfectly.

I'd also say Vin's development in Mistborn is something like Zorian's: gaining new powers and developing her cognitive and social capabilities at the same time. Mistborn itself is probably not +rational+ rationalist, but as with all Sanderson the magic system is very rule-based and super fun to read.
