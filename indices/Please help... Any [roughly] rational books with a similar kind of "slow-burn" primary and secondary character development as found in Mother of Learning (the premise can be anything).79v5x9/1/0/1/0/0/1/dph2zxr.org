Vin works with the nobles, because a large part of his plan is setting Vin up as part of the new ruling class.

to rub things in, the only thing of any import Vin learned is that House Venture was responsible for those special mines. To make things worse, Vin doesn't make use of this information in a tactical way at all!

So, recon work is irrational? Or is recon work where you dont find anything irrational?

but if they didn't expect the soother stations from the start they had to lack brain cells. How can you use a singular strategy for recruitment and propaganda and then not anticipate your vastly overequipped enemy has been doing the same thing only with better resources and more reinforcements?

I dont remember ever hearing that they were surprised, they were planning on that all along.

Another piece of stupidity is forming the army at all - it's a huge long shot and he knows it. But it's not even a moderately successful long shot. The soldiers help out exactly zero times in the story, but distract from more fruitful endeavors like destabilizing the Noble Houses and hitting high priority targets.

Killing a king doesnt make you king, it makes whomever has the largest army king, after the fighting is done. The second book

For a more concrete example of the Idiot Ball, the moment when he puppeteers that soldier in the cavern is top tier stupidity. There's a fine line between a morale boost and inflating your own ego, and that crossed it. He acknowledges it was a mistake later, but that doesn't really matter, because in a piece of rational fiction the main character doesn't make the first mistake that would raise dramatic tension, they make the third or fourth.

You are saying that middle of a fight, he should act with perfect forthought at all times? When watching an ally getting stabbed, when you have a magic power to stop it, stopping it is perfectly rational. He had very little time to stop and consider.

and inflating your own ego is perfectly within reason when your longstanding motivation is to set yourself up as the martyr that spurs your people into action.

from the sound of it I think the problem you are having is that everyone isn't perfectly acting in their best interests

I will admit that drawing on the mists would be a horrible thing if it actually happened at the end of the story and not the end of the first third.
