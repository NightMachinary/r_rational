I hesitate to believe you can make converts with long-winded lectures, but-'

The mist power she draws on at the end of the first book is not adequately foreshadowed for a stand-alone. Mist is described mystically, and The Lord Ruler's abilities are partially indicated but perhaps not as tantalisingly as they could have been.

But viewing the trilogy as a single work, the foreshadowing and partial construction step by step create a fairly large number of climaxes. The final battle, and the Superman-esque abilities whipped out for the first time rub me the wrong way in large part because those powers we're somewhat rational based upon the power rules, but the people able to use those powers are immediately withdrawn from the world basically bt the word of God.

If you establish self-consistent magic, and have your main characters eventually abuse it to the fullest extent, you shouldn't immediately remove that potential at the conclusion, in the sequel series.
