Every single character in the first book takes a turn with the idiot ball can you give an example?

the final battle is decided by a power that was never foreshadowed

It was foreshadowed a couple times. "he is the only one powerful enough to wear metal in him, and everyone else imitates his fashion". The multiple discoveries of new metallurgic arts, the attempt to genocide his people and keep his power a secret. It would have been an idiot ball if he left his power source laying aroung.

The main character goes through the stations of the plot without any consideration or thought their motivations. (Which main character? Both.)

No, seriously, which one? Kelsier, who is fighting a corrupt king not for his people, but out of petty revenge for his wife? Vin, who had no real reason to fight, except everyone she ever had treat her kindly was in the rebellion, and thus fought for her friends?

Lets put aside "i dont buy the character development"

he comes back for the final arc, the middle part having essentially zero relevance save for the introduction of Elend Venture.

Judging what is relavent a third of the way through a story is an interesting trick. Most if not all of that is relavent through the rest of the series.
