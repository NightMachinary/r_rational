Just one thing regarding the deus ex machina drawing in mist thing, I think it works better when you read the whole trilogy as one continuous story. How and why that happened out of the blue all of a sudden serves as mystery for the second book and a critical part of the resolution of the last book. It itself serves as the introduction of that ability, to prevent a deus ex machina in the overarching story. Brandon has a habit of building stories on a larger scale like that, and while it's not an excuse for a first time reader or for anyone who ends up not getting hooked and reading on, but it's possible you'd feel differently about it when you know the full context.

This also sort of applies to Kelsier in the grand scheme of things, and that's all I'm going to say about that.

That all being said, as far as deus ex machinas go, this one was fairly mild. Vin already put together all the clues together and found the solution. The mystery was solved. All she needed was that extra push of power to actually pull it off.
