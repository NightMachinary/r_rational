So with the idiot ball thing, let's start with Vin. Vin spends the middle third of the book in this weird state of cognitive dissonance where she denies the crimes of the nobility she's come to see as normal, only to come to the sudden revelation that they were really slimy all along - except for Elend, who is probably the most nuanced noble in the entire first story (not that it says much). My first question is why? Why did she infiltrate the nobility instead of doing literally anything else? She's Mistborn, not to mention less experienced. If you need a girl that fits the bill of a country yokel in order play Valette, why use her instead of some other peasant off the streets that's better at acting (And less likely to FALL IN LOVE with a random member of the country's tyrannical ruling class. No matter how it turned out in the end, it still had the potential to go ass-backwards.) It's not like keeping an untrained Mistborn as your infiltrator makes her somehow more resistant to torture and capture. The way I see it Kelsier spends most of the book tying up a major combat asset in useless busywork. And why does Vin suddenly forget all of her trust issues in the middle of the story? I can understand her loosening up around Kelsier and co. after a little bit of time, but the nobles look and act the antithesis of her personal philosophy, at least until she slips into her "mask". It feels to me like Sanderson just wrote that in because in stories people who are exposed to power get corrupted by it, so it's only obvious that Vin would /completely ignore/ her impoverished roots. And to rub things in, the only thing of any import Vin learned is that House Venture was responsible for those special mines. To make things worse, Vin doesn't make use of this information in a tactical way at all!

Kelsier time. Any plan that results in your own Martyrdom is idiotic by default, because there are literally a million other ways things can go down. It's implied in the story that the reason he needed to do this is because the Lord Ruler has soother stations, but if they didn't expect the soother stations from the start they had to lack brain cells. How can you use a singular strategy for recruitment and propaganda and then /not anticipate/ your vastly overequipped enemy has been doing the same thing only with better resources and more reinforcements? For a more concrete example of the Idiot Ball, the moment when he puppeteers that soldier in the cavern is top tier stupidity. There's a fine line between a morale boost and inflating your own ego, and that crossed it. He acknowledges it was a mistake later, but that doesn't really matter, because in a piece of rational fiction the main character doesn't make the first mistake that would raise dramatic tension, they make the third or fourth. Another piece of stupidity is forming the army at all - it's a huge long shot and he knows it. But it's not even a moderately successful long shot. The soldiers help out exactly zero times in the story, but distract from more fruitful endeavors like destabilizing the Noble Houses and hitting high priority targets.

There's more, but you get the point. I haven't even gotten into the meta-stupid stuff, that is to say the dumb ideas that only worked because the Lord Ruler's system was inefficient in some unexplained way. But let's get to the elephant in the room: the deus ex machina at the end. This is less important than the others in the book because I understand it's elaborated upon later. I wasn't talking about the metal piercings - that part was clever. I was talking about the fact that Vin "draws on the mist" in order to gain the power necessary to exploit that weakness. As far as I know that had no precedent or explanation in the first book.

The reason I didn't elaborate in my first post is that there's so much to get into, and I'm never going to talk about it all unless I write a dedicated review, and that review would probably be longer than the book itself. Just trust me when I say I've barely scratched the surface.
