As much as I enjoyed it, /Mistborn/ is about as rational as a dog with Alzheimer's. Every single character in the first book takes a turn with the idiot ball, the final battle is decided by a power that was never foreshadowed, and the twist with the Lord Ruler is like one story-long version of "the butler did it". The main character goes through the stations of the plot without any consideration or thought their motivations. (Which main character? Both.) Vin in particular is replaced with a completely different character going by the same name in the middle portion of the story, and I don't buy the "character development" that takes her there. She comes back for the final arc, the middle part having essentially zero relevance save for the introduction of Elend Venture. The only thing rational about it is that the author doesn't treat the enemy like a total pushover. (By making the main characters too stupid to challenge him on even terms until Deus Ex Sazed)

I've only read the first book so far, but I don't see this getting better in the rest of the trilogy. Not that I won't, mind, just that calling the book "rational" couldn't be further off.
