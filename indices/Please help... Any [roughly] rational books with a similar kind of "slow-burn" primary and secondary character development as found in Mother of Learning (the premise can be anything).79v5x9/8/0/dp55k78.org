I agree the Arithmancer is a good recommendation, but Lady Archimedes fell off a bit for me. The Arithmancer was a lot of Hermione still learning and experimenting to figure things out. LA was more "Hermione knows a ton and is a magical badass who can make up spells practically off the top of her head." It's still good, but I enjoyed the original's pacing quite a bit more.
