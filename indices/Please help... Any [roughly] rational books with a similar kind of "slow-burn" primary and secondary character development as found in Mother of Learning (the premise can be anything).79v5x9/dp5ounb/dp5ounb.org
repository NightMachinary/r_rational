Pokemon: The Origin of Species, by [[/u/daystareld][u/daystareld]], is definitely slow, and character development is a big deal. It's rationalist, not just rational, so character actions and growth really have to make sense. A somewhat gentler touch than HPMoR, though; just as many demonstrations of how to think better, less angst at the world's inferiority.
