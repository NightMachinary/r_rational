I think Worth the Candle might be a good candidate. I'm not sure I'm attracted to it for the same reasons I like MoL, but it's compelling.

On the other hand, Saga of Soul is phenomenal and definitely what you're looking for, and I think there are around 60-80 chapters, but it's been dead for years, so you have to take what you can get.
