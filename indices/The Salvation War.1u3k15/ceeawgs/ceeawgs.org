Unfortunately, part three- /The Lords of War/- looks like it'll never be written. But don't despair! There's more! Err, a page more. [[http://bbs.stardestroyer.net/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=128314][*Don't Wake Me While I'm Quiet]] has been canonized, but even then insanely tiny. Sigh.

ETA: They're also readable [[http://bbs.stardestroyer.net/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=118771][here]] and [[http://bbs.stardestroyer.net/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=134719][here]], but they require a log-in.
