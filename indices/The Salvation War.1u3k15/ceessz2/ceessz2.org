I personally enjoyed this story quite a bit, but I know that lots of people found it to be dull and wanky. There isn't much conventional tension, and the conclusion is never in any doubt. The central conflict isn't the war between hell and earth; The central conflict is a civilization encountering and adapting to something completely outside its frame of reference.

/The Salvation War/ shares some fundamental properties with [[http://www.stardestroyer.net/Empire/Fanfic/Conquest/][/Conquest/]], which was also [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/1thq65/conquest_star_wars_vs_star_trek/][recommended]]. They're both strategic, political stories with completely unbalanced factions. They don't really focus on character drama, but /Salvation War/ does have more stronger characters, and is better written overall - but it's also much longer. If you enjoyed /Conquest/, you'll enjoy /Salvation War/. If you didn't, and you can't imagine how it could have been good without major rebalancing, you won't enjoy /Salvation War/. If you think /Conquest/ could have been good, give /Salvation War/ a shot.
