The opening needs work. The very first sentence sets the mood and tone for the rest of the novel, and I found that "Seth rang the doorbell, and Justin opened the door, a baby on his shoulder" set a very bland tone, which carried through the entire part of the conversation where Mary was present.

I really enjoyed it once it became clear that this wasn't actually a mundane story of a brother trying to connect with his father's illegitimate children. The discussion about ethical use of power was great, and the ending was something I didn't see coming, but in retrospect, something I felt I /should/ have, which is the very best sort of ending.

But, yeah, the opening /really/ drags, and I honestly only kept reading because I felt certain that no one would write a story that was that bland all the way through.
