As a counterpoint, I love how Alicorn's stories often feature "mundane" situations, which provide a background for exploring complicated moral questions or developing clever ideas. Also, it's always interesting/fun trying to notice the discrepancies between our world and the fictional setting of the given story, that gradually appear, to try to understand the setting. Reading from the perspective of (initially/temporarily) normal inhabitants, who view their often (from our point of view) weird world as normal, underlines the strangeness of the world, as "exciting" people always have unusual lives. Plus, I find it endearing that not every story has to be about somebody trying to conquer or optimise the world (not that Alicorn's work is lacking in that...).

In the case of this particular story, the exposition of the setting is valuable IMO. Additionally, if you re-read the story, many of Seth's seemingly innocent or even inane comments and thoughts, are now rather ominous.
