It's not the "mundane" that I mind; it's the "bland." This story, how it started out, could have been about a hereditary genetic defect (it kinda was), and I would have had exactly the same criticism.

I just don't get the sense, reading the first section, that the main character /wants/ anything out of this. He's meeting with this newfound relative... because. Just "because." Of course, it later becomes apparent that he /does/ have a reason for visiting, something he wants from his half-brother, but that doesn't show through at all.

Now, given the format of the story , /exactly/ what he wants isn't going to be revealed to the reader right away. But the fact that the MC wants his brother to do him a favor, to make a sacrifice, to help him with a project, or the fact that there is a family secret or genetic condition that the brother needs to be informed of... Any of that would give a hook to pull the reader along, to say, "Keep reading, something interesting is coming!"

Eventually, interesting things happen, but, if you don't set the hook early enough, a reader might not get to that part of the story. I almost didn't.
