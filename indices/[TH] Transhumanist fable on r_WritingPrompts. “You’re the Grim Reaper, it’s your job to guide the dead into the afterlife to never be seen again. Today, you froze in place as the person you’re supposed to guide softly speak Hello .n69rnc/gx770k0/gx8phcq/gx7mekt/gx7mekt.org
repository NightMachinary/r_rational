I'm a stickler for the metaphor so I wonder what this would look like with the classical interpretation of the four horsemen: Conquest on White ("conquering, and to conquer"), Slaughter on Red ("that they should kill one another"), Famine on Black, and Death on the Pallid Horse. Probably Famine would be first to go?
