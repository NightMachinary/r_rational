It'd be interesting to read a sequel/alternate, where the Reaper reaps the last thing in the universe which could be considered "life", but is still surrounded by leftover constructs of civilization which are sapient or super-sapient in and of themselves.

Would Death have to stick around until the universe itself ran out of energy, and thus the potential to accidentally recreate life, no matter how lowly? Or would he be able to hang up the cloak and scythe, put the chairs on the tables, and switch off the light as he left?
