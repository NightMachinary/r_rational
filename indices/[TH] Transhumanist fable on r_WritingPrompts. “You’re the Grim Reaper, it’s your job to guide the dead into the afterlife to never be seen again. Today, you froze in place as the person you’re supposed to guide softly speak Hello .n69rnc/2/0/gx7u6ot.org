Is Red as Slaughter really the classical interpretation? I thought that Red was /Civil/ War (as opposed to White's imperialistic War Of Conquest), hence "that they should kill /one another/".

And if one takes this view, then War of Conquest is already on the way out in our time. Unless we suppose that there is alien life to be cnquered, it'll be long dead by the time humanity gets its act together well enough to end famine and disease; in an enlightened age any war between human factions would be more of a Civil War than any kind of "War of Conquest" as the Greco-Roman world would have understood it. So, had a horseman of Conquest existed in the world I sketched out in my ministory, they would quite probably have been the first Horseman to go.
