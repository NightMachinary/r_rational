Both Slaughter and Civil War were common readings, AIUI. Slaughter is more, hmm, thematically resonant, so I prefer it.

I don't think Conquest is going to die any time soon. We have reined it in somewhat, but that mostly just means that it has to either pretend not to be conquest (Russia w.r.t. Abkhazia, South Ossetia, and Crimea) or be groups which flout international norms (ISIS). Conquest will be multi-planetary unless there's a successful singleton established before that /and/ it prevents violent struggle within its hegemony.
