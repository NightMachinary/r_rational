Aaah, I see the confusion. My artistic vagueness comes to bite me in the rear... The Moon as a celestial object was not destroyed. I was trying to suggest that the /first human colony on the Moon/ had been wiped out recently (presumably by a plague outbreak of some kind), and this is what warranted a ride of the last two Horsemen --- much as it would have been the deaths of the Romans themselves which summoned them to the Fall of Rome, not any loss of physical real estate incurred.
