The timeline implied is:

Fall of Rome, t=0

End of War, time unknown but before the End of Pestilence

End of Pestilence, t=3000-4000 years

End of Famine, time unknown but after the End of Pestilence

End of Earth, not explicitly stated to be after the End of Famine but implied.

Humanity forgets the location of Sol, unknown time but presumably after the End of Earth

Death takes the Horses for walkies in the empty void where Earth formerly orbited, on the spot on its surface where Rome formerly stood. Many centuries after the Fall of Famine, probably much later.
