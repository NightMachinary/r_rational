  Rename it to The Dark Wizards of Donkerk. Similar title, feels less generic, and suggests emphasis on the world and the society rather than a character-driven plot.

Really disagree with this one. /Wizards/ sounds a lot more campy and would make me less likely to read it. The singular makes the reader think, wait which one is the dark wizard, is it the boy, is it the teacher, is it the prince, etc.
