I like the title too. It made me think about Sophia's sacrifice near the end.

Is she the dark wizard because she sacrificed the crown to cast a spell? Or is it because she sacrificed her brother's life to save the kingdom? Or maybe Henry is right, and there is no difference between those two and sacrificing a cow so we can eat steak?
