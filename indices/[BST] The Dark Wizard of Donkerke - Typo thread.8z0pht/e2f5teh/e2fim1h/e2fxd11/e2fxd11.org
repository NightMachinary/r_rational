  Removing the prophecy entirely, for reasons you've already talked about. It's a crutch, it derails character motivations, most characters already have plausible reasons to do what they're doing (eg Henry could be going to the Important Place to retrieve his birth certificate).

The prophecy drives a part of Sophia's relationship with her father. It also sets the scene for the story in general. It seems like this would be a really big change to remove, doesn't it?

#+begin_quote
  Delay the realization that Fiona is Sofia a bit longer. It'd add some tension, make their relationship a bit more organic, and make Henry look less self-indulgent. (though it's not a major problem in the first place)

I kind of liked this the way it is now, personally. It motivates Henry to go with her in a way that might seem odd or forced otherwise, and makes for a fun tension in their travels.
