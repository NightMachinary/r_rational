  The prophecy drives a part of Sophia's relationship with her father. It also sets the scene for the story in general. It seems like this would be a really big change to remove, doesn't it?

Things that are driven by the prophecy, that I remember:

- Ventor learns about Henry's kidnapping.

- A scene that shows how the sages work, where they dissect the prophecy.

- The King locks up his daughter.

- Ventor goes after Henry when Sofia disappears.

- Henry meets Sofia, they talk about the prophecy.

Of all these, nÂ°4 seems to be the hardest to justify without the prophecy. On the other hand, the King's relationship with his daughter already makes sense without a prophecy, just based off her being kidnapped as a kid.
