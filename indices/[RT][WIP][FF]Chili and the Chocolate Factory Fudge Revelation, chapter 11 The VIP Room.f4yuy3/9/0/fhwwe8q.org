I thought it was a reference to this line from Ch. 8:

#+begin_quote
  The sky was a dark gr[redacted]y col[redacted]r.
#+end_quote

which is a joke about British vs. American spelling. No one knows whether Wonkaland is in England or America, so they don't know whether the sky is a "grey colour" or a "gray color".
