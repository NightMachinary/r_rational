Order demons seem to basically have "editing privileges" on creation, turn various physical laws on and off, etc. By analogy I imagine that the higher level demons have more expanisve abilities like being able to create new things from nothing, or delete them entirely. Then maybe when you get really really high you start being able to change the fundamental laws of the world globally and permanently, not just distort them in certain areas.
