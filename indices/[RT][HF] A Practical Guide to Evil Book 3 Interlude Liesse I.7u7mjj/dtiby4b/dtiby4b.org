Does anyone understand the layout of the battle? Is the remaining central bastion behind the field of undead and the pit in the middle of it? Where exactly are the demons? Are the wights that turned into a formation those in the field or behind the bastions?

I'm just trying to understand whether Masego's multi-track warding will fuck over the legions or the wights.
