"... Friction is there where there should be none."

Oh hell, if you can capture an Order Demon, rip out it's aspects and reverse engineer them you can literally become a capital G God.

The very first application I thought of was creating a goddamn perpetual motion machine. I mean the reason why that is not possible in our world is because dissipative effects (like friction) dissipate some of the energy placed into a system. So you'll never get 100J of Work for 100J of Heat supplied in most processes you encounter IRL.

A Magineer who reversed engineered an Order demon would laugh and flip off such paltry "guidelines". Superconductors, bullet train carts, high powered artillery shells... the the list goes on. I wonder if those glorified lawn ornaments in the sky employed such a method to gain their technological superiority?

And an Order Demon isn't even at the Top of the Demon Hierarchy! By Cthulhu I cannot wait to see how a Tier 1 Demon functions...
