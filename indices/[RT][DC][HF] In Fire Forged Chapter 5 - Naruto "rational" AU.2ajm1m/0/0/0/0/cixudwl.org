I suspect you're entirely right. In fact, my original plan called for me to write the entire story first (or at least, the first volume), and then post it all fairly quickly as I got it all edited (mostly because I despise abandoned fiction - it's a tragedy, and I didn't want to do it to any potential readers). I changed that plan a while back and just got it out there instead.

It's definitely something I'm keeping in mind for the future arcs and volumes. The entire beginning arc of volume two has already been rearranged drastically to get into gear much quicker, for example. That being said, I think this first arc in particular would be difficult to truly rearrange to segue into the larger "myth arc" (I'm doing that as fast as I possibly can, believe me) - the team selection>bell test>D-ranks>etc beginning is an almost holy format that serves to introduce the changes in a familiar way; there are forms to follow in Naruto that I feel like I need to at the very least afford passing nods. In the future, I'm going to have much more free hands to arrange things as I like.

On an aside note, I never did call it an act. I called it an arc - I... /think/ there's a difference? Though I'm not sure it makes your complaint invalid - I do see your point.
