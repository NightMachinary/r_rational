Pretty good chapter. My only concern is that with not much happening this chapter (though we do find out that roofies are still a thing. Watch your drink, girl!), and the next one being interlude, the pacing might suffer a bit. It kinda feels like this arc didn't have a real conclusion - rather it's just setting a couple threads up, but doesn't close anything.

One'd think the fight vs the Uchicha would be a better closing scene in the act, but that might or might not fit your plans.

In general, I remain optimistic towards this story. Keep up the good work!

(I'd post a review but can't log in to ff since they stopped supporting + in emails ;_;)
