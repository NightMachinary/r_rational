I'm hoping the interlude won't be seen as slow - certainly, I think it should prove very interesting for people. It's true that this arc doesn't close anything off, and it was honestly never meant to; it's an opening, and that's basically it.

It may seem long now, but the beginning is very short in comparison to the rest of the story - we're only /just/ barely getting started. When I initially thought out the story structure, it didn't feel like an issue to me because the beginning was so "short". Maybe that was a mistake on my part, but that is as it is, now.

Hopefully, though, you'll soon start seeing the payoff that I've been anticipating and planning (and sense the reasoning behind it), as all this setup begins to play out throughout the volume and later the entire trilogy as a whole. I've been aching to write the next arc in particular for a very long time, now! :D
