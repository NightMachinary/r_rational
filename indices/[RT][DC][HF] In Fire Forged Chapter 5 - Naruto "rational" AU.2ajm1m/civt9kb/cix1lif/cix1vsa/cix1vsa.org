Right. I think you're hitting one of difficulties while writing serial fiction. Compared to the entire thing as you currently envision it, and for the reader that comes later when more of the story is written, the opening might in fact be just fine.

The live reader, getting a chapter every two weeks, has a significantly different perspective.

I think a good comparison here would be the first act of [[http://parahumans.wordpress.com/][worm]]. It has a similar number of chapters (6), and is the opening to a larger story, but within itself it also has a clear opening - build up - climax - resolution progression. We are introduced to the MC, see her take the first steps in the parahumans world, and wrap up with a big fight that resolves the most immediate problems (and creates twice as many new ones, of course).

Now, don't let this discourage you. I'm still enjoying the show! Just think this might be worth keeping in mind.

Edit: I suppose the other perspective is - if you didn't call it an 'act', I'd be totally fine :P An act with no resolution at all seems misnamed.
