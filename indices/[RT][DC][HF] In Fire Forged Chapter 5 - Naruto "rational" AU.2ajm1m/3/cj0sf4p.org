Very nice chapter, I liked it a lot. I liked her interaction with her father. I liked the talk about seals of course, though it does slow down the chapter a bit, especially in combination with the training and the talk with dad, all of which was slow. I think the chapter would be improved hugely by having something action-y or tense-y happen in between the training with Ino and the dinner. Now it's "first we have a scene where Sakura talks to Ino while training. Next, we have a scene where Sakura talks to Ino... while having supper!" :P

(I would have liked some description of how Sakura actually goes about earth chakra molding -even just one line explaining how she chooses to mold earth rather than regular chakra- but this is more my personal preference than something crucial to the story.)
