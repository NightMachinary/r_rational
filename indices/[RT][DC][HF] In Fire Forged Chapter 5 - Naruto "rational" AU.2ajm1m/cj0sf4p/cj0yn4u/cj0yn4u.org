I tried to think of something, but in the end it would simply have been action solely for the sake of action, which I wasn't a fan of. Originally there was a part where Team Seven assisted the police with busting a drug operation and dished out some ol' regular asskicking, but in the end that one didn't work out, so it got trashed along with most of the original chapter five.

I swear, for every word that's been uploaded, there've been two or three words written already that didn't make the cut! :D
