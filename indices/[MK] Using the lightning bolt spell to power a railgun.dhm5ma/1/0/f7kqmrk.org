It'd certainly make it easier to treat the railgun as a fixed-emplacement lightning-bolt maximizer or booster. A caster with sufficient weapons knowledge (or teaming up with someone with that knowledge) can effectively fire a five-fold (or whatever) strength lightning bolt for the same mana cost... as long as they're crewing the gun and the gun is sufficiently undamaged.

You might also have some factor along the lines of the gun can be fired at a fixed target as fast as there are mages able to dump lightning spells into it... as long as it doesn't need to be retargeted or the vessel it's on doesn't move. Targeting (or retargeting) might take a round or so.
