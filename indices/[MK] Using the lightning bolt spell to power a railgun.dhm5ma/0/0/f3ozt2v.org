It seemed that the main factor is the fact that the lightning bolt has enough energy to kill a human on contact. 8d6 damage is an average damage of 28, and if an average human is assumed to have 10 HP, that's easily enough to be lethal. By comparison, actual lightning bolts have a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_injury][listed mortality rate of 10-30%]], and are estimated to contain a gigajoule of energy.

Yes, there is likely some secondary element of magic channeling the electricity into a line, and yes, a single lightning bolt spell likely wouldn't be enough power for a grand ship-mounted railgun. But even a small fraction of that power would make a terrifying siege weapon in a fantasy setting.
