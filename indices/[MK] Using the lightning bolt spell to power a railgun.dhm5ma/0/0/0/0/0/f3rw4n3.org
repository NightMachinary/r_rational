I think the most important question to resolve is the targeting, lightning is just electricity grounding itself, and the lightning spell doesn't ground itself on the first target let alone before it reaches the first target. So depending on how targeting is achieved, leading a charge around by creating a path of minimal resistance, or creating a set of positive/negative charges that annhilate each other, then lethality would probably be a matter of making sure the spell targets the heart.

None of this really relates to voltage or wattage. I do mechanical/technical work and I was talking to an ex HVDC electrician a few months ago, and he showed me a picture he took on a job site where a kid accidentally grounded a high voltage transformer or something from his shoulder to the back of his skull, blew the back of his skull right off and simultaneously cauterized the exposed brain, the kid lived but got knocked out.
