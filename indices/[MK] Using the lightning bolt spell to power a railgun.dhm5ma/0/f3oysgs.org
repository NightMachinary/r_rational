It's not well-defined. The spell does the same amount of damage to creatures of different sizes or different chemical makeups.

And it's "100 feet long and 5 feet wide"? Huh?

Each part of the description either gives contradictory information about how much energy is in the bolt, or else no information or extremely vague information.

You're not going to be able to come up with reasonable values, but my guesstimate is that it'll be totally useless as a railgun. [[https://www.popsci.com/military-aviation-space/article/2008-02/navy-tests-32-megajoule-railgun/][Real-world efforts are in the range of tens of megajoules of energy]], which seems like a lot more power than a lightning bolt spell.
