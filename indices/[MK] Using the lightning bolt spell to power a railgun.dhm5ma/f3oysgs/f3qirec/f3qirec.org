Getting clever with the tools available is such a staple of tabletop RPGs that I don't think you have any grounds on which to forbid this outright. The Rule of Cool is strong here.

Enough "realistic" analysis on the physics of lightning has been given, so I'll try to answer from another angle: Game balance. If your wizard is dumping a lightning bolt into firing the railgun, then the easiest call to make is for the railgun to also do 8d6 damage. The railgun mechanism just changes the description, not the numbers. But that's boring.

Mechanically, I would expect the railgun to change the damage type to piercing, and for it to require a ranged attack roll. If it's a standard fantasy setting, then /nobody/ is proficient with this new weapon, though your players could earn proficiency after they accidentally blow up an orphanage or two with it. Since the railgun projectile is very definitely NOT a magical effect, spell resistance doesn't apply anymore. The railgun got hit with the spell, not the target.

Beyond that, though, there's plenty of opportunity to tweak things. I'm not familiar with siege engine mechanics in D&D. Do they allow saving throws for half damage, or do you just have to hope your AC is up to the task? Given that deploying the railgun, loading it, and firing it will probably take a crew (I'm picturing the party ranger as the operator), it might be fair to give it a few more d6 of damage. Or since it allows someone else to make the attack roll for the wizard, take a d6 or two back. If they have access to bags of holding and can deploy the railgun just by turning the bag upside down and shaking it vigorously, it might be worth less damage.

You might simply have to adjust the rules as you go. Be upfront and honest with your players about it and let them know that you reserve the right to adjust the mechanics over time. I definitely want to hear how it works out though. Tell us all about the orphanges they blow up.

EDIT: I just realized, on a second reading, that this may have been a purely hypothetical question, and not related to an ongoing game. My "because game balance said so" post doesn't fit so well the rational-fic virtues this subreddit strives towards. I leave this comment here as a monument to my own lack of reading comprehension.
