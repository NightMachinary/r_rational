Lightning bolt duration is instantaneous, so it doesn't last long enough to power a rail gun. The gun simply fails to fire. No you can't get around it by adding energy storage mediums because they need time to charge as well. You'd need something with a duration (maybe there's a version that sets up a field lasting x rounds).

As for how effective it would be, the way d&d rules work I'm pretty sure it is exactly as effective as an ability of an equivalent level to the spell being used to power it.
