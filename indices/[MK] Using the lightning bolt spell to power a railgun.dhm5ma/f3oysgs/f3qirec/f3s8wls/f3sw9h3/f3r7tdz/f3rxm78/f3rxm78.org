The premise of this idea is that a lightning bolt is an inefficient way to use energy to kill people, since people get struck by the ludicrous amount of energy in a lightning bolt and survive the impact a majority of the time. So yes, converting the electrical energy into kinetic energy wouldn't increase the total energy available, but makes the energy much more efficient for causing damage (as it's in the form of a kinetic projectile instead of ionized particles that pass through the victim).
