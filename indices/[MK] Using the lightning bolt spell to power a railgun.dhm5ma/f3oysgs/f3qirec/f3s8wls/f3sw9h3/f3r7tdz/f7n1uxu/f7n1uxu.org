Personally I assume things like this are going on "behind the scenes" all the time with spells, wizardry is always described as very complex so I assume if you piece apart the spell matrices and interpret them through modern physics you'd find stuff like ionization paths and low pressure zones and such like to get the most out of every spell meaning further optimization would be difficult and require wise mage... But that isn't actually relevant since it would be optimized for casting without tools. I guess what I'm saying is that an isekai wouldn't necessarily be necessary, infact I could imagine a whole class of reverse magic wands, semi mundane items that can produce a major effect if used with a variant of a common spell. So in this case something like

Magnetic tuning fork: A complex cradle of metal and rubber with two long rods of an unusual alloy, when a specialty metal slug is placed in the cradle, after turn of uninterrupted focus is used to aim it the wizard using it can use a variant of Lightning Bolt to propel the metal slug. *Insert stats about range, damage and accuracy*

Cold condenser: A system of glass vials, tubes and valves with which a wizard can over an hour and after casting a specialized version of Cone of Cold condense a clear smoking liquid out of the air into specially made metal vials. *Insert stats about damage uses and utility uses*

Rod of the Seige Mage: A heavy, stocky metal tube, a wizard can use a specialized version of Fireball of the 4th level or higher to launch a Fireball of one level lower to 10 times the normal range using this object.

Further delaying vial: A ceramic vial rapped with metal bands and using 10GP worth of rubies in crafting. A wizard can use these to contain a delayed blast fireball without using concentration indefinitely though each has a 1 in 20 chance to detonate every hour a wizard doesn't spend a turn suppressing it. If shattered the spell ends immediately with normal effects with an additional 1d12 piercing damage.
