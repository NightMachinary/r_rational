A quick Wikipedia skim indicates that an average [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvesting_lightning_energy][lightning bolt]] "carries a relatively large amount of energy (approximately 5 billion joules). However, this energy is concentrated in a small location and is passed during an extremely short period of time (microseconds); therefore, extremely high electrical power is involved. 5 billion joules over 10 microseconds is equal to 500 trillion watts. Because lightning bolts vary in voltage and current, a more average calculation would be 10 billion watts." (10 000 megawatts).

Currently, "it would require 25 megawatts to propel a projectile to the desired maximum range (i.e., to launch 32MJ projectiles at a rate of 10 shots per minute)" with a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railgun][railgun]].

From what I can [[https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-voltage-and-amperage-of-an-average-lightning-bolt][find]] "the peak current for over 98% of all cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning strikes ranged between 5 kA - 200 kA", so that's 5000 to 200 000 amperes. A railgun needs 6 million amps of current.

This means some kind of capacitors would need to be used.
