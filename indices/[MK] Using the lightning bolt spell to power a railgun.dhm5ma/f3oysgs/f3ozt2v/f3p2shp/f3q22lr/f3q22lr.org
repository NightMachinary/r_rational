Good point, lethal =! more energetic. It could just have a better voltage/amperage ratio to disrupt nervous systems(your biological pacemaker in particular). This would be a decent explanation for why most creatures get hurt the same, especially with all the intelligent creatures in DnD. For non-innervated creatures maybe it disrupts their innate magical "nervous system" or something.
