You're right that targeting is important, but I don't think it's the most important part. A lot of electrical shocks go through the heart incidentally, since most of the time the electricity will ground to the ground. So if it starts at your hand or head it's passing through your heart on it's route down. The most significant factor is how much damage it does to your heart and nervous system, which is determined by the overall energy and voltage/amperage.

You can look at some non-faraday cage magic tricks with tesla coils for examples of electricity with high energy tuned not to harm, or defibrillator's for low energy tuned to stop hearts.
