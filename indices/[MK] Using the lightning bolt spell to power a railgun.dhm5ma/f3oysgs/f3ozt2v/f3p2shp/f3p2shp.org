Being more lethal doesn't necessarily have to correspond to containing more energy. For all we know the lightning bolt spell has some additional magic woven into it that makes it more likely to hit vital organs or maybe it's more efficient in terms of how much energy it loses to the atmosphere.

Also note that the energy released by a lightning strike is not the same as the amount of useful energy you can get out of it.
