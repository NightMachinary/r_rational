Kinda makes you wonder if it'd be possible for a magic-user to create a lightning bolt spell which only needed a tiny bit of energy vs opponents for lethal or near-lethal results because it had a neural targeting component.

One-tenth the magic power, ten times the lethality. Far less destructive vs non-living targets, of course - it'd be more like a strong taser to the brain, heart, and spine than an actual lightning strike.
