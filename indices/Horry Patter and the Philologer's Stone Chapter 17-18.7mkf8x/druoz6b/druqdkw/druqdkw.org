Yeah, this is at least half my fault. Fanfiction.net was refusing to accept new chapters, so I had to edit an old document, and stick the text of the chapter in it. This screwed up all the formatting, so after I was halfway through fixing the formatting through (what will be parts 1-4), it was eaten by a failed update.

Then I ragequit and just posted what now is part 1, because I still had that saved. I may eventually rejoin them all into 1 chapter, but I didn't want to post /nothing/ yesterday. They've since fixed the updating bug.
