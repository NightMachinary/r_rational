These are short, but already tons to look at. It seems my prediction that Future!Horry removed Present!Horry's soul for some reason might be correct, though I suppose we don't know precisely when Horry's soul vanished. It sounded sort of like Horry's abuse at the hands of the...Durbleys? (I've forgotten them already) might have something to do with this.

In any case, Alvin feels he has already failed monumentally. Considering that we have /no idea at all/ what the grander conflicts in this story might be, this may or may not be a horrifically bad thing. The people of this world seem unusually attached to the idea that all of their actions are predecided, so I am unsure if Voltebort-he-who-must-be-named should be thwarted or not.
