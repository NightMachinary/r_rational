Alvin's eye can see the past. So, if on the rooftop future!Horry managed to swap souls with present!Horry, that likely explains Alvin's observance of Horry's soul suddenly disappearing and a new soul replacing it from nowhere. The soul lines are unbroken, they just cross a temporal boundary that Alvin can't see across.

Is present!Horry now a horcrux for future!Horry?
