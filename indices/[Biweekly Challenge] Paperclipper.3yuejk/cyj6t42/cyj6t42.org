This is a long one, probably needs to be pruned a fair bit. It's part of a rational Doctor Who setting I'm working on. The setting does away with a lot of canon (because honestly a lot of canon is idiotic) and this story shouldn't need any existing knowledge.

Just in case, a brief summary of the needed information: the Doctor is an immortal Time Lord from Gallifrey who travels in the Tardis, a time machine that appears in the form of a blue police box on the outside and like a space ship (of changing appearance) on the inside. Time Lords possess the ability to regenerate into a new body after death and the Doctor is (as far as he knows) the last of his kind, having permanently sealed Gallifrey away to end a terrible war.
