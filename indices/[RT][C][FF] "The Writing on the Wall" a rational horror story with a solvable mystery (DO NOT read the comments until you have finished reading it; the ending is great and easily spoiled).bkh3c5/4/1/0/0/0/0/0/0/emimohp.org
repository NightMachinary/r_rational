Spoiler tags let you black out spoilers so that they must click to be revealed, preserving surprising elements of the story so that they may be more fully enjoyed, and allowing people to opt into them. Their use is detailed in the sidebar, although they only work when the subreddit's CSS is loaded, and not for example on i.reddit.com.
