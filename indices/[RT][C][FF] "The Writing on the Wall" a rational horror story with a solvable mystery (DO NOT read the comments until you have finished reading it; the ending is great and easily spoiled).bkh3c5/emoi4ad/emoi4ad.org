--It occurs to me that, if you had an AI-containing supercomputer or a cold-sleep chamber or anything else that you had a strong need to stay untouched for a vast length of time, a secret inner chamber in such a place might be an /excellent/ hiding spot. Or rather, I could imagine myself thinking 'Isn't it even more likely that any really important things would have been hidden in the middle of all this, rather than elsewhere?' and wanting to send in people in lead-lined suits to check... (For which matter, presumably no evidence that there aren't such secret plans for these facilities in reality? Which now is better, low-security that no one knows about or high-security that everyone knows about, but without knowledge that there's something there...)
