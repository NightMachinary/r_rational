My hypothesis without spoilers and reading about halfway: it's an old radioactive dump site and they're trying to make it look as scary as possible to keep people away. I figure this because I've seen similar ideas in a youtube video about keeping vastly different future cultures away from our long-lasting radioactive waste.

Edit: Yup. Got it at "looking scary is the first line of defense for a lot of old tombs". I'm pretty sure the story was inspired by [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOEqzt36JEM][this]] or one of its sources.
