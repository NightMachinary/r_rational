A very good point--and whether they knew about it already or had to throw scientists and test-animals at it to develop protections, by the point they're taking the danger inside seriously the preparations have arguably fulfilled their role. Past that point, if they're willing to risk lives for it--especially if they're also stopping it from spreading outside while they're doing so--it's their choice if they want to poke around inside just in case we've hidden something there, rather than taking out word for it. The intention being to prevent 'tragic accidents' who would have been harmed by us if our warning methods were insufficient... yes.
