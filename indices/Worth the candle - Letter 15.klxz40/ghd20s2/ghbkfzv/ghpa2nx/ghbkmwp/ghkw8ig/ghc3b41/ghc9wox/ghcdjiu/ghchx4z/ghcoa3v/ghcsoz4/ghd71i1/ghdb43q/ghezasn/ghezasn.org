As you already know, she's dead and never bothered to tell any of them anything specific about the guard, so yes, they'd have to investigate if they wanted to do something about it.

Ultimately, it seems your position boils down to the fact that you can't accept anyone reacting to what she told him with anything but unbridled rage at the rapist, so I don't really see a point in arguing further. Just know that not everybody would react that way, some people (perhaps even most) would prioritize what the victim wants and what Fenn wanted he gave her.
