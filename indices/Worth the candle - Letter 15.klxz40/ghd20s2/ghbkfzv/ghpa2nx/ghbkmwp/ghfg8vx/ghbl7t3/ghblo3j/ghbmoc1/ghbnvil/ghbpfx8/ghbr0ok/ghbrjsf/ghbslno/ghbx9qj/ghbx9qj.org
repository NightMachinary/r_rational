Even if she wouldn't be against it, that's not really the question -- the question is what she actively wants.

There's a segment later in the story about how you might feel differently internally and externally about wanting people dead, and given the severity of the circumstances I'd say it's better to act in accordance with externally stated wishes and not take the risk by assuming internal ones and potentially being wrong.

When you assume someone's internal state to justify your choices like that, you're taking control away from them. That seems to me like something you don't want to do with victims.

You're quoting Chekhov's Gun.

My response to you would be that the story /does/ use the information -- the reveal (and ensuing discussion) serves to demonstrate that Fenn is making herself vulnerable to Joon (and trusts him), and beyond that it serves to inform her character and her attitude towards other events in the story going forwards.

The information is given in the story in service of character development and character relations, not to kick off a revenge arc. I wouldn't consider it an unfired gun at all.
