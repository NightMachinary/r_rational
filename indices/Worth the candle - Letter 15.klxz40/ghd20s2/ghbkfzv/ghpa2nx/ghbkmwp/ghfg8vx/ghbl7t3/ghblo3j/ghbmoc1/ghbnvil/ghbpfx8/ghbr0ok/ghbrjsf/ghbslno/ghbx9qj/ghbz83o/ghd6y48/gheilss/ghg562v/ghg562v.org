  Something is really wrong with you, this adamant defense of letting the rapist go unpunished and giving asinine reason why they should ignore it.

/Sheesh/. You're a font, no, a /relentless deluge/ of bad-faith argumentation. There are five dirty tricks in this sentence /alone/, and then you just /keep going/, more sentences, more posts, maintaining the same density throughout, and I feel like I could write an essay about each! I could analyse you /endlessly/.

I stand in awe, in reverence, in fear. Did you arrive at this level of mastery by study, or are you a natural?
