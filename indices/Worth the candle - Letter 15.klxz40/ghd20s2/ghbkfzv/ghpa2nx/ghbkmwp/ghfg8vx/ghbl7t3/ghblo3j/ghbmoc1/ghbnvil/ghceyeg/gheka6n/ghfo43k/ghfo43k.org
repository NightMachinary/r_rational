  Vigilante murder? How many people did Joon and company kill? Hundreds?
#+end_quote

Yes, and Joon /doesn't like it/. He quite frequently thinks about all of the people he kills, and the moral implications. Notably, he very rarely sets out to kill someone; they usually provoke him first (trying to kill him, kidnapping Amy, etc.). Even if a person "deserves it", Joon isn't going around killing every single bad person on Aerb. He's not the Punisher, even if they have comparable body counts.
