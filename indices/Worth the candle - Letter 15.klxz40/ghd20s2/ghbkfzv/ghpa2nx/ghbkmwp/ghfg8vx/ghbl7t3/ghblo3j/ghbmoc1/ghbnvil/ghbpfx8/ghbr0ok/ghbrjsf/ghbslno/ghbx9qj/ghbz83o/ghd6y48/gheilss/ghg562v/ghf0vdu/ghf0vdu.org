Sometimes life is messy. Not everything gets wrapped up with a neat bow, not every wrong gets addressed, and not every trauma is overcome. Worth the Candle is about that messier kind of life. Its about facing the fact that not everything can be resolved cleanly. That may not be your cup of tea, but it's a deliberate choice the story has made. It's not a flaw.

As for your supposed mistake you've pointed out, I'm pretty sure you are misunderstanding. To leave the bottle they need either Solace to use her druid magic or to use one of a few different entads they have to get out. A character without either of those things would indeed be trapped.
