WtC is, in large part, about trying to make power worth something when you /can't/ neatly counter the past traumas.

Singling out Fenn's rapist for revenge when she herself has other priorities? Her emotional wounds won't be neatly solved by a simple violent payback. Why should we be allowed to pretend otherwise? The story does address a different rape later on, in substantially more depth. But that later, more detailed rape-response is not "and now we've punished someone, so things are fixed."

Lots of stories have awful things happen, and then act like they can be neatly set right. But WtC isn't about un-breaking what's broken and un-scarring what's been scarred. WtC is all about the /other/ kind of getting past trauma.

That no-erasure attitude makes WtC more glum than I like at times... but also makes it meaningful and authentic.

Yeah, it could be frustrating that in this gamelike world, Fenn's unhappy past isn't reduced to a tidy kill-the-baddie quest. But that's key to WtC. In a genre full of "power = easy escapism," WtC lets me read the other side of it: "I have huge power, and I /still/ have real problems that power won't erase."
