I don't see what the point would be. They'd find this random loser guard--somehow--yell at him, snuff him with negligible effort, and then what? Get an insignificant amount of closure for something that happened years ago which that dead guy might not even have remembered? The reason it hasn't happened is that it wouldn't take the story anywhere interesting.
