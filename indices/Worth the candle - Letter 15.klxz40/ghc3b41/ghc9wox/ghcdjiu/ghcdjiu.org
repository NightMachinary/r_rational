The story is full of the inner monologue of the MC, so having a chapter for closure about this is simple.

It is important because the mc is supposed to "fix" Aerb, and letting loose a rapist that he can end in half a chapter is jarring.

Remember the chapter where he attacks the DM because of how messed up Aerb is? But now he doesn't go after a rapist? That makes him look like a hypocrite, whining about the DM but doing nothing now.

It is funny how many people are trying to justify that the mc doesn't hunt down the rapist, why is that? Are they in favor of the rapist or are they fanboying the story and don't like when I point out these things?

The rapist can be killed in half a chapter and the other half can be about Fenn having a catharsis.

Edit:

I skimmed a few chapters and now I know why, Fenn dies, so the author wanted to put a lot of drama for her story, but didn't want to invest more chapters in her, after all he was going to kill her off.

Now I know why, but it doesn't make it better.
