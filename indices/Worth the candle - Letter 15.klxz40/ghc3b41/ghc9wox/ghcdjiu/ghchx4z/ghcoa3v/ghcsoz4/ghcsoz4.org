I'm not trying to make an abstract argument about rape and justice, I'm trying to explain why it's not good for the story, qua story, to have Joon and company do this. It's simply hard to see how it could be written to be entertaining or compelling or take the characters in an interesting direction. At best you could have a one-paragraph aside along the lines of "also we had some downtime so we hunted down the guy who raped Fenn and threw him into the Gay Rape Demon exclusion zone and Fenn was very happy okay back to the story." Wronged woman gets powerful friends to avenge her is the literary equivalent of double-stuf Oreos.
