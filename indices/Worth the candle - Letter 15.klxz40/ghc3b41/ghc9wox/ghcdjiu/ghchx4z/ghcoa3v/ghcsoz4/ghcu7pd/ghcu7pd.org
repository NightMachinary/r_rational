I'm waiting for someone to make the connection.

But it seems no one sees it. The rapist was Poulus Cambria he was a soldier convicted for rape and send to zombieland that Mary killed.

So your argument that it is not interesting is moot, because the chapter was there from the start.

And a chapter killing a rapists is not compelling for you, for other people it may be.

Or are the flashback chapters that important? You can skip most of them without problem.
