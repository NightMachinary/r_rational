Something is really wrong with you, this adamant defense of letting the rapist go unpunished and giving asinine reason why they should ignore it.

Or are you a fanboy and can't take that something in this story isn't perfect?

You can't accept that the author messed up putting this in the story and you are searching for excuses?

There you go, another example that this novel you love so much isn't perfect.
