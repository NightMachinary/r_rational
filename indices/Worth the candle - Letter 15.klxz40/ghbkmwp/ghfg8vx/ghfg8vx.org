WtC is a story about story tropes. So I can kind of see how OP would think "hey, the story mentions a rapist, that's a Villain Signal, why aren't they doing something about it?"

But in real life, most rape victims don't want to be defined by the rape, and most rapists are the alarmingly typical product of screwed-up societies rather than distinctively evil cackling villains. And for Fenn's rape WtC mostly follows life, rather than tropes.

It didn't confuse me, unlike OP. But I could imagine a paragraph where Joon thought about a hypothetical revenge mission, both in terms of whether the DM means it as a quest hook and how Fenn would feel about it. Not because WtC sets us up to fetishize Fenn's rape as defining her - it doesn't, it's obviously way more concerned with her unhappy childhood among "proper" elves - but because there are other stories that would go that direction.

So why didn't AWales write in that paragraph? Maybe because "avenge a rape" is more of a trope in /films/ than in /games/. Personal revenge on random lowlifes who hurt your people? That's not a tabletop RPG thing. When you run a fantasy game, the party's Designated Villains are going to be people with interesting setting content - like the pureblood elves.
