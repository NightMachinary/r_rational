I can't speak for anybody else, but it never occurred to me that they would hunt down the rapist. Snuffing him wouldn't un-rape Fenn, it would mostly be gratification for the reader to see our heroes slap around somebody who deserves it (and who couldn't fight back--it would seem like a rather superficial pleasure for the reader, no more than a revenge fantasy). The subject of rape does come up again, just FYI, and it's major and consequential. Along with Joon's hangups about sex. TBH I wish it would address both subjects a bit less.

However, supposing Joon did find and hurt the rapist, well, it would require minimal effort for him to actually hurt the guy. As a gesture to Fenn, it would be roughly equivalent to going miles out of your way to buy somebody penny candy. Maybe she'd enjoy it, but the deeper issue is the harm it did to her psychologically, and hurting the rapist would, again, not resolve that. Also if you read her "read in case Fenn dies" letter, we find that she was explicitly trying to be a kinder--and less vengeful--person at the time she died. A more meaningful resolution, in story terms, would be for Fenn to try and help other women the guard hurt. Murder-justice is cheap.
