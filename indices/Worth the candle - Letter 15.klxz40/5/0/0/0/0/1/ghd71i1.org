You do remember they're on a quest to save all of Aerb, including trillions of people on the hells, a large number of which, I'll wager, are constantly being raped and worse? Sure, Juniper could've taken the time to go solve this one specific evil he knew about, but Fenn never asked it of him and they have bigger fish to fry. It seems like you think it's unforgivable of him not to go all white knight to get revenge for her when it's clear she didn't want it (she almost didn't even tell him) and he offered what she actually expected in return for her sharing: his full support and no condemnation.

Yes, rape is horrible and no rapist should be left unpunished, but when she didn't ask it of him, it's not his place to go all “tell me the name of this knave and I shall slay him!”.

Like I said before, the story still isn't over, it seems you already know of her death, but it's not impossible she might return. And even if she doesn't, it's not impossible that it might be addressed in another manner, for example (possible spoilers about content you might not have reached yet): Amaryllis currently has a great deal of power within Anglecynn, it wouldn't be impossible for her to discover where Fenn was arrested, which guards worked there back then and order some investigation into which of them were raping prisoners. Then have them sent to trial for their crimes. All of which would merit maybe a paragraph telling us that it happened in the background while Juniper was more preoccupied with saving the world.
