Investigate? I'm pretty sure that Fenn knows exactly where she was prisoner and who the guard is.

It's not to go all white knight, it is really easy for him to do it, but he won't, that only makes him a hipocrite. He accused the DM of being responsible of all the evils of Aerb and doing nothing to fix it, but now he ignores this rapist when he can deliver justice.

That means he is not better than the DM, even after hearing something like that he can easily ignore it, like nothing happened, that only shows a lack of care.

It is impossible to not go into a rage after hearing it.

People misunderstand that the opposite of love is hatred, it is indifference.

So showing so little emotion for something of this magnitude only shows how little he cares.

So what if he cry's a bit? So what if he gives her a hug? A normal person that cares about someone you love wouldn't be able to keep this composed, he would imagine what she's been through without being able to keep calm.

But he accepts it so easily, if it would be me my stomach would be churning I would not be able to sleep and I would be imagining some scumbag defiling Fenn without her being able to do anything.

Imagine the MC of Goblin Slayer being composed after what he saw, just ignoring it and living his life like nothing happened.

That unbridled rage is much more real than this piss poor reaction.
