It was stated that he was a rapist and the difficulty of convicting someone for rape because of the need of several witness.

If that dude was Fenn's rapist and in the future we know for sure then it was intelligent of the author, if not then giving Fenn that backstory is plain dumb.

A good story doesn't leave things inconclusive.

And all those flashbacks that doesn't matter don't hurt the pacing of the story?

That it hurts the flow is your opinion, if all those flashbacks don't do it one chapter to kill the rapist won't either, if he is still alive.

The author spoke about Chekhov's gun:

"Chekhov's gun is a dramatic principle that states that every element in a story must be necessary, and irrelevant elements should be removed. Elements should not appear to make "false promises" by never coming into play"

So putting such a backstory without conclusion is a "false promise"
