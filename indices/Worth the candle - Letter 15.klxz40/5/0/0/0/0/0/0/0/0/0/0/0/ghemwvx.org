That you think the flashbacks irrelevant shows that you don't understand what the author is going for here. This isn't supposed to be a standard isekai, and Joon's past is entirely relevant to the world born out of his ideas. Even when the flashbacks aren't critical to understanding why thing are the way they are (as with the unicorn), they generally have a thematic tie-in to the current action.

EDIT: Yes, you dragged me back in after I said I would drop it, congrats. But seriously, this is the equivalent of, I don't know, asking why Taylor from Worm doesn't go save Africa from parasites and malaria. Yes, that would make sense, but it's not that kind of story.
