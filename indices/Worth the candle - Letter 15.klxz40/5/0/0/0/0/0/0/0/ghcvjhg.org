Are you talking about the one dude Joon teamed up with around chapter four who tried to get himself taken along on the soulcycle instead of Joon, only to have Mary decide he was a fink and shoot him? That wasn't about the rape; AW made his crime rape so they'd pause and go "wuh-oh," Mary being a (sort of) vulnerable young woman, but the chapter as a whole would work about as well if the guy had been a bank robber who otherwise acted identically.

Taking time out for rape justice for Fenn would have contributed little to her or Joon's character while harming the flow/pacing/structure of the story.
