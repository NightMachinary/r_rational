And wouldn't it help other woman if the rapist is no more?

Or should she wait for the rapist to act again so she can comfort his victim?

Your great solution is to help the victims of the guard, and not stop the guard from raping them in the first place? Are you serious? That is your solution? This convoluted plan just to not punish the guard?

Would you leave alive a band of bandits that kill and rape just so you fell better about not killing them? Even if letting them live would cost the lives of innocents?

Cheap justice is still justice. You are trying to convince me that letting a rapist go unpunished is a good thing, and i will never accept that.

You are trying to convince me that women that are raped should endure it, that they should live with it, and i will never accept that.

That you are trying to convince me of such things make me wonder what are you thinking, is it that difficult to say that rape should be punished? Is it that hard?

It doesn't matter what asinine arguments you try to explain why it is a good thing that a rapist goes unpunished, i will never accept that.

Edit: I'm a bit harsh, but I'm sick of people trying to downplay the rapist, to try to justify why he should go unpunished.

That saying something as simple as the rapist should be punished, and there being a bunch of people that is trying to convince me that it is fine to let him keep raping because some silly arguments, that the victim doesn't want the rapist to suffer, or that taking justice with your own hands is a bad thing in a basically lawless world compared to Earth.
