First go to the authorities, if that doesn't works then you take it upon yourself.

And I don't think that I have to repeat that they aren't on Earth, that they have killed a lot of people, even some that don't deserve it as collateral damage.

So trying to use the morals, law and sensibilities of Earth is foolish.

And we all know that the probabilities of the authorities ignoring them is high.
