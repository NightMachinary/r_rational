Vigilante murder? How many people did Joon and company kill? Hundreds?

Are you serious? If you are trying to use Earth's morals in this story Joon would be a psychopath.

Stop trying to force Earth's Morals when it fits you, if you are so against murder why are you reading this story? They killed A LOT of people, and I don't see you whining about it.
