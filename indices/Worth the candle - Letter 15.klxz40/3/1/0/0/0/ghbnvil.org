I don't think this is true, and it seems like a pretty un-nuanced take.

You seem to suggest that the only reasonable reaction to learning about tragic history like this is to immediately demonstrate and signal how much you care, but that's kind of making it all about yourself and taking control of the situation/recovery away from the victim.

It would be one thing if Fenn asked for help taking revenge or whatever, but frankly it seems like overstepping boundaries to suggest that the only valid response to having vulnerable information shared with you is to aggressively take revenge to demonstrate that you care.

Even making the suggestion runs the risk of opening up old wounds that Fenn might not want to be forced to confront.
