Killing the rapist doesn't undo past wrongs.

Unless Fenn specifically states so, there is no reason to think killing the rapist makes her feel better.

As for the rapist going free and potentially committing more rapes; why care about this one specific criminal more than others? They could target other criminals where there is a better "effort to crimes prevented ratio". Im sure that specific criminal is unlikely to be right at the top of that list.
