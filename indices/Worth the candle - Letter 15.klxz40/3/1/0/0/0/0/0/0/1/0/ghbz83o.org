That is the problem, after he reads the letter he doesn't mention it, not even to say that he doesn't care what happened to her and he still loves her.

It is like the incident never happened, the focus is entirely on that she got a child.

I am not saying that they should only speak about the rape, but the story just drops the bomb and ignores it afterwards. Not even a inner monologue.

It feel like it doesn't matters, like someone tells you he was raped and the only think you say is" cool story bro"

She wants to take vengeance against the elves that wronged her, I assume that being raped is pretty high on the list of things to be angry about.

She is a person that killed a lot of people, I don't think that she is a weak victim, only that she got no form to retaliate.

I just feel that thinking that she just wants to forget it and do nothing about it feels like looking down on her, like she can only suffer without being able to do anything.

It feels like the rapist wins, there is no consequence for him, the victim has to live with it.
