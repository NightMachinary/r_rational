I thought his support was demonstrated pretty clearly.

Immediately after reading the letter Joon is depicted as weeping and needing time to get over the strong emotions he's feeling.

The focus on the child-solace is when he's speaking speaking with Amaryllis, with whom it would be inappropriate to talk about this with.

The following caps off the conversation with Mary:

  I know,” said Amaryllis. “And Fenn? Are you judging her?”

  “No,” I said. “I would tear apart the world for her.”

When he does see Fenn again (the very next chapter), the very first thing Joon does is reassure her and demonstrate his continued support of her:

  When the month was up and the door to the time chamber was finally reopened, I rushed out and found Fenn. There were no surprises waiting for me this time, only a slightly anxious-looking half-elf. I'd reread her letter, the heavy one, just so that I would have it in mind, and the hug I wrapped her in reflected what I felt.

  She'd been right that none of what she'd told me was the sort of thing that normally pinged at my instincts, and that there was a bad kind of damage, when it came to what I found compelling, but I was already in love with her, and all I could think was that I wished nothing bad had ever happened to her. There was a small part of me wondering if this was all somehow my fault, if every bad thing in her life was just set up in order to manipulate me. I was still trying my best to just live my life without second-guessing though.

  Loyalty Increased: Fenn lvl 26!

  “You're crushing me,” Fenn whispered into my ear. I relaxed my grip on her. “No,” she said. “It was good, more crushing please.”

  So we had our moment of reunion, and then went away from the others so we could talk.

  “You don't hate me then?” asked Fenn.

  “No,” I murmured. I was still holding her.

  “Well, good,” said Fenn. “Good. I should have told you. It felt like there were just some things that I needed to dance around, and --”

  “I understand,” I said. “I wish you didn't have to go in there, or that we could take some time together, or ... something.”

--------------

This seems to demonstrate pretty explicitly that he cares and still loves her.

The story leaves specific mentioning of the incident out because it's tactless -- mentioning it directly will just open wounds -- and seemed to me to do a pretty good job of showing how to show support for this kind of tragic event in someone's history.

The key quote imo is "I was already in love with her, and all I could think was that I wished nothing bad had ever happened to her. There was a small part of me wondering if this was all somehow my fault, if every bad thing in her life was just set up in order to manipulate me."
