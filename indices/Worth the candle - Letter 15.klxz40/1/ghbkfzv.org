That's not much of a spoiler warning, you can still see the next line from the subreddit. But in answer to your question, thus far the guy has never so much as had his name revealed, and for spoilery reasons I suspect he never will. However, as we've already established that the DM who's apparently responsible for everything terrible on Aerb will keep Joon from punishing him, the anonymous guard seems like small potatoes.
