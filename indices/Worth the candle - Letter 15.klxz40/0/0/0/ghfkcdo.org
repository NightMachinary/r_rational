This conversation would probably be more productive and enriching if you assumed good faith and didn't rephrase your opponents' points in the most uncharitable manner possible. That said, Joon's goal has always been to ascend to pseudo-divinity for the sake of healing the harms of Aerb, with death-of-baddies being ancillary to that and in some cases actively avoided. In fact, in later chapters, while the action continues, he goes out of his way to avoid solving problems by violence, even against people who certainly deserve some serious pain. There's still action--there's one hell of an extended duel sequence down the road--but there's also a growing recognition that he can't punch every problem to death, and that there's something unhealthy in rejoicing in the deaths of even genuinely bad people. If that's not your cup of tea, yes, you should probably avoid this story.
