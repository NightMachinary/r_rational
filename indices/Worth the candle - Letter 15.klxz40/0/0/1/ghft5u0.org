Joon isn't just letting evil happen. WtC, unlike a "slice of life", is showing Joon working towards power enough to fix everything that's wrong with the world. Then he can cure it all, from each individual unpunished crime to the billions being continually tortured in literal hell.

But WtC /doesn't/ let him line up his quests as perfect tidy cures for past suffering. Even the companion quests don't erase the bad days before. That's the key difference between WtC and the more trope-obedient stories it's deconstructing. Joon gets to gain unrealistic power, yes. He gets to be a huge hero. But he has to do realistic work to make that power and heroism emotionally fulfilling for himself and his people, with all his and their personal problems in the way.

Is the story flawed by Fenn mentioning her prison rape without making it a quest or focus? At most, only for not sneaking in a reminder to "rape is a Villain Signal" readers that in WtC, rape is just like other past suffering. It's something you build past, not something you tidily undo.
