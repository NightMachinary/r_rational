It's /always/ a good time to have an entire set of time-travel passwords. Some will only be accepted on certain days of the year, or certain years in the century, or at certain times of life. Others will only allow a holder of the password to declare themselves a genuine time-traveler but not be assumed to be telling any other truth (in case you need to give a password to someone else who travels back and you don't know if they have your best interests at heart). Still others will allow a traveler to obtain certain levels of assistance from you quickly.

...did no-one else set this up when they were a bored kid?
