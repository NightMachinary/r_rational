Sure, against the possibility of additional loops, anyway. It won't help you with original-you at this point, since you'd need to have established it 24 hours earlier. Though I'm assuming a fixed timeline in my response, which implies you will /not/ interact with yourself anyway, because if you will (had), it presumably wouldn't then have been unexpected when you traveled later.

If it's not a fixed timeline, you'll discover that in due course, but explicitly testing that (by deliberately trying to make a change) is a /bad/ idea, because if it /is/ fixed, whatever happens to prevent you from your intended change may be unpleasant or indeed fatal.
