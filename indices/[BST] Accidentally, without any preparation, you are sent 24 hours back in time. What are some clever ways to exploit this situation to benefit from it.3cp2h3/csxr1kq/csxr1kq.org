Two bodies is /much/ more exploitable, even with no preparation.

After you've gone back and realized what the hell's going on, plan carefully. You will wait until the next big lotto drawing (hope this is a day of the week a big lotto is actually drawn on...use the biggest-payout one available, obviously, even if it's a "crappy" daily). Make careful note of the numbers. Now contrive to send these numbers back with the original you in some way you won't have noticed...while original-you is asleep, slip them between your gym and blockbuster cards in your wallet, or safety-pin them into the hem of the pants you're going to be wearing (ideally both, lest things devolve into a comic hunt for the hem-note that fell off and was caught by a gust of wind or something). Code the numbers in some simple way so someone else who finds them will not have the actual winning numbers.

Examine your plan for any obvious flaws, adjust as necessary. Think about it for at least five minutes, but 30 would be considerably better. Every time you find and patch a flaw, add five minutes. Once you're confident, check your wallet (and/or your pants hem, etc).

If you find numbers, go buy your ticket. If you find mysterious bloodstains, you're probably screwed (given a fixed timeline, abandoning the plan at this point won't help, that blood's gonna come from /somewhere/), but don't give up...pick up some emergency medical supplies and soldier on. Consider concealable body armor as well if your current finances permit.

Assuming you did find numbers, when you get to the lotto place, you may be tempted to buy more than one identical ticket so if there are other winners you will get a bigger share. Consider carefully how officials will react when you claim your winnings in that manner...do you want those questions asked? Decide you want at least a small hedge against sharing. Buy several camouflage tickets with one of the numbers increasing incrementally, then skip a number, then buy two of the winning ticket, then several more cover tickets increasing normally. "I had a dream but I couldn't remember the last number exactly...weird fluke that I accidentally bought this ticket twice, eh, Lottery Commissioner?"

When you catch up to "the present", you may be tempted to try to observe original-you at the moment original-you was transported back. Consider whether this knowledge is worth the unknown risks of being present - take into account you are now wealthy and have "more to lose". Even if you decide it's too risky, consider setting up video equipment in your stead...even a slim possibility of learning how to trigger the event again would be of extremely high value...

At all times remain hyper-vigilant for the sound of your own voice. Record it and play it back so you're sure you can recognize it. Remind yourself to react instantly to any shouted warnings from yourself, as they will /probably/ be in your best interest. Try /not/ to look around too much though, so as to leave hypothetical future-yous as much room as possible for stealthy assistance should additional loops somehow occur. Do not allow the latter caution to result in you being hit by a car or something - be sensible, insofar as the context permits it.
