If the outcome of all sports games boiled down to random quantum effects determining the outcomes of the game as opposed to higher order effects like physical conditioning, experience, and cerebellar coordination/skill... there'd be a lot more 'game upsets' by newbies.

Then again, if you're stating that at an elite level of sports, all of these aspects are truly equal, then its just like a quantum coin flip. Schrodinger's Tennis Court.
