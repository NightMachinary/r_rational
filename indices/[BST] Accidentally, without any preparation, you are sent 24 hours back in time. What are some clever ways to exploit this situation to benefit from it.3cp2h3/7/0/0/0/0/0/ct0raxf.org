It most certainly is. Luck plays more of a role the closer two players are in skill, and the precise score between two players is affected by chaotic divergence in quantum-sensitive components for all that we know. Just because it is not the only thing does not make its effects negligible. Even if quantum effects were not truly random, the effects of going back in time

I am claiming the nature of our universe is probabilistic, which lies on the spectrum between determinism and randomness. More specifically, I believe that the determinism we do see is a result of emergent effects from the quantum state, which is in fact the case. I have said nothing that would imply that newbies would win against professionals any more frequently than they already do. Citing the MWI doesn't do anything for this either, as that pushes the random effect from "what happened in reality" to "what reality am I in."
