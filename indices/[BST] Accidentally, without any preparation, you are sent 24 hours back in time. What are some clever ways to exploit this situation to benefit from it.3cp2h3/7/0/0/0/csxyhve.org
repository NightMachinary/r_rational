That's utterly unsubstantiated. Fluctuations in a referee's brain and arm could affect a coin flip. Fluctuations in neurons could affect the exact pattern of neural activation, affecting the exact pattern of pretty much any muscular activity on the planet. It would be pretty silly to find out that the game started entirely differently from your foreknowledge. And then you owe a lot of money very quickly.
