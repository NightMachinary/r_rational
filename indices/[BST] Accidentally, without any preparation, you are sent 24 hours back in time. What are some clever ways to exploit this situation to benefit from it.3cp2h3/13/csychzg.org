Taking that I am sent back /now/ by 24 hours with no prep, here's what I can currently leverage:

- Let my roommate know that he's gonna have a really shitty day at work, and he should just call in sick. Seriously dude, it wasn't worth it today.
- Post the general summary of new chapter updates to fanfics I read on Spacebattles/Sufficientvelocity ahead of time in an effort to prove my time travel. Actually, no, write out the details in a password-protected archive which I post before the chapters go up, then give the password a few hours later.
- Be irritated that I've lost a lot of really good work on the game I'm making in Unity.
- Be happy that I lost absolutely no real (job) work since I got nothing done on that front in the last 24 hours anyway.
