You could probably prevent 3/4 planes from hitting buildings on 9/11, though you may get disappeared for doing so. Grab/buy a bullhorn, and go to an airport, near a police station, or even a public place like a mall, and shout out basic information about the event.

"Four commercial planes will be hijacked this morning with the purpose of flying them into buildings. The targets are World Trade Center North Tower, World Trade Center South Tower, The Pentagon, and an unknown fourth target. The fuel and impact from the planes will be enough to bring down the WTC towers."

Repeat your message until you (probably) get arrested. They will probably start believing you after the first hijacking is noticed.
