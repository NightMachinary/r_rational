The version I'd most be able to exploit:

- You're on a brand-new branch of time. Nobody in this new branch needs to go back on schedule or anything like that.
- You get sent back bodily rather than just memories.

I get a permanent clone. That's the main benefit of this scenario. The clone has limited future knowledge; in the best case scenario, we can use that to win a lottery, clean up on some sports bets, etc. In the expected scenario, we draw lots to see who keeps a 9-5 job and who does something else. Maybe one of us would go into consulting and work from home -- having an extra me would mean somewhat increased cost of living, plus having two of me working would mean an earlier retirement (assuming shared living expenses).

The worst case, of course, is if I find I can't stand living with myself, my employer finds out I'm moonlighting (despite using a different body), and I find I'm not sufficiently self-disciplined to handle working from home.
