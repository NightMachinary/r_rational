*shrug* It's not that they're likely to find a way to invalidate your claim, just that it's sensible to avoid additional scrutiny if you can (if there are reliable strategies for keeping lottery winnings private even in the face of media interest - "Officials report /21/ winning tickets were sold for Thursday's Big Lotto draw" - it'd be a good idea to use them anyway).

At the very least, you might create a bitter nemesis out of the other winner, who still has 1/21th of a lottery jackpot to work with. :)
