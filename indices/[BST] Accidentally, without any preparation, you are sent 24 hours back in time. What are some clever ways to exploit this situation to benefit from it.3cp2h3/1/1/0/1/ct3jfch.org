I made a "password" (it's not in any way, shape, or form a password, exactly, but the concept is the same) so I can reasonably have an excuse for positively identifying myself if I make a self-insert time travel (or, for that matter, dimension travel, fanfiction.)

I haven't determined whether I'd cooperate with myself (because lying about a closed time loop would be exactly the sort of thing I'd do, because past me can go fuck myself since I won't be affected) but it's still a fun thing to think about.
