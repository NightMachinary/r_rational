With no preparation the question comes down to "What information did I learn and remember during the past day that I could exploit 24 hours ago?", which is almost entirely dependent on what happened in your life in that period (and perhaps how good your short-medium term memory is).

With 5 minutes of preparation the most obvious answers would be lottery numbers (if a drawing in your jurisdiction occurred in the period in question), or failing that stocks that gained or lost a lot of value in that period.

Alternately you could use the 5 minutes to gain information you wouldn't normally be able to get without unacceptable consequences. You probably wouldn't be in a position to do anything like corporate espionage, but if you had something you wanted to ask or tell somebody but were afraid of their reaction, you could use that 5 minutes to call them on their cell phone (assuming they have one) as a test run.

If you physically went back such that there were two copies of you that opens up some other possibilities. You could establish an ironclad alibi if needed, or simply try to come up with an epic prank or magic trick that left everyone wondering if you had a secret twin. If you're in a relationship you could even give your SO a special threesome :)
