Well now they have. In order of appearance, by ctrl-f for "Name ":

The Vital Name:

#+begin_quote
  Today at work, I accidentally discovered a Name that gives souls to non-living objects. Like, not just turns them into golems. But actual souls. Nobody knows.
#+end_quote

The Wakening Name:

#+begin_quote
  Me, the guy who had gotten a $70 fine earlier that day for using a Divine Name to wake me up because the coffee pot was empty.
#+end_quote

The Sentinal Name:

#+begin_quote
  "Whenever you use a protected Name of God,” I continued “UNSONG agents with the Sentinel Name tattooed above their ear, and the Names involve tattooed on their foreheads, can track your location."
#+end_quote

The Confounding Name:

#+begin_quote
  As soon as you realize you're in trouble, sing yourself the Confounding Name and forget all about us.
#+end_quote

The Vanishing Name:

#+begin_quote
  “What does the Vanishing Name do? It's no less than a form of teleportation! Speak the Name, and you disappear and reappear somewhere else within a few hundred miles. According to my sources one of the test subjects in Pittsburgh ended up in Akron, and another one in Erie. The precise range is unknown, and the destination doesn't seem to be under voluntary control. Hence the label. It's useful for getting out of a situation, but not necessarily getting into one. Useful for, for example, underground Unitarian choir members in exactly the types of problems we're hoping to avoid.”

  “So what's the catch to this seemingly astounding discovery? First, the Vanishing Name teleports you to a situation complementary to the one you were trying to get out of. Both of the testers in Pittsburgh, for example, ended up in laboratories devoted to the testing of kabbalistic Names. So there you are in a laboratory testing a kabbalistic Name in Pittsburgh, and you speak the Name, and you end up in a laboratory testing a kabbalistic Name in Akron.

The Luminous Name:

#+begin_quote
  The Luminous Name had been worked into various prayers and magic squares and configurations to produce lights of dizzying shapes and colors.
#+end_quote

The Kinetic Name:

#+begin_quote
  Clever inventors in self-funded workshops had incorporated the Kinetic Name into all sorts of little gadgets and doodads.
#+end_quote

The Fertile Name:

#+begin_quote
  The Fertile Name brings forth grain from the earth, speeding the growth of crops by nearly half.
#+end_quote

The Purifying Name:

#+begin_quote
  The Purifying Name instantly kills eighteen species of harmful bacteria, including two that are resistant to all but the most toxic antibiotics.
#+end_quote

The Explicit Name:

#+begin_quote
  Either Harold or Juan.
#+end_quote

SCABMOM:

#+begin_quote
  “Sacred kabbalistic marriage of minds,” said Erica.
#+end_quote

The Moon-Locating-Name:

#+begin_quote
  A bright light appeared a couple of feet in front of my face. From the light sprung a beam, pointing up and a little to the west.

  ...

  “It shows the location of the moon,” I said.
#+end_quote

The Optometry Name:

#+begin_quote
  "The Name was HANAPHOR-KOTA-SALUSI-NAI-AVORA-STE-KORUSA. I spoke it once, then took off my glasses. I had perfect 20-20 vision."
#+end_quote

The Avalanche Name:

#+begin_quote
  It was a simple name, the Avalanche Name, only eleven letters, not very good at hurting people but excellent for collapsing buildings. Also good at getting people's attention. Ana was a sound sleeper. Once she'd told me she wouldn't wake up even if the house fell down around her. I figured she was exaggerating. I guess we would find out.
#+end_quote

The Tenebrous Name:

#+begin_quote
  I spoke the Tenebrous Name and plunged the street into darkness.
#+end_quote

The Bulletproof Name:

#+begin_quote
  While they were adjusting, I spoke the Bulletproof Name, which would protect me from exactly one bullet. Names must be spoken clearly and distinctly. Unless you're the Comet King or something, you can't get much more than eight or ten letters a second. The Bulletproof name was forty letters , which meant four to five seconds. That meant I wasn't so much safe as “safe from anyone who couldn't shoot me twice within a four second interval”. Once again, I did not expect UNSONG to have that problem.
#+end_quote

The Ascending Name:

#+begin_quote
  So I ran to the side of the house. The Ascending Name would send me up to the balcony, but they would probably hear me, either through the Sentinel Name or the normal channels. My options were kind of limited. I spoke it anyway, fast as I could, and got hit by a bullet. It hurt. I jumped through where the front window would be if I hadn't collapsed the front of the house and made it into the apartment above ours.
