I really like this thought. It's basically the sort of idea of some of the best parts of /The Prisoner/. However, I get the feeling that there's probably other stuff that will be going on. Unsong are possibly super competent - is there any real evidence to suggest that they haven't through secret courts + gag orders, and other measures, forced all consumer-available OSes to keep their microphones active and to store the last ~24 hours of audio that was spoken in their presence? Because if you're boobytrapping things like Llull anyways, why not go the whole hog?

It also doesn't seem impossible that Unsong are simply playing at another level. What if they have the word that Aaron discovered already, and are either not using it, or using it only under extremely controlled conditions, while trying to keep a lid on the situation by suppressing the word every time it arises? Or perhaps each word that does the ensouling can only be used once and Unsong constantly try to gather all ensouled equipment into their possession?

Aaron's paranoia, clarity of thought, and skepticism has very much not been a feature of the story so far, so if they do end up trying to con him as you suggest I think it'll likely work. I could also see Unsong going for a 'join up or die' approach.
