Let's assume, for the sake of the narrative, that nonconsensual mind-reading is not in Unsong's repertoire(otherwise it's game over). That being said, there are three paths available to them for getting the Vital Name out of Aaron:

A) The Stick: Torture/torturing his friends/various other threats.

B) The Carrot: Try to talk him into giving it up, giving reasons for how Unsong will use the name for good and offering him things he wants.

C) The Con: Trick Aaron into revealing the word.

Unsong is probably very good at A) if they work for Hell, but Torture is still unreliable and would probably be only used if other strategies failed. Unsong is also probably very good at B), but I'd expect Aaron to be very unpersuadable. I think Unsong's best move is to try for a con. Speed Aaron away to a dark cell, make a show of trying to get the Vital Name out of him. Then, Aaron is suddenly “rescued”. Maybe by agents claiming to be another Unitarian cell, or perhaps some more serious rebel group. The theater plays out, and Aaron is eventually alone and speaks the Vital Name again. Unsong is of course listening in, either through magical or technological bugs, and win. If Aaron doesn't say the name again, they recapture him and move on to strategies A) and B) in earnest.

The scary thing is, even if Unsong doesn't do this, if Aaron gets out of this he should be paranoid that they have.
