I try to imagine what I'd do if I was Sabrina, with a student possesing a unique power that might upset the social fabric of psychics.

I don't think her response matches that scenario. Why wait several months, then announce the problem to my students, including the affected student?

It's much more likely she just learned about the problem and that it isn't any of the students. It might not be Mewtwo either.

If Sabrina noticed a secret of Mewtwo's that he had kept hidden--that is, something she should know about with her powers but found out about some other way--that neatly explains her suspicion and her lack of certainty in the ability.
