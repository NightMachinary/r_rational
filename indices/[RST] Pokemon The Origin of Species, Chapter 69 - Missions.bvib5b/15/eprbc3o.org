So a question of scale, how do gym leaders have time for anything? There's at least a few million people in Kanto, kids are expected to go on some kind of independent journey, at least some significant fraction are gonna try tackling some gyms (or joining one). Even if most of those gym challengers only challenge one or two gyms in their life, that's still thousands of tests a year the gym leaders need to personally administer.
