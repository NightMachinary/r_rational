Maybe Keiji is from Mob Psycho 100? I'm not familiar with the show, but there is a (deceased) psychic with that name in it.

If so, there is a higher-than-background chance that Sabrina's second and third die horribly.

However, Jason and Keiji aren't exactly uncommon names. These characters could easily be original. I suspect the same about Rei, despite the possible Star Wars reference.

Going further, even if the names come from famous fictional psychics I hope that they get characterizations that differ from their source material. I think uniqueness is likely. Red Verres has some things in common with Harry from HPMOR, for example, but he is definitely his own character.
