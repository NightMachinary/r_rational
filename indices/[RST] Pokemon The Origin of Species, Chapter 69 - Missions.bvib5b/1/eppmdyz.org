Awww shit something happened with Mewtwo, the timing of the emergency and her realization of M2's deception line up too well.

The obvious guess is Mewtwo escaped, which'd explain why Sabrina's on a mission of undetermined length, but this'd be a strange priority when the superweapon's out of the cage. Perhaps Mewtwo /attempted/ escape or otherwise showed total unreliability, and Sabrina's tasked with probing M2's mind or running psychic interference or something?

(Also it's unclear why Sabrina thinks Mewtwo has some theoretical perfect shield, isn't "Mewtwo's a way stronger psychic than me" enough of an explanation?)

Speaking of psychic impossibilities, an interesting line on teleportation way back in ch43:

  Some even claim that strong enough psychics can go with their pokemon to places only they have been to, but if so none have made themselves available for testing.

Calling a shot: Mewtwo reverses that line of thought and escapes (in part) by teleporting with an unwilling human to a place only that person has been!
