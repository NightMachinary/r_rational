Hmm, lots of thoughts here.

​

First off, I must be confused, like, in what way is Red's partition not already a 'perfect shield', insofar as it would cause mind reading to be wrong? That is:

​

Mind Reader: Are you planning on sitting down and crying today?

Future Red: Nope! That would be stupid and unproductive.

Mind Reader: He is telling the truth.

Future Red: Hmm, I need to relax my partition for a sec for a reason.

Past Red: Bwaaah!

​

I can think of two reasons the partition is imperfect. The first is that it can be sensed, and the second is that it only changes values, not knowledge of facts. That is, past & future Red know the same things, and also psychics can detect the partition. Presumably the 'perfect shield' that Sabrina is worried abut has fixed one or both of these flaws.

​

The other fascinating question is how Sabrina has a 70% confidence that the perfect shield exists. It's easy to imagine ways to get a 100% confidence, but 70% implies to me that something has happened that strongly implies a perfect shield, but other explanations exist. ie:

​

Psychic: Will you steal the Master Ball?

Guy: No

Psychic: Checks out

Phone: We have your loved ones!

Guy: Yoink!

​

If they don't know about the phone above this would look like perfect shield, someone concealed their evil intentions through a screen, and wouldn't have had any detectable partitions. I expect that these kinds of things are the 30% that she's leaving.

​

As far as a guess as to what is going on, Mewtwo is the obvious suspect for any psychic phenomenon. It strikes me as very interesting that they don't think of psychic pokemon as having consciousness of the same kind as people do. If that's true, and Mewtwo is a chinese room (or simply so foreign that he looks so to human psychics, since we've had chapters from his POV), he may have the 'perfect screen' kind of deal.

​

I haven't played the original game in a long time, does Mewtwo have any moves that only he has that sound basically like mind control? If so, that would be my guess, with his puppeteer power playing the part of the phone call above, which makes Sabrina worry about a perfect shield.
