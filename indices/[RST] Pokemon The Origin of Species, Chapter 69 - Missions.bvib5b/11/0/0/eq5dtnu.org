This comment made me look for myself if there were any moves I might consider "mind control" in the game.

I'm tempted to argue that Imprison and Disable is really weak mind control, but it is negative mind control rather than positive. Making people not do things instead of do them.

Instruct and Encore are more like mind control, but maybe are just brain short circuits that force you to redo previous thoughts and actions.

All these (except Imprison) seem to have a common relation in that they all rely on manipulating the targets most recent thoughts/actions. That feels like it might be meaningful... Somehow...

A lot of fairy moves are kind of mind controlly, or at the very least thought-implanting, but that feels less relevant.
