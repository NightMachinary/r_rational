I might be conflating the mind and the brain.... IRL, it's not a problem since the former is a fiction, so the conflation is easily reversed by treating it as a synonym for the latter; I should be more careful here since minds can be decoupled from the brains that typically host them: do we know for sure that pok√©balls cause brain damage? Or are we guessing because the symptoms are similar? If the damage is actually to the mind, the mental shield has a good chance of working.
