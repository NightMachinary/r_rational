  Is it not definitely Mewtwo in Misty's cave?

Nope, it's definitely not.

  So say 10k is more common, and they happen once every two years or so. That's nothing compared to cancers and heart disease
#+end_quote

Yep, though those diseases are not issues in the pokemon world due to their advances in medicine. Also keep in mind that the pokemon world's human population is /much/ smaller than our's... I would guesstimate it's somewhere around 1/4 as populous.

  Red seemed to make a lot of progress on his own with his powers, but months later he's made very little. Hmm.
#+end_quote

It's not months later, the timejump was ~4 weeks. His progress mostly involved getting a lot better at sensing people's emotions and thoughts with casual observation and better merging with his pokemon, as well as some more control over his partition.

  Teleports: My understanding is that teleports can only move one person at a time, and can be from anywhere but can only be to an "outdoor" area that's predetermined except in very rare cases. Is that correct?
#+end_quote

One person at a time, yes. From outdoor only, not from anywhere. To outdoor only, and it's predetermined unless you're a psychic who can fully merge with your pokemon: then it's anywhere you've been that you've set a mental anchor to with your pokemon.
