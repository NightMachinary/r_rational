Yep, I was just asking because I wanted to understand what a reader's perspective is of how the powers work :)

The teleportation itself is a use of psychic powers that encompasses the person to bring them along. An abra can teleport a bag of rocks because a bag of rocks are not immune to psychic powers. Your analogy of throwing a rock at a dark person doesn't really make sense to me, because that's an obvious case of not actually touching the dark person with the psychic powers.

It's not like if someone just throws a telekinetic punch at someone without using their psychic senses it will hit them: it was explained in Viridian Forest that as long as the dark pokemon/person is alive, their body is constantly able to negate any psychic ability. So a pokemon teleporting their trainer is pulling their trainer along with them is in fact using their powers to affect the trainer's body, which they can't do if the trainer is Dark.

Does that make sense?
