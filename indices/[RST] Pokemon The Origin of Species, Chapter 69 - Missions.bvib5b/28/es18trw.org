Finally caught up and now I can follow the reddit posts which are far more active than the website! Yay! Patreoned too. Now I am going to go backwards through all the reddit posts, and also spam a bunch of questions here.

- Is it not definitely Mewtwo in Misty's cave? I assumed every Mewtwo chapter was in the past and Misty's chapter about the cave with her second was roughly present, meaning Sabrina was tasked by Giovanni recently to figure out his mental shielding thing since there's nothing else she can do to help him. But if it's not him in the cave, then they still have him on the island and that would make more sense on why she's bringing this up with her psychics now: because they just realized he's got a perfect mental shield.
- Vermillion's latest T3 caused about 7,000 deaths and was the lowest T3 (or lowest Stormbringer incident?) on record. So say 10k is more common, and they happen once every two years or so. That's nothing compared to cancers and heart disease. That's even less than deaths from car crashes in the US. Looking at deaths from hurricanes, it seems to match the worst of those. Catching the legendaries seems like a drop in the bucket of death causes given this perspective, given modern day people aren't particularly threatened by natural disasters.
- Red seemed to make a lot of progress on his own with his powers, but months later he's made very little. Hmm.
- Teleports: My understanding is that teleports can only move one person at a time, and can be /from/ anywhere but can only be /to/ an "outdoor" area that's predetermined except in very rare cases. Is that correct?
