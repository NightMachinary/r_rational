  It's interesting that most of the psychics are teenagers, though

Besides Rei likely being older like you pointed out, I thought Tatsumaki would be 28 like she is in OPM. She's just short.

Checking the chapter plenty of their ages were mentioned, so listing them out it's:

Daniel - 16

Tatsumaki - mid twenties (28 in OPM)

Satori Komeiji - 15

Rowan Donkerk - early twenties

Jason Grey - late teen

Rei - the "most senior student in both senses of the word" so probably over 28

Counting Red that makes 4 teenage students, and three adult students. (wait I actually don't remember if in this story trainers start their journey at 10 or older, but for some reason it's in my head that Red is 13. Is that right? which chapter was his birthday.)

We also don't know if Sabrina's students study under her forever, she could have had other students in the past who studied for a few years then went on to do something else. Daniel is the second newest student (behind Red) at one year, so everyone else has been a student for at least a year.
