To me it seemed a lot like either; 1 that the ability to develop psychic abilities peaks at a certain point/it's easier to develop mental powers while the brain is more elastic or 2 that for the most part adults either don't have the time or are just straight up unable/unwilling to spend the amount of time doing the self development stuff. At the same time it makes a lot of sense that someone who was a functional person without needing to heavily develop their psychic abilities might just not be willing to develop a skill that potentially endangers their already functional life. Or at least so that there aren't the fear or paranoia around having someone you thought you knew turn out to be psychic after all the time that you might have known them.

Conversely it might be that there's a limit to how much a teacher might be able to teach a given psychic in the first place and that for the most part her former students might be given some kind of foundation and then left to self-study afterwards. meaning that while there can be older students that just as a matter of timing that most of the people that were being taught at the time that Red is were on the younger side because older people might have already had the opportunity to be taught. But who knows really.
