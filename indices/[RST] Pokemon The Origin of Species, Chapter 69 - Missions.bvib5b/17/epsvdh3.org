Wow, so Leaf is really going through with the plan to catch and release every pokemon in existence huh? I mean, it's not /un-/reasonable if you take in to account that automatic catcher that was introduced at the SS Anne. Still, that's a lot logistical problems to consider. Maybe ethical ones too, but when have those ever stopped anyone.

I am super excited to see Red finally start talking to himself for some reason! It's like a thing I never knew I needed until I had it. Also, it's good to get small updates from the secondary characters every once in a while like we are. In particular Red's mom, she had some stuff going on and it seems like itll all come to a head soon.
