The comment about Joy only having one eye now made me wonder whether organ transplantation for Pokemon could've been possible. It took me looking into the idea to realize we don't have the technology to connect something as complicated as the optical nerve yet - kinda obvious in hindsight, since that would mean solving blindness fundamentally. (Partial transplants are possible depending on the part, and research on whole-eye transplant appears to be ongoing.) But at least, in the Pokemon world, containment technology should make most of the storage, preservation and transportation of organs much easier.

I noticed the references, but only got Tatsumaki and Satori right.

Also wanted to suggest calling Past Red "Dammed Red", drawing from the comparison Red made last chapter about how his powers work by "damming" certain parts of his neurological activity. And for the wordplay. But I guess "Dammed" Red applies more to Present Red, since he's the version that exists when the partition's up.

Thanks for the chapter.
