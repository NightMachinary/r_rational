Yeah, something happened with Mewtwo. It's obvious from Sabrina running off and the details of the task she left them.

Does anyone think the tier 1 threat that Leaf mentioned might have anything to do with it? It seems a little odd that it was "resolved" so quickly and that Red didn't even know about it. I suspect that something happened that triggered a tear 1 alert, but that somebody got the alert reverted and suppressed reporting on the incident.
