Sorry it took so long to respond to this, somehow I didn't see the notification, or else it just got lost between devices when I checked my inbox.

  A. The camera is a layer of protection that Red controls. Ranna, in the negotiations, is explicitly demanding protections she controls as she presumably doesn't want to rely on Red for her safety. This quote, "The trainer will have to subject themselves to checks I deem necessary", already heavily implies mind probing.

It's not, actually, it's a camera that's in her office and streams to her storage. Red collects a copy of it along with the data, but there's nothing stopping her from accessing it if someone acts against her. She could even check it daily and erase her memory of doing so; keep in mind that she's not actually unconscious from any of the attacks, just vulnerable.

  B. Kanto is established as the most superstitious region and Pewter City a town where religion has enough political power to hinder and meddle with scientific research and advancment. Blue himself is ashamed of his typing and keeps it secret, being revealed is likely to tarnish the oak name instead.

It would be /incredibly/ unprofessional of her to reveal this information, both from the angle of her position and that of the agreement she made with Red. Even if she is superstitious enough to believe that the 11 year old Blue Oak is going to try and attack her just because he turns out to be Dark, the likely worst case scenario would just be to politely refuse. There's no realistic scenario I can imagine where she doesn't come out at least as tarnished as Blue by spreading rumors about him.
