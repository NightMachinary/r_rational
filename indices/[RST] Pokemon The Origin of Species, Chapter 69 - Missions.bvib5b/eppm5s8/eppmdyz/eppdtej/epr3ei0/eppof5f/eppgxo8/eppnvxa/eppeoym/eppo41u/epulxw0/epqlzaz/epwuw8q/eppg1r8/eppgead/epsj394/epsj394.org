Also don't know about Rei, but [[https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Satori_Komeiji][Satori Komeiji]] is a Touhou character known for the ability to read the minds of everyone around her with her third eye ([[https://en.touhouwiki.net/images/b/b3/ThGKSatori.png][visible on her chest, with long cords winding around her body]]).

She's apparently not very likable because of it, but gets along well with animals.
