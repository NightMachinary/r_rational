I mean on the one hand there's obviously a lot of differences in terms of the developmental history and the associated slang with it, between our timeline and the hypothetical one happening here, but man it seems like Daniel really means "normie" rather than normal, that and while there hasn't necessarily been that much evidence to suggest that being Psychic has a correlation with a mental disorder I would certainly think there might be if I knew someone that acted like he did. Especially knowing his prodigal status and potential 'genius.' Also while the rest of the chapter certainly does not suggest that it is Red that Sabrina is talking about the mention of partitions and the distancing of the internal thoughts and outer surface layer thoughts, that was definitely my first thought. But is most likely Sabrina being called in as Giovanni's resident Psychic expert.

But jokes aside it's nice to see them working on the ranch, it's also really cool to see the differences in approach from the other student Psychics than Red where we see them i dunno almost like a group of parkour-ers or skaters or some kind of athlete doing the thing and Red's more theory based approach. It's also an interesting way to see prejudice/racism from the group of psychics, especially given that we've previously seen the mentions of the prejudice against Dark trainers. Granted at the same time it makes a lot of sense that even surface level mind readers would be good at turning public opinion against a group that causes them disadvantages.

I also really enjoyed the talk between Red with/out his partition and that for the most part from the outside he's not unrecognizable and that to large degree it feels like a natural extension of the kind of, not-trouble shooting, or really rubber duckying but like a more personafied devil's advocate type thing. Not quite the whole uhh you know angel and devil on the shoulder but more of an introspective type thing around not being sure about how to deal with emotions. Like it makes sense to me that Red has that kind of grief, like a vein through his entire self from the sudden loss of his father when he was young leaving him kind of vulnerable to another shaking of that kind of situation cause it clearly pings of that deep seated pillar that he's kind of had to build around. Like both Red's have a point the more surface Red has to live in the kind of world where people die all of the time i mean we hear about another smaller even that probably has casualties in this chapter, and Green even says that she was comparatively sheltered to that exposure to death, and that Red lives in a world where everyone pretty much just keeps moving forward and that in a reductive sense that he can't really just go to pieces and not move on from his grief. Conversely suppressed Red has the very valid point that he hasn't really dealt with his grief or even his ongoing conflict with Blue and just keeps shoving them forward and its not like they're just going to solve themselves, for the most part of course i mean in my personal experience of grief i'm certainly not as debilitated as i was the day or even the half a year after but that's after like nine years and it's a different situation that someone who basically keeps re-experiencing that first i dunno day or so after the event. I mean it's not clear how much time he's spent with the partition down but it doesn't feel like weeks of time cumulatively i mean it doesn't feel like that many days of the partition being down but he does mention that when training that he would sometimes be unable to do anything but lie around afterwards so i guess over the months of training it added up. but even weeks isn't necessarrily that much time when so much of it seems to non-contiguous.
