Simplest answer is that, the level of proficiency required to make a comfortable living in the private sector is relatively low so most psychics old enough to be expected to support themsleves would rather just take the job babysitting corporate secrets than continue their studies. It may also be that one or both of the teacher or employer expect a level of loyalty incompatible with doing both (for example you employment contract prohibits letting another psychic into your mind where they might see the secrets you were hired to help protect, but your teacher insists the only way to learn how to resit is to practice).
