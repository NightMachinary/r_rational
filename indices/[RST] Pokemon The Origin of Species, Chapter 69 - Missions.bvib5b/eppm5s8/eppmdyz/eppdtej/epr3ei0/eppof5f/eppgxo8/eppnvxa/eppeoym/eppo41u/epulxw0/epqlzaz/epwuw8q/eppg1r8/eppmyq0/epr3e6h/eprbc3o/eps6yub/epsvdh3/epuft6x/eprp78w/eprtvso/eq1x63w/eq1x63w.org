Um excuse me author, in chapter 40 Mewtwo and Giovanni are in the /middle/ of a Go game:

#+begin_quote
  I stay silent and study the Go board, wondering if I should form an eye or start a new formation.
#+end_quote

Yet the section concludes with Mewtwo /starting/ the game.

#+begin_quote
  "I intend to," I say, and place my first piece on the board.
#+end_quote
