Why not? A normal non-psychic person just tells an Abra "Register teleport" and the Abra who has a nose and ears and knows the person there is their owner/trainer registers that location. Then later the person pulls out that Abra and gives the command "Teleport" and they both poof to the destination. If an inanimate bag can be teleported, I don't see why a dark trainer can't be teleported.

I understand that dark people and pokemon cannot have their minds read and are immune to mental attacks because their mind is like a void to pyschics in the same way you can't read the mind of a sack of rocks. But you can still telekinetically throw a rock at a dark person or pokemon in the same way you can telekinetically throw a rock at a sack of rocks. So if the Renegade on Mt. Moon could give his Abra a sack of rocks to teleport, it could probably also teleport a corpse, and that's where my confusion begins of why it can't teleport a living dark trainer. Registering and commanding the teleport doesn't require psychic powers. It's not like dark trainers are invisible to psychic pokemon; just their mind is invisible.

I'm fine with dark being a disability socially and functionally for the sake of the story. I was just surprised and confused to learn that Blue and Giovanni can't teleport, and wanted to understand the in universe reason for such.
