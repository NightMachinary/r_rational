Decided to start re-reading from the beginning after this, and noticed this chapter mirrors the first in a couple places. When Leaf tells Red about her ambitions, they have the exact same exchange in reverse from when Red declared his intent to discover the titular origin of Pok√©mon species. And of course the very first scene in the entire fic has Past Red taunting Future Red from the alarm clock, in a room that "appears to belong to two very different people". Legendary-tier foreshadowing?
