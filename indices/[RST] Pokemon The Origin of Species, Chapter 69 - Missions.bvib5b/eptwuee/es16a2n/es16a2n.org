  he comment about Joy only having one eye now made me wonder whether organ transplantation for Pokemon could've been possible. It took me looking into the idea to realize we don't have the technology to connect something as complicated as the optical nerve yet - kinda obvious in hindsight, since that would mean solving blindness fundamentally. (Partial transplants are possible depending on the part, and research on whole-eye transplant appears to be ongoing.) But at least, in the Pokemon world, containment technology should make most of the storage, preservation and transportation of organs much easier.

The vegetable Charizard company from the cruise could probably make billions just by making new organs.
