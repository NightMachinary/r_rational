Ah thanks for catching that, I'll edit it to make it more clear: keep in mind the context of the conversation is what counts as "inside" for teleporting, like does it need all 4 walls and a roof. She was saying that pokemon can teleport "from" inside without as many restrictions as "to."

  Why make it so dark people can't teleport? If normals can do it, I'd expect dark people could too.
