Thank you for the quick response!

I had to madly CTRL+F through about thirty chapters (which is what I was trying to avoid by asking) before I found this from Ayane in ch43:

#+begin_quote
  “I don't recall that experiment being done. But a pokemon can *teleport from inside a building*, so surely it cannot be a case of being simply unable to pass through walls?”
#+end_quote

That's why a lot of readers thought Aiko might have survived, but you're saying Pokemon can't do that anymore. Is there a detail I'm missing?

Followup: Why make it so dark people can't teleport? If normals can do it, I'd expect dark people could too.
