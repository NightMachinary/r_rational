I don't think that satisfies the problem.

A. The camera is a layer of protection that Red controls. Ranna, in the negotiations, is explicitly demanding protections she controls as she presumably doesn't want to rely on Red for her safety. This quote, "The trainer will have to subject themselves to checks I deem necessary", already heavily implies mind probing.

B. Kanto is established as the most superstitious region and Pewter City a town where religion has enough political power to hinder and meddle with scientific research and advancment. Blue himself is ashamed of his typing and keeps it secret, being revealed is likely to tarnish the oak name instead.

I personally saw three ways this could of gone

#+begin_example
     1. Ranna is just as intolerant as the average kantonian and either
#+end_example

1a. She suspects foul play and accuses Red and Blue of it. The arc ends in a downer ending as they all stumble on their first obstacle of their ambitions as the angry mob runs them out of town.

1b. She sees it more as an unfortunate mistake that Red cannot control and simply refuses Blue as is. Red mcgyver's a solution to still get spinarak tested or worst case fails to complete his report.

#+begin_example
   2.  It is revealed that psychics are ironically more tolerant of dark typing than the average kantonian and has an alternate means of protection . 
#+end_example

Blue ends up being the offended party as he is both exposed and possibly humiliated depending what the alternative protection is. Drama occurs but for the most part the story moves on that same path it currently is on.
