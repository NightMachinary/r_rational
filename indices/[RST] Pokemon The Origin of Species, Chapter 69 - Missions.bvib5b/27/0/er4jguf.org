Nice catch! I can't remember if I thought this explicitly at the time, but A) the sessions are all being recorded, so that's one layer of protection, and B) Blue is the grandson of professor oak, and fairly young, so he's likely to be deemed on the safe side even if he's Dark.

Thanks for pointing this out! If you see anything else, please let me know :)
