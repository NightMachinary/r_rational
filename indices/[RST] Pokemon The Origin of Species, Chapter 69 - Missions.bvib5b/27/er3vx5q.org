So I've actually been a new reader to this series and I'm not even at this part yet, but I wanted to post this since no one brought it up in the chapter thread (26) I confirmed it.

In particular, a plot hole during the pewter city arc that disappointed me greatly. Specifically:

-As part of the negotiations with Ranna, she must be allowed to prepare herself so no one can take advantage of her after being night shaded

-Blue is, as far as I'm aware, is dark minded and Red decides to have him escort his spinarak for the experiment.

Considering the whole point of the arc was them not getting exactly what they want on their first tries, I was fully expecting something to come out of this. Otherwise, how did a psychic prepare herself for a dark mind that have superstitions surrounding them about how unpredictable and deceitful they are based solely on how psychics can't probe thier minds at all?
