Under consideration when he did what he did. She's implying that he attacked Zerstor to make his own legend.

I'm not sure what Vidre's deal is, but she clearly cares a /lot/ about safeguarding the legend aspect of the illustrati so that their powers are maintained or grow. Her couple of "supposed to" lines give me the impression that she's annoyed with Dominic for not playing into the narrative of "rube outsider who gets inducted into a New Magical World so she can give expository speeches," and given her conversations with the bards I suspect it's more because she's frustrated he doesn't get the importance of playing into narrative conventions for the illustrati than because she likes to give expository speeches.
