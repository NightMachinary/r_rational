There doesn't seem to be much "structural" magic. Everything we've seen so far has been more along the lines of command of a concept in the moment, rather than long-term alteration of that concept. Add the fact that you have to be famous to use magic, and the possibility of "backstage" magic is reduced to feats of illustrati with the time, inclination, domain, and reputation - magic Da Vinci, if you will. I'm not even sure what kind of domain would let you do structural magic - maybe simply a labour-saver such as metal or wood to make prototyping trivial.
