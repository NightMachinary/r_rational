#+begin_quote
  I am not sure I understand this sentence. Under consideration by who? Since becoming super powered is fame based why is there a group or person considering who to elevate?
#+end_quote

Under consideration by Dominic. And while powers are based on fame, Welexi and Vidre's group employ bards and writers to spread word of their exploits. "Elevation" means they're going to tell people about Dominic too, so he'll become an illustrati (and presumably bolster Welexi's story at the same time).
