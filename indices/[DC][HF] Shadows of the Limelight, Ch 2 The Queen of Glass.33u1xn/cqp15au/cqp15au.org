Illustrati get their power on fame yeah? Could Dominic or some other shadow/light user make a small shadow puppet theater in his hand with a candle, cloth for shadows and magnifying lens point the whole thing to a wall, thus creating a bigger version of his trick and possibly making money by creating stories and or entertainment?

I expect to see a lot of non combat applications for magic play and lot of famous persons who use their powers for economic gain. Or something like Corta does with her voice.
