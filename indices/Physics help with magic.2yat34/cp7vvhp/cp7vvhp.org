Alright, well my (unsolicited) storytelling advice is just to not worry about it. Unless your story is going to exploit some aspect of the magic system, you don't need to explain why saying /Kelenta/ produces a fireball, it's enough to know that it does. And you don't need to explain to the readers how saying /Kelenta/ produces a fireball, they only need to know that this is possible. Telling them how it works is probably to the detriment of the story if it's unimportant, due to the Law of Conservation of Detail.

I can't actually help you with making a counterfactual system of physics whose result is classical D&D physics. I /highly/ doubt that there's anyone who can do that, given the gaps in our knowledge about actual physics. And even if you did get there, you'd probably have to posit counterfactual biology to make people able to use it, which means counterfactual evolutionary history. And all of that to arrive at the same old system of magic.

The story I've seen that comes closest to having a particle system of magic is /Ra/ by Sam Hughes ([[/u/sam512]]). You can read about [[http://qntm.org/what][what magic is here]], which shouldn't have any spoilers, but it doesn't actually go into the "physics" of the system, which I assume weren't mapped out even though Sam /does/ have a working knowledge of particle physics, mostly because there's (again) not much of a point to it.

My (unsolicited) advice is to think of all the "rules" that your system has, whether any of them are actually false in some clever way that people haven't figured out, and what the answers are to all of the experiments that you can immediately think of.
