Have the sun be partially dyson'd, with an ability to make cheap nano or pico scale portals. This dyson sphere is set to respond to life to provide certain desired functions. Kinetic motion, heat, plasma dumping and light are easy to provide- if a set group of organism's with a shared desire do a similar action then portals will open and something will be heated up, be gravitationally yanked around, have light shined on it.

Over the course of history many new functions were invented. A fireball spell, where heated plasma is dumped in the air and propelled at an enemy. A flame lance. A disk of levitation.

A lot of human magic is based off finding these functions and using them. Perhaps only one obscure crab species 10000 years ago used the term oogly boogly to summon a kinetic boost that hasted all, but humans don't really know the exact emotional resonance that made magic do that, so now they say oogly boogly and click their hands to cast a haste spell.
