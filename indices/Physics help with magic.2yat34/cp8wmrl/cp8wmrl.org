Orion's arm has matter made of magnetic monopoles which they discuss here: [[http://www.orionsarm.com/eg-article/48630634d2591]] (see the section Interactions Between Magmatter and Normal Matter). It can normally phase through matter, but if "magnets" are made with it, they'll interact with normal matter. Granted, it's also extremely strong, absurdly dense, and it has a tendency to cause proton decay making it more dangerous than antimatter, but that's just due to the specifics of Orion's arm. Just make it of comparable mass with conventional matter and don't cause proton decay.

For extra fun, add in a fifth force, and include stuff that conventional matter doesn't interact with at all. Perhaps magical flight is just swimming in a dark matter sea that nobody else notices.

As for the actual mechanics of spells, perhaps you could make it so trained spirits are used, and the spells are just commands.
