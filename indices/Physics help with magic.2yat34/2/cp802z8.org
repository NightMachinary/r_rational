This was kind of a dumbly wide net.

A proximate thought I had was, and I don't know how plausible: magic as a kind of dispersed nanofiber made by older entities, which has become overgrown with emergent life that's (increasingly less) blindly rediscovering its command language. Some kind of field of...vibrations?...that can rearrange matter and receive commands. Over long periods, certain unbiological motions would have in rare cases approximated these commands and given rise to the perturbation in the manafield that made it fertile for emergent life.

It's just, the less William Paley it is the better. The more natural, if unlikely, the nature of mana is, the better.

Verbal commands and accoutrements could be linked to human devices for controlling mana more adeptly, rather than the magic itself.
