Here is a system, inspired by Nasuverse mechanics and my headcanon of Nasuverse mechanics.

"Mana" binds a conceptual/mental layer of reality to this physical one. In sufficient quantities and under the right circumstance it can cause conceptual/mental rules to override physical ones. Because Humans are sapient, they are able to make the mana respond directly to their thoughts. However, this alone is usually insufficient to properly create magical effects. Human use various methods of self-hypnosis to make their mental manipulation of mana actually scale into spells. Words, chants, and gestures can be trained and associated with specific hypnotic states to induce the changes in mana for spells. Also, naturally existent spirits that exist dispersed in the background (like micro organisms) can be trained to respond to words/chants/gestures of humans and can thus augment spells or create them entirely themselves. Finally, certain implements with the right conceptual connotations can be altered by spells so that they physically interact with mana themselves, thus allowing the creation magic items.

So to give a few examles:

- A shaman daily interacts with the minor spirits in order to build up a relationship with them (in actuality, from a reductionist standpoint he is simply training a learned response in entities that aren't really smarter than plants). When he needs to do magic, he calls on them for aid. Often, he will slay predator animals and then try to bind the concepts that make them effective predators in order to aid himself. So he kills a wolf to gain endurance, or cat for stealth. The lesser spirits respond to him and aid him in this process.

- A wizard draws mana that interacts with fire and compresses into a stored form around a flammable material in order to prepare spells of fireball.

- An oracle sits a significant location (leyline?) and sense the flow of mana in order to divine the past, present, and future. (Mana is influenced by conceptually significant events, and thus can be used for divination that way.)

Other points to consider in your system:

- Do humans and other lifeforms naturally produce mana? How is their internal supply different (maybe they can directly cast spells from it more effectively than with natural mana)?

- What limiting factors have stopped the usage of mana from sending evolution on a completely different course? (Finite amount of it, conceptual effect get weaker if they are overused, etc.)

- The most important point: What characteristics do you need mana to have to make your story work?
