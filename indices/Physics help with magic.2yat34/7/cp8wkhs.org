If you're willing to have alt physics, then... just have alt physics? You can add an extra class of particles (or whatever) that barely interacts with our own, with whichever exceptions you like. The real questions are why the world looks so much like our own world (in one of my own, someone asked the very reasonable question of why we're not covered in conservation-of-energy violating organisms) and the origins of any massively coincidental details that crop up (e.g: you can't have vocal commands written into physics and have humans independently evolve that; that's too much coincidence).
