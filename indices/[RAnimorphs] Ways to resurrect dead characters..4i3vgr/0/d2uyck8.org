(You might want to rename this thread it's a little spoilery) I'm not sure Cassie would want to return in the first place, having died honorably and doing what she felt was right.

Regardless.

If Cassie's mind is still running in the Z-Space yeerk tissue, that body can be displaced through a wormhole and she could potentially survive in a Chee host.

When you start to introduce time travel, especially in stories originally written for an ten year old demographic, the rules get strange. Travelling through Sario Rips and using the Time Matrix are the methods through which canon time travel can occur.

If you go back in time with a Sario Rip you have a limited period to save Cassie. If your split timeline catches up to the period in which the rip occurs and there are multiple copies of an individual existing at the same time, they're both erased from reality.

Although this doesn't happen in the novels when all the Others were simply killed. Corpses still exist. This may suggest that Ax's explanation was Andalite folklore that has no basis in truth. If that's so, you can simply go through a rip, acquire and spawn off a copy of Cassie and then return.

Meanwhile, there's this absolutely broken technology which should not exist in a Rational!Animorphs story

  The Time Matrix is a spherical device created by the Ellimist, which allows the user to travel through time and space. In addition, the user can alter reality itself even without time travel, making people remember things that did not happen. Should the user request something entirely detached from reality, it has the power to send the user to a new universe specifically created for them.
