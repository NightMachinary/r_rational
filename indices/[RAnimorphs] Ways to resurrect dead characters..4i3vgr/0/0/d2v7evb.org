The Time Matrix is amusing, but I was actually thinking of the book where they're picked up by a ship in z-space; they have an entire adventure on an alien planet, but no time passes on Earth.

If you could pull that off in both directions, you have easy, effective time travel. All you'd need is some kind of z-space beacon.
