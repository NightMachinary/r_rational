A couple of ideas. Also keep in mind we aren't 100% sure Cassie is dead yet.

- Cassies body is still in Z-space right? In canon, the Animorphs' bodies once got picked up by a passing Andalite ship in Z-space... this was noted as rare in canon and its probably even more improbable in this rational AU, but with the Ellimist and Crayak manipulating things, it is still possible. Also, afterwards there were somehow transported back with another undocumented side effect of the interaction of z-space and morphing. (Book 18, thanks to the wikia because I couldn't remember the details and I might have missed this one anyway since there were so many and the library never had them all at once)

- In canon an "allergy" to a morph (literally how Ax described it in canon, although in this rational AU "allergy" might be more a metaphor) caused Rachael to have problem morphing and eventually caused her to eject an entire copy of the morph in question - an alligator- from her body. If they could trigger that artificially and they have a morph copy of Cassie, problem solved.

- Finally, there is the narratively unsatisfying, but possible given canon, option that the Ellimist has created this as a dream/illusion in order to teach the Animorphs some kind of useful lesson.
