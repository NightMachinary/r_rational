(Spoilers)

Harry isn't perfectly rational -- actually, far from it. A perfectly rational character would recognize the value of social skills and that even pretending to submit is a useful tool.

Harry is an imperfect copy of Voldemort into a younger body, paired with a lot of Muggle science education. He's borderline sociopathic and definitely disassociative -- enough so to partition his sociopathy into a separate "dark side" that he uses as a tool but tries to keep locked away. As such, it's hardly surprising that he's arrogant and unpleasant.
