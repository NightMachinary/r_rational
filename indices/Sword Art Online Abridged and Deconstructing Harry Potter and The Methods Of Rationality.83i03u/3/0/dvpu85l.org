  In short, rational fiction is fiction featuring characters who rigorously pursue their goals --- as opposed to most "normal" fiction, in which intelligence, motives, and character personalities could all be overridden in favour of whatever plot the author wants to enforce or whatever theme they want to explore.

I would say there's a thin line that is basically one of suspension of disbelief, because since people in real life /aren't/ 100% rational, stupid or counterproductive decisions in a story can be justified, even when they're convenient for the plot, as somewhat realistic, but only if they don't push it too far. For example something that I feel could well fall under the name of rational fiction is Fullmetal Alchemist: no one's some bastion of rationality like Rational!Harry is, even Edward Elric, for all his cleverness, is stubborn, hot headed and impulsive, but overall it's all always consistent with established traits, and the plot and the actions of the characters click together like a puzzle, leaving a very satisfying picture of something that feels believable and makes sense within its own rules, without renouncing being emotional or having strong themes.
