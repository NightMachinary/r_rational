I haven't seen .hack but I think SAO's premise was good, while not extremely original, also in some of its setting elements, the way Aincrad is set up.

I'd say that Accel World, by the same author, is the superior work both in execution AND premise (in AW, the premise is there's a virtual/augmented reality game that runs off some sort of internet neural link everyone has and allows you to win points that you can spend to run your brain's cognitive abilities at incredible speed, thus living hours in the span of a second), but for some reason that never become nearly as popular. Probably because of the chubby main character.
