#+begin_quote
  An anime that can be accurately summed up as “Good Premise, Horrible Execution”
#+end_quote

Considering that the premise was already rather well-tread by such things as .hack// far before SAO started, i think it's reasonable to say that it's just got bad execution; giving credit to the premise of SAO is kind of akin to giving credit to a premise of "orcs are fighting humans"
