No he doesn't. He states quite clearly that he wanted the world he imagined to be real so that he forced people to act like it was.

I suspect this is one of those random fandom memes that people come up with and spread around so much that the original gets buried. Picking this as the final potshot of the abridged series was always a downer for me (the original webnovel introduces characters based on fantasy archetyps, Asuna is literally introduced as being like an elf, there is no shortage of worthy material but in the end they went with a line that translates poorly and that just means "I no longer feel as driven").
