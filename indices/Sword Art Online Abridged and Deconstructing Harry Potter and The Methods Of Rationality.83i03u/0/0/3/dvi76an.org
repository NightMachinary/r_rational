I think we read two different fanfics and also watched two different anime parodies.

In general, this whole thing feels like a huge reach to compare two extremely different works.

Also, maybe you misunderstand what a superiority complex is? I don't think Harry has one in HPMOR. Perhaps you mean to say that he is supercilious, it's not quite the same thing.

Maybe Kirito does in SOA:A, or maybe he's just a deranged parody of a character who pivots personallity scene by scene for comedic effect. That's basically why a comparison of SOA:A to anything is invalid, its just like, a joke, man.
