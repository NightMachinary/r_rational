despite the downvote brigade here, and also inspite of the fact that I love HPMOR (enough to have a tattoo of it!) - I understand and agree with your underlying point.

Harry's failings are largely attributed to his inexperience, his lack of self control, or not being smart or machiavellian enough to WIN. Often, his "dark side" is more successful and gets what it wants, with few negative consequences.

Your concern, I think, is that harry's sense of superiority and exceptionalism is not ultimately challegend or punished. He IS better than everyone else, he is smarter and more successful, and in the end he wins because of, not in spite of, these traits.

Fundamentally, reactions to this fall into two camps: people who identify with that sense of superiority, and people who are put off by it.

you will find a lot of the former in this sub, and on reddit in general. This sub is ALL ABOUT feeling superior because of things like being more intelligent and rational than others. and attacking harry's superiority and ego is akin to attacking the reader's superiority and ego; hence to negative responses.

It's not as binary as you portray it - Learning to Lose, for instance, is a good example of harry's temper being called out, and there are other places his compassion is appealed to.

But it could be considered a moral blind spot of the work that, at the end of the day, it is the superior intelligence and rationality of an individual that matters.

and this isn't even in keeping with the way real science works. Science is about collaboration and building on the work of others, not single handedly discovering the inner nature of dementors in a flash of insight without any evidence, reason, or experimentation.

HPMOR would be improved by increasing emphasis on empathy, collaboration, and the hard work of improving ourselves and the world -- which, come to think of it, Significant Digits did a fair bit of.
