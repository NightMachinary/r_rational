I last read the story fully about a year ago and only skimmed over it before writing my essay given its length I'm sure that's forgivable. Objectively yes Harry does suffer from failure in the story the problem is the way those failures are treated.

It's never treated as an actual character failing but rather a villain that must be overcome most explicitly with the "dark side" plot device which is one of the laziest attempts at adding depth to a character I've ever come across. Harry is always able to either refute or overcome the criticism through the weakness of those condemnations. McGonagall engages in the incredibly weak line of attack about how he doesn't need to worry about something that could be trivially refuted. Professor Quirrell calls him out as looking insincere, fake and being insufficiently manipulative while only Hermione calls him our on his superiority complex which only brings him low a single time and results in no shift of his attiude
