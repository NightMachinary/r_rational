Yeah, I'm aware that Harry doesn't count as perfectly rational either - who could? And after all, /how would you even go about writing one such character?/ - but he makes of rationality an explicit objective, and a value around which he centers his life. Though to be fair he /does/ recognise the value of those things, he's simply still unable to pull them off properly because of his human flaws. So what I meant was mostly that no character in FMA is a champion of rationality, even Ed, despite being a scientist and all, won't go around lecturing people about it, he's far less cold and more human than Harry and isn't too bothered by it. Still, I felt the story qualifies well as rational due to how finely it is crafted with regards to worldbuilding and attention to coherence.
