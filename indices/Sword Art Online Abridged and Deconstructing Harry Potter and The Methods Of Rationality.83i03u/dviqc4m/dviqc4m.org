The main problem here is, of course, that rational fiction isn't "a variant of the traditional mary sue type fan-fic..." et cetera. There isn't a single agreed-upon definition, but I favour [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6gd97l/meta_the_definition_of_rt/dippn6n/][this one]]. In short, rational fiction is fiction featuring characters who rigorously pursue their goals --- as opposed to most "normal" fiction, in which intelligence, motives, and character personalities could all be overridden in favour of whatever plot the author wants to enforce or whatever theme they want to explore.

As such, SAO:A isn't a deconstruction of rational fiction, neither it is a deconstruction of ratinal/ist/ fiction (it would be something closer to [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6178036/chapters/14154868][/Cordyceps/]], except not really). It is arguably an example of rational fiction. Is it a deconstruction of rationalist fix-fics? I... don't think so either, SAO:A!Kirito isn't really a rationalist or a fixer.

If you define "a rationalist" as "an egotistical narcissistic douche who uses his limited scientific knowledge to fuel an unjustified superiority complex", then sure you're right, but, well, it doesn't /really/ have anything to do with rational fiction as we define it or even HPMoR.

*tl;dr:* I think your thesis, as it is, rests on a fundamentally flawed assumption.
