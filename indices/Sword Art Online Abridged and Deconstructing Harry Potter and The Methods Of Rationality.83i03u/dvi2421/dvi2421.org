I think [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/7do4y7/hjpev_successfailure_reread_chapters_100end/][we read two different fanfics]]. Harry's mistakes are constantly pointed out by the narrative and other characters, and (imperfectly) struggling with his arrogance is a major part of his character arc that has real consequences.

The parallels to HPMOR outlined here don't really match up with my experience of the story, to be honest, and I think they're tenuous at best. That said SAO:A is a fantastic Abridged series that does a great job of deconstructing the original by making it more clever and the characters more nuanced (much the same way HPMOR does) and I encourage everyone who hasn't seen it to check it out, even if you never watched the original SAO show.
