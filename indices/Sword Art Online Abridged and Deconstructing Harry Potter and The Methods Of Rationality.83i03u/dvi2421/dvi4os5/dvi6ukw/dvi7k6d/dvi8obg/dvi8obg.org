  It's never treated as an actual character failing but rather a villain that must be overcome most explicitly with the "dark side" plot device
#+end_quote

The only people in the story that know about Harry's Dark Side are Quirrel, Hermione, and Dumbledore, and there are plenty of people who criticize him for things completely unrelated to it, and times he criticizes himself for things unrelated to it, as I and others have now demonstrated.

  and results in no shift of his attitude

You are literally complaining about the character having a flaw that's treated as his overall major arc for growth. And it /does/ shift, in small ways throughout the story, but most importantly and completely at the end of the story, which is where it should:

  "You know," Hermione said to the horizon, still not looking at Harry, "I had a conversation like this with Professor Quirrell, once, about being a hero. He was taking the other side, of course. But apart from that, this is feeling like when he argued with me, somehow."

  Harry kept his lips pressed shut. Letting people make their own decisions was hard, because it meant they were allowed to make the wrong ones, but it still had to be done.

Learning not to be manipulative, even in a situation where he knows more than Hermione does and has goals for her that she can't be made aware of, is a shift in his attitude that directly results from the experiences he had throughout the story.

In this community we value people being able to admit their mistakes and learn from them. I would like to gently suggest to you that you take a moment to reflect on whether you actually know what you're talking about when you continue to make arguments that I and others can disprove in minutes by citing the source material.

You don't have to like HPMOR. Not everyone in this sub does, believe it or not. But your criticisms of it are showing that you have not read it as closely as someone should when they attempt to analyze a piece of fiction beyond the generic level.
