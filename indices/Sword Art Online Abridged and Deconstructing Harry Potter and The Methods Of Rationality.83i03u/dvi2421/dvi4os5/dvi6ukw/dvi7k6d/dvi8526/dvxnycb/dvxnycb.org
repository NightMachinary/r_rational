I think his general point is probably that the /story/ itself never seems to condemn it, namely, it perpetually sounds like the narrator fundamentally sides with Harry, forgiving his mistakes as minor, understandable failings, even when they're catastrophically wrong (like breaking Bellatrix out of Azkaban, which frankly I felt stretched a bit my suspension of disbelief in how easily Harry agreed). Which it sort of does, but then again, it's pretty reasonable, and it's not like Harry doesn't suffer consequences or learn from those mistakes, as you said. It's one of the reasons why I found that "Significant Digits" is somewhat complementary to HPMOR - it shows "the other side", gives us more of other people's points of view, around Harry, and in general makes more compelling arguments for alternative ways of thinking and acting than his alone.
