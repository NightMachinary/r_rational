Okay, let's back up a little bit: what does it mean, in your view, for something to be treated as an "actual character failing"?

Suppose you mean that Harry never fails in a way that causes /later shifts in his character/. This is demonstrably false: for example, after being called out by Professor Snape on his tendency to make judgments without being given all the information (chapter 27), Harry /does in fact start requesting information more often/ (which is demonstrated very obviously in chapters 37, 86, and 108, among others).

But maybe that's not what you mean? Perhaps instead what you mean by "actual character failing" is that Harry never fails in a way that leads to /plot-relevant consequences/. If this is what you mean, then it is /also/ false: breaking Bellatrix Black out of Azkaban led to enormously far-reaching consequences, and pretty much set the course for the entire second half of the story.

There's this thing people often do when their position is untenable, where they deliberately use vague descriptions in an effort to make their positions as difficult to attack as possible. They reject any attempts to pin down their definitions, because a definition made concrete is a definition that can be falsified. And I'm being blunt here, but it seems to me that this is exactly what you are doing. So, before we go any further on this, could we please settle on a set of common definitions?
