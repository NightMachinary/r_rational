Not only do I object to your oversimplification of the situation (what does being criticized for "being too evil" mean?), I would also like to ask you a question:

[[http://www.hpmor.com/chapter/10][Have]] [[http://www.hpmor.com/chapter/14][you]] [[http://www.hpmor.com/chapter/18][actually]] [[http://www.hpmor.com/chapter/19][read]] [[http://www.hpmor.com/chapter/27][the]] [[http://www.hpmor.com/chapter/50][story]] [[http://www.hpmor.com/chapter/63][of]] [[http://www.hpmor.com/chapter/85][which]] [[http://www.hpmor.com/chapter/86][you]] [[http://www.hpmor.com/chapter/90][speak]]?

Each word in that sentence is a link to a different HPMoR chapter, in which Harry called out on his attitude by (respectively) the Sorting Hat, Neville Longbottom, Professor McGonagall, Professor Quirrell, Professor Snape/Lesath Lestrange/Neville Longbottom (yes, this is a three-for-one), Hermione, /himself/, himself /again/, Mad-Eye Moody, and himself one more time--and that's only the links I could get to fit inside of a single sentence. (Incidentally, Dumbledore is actually one of the characters who criticizes Harry the /least/.)

Seriously, can we stop doing this thing where people show up to criticize HPMoR while making it pretty clear that /they did not at all pay attention while reading the story/? This case is extra embarrassing because of [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/7do4y7/hjpev_successfailure_reread_chapters_100end/][the handy compilation of failures Harry suffered in the story]] that was linked /in the very comment you replied to/, but which you apparently felt was beneath you to click on.
