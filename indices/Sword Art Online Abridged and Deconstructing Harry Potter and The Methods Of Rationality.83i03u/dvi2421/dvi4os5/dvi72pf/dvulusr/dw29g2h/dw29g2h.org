but the moral of the story seems to be "get smarter and more manipulative", not "don't be a condescending asshole." This is what people mean when they say harry doesn't face the consequences of his superiority complex.

one moment that DOES do this I think is when Harry and Hermione are experimenting trying to create glowing bats, and Harry's overconfidence blindsides him. More humbling moments like this might help.
