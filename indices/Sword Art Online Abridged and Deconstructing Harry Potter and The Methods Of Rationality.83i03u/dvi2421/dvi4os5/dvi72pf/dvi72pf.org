Again, we have clearly read two different fanfics if that was your takeaway :P

Ch. 18:

  "Fair, Mr. Potter?" Professor McGonogall snapped. "I have had to file two reports with the Ministry on public use of a Time-Turner in two successive days! Be extremely grateful you were allowed to retain the Time-Turner even in restricted form! The Headmaster made a Floo call to plead with them personally and if you were not the Boy-Who-Lived even that would not have sufficed!"

  "But you have given me well-meant advice," said Severus Snape, "and so I will give you true advice in return." His voice was almost perfectly steady. Like a string stretched almost perfectly horizontal, despite the massive weight hanging from its middle, by a million tons of tension pulling at either end. "You almost died today, Potter. In the future, never share your wisdom with anyone unless you know exactly what you are both talking about."

  "Really?" said Captain Ernie Macmillan, looking up from one of the corner tables where he was being crushed at chess by Captain Ron Weasley. (They'd brought back all the other chairs after Malfoy had left, of course.) "I mean it seems kind of obvious to me. Who would try to come up with all the ideas just by themselves?"

  "Harry," said Hermione, at exactly the same time Zabini said, "Malfoy."

  He should've remembered that promise to Hermione before going to Azkaban.

  Why had he decided to do that, again?

  /My working hypothesis is that you're stupid,/ said Hufflepuff.

  /That is not a useful fault analysis/, thought Harry.

  /If you want a little more detail, said Hufflepuff, the Defense Professor of Hogwarts was all like 'Let's get Bellatrix Black out of Azkaban!' and you were like 'Okay!'/

  /Hold on, THAT'S not fair -/

  /Hey/, said Hufflepuff, /notice how, once you're all the way up here, and the individual trees sort of blur together, you can actually see the shape of the forest?/

  The frustration was building up inside her again. "It's my life!" Hermione burst out. She could imagine what it would be like with Harry messing with her all the time, constantly inventing justifications not to ask her first and not to listen to her objections. She shouldn't have to win an argument just to - "There'll always be some reason, you can always say I'm not thinking right! I want my own life! Otherwise I'll walk away, I really will, I mean it Harry."
