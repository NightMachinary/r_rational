As it has been said already, the idea that the story never calls out Harry on his flaws is bullshit and a belief that always seems to persist no matter how many direct quotes are used to refute it. Harry has a distinct character arc from start to finish, a lot of the final arc is Harry wondering how the fuck he could've be so blind and stupid this whole time, and the final chapter has even more of that when Harry has to be magically prevented from making a mistake that probably would've ended the world because he didn't want to think about the reasons he couldn't save as many lives as possible. Almost the entire story is from Harry's perspective, and he obviously does not have a clear view on his personality flaws, is quite good at rationalizing afterwards, and is more controlled by his biases than he thinks.

Both of these are stories I really like and have gone through several times, and only a few parts of this post ring true to me. They possess more structural/characterization differences than your central premise can really handle before it starts to break apart. I had a lot more written about the specifics of this, but in summary, several of the connections are thin, or in some cases just wrong, and a fair bit of its persuasiveness is dependent on whether the reader also has the same deeply uncharitable view of both Methods and rational fiction as a whole. Also, tread carefully when using the lens of "deconstruction", it is a word that has a tendency to get whipped out whenever any story deviates from standard genre story beats.
