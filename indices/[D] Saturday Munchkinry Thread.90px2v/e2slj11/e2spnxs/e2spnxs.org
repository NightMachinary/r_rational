If I'm alone, I converse at the aliens and attempt to communicate by writing and reshaping whatever they give me. If I'm with other humans, I converse with my fellow captives as well. Being conversant seems like a sapient behavior, as does creative work. If with others, I try to coordinate our actions--cooperation is sapient.

I have things like the things we give rodents? I move the soft stuffing of my cage into geometric patterns on the floor, which I then refuse to cross. I flip over shelters and fill them with water. I soak my food and write all over the walls with the paste.

I also pay attention to how the aliens move and spend time trying to mimic them, to the extent that my physiology can. Same thing with sounds or any other behavior of theirs I can notice. The thought "This creature is behaving just like us!" serves me well, if the aliens are benevolent.

If that doesn't work, I might refuse to eat most types of food, punch walls and self-harm to keep the attention of the alien biologists on me. Pretend to be dying at first, then legitimately try to hurt myself second. If they are benevolent, I'll need them to think they are doing something wrong so that they can realize their mistake. If I am alone I exaggerate negative behaviors until they interact with me directly or until they put other humans in my enclosure.
