  If I'm alone, I converse at the aliens and attempt to communicate by writing and reshaping whatever they give me. If I'm with other humans, I converse with my fellow captives as well. Being conversant seems like a sapient behavior, as does creative work. If with others, I try to coordinate our actions--cooperation is sapient.

I've seen monkeys look conversant and coordinate their actions in what appears to be an intelligent manner.
