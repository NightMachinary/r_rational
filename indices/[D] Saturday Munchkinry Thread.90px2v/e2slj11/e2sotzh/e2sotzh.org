Writing would be an obvious way. Even if the meaning isn't clear, the likelihood of a pattern of repeating symbols being intelligent communication is fairly high. To keep things simple for them, it would be better to write in all-caps so there's only 26 letters plus a few punctuation symbols.

Tracking time would be another way. If there's any manner of day/night cycle, making a single mark for each day would indicate that you are likely capable of counting and potentially other forms of math.
