  you would want to capture all of the humans and use them as breeding stock so that you could slaughter the children repeatedly (depending on what you consider to be a live human in your death count, abortions might be faster and more efficient)

Yeah, I suspect that this is the sort of edge case that would be very attractive to an AI with the right definitions in place. It might just put all its resources into human cloning. The cloning doesn't even have to be all that good if you only need the embryos to live long enough to be incinerated to add to your score.
