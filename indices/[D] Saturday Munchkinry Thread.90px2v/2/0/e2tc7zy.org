Note that if X is sufficiently large, like thousands or millions of years, some interesting effects can happen, depeninding on specifics. If you are a human (or demon with a finite lifespan), and X is significantly larger than your own life (I want to maximize the number of deaths that I think will happen after X even if I'm not around to see it), then you actually want to maximize the prosperity of the human race, in so far as that increases birthrates and thus people dying of old age later on. You would look sort of like a benevolent force, and could actually play yourself off as one in order to avoid resistence, but you might need to surpress things like a cure for aging if technology gets too advanced, so it's not quite benevolent.

If you can get powerful enough to take over everything, you would want to capture all of the humans and use them as breeding stock so that you could slaughter the children repeatedly (depending on what you consider to be a live human in your death count, abortions might be faster and more efficient). Actually, even smaller timeframes like 50 years might suggest this, depending on what kind of world you live in and how much control you get. If you can conquer nations or the whole world and have enough control to slaughter them at will, you might as well breed them for as long as you can and then slaughter them all right before the time limit ends.
