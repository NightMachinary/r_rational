  I've seen monkeys look conversant and coordinate their actions in what appears to be an intelligent manner.

Hopefully the aliens decide to apply the same tests for sapience to me that we've applied to monkeys. Or better tests.

Also, hopefully the aliens are more sympathetic to human sapience than humans are to that of other animals on Earth. Given they are traveling the galaxy looking for interesting animals... hope isn't unwarranted.
