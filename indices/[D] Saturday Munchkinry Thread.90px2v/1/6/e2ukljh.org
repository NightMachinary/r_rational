Without a doubt, I would do whatever I could to write (up to and including drawing my own blood), and I'd use math. I'd use a simple system of tally marks or dots as my numbers, and by slowly defining symbols for different mathematical concepts (starting with counting, moving on to addition, subtraction, etc), I would begin to display more and more advanced mathematical knowledge until I can define the Pythagorean Theorem or a similarly complex idea.
