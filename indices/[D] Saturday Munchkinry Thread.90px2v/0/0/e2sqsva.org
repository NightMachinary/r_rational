The first couple reincarnations would probably catch me by surprise.

By the 3rd or 4th round, I expect that I'd have enough experience to be notable within my tribe.

The next step would be creating some tradition or ritual to make it easier for me to transition back into power when I reincarnated.

I might carve some 'totems' that let the chosen bearer talk to the spirits.

When I start getting uncomfortably old, I'd go into the woods and hide a totem. Then, call my family and allies over, explain that the spirits say its close to my time, and ask them for a secret of some kind so they'll know that my successor is legitimate.

Then, arrange a suitably impressive ritual death. Reincarnate. Then new body can claim to "have visions" from the ancestors.

Being able to immediately find the totems & know secrets from the old chief should be enough to retake my old office.

And, at that point, my tribe is being lead by a wise, eternal king who provably has the backing of the heavens.
