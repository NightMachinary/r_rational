Assuming that you had an implacable urge to cause the maximum possible amount of deaths, and your time preference function was a step-function- continously 1 before stepping down to zero at time X- and you were entirely prevented making any plans, that stretched further than than X, or considering any events after X, even though you intellectually know you may still be alive after time X

What would you do to fulfill your urges if X was (Example approach)

- 1 second (Just attack, walking randomly- though you cannot even open doors)
- 1 minute (Walking towards enemies you hear, attacking directly. If you're captured, you have no patience to pick locks, etc)
- 1 hour (Attacking via ambush, perhaps stealing weapons if you can see them)
- 1 day (Stealing weapons capable of killing more effectively)
- 1 week (Poisoning food supplies)
- 1 month (Gathering gangs of thugs)
- 1 year (Joining armies)
- 10 years (Formenting wars)

(Yes, this is for a story with AI-analogue demons)
