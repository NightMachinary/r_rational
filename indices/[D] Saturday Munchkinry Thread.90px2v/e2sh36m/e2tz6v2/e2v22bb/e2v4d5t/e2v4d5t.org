I think you misunderstood.

Let now be 0. Let X be 100. I believe I die at 100. 50-me believes he dies at 150. I know that 50-me believes he dies at 150. At t, let acquiring enough food to last for d take t/10+d/10.

If I immediately acquire enough food for 100, that takes 10. At 50, I will realize that I will need enough food for another 50. Acquiring that much at 50 takes 10. At 0, I see this coming. By getting 150 immediately, I can waste 5 of my time so 50-me won't waste 10 of my time.

(Another solution would be to take poison that kills me at 100 so 50-me will agree that he dies at 100.)
