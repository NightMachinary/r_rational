It also depends on how long-term resources end up getting allocated. If the galactic power accumulates all energy to prevent it being wasted and decides that they will distribute it among a population limited to 10 trillion people who are no longer allowed to reproduce in order to make supplies last longer, then you get 10 trillion deaths however many years later. But this could also push back the heat death by many times what it originally would be if they have good energy storage. If you have a limited population of 10 trillion people but they die of aging every 300 years, or are forced to cycle out to make room for new people, then you get 10 trillion deaths every 300 years. If you allow people to reproduce as much as they want and the population grows exponentially until they consume every resource and then heat death occurs more quickly, you get a bunch of deaths all at once depending on how that effects efficiency. It depends on how many resources are consumed per person, and how many total people are born before the end. It's probable that an immortal society would have a much smaller birthrate per capita than a mortal one, although they would possibly be able to exponentially grow more quickly and capture more resources from stars, so it could go either way.
