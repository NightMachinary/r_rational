This was a plot of a sci-fi short story I read once; a group of human spacefarers crash-lands on some planet in a way that leaves their landing ship unretrievable, manages to survive (living off the local land whose biochemistry is fortunately compatible) but doesn't have any more-than-primitive tech, and then get picked up by an alien ship (which has never met humanity before and is looking for exotic zoo animals).

The dilemma facing the crew, then, is exactly as you describe.

They try writing numbers in the ground with a stick. The aliens introduce grubs to the soil that can be dug for.

They try to indicate their intelligence by making something fairly complex (given the materials at hand, they elect to weave baskets). The aliens assume that this is some sort of nest-building behaviour to attract a mate and remove the wall separating the male and female humans.

Eventually, in that particular story at least, they succeed by trapping a little shrew-like creature in one of the baskets and feeding it grubs - because the aliens agree that only intelligent life keeps pets.
