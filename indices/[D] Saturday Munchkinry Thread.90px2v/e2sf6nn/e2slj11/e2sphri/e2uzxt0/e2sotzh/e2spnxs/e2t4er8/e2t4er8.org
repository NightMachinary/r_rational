In an episode of Stargate Universe, this happened, and the humans built a fire which prompted the aliens to let them go, recognising their sapience.

I'd probably do something with prime numbers, fibonacci with my food or with my toys. I'd try to give everything in my enclosure consistent names and name the aliens if I can tell them apart: human biologists are very interested that prairie voles seem to have consistent alarm calls for eagles vs snakes vs people, and that crows can recognise individual humans.

There's a chance they can't hear the wavelengths I communicate on, so I'll try and also assign people "names" with the objects in my enclosure or foods I'm given. So the guy with the blue tentacles I might always put my ball near, and the guy with the orange tentacles I might always put a weird green alien carrot near. Maybe instead invent a hand sign language for the same, since they can probably see my body somehow.

Another thing: try and categorise the things they give me. Arrange my food by colour/shape/size assuming it's not just a mush of oatmeal.
