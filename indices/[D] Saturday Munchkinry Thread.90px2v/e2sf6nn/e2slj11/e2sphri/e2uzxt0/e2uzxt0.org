Taking another animal as a pet would be a decent bet. If they didn't determine humans were intelligent from all the industry, radio communication, billboards, signs, etc. when they abducted you from Earth they probably won't find anything you write or say sufficient proof of intelligence. So demonstrating that you understand the concept of captivity and practice domestication of animals is a good bet as it's a behavior you recognized in them, so they'll probably recognise it in you as well. If they are benevolent they won't want to hold a species that understands capitvity captive.

Otherwise it would be best to observe the aliens when the observe you. Try to identify how they communicate and mimic that behavior as that gives you the best chance of them noticing your attempts.
