You have been abducted by an alien race. You have no way of communicating with them, no way to inform the outside world, and no way you can see to escape. The aliens appear to be a highly advanced spacefaring civilization, and during your captivity, you realize that 1) they frequently capture living creatures from various worlds and keep them as pets and 2) they do not realize you are sapient. You are kept in an enclosure with food, water, and various things to amuse yourself with, much like the sorts of toys we give to rodents we keep as pets. The aliens observe you every day, but their interest in you will peter off as you become less novel to them. From what you have observed of their vessels, the aliens appear to be intelligent and benevolent. How do you convince the aliens you are a sapient being that does not mean them harm?
