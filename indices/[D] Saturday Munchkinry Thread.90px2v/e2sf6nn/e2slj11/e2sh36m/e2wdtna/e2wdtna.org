People have a magical ability to transfer injuries/ailments from one mammal to another.

Everyone (intelligent species) have the ability (with some small amount of training during childhood) to take injuries onto themselves.

It requires much more training/magic to move injuries between 3rd parties but it can be done.

Some implications I'm aware of:

As with the introduction of any healing dangerous things become significantly less dangerous and therefore much more common\\
Trained doctors will carry around pouches of mice/some easy rodent to move injuries too\\
Wealthy people will never experience pain for any length of time since they can just have slaves/poor/doctors take pain from them\\
People who dote on their children might equally cause the same\\
Larger animals like horses and elephants become much better because if they break a leg or something any nearby human can quickly solve this problem. Not sure about choking, if people can take choking for themselves it's very good for horses who cannot vomit.

What would be some impacts I haven't thought about?
