The longer away X is, the more you'd want to expand human population. If x for instance was a thousand years, killing everyone tomorrow is not going to cause the most deaths. A thousand years ago, human population was estimated at 250-350mil. Now it is at around 7,500mil. If the population increase can be maintained by the AI-analogue demons, the population could be at 150 billion at the end of the thousand years. and now imagine that you harvest anyone that is above child bearing age, and most males because you don't need that many, and now you have a proper cattle farm going.

What you have, is a problem that has already been solved by humans. Instead of simply killing for killings sake, we kill for food. The further along our civilization went, the more efficient our farming became. Instead of hunting everything, we only hunt a few so the population remains. Instead of allowing the population to remain in the wild, we keep them so we get a more consistent source of food. We take more and more care of cattle, so that they can give birth to more young. We add selective breeding, so that the young that are born are stronger and better and can survive better, so we can kill them when we need food. You probably get the point.

The longer X is, the more you are simply farming. The neat twist you have with AI-analogue demons, is the lack of "ethical human farming" activists, leaving you to boost population to massive levels.
