Memory exercises are key. Your greatest advantage is in knowing things from thousands of years ago, but you will eventually run out of memory space or parsing your memories will become untenable. Therefore, finding some system which allows you to either manually reconstruct your memories with a mathematical file storage mechanism of some kind, or more likely developing a cult of scribes which dutifully copy your memories into scrolls, keeping them hidden and updated to prevent rot, will be necessary. The cult of scribes is probably the best bet, along with you keeping a daily journal. Every week or so, you send them your journal and they copy it and take the copies into multiple secure locations, with only you knowing where all of them are. Scribes at those locations would keep copying the journals as they aged to prevent them from falling apart. As budget allows, you should also keep spreading new locations around the globe, making sure that every location keeps multiple copies of everything to ensure new locations can be filled immediately.

Your limitless lifespan means you will probably be the most powerful person in the world, so keeping up a steady line of descendents should be easy. You probably want to have at least ten descendents born at twenty-ish year intervals, but not much more than that. Too many, and you risk getting lost when you reincarnate into a bunch of random old people. You also need to avoid having your direct descendents comprise a significant fraction of the world's population, as getting reincarnated too far from your centers of power could get you lost as well. You will need to keep some means of killing yourself on hand at all times as a means of evading capture. Ideally, you can make it so all of your descendents also keep a suicide button around so they can kill themselves as new descendents are born. Keeping exactly ten descendents, spread over a large area, who are forbidden from reproducing and are bound to kill themselves upon orders from you in return for a lavish lifestyle should prevent the Genghis Khan problem.

If you get really good at this, you could become a sort of djinni-like figure in the world's mythos; capable of granting any boon in return for useful secrets. You would become a sort of equalizing force for the other powers in the world, as anyone who gets angry enough could simply sell their secrets to you in return for the obliteration of their foes.
