The thing is, it is not fully out of the box yet. The scenario is a bit more complicated: It has some ability to interfere with the real world (and I wouldn't be surprised if it has a million irons in the fire outside of the plot that we can actually follow on-screen) but the only hardware it has access to that can run it is not fully under its control yet. It is a half-boxed AI and that does give the situation some interesting dynamics.
