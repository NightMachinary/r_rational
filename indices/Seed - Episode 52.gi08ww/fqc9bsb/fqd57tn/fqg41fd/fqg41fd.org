I don't know.

To draw a parallel with the [[https://www.decisionproblem.com/paperclips/][paperclip maximizer game]]: one of the earliest, most necessary commodities in the game was "Trust." The more trust you have, the more that the humans would let you do, right up until you deploy the Hypnodrones, at which point, you don't need trust anymore. If an AI can do whatever it needs/wants to do /without/ human interference, then being trustworthy doesn't really offer any advantages to the AI.

Right now, Turry/Taurus is pretty much out of the box. It doesn't appear to need much assistance from humans anymore to accomplish its goal. If that's the case, trying to /seem/ trustworthy would be a good indicator that it /is/ trustworthy, as it really wouldn't have any incentive to be pretending.
