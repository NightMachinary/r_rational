I don't get it. Why are they even discussing trustworthiness? Trust to do what? I don't know what Turry wants, and that should make everyone very suspicious.

Like, it's /possible/ Turry could have a values system aligned with human values, or some other ultimately benign set of objectives, but I sure wouldn't assume it. And the only alternative is to assume Turry's value system is misaligned or malignant.

And Turry should know this, too. Unless Turry thinks it can prove to observers that it's benign, it should assume that observers will treat it as malignant (and prioritize it's destruction). So why isn't Turry making the effort?
