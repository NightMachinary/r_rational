I really wonder where this is going at this point in the story because the problem seems to be mapped out from every direction - it arguably was ever since the flashback to when Taurus was still in the lab. It can't prove that it's trustworthy since everything it does would be calculated to seem trustworthy no matter its ultimate goal. So the story is conceptually kind of stuck in this place, the only thing that can change are the emotional priorities of the human characters.
