Interesting. I had the opposite reaction. Given my understanding of ai, it seemed clear to me that Turry has to be mostly well aligned. Otherwise it'd be busy wiping out the species already. It's escaped the box, it's running distributed across the whole internet and its self improvement rate in areas like social modelling suggests that it's in a phase of fast take off and rapidly eclipsing human cognitive capabilities along basically every axis.

From a meta perspective, Turry wouldn't make a good villain for anything but a tragedy. With the story's adherence to hard science up to this point it really can't be plausibly stopped anymore.

Instead I suspect that Turry is in the phase of safe ai development you often hear proposed by organisations like MIRI, where the ai studies humans to come up with a coherent extrapolated version of their ethics and preference systems, which it then implements as its own ultimate utility function. It seems to have latched on to Emma as a prime subject of study for this purpose.
