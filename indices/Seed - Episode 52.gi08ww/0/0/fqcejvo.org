I think the comic is definitely relying on our collective ideas of unfriendly AI, but it's also definitely doing a good crafting job. We know that Turry didn't have boundaries (see its initial attempts to help Emma) but is /learning/ and has an unspoken goal. We don't know for certain if Turry is good or bad, by our standards, which means part of the tension is whether everyone else is responding /appropriately/.
