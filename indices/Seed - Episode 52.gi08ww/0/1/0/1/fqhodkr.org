Turry may not yet be powerful enough to truly be able to ignore humanity even if it wanted to. I mean it doesn't seem to have any independent manfufacturing capability yet so if nothing else if if the goverment became convinced it was going to deploy the Hypnodromes they might still be able to destroy the internet and kill it. At a massive cost but it might still be possible.
