I watched this [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NJW9vsF0aE][short video essay]] earlier about how compelling, terrifying villains are created through building tension around the combination of power and uncertainty. I dunno if Seed has really done a good job of crafting Turry in that sense, or if my personal reading on the dangers of unfriendly AI is doing the heavy lifting, but I'll be damned if my breathing doesn't get a lot more constricted with every line he speaks.
