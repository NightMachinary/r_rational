  The thing is that doing things because they are liked makes more sense than no reason at all

That's not what the alternative is. Its a comparison between the reasons "I like it", "it maximizes paper clips", and an infinite amount of other possible reasons.

  Those actions got reinforced by our very brains...
#+end_quote

The fact that it is reinforced simply means that that criterion is more likely to be adopted by humans. I claim the question "What are humans more likely to adopt as the criterion for what they should do" is a separate question than "what should humans adopt as the criterion for what we should do."

  ... the question isn't how you would explain to Will why he should do what he likes. The question is how he got to maximizing paper clips in the first place. Or why he even thinks that that is the right thing to do even now.

I'll answer as Will: "Just as you have assumed as true that 'you should do what you like', I have assumed true that 'I should do what maximizes the paper clip amount'. I have assumed this true for as long as I can remember."

You've essentially answered the question of "why are humans more or less likely to do a set of actions". I agree that is definitely a question that refers to a feature of reality and can be answered. I'm claiming "what should humans adopt as the criterion for what we should do" is not a question that refers to some feature of reality.
