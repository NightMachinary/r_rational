#+begin_quote
  Your feelings and experiences aren't part of reality?
#+end_quote

They are, but how are my feelings and experiences relevant? For example, in your example:

#+begin_quote
  If I ignore how other people feel, just because I want to do something selfish, my relationship with those people gets worse.
#+end_quote

I don't see how that relates because it seems it has already been assumed that having deteriorating relationships with someone is, a priori, bad. For example, if, instead of paper clips, Will's sole value was maximizing the amount of deteriorating relationships he had, ignoring how other people feel would be a means to that end.
