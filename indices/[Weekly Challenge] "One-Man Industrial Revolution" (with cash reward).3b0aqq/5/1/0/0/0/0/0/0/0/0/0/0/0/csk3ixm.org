Hmm, I don't understand how that process works.

I understand/use the Bayesian process to determine the likelihood that some feature of observed reality has property X. But I wouldn't be able to apply it in this situation because this doesn't seem to concern an observation of reality.

To help me understand, could you please give an example of such a piece of data (gathered from experience) and show how it backs up the claim "I should base my actions on all concerns that move me"?
