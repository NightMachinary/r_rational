edit well after the fact: this is incredibly paranoid but if any academic philosophers are reading this comment chain, I just want to say I'm well aware of the arguments against and unpopularity of moral non-realism in academic philosophy (and I've read works like "The Normative Web" by Cuneo). Please interpret what I'm saying in the context of the subreddit and this comment chain, use the principle of charity, etc., etc.

Hmm, that's interesting. I haven't really thought of there being much innate connection between naturalizable desire and morality. If I'm understanding you correctly, then I certainly feel a huge disconnect. For example, I give to Givewell due to the abstract notion that, statistically speaking, it is a comparatively efficient means of lowering the mortality rate in a given region. That elicits /nothing/ emotionally (except, perhaps, boredom) or in my desires. Even it were more tangible, my real, genuine, desire in life is to maximize the amount of time I dick around on the internet. Its a /very/ powerful desire and vastly outweighs my desire to donate. But, like Will, I (at least try) to follow on what I value and think is right rather than what my natural desires are.
