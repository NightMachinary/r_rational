Yeah I saw the wiki but ignored the link to the [[http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax][Markdown]]. Even the wiki skipped over the issue I was having (around all the beaks). My text editor wasn't playing nice either. Oh well, I don't think I'll be having formatting issues any more from the advice given. Thanks for the advice!
