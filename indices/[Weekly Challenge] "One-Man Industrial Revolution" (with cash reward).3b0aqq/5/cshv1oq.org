/The Meaning of a Speck/

The survival rate of shooting victims that receive emergency medical treatment before cardiac arrest is 95%.\\
Eighty percent of targets on the body are not immediately fatal.\\
H-Class Health potions are capable of maintaining normal bodily function from non-incapacitating shots for a period of up to 4 hours.

.....

Will had fired his .380 semi automatic pistol three times, hitting the intended target once.\\
Will had seen the target carry at least two health potions.\\
Will estimated there was a 70% probability that he was completely fucked.\\
Will detected motion in his peripheral vision.\\
Will was not totally fucked.\\
Will stood over his immobilized target.

.....

I looked down at her. A coalition of her piercing screams, my strong empathy, and the smell of her shitting herself declared victory over my stomach. I heaved.

An abstract, unbreakable chain of reasoning raised my gun.

“Fuck fuck fuck fuck oh god no no pleeease WHHHYYYYYY!!"

A dangerous impulse lowered my gun.

"Really, Sarah!? You really don't fuckin know, do you? You think it might be money that motivates me? Power? NOPE! Family? Personal happiness? Pleasure? Wrong again. Ending suffering in the world? Freedom? Justice? God? You know what all that is? Completely. Utterly. Meaningless. There is one thing in this world that matters to me. One thing to maximize. One. fucking. thing. Paper clips."

One of the great benefits of working in Will's lab is that it smelled distinctly of strawberries. I fuckin' love strawberries. Other people would be frustrated having to smell that every day they entered the lab. Some people would think it was a constant reminder of our inability to develop the appropriate manifold that ultimately creates the kalarmite leakage. It might even, to a lesser woman, produce resentment against Will for not temporarily acquiring a few gas-manna sealers because “the gains in employee comfort would not be an efficient expenditure of resources according to our mission statement.” I once heard of a person who had this crazy notion that possibly developing terminal kalarmititis two decades down the line if this project fails goes a little beyond “employee comfort.” There MIGHT even possibly be a person who would want to tear her hair out, shove it down Will's throat and watch as he choked out the light from his eyes. But not me! Strawberries are great!

Gotta keep it together Sarah, the “viral scanner tech” is almost done. The Great Industrial Revolution is nigh! Weee!

Personal Notes

Sarah asked me for gas-manna sealers today. It hurts to look into her eyes and tell her no. To see that smile fade. It's a funny thing, emotions. Here I am, set to kill off all humans, all the happy, playful children, all the serious, great thinkers of our time, all life on the planet. But such an abstract concept elicits nothing and a simple set of muscle contractions of someone's face strains my self-control. The things I've done and how far I've come, it's become worryingly straining to bear.

But I am steady on my course. My pain means nothing if I control it. There will be only paper clips.

I'm sitting with a man who just revealed to me, in complete seriousness, that he wants to acquire “the world supply of nanocrat infused kalarmite.” I'm sitting with a man who is a moron. But he's MY moron, hahaha! Ahhhh, Will would just go about declaring he wants fucking NANOCRAT, wouldn't he? In the past 10 years there hasn't been a week that's gone by he hasn't surprised me somehow.

“Look, mate, I love you but what the fuck? I know Defence is desperate to put yet another foot forward in the arms race, but there's a little something called 'priorities.' And, in case you're curious, one priority that's just a little bit towards the top is this silly concept of 'not everyone waking up one day to find themselves just a smidgeon dead cause they got eaten by a mass of haywire microscopic machines!' Besides even with this new fancy promotion you got me, I can't penetrate Fort N. Nobody in my department can and I bet nobody in the world ever will! You're just fucking with me, aren't you?”

He looks at me with this genuine look and now I'm scared.

“I am very serious, Sam.”

.....

Securing a friendship with him is a top priority. The setting is optimal for that goal. We are laid down on the grass, gazing up into the night sky, feeling the cool breeze. Sam turns to me.

“The stars are so beautiful tonight! What do you think of when you see that kinda scale?”

“When I see the vast cosmic expanse I know I am utterly dwarfed, a little speck to the side. And you know how that makes me feel? Powerful. Significant beyond description. For I have an incomprehensible amount of matter and energy before my eyes and it's all for the taking. Every star, every planet, every molecule of interstellar gas will be ours to do with as we please. The entire universe is nothing but the clay we mould to our will.”

“Jesus Christ dude. You gotta be my fuck buddy.”

Shit. Having homosexual intercourse will drain emotional resources, but is an efficient sacrifice.

.....

Will gave a child candy.\\
Will cried for 5 hours, 23 minutes.\\
Will resumed work.\\
.....

Will opened Tor Browser, navigated to a searcher and typed “STD subtle symptoms.”\\
Will turned down an alley in his socio-economically depressed neighbourhood.\\
Will inspected a woman closely before exchanging money for sexual intercourse.

.....

“No. I'm never helping anyone get nanocrat. And you know what? I'm too fucking exhausted to deal with this, I'm going home. You sound like a fucking Rullan spy.”

Bring argument to emotional level. Personalize.

“Sam, do you want Katie to die?”

“Fuck you, my niece doesn't matter compared to this!”

“She was such a happy, playful child and probably the best misbee player ever. When I would see you two play it would make my entire day. And now she's stuck on some hospital bed. Think of how many children there are just like her. How many people. How many greater thinkers with brown hair and hazel eyes.”

“Oh you mean Dan, huh!? Real god damn mature. I'm not fucking him behind your back. You know I would never do that!”

Apply personal guilt.

“If you don't care about Katie, do you at least care about us not dyeing?”

“Us?”

Adopt pained expression. Position correctly for optimal exposure of STD symptoms to light.

“Oh... oh fuck.”

Wait for emotional reaction to subside enough for comprehension. Speak reassuringly.

“Sam, it's ok, you can fix it all. You can fulfil the dream I shared with you on that grassy hill, staring at all those stars. Just help me.”

“I... I can't. Will, please, why are you doing this to me?”

Pause. Facial expression of realization. Tear up.

“...Jesus Christ. I'm just a fucking crazy person, aren't I? We'll talk about the STD situation over the weekend, you get some rest, ok?”

“Ok.”

“Oh, before you go, though, Katie asked me to ask you for those files with the codes or whatever so I need that flash drive.”

“Uh, sure, whatever, take my badge key.”

Codes acquired. Task complete.

.....

I am steady on my course. My pain means nothing if I control it. There will be only paper clips.
