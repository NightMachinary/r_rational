*Part 7 of 8*

They didn't live that one down.

A hundred fifty children awaited his arrival the following weekend, smiles on their faces. When they saw him coming, they surrounded him, some with smiles on their faces and others sticking out their tongues at him, and they told him they had a plan after all, just he wait and see.

"You did, eh? After I'd told you, in no unclear terms, that it was impossible, and when half of you had already given up? You're joking," Art retorted.

"Hear to us then, for after much thought we have devised such a plan," said a boy as he leapt on top of a stool and thus stood higher than all the rest. The others seemed to parted so he could face Art without anyone standing in the way. "This plan has seen contributions from each and everyone of us," said the boy on the stool, holding up a sheet of parchment.

Wait, thought Art, this lad's only a teenager and he not only could read and write, but actually had wasted good money on ink and parchment?

"Some things were apparent from the beginning. First: The objective. To extinguish the phoenix would require that all fires be put out at least for one moment. As it would be impossible for everyone to simply abandon the use of fire, it can only be done for a short while. This time period would have to be determined ahead of time and we must ensure that the chosen time be communicated to all the realm far in advance, so that everyone will be aware of this. As it will certainly require time to vanquish the phoenix and put out all the fires it may have caused, this fire-ban will have to be maintained for at least a day and night. Since people will want to use fire when it's dark and when it's cold, the best chance of success will be on the summer solstice, when the day is longest and warmest, and hence the fire-ban will be on that day.

"Now, the major sources of fire. One: Wildfires. Two: Light sources. Three: Indoor fires and campfires. Four: Cooking fires and crafts fires. Other crafts related fires. Five: Fires caused by the phoenix. Six: The phoenix itself." And he described the construction of watchtowers all over the lands at regular intervals, each supplied with a team of horses and a great many of barrels of water and each overseeing a swath of territory and charged with ensuring that any fires spotted within its domain be put out with haste. He noted the edicts that would proclaim it unlawful to use fire for any means, and how several day's worth of cooked food would be prepared in advance of the fire-ban so that none would be tempted to cook on that day.

"Now, to ensure that all these policies are carried out..." and he described a system of neighbor-monitoring to ensure that no one was keeping a fire lit when they should not; and for a day-long curfew for when all children must stay with their parents the entire time; and for new laws to be made, by all the kings of all the kingdoms of the world, for terrible punishments to be meted out to those found violating the fire-ban; and a system of self-monitoring amongst the guards and nobility so that they would not be bought out by those who were guilty nor be tempted themselves. And he described how it was to be expected that the fire-ban would fail the first year, that it was but a test to see who would break the laws.

"Now for the phoenix and its path of destruction, the challenge is in ensuring that the fires it creates where it goes cannot spread as wildfires tend to do." And he went on to describe how the peoples would be required to pre-burn all of the forest and meadow in all the land in the days before the fire-ban, so that having already been burned down, they would not be easy to rekindle. He told of how the peoples would be told to re-pattern their farmland into small square lots, with grids of fallow ground separating them all, so that the fire could not spread from one lot to the next. He told of how all the wooden buildings and thatched roofs in all the towns and villages in all the land would be razed, and new buildings of stone raised in their place, that the phoenix could not set fire to the settlements.

"And the most difficult of them all, the phoenix." And he went on to describe how in order to whittle down the phoenix, they'd need to blast at it continuously out from a water hose; how this waterhose would be stiched together out of thousands of animal kidneyskins each, and connected to water reservoirs set atop towers overlooking the land, so that the weight of gravity would allow the water to blast forth from these hoses instead of needing catapults to launch the water. And he explained how this would have to be done all across the land, so that a single village may have a dozen such water towers, and a kingdom tens of thousands. And he explained of how far more people would be needed to mine and smelt and smith all the metal that would be needed to build these water towers, and so this was a project that would take a great many years to finish.

Art realized he'd been standing there, mouth agape, the entire time. These people -- children all, and some not even in their teens -- had thought of everything, far more than he'd imagined. They'd foreseen problems he'd never even considered, and then found solutions to them too. In the water towers they'd even managed to devise a solution superior to his water-buckets idea, without him even saying that this was a problem that needed solving. This was the true power of many people working together.

And he felt a swell of pride at having brought forth this awakening of their creativity. There was hope yet for humanity.

"Ah, of course. Surely it will take you quite some time to swallow all that and tell a story out of it," the boy on the stool said. "In the meantime, let us get started on the next one. What is the next demon?"

"Ah, the next demon," said Art, as he mused to himself. Were they ready for such a task as what he was going to place upon them? Then again, they had demonstrated ability enough, and he didn't have forever. Every week he waited was a week he'd lose and never gain back. He still had a few other demons planned for them to overcome, but it seemed like he could skip over them all now, all but the final one. "Well, I guess you are ready now."

A look of unease started to appear on some of their faces. "Ready for what?"

Art stood up and made a gesture to indicate he was referring to them all. "Look at yourself, then think upon what you've managed to achieve. Do you realize how far you've come? You've learned never to give up even against impossible odds. You've found just how capable you are at tackling challenges and coming up with solutions. You've understood the importance of working together and learned to delegate responsibility. You've started to get a glimpse of the enormity of scale involved with these kinds of undertakings, and just what could be done when you can have thousands work toward a common goal. You'll have to remember just how to use all that, if you are to succeed on this next quest."

"Just tell us already," shouted one among the audience, and many others nodded. "Yes, tell us!"

"Not so fast," he said. He turned to look at a guardsman sitting a short distance from him. "Good sir, there is something I absolutely must do. May I borrow your sword for a moment?"

"A sword's not a toy, boy."

"I promise you, this occasion truly is solemn enough to warrant it. I'm not going to do anything stupid, and if you think I do, I've never used a sword before, surely you can overpower me. You also have your fellow guards with you."

For a moment the guard wavered. Art smiled; him saying no would make him lose respect in front of all those arranged here. Then the guard replied, "A swordsman never parts with his sword," he said, glaring at Art.

"Do as he asks," said the boy-on-the-stool.

The guard started, his eyes bulged, as he whirled on the boy. "But my lord!"

Art just knew the boy was someone special. He turned around and asked who he was... Art's mouth gaped open. A prince? Here? Then he mentally slapped himself. Of course the prince would show up; Art had chosen the Hickory Hedge to be the main meetingplace precisely because it was in the most crowded place in town, right beyond the castle gates, and any boy would want to see what this crowd was all about.

"This should be interesting, now lend him your sword."

"Yes my lord," said the guard, unsheathing it and handing it over to Art hilt-first.

Art took it and turned to Jane. "You have passed the penultimate test. I would make you a member of the Order of Demonslayers. Do you accept?"

A smile passed over the children's faces even as the adults scowled. Of course the children would want to play at being knighted. He looked at Jane, waiting for an answer.

Blushing, Jane got on her knees. "Yes, my lord."

"I am no Lord," replied Art. He tapped the flat of the loaned sword on Jane's right shoulder, then her left. "I, a mere mortal, hereby dub you, Jane, First Knight of the Order of Demonslayers." To that the children answered with excited applause. Art then turned to the boy next to her, and asked the same of him. One by one he went, until all the children who were there had been dubbed, including those who had arrived there for the first time. After all, they too had seen what it took to come up with the answer for this episode. They too took the Lord's test. He returned the sword to the guard. "Will you, good sir, please do the same for the young lord? For I dare not do so myself."

A look of shock crossed the guard's face. "I can't, that would be---"

"Do it," ordered the prince.

"...Very well," said the guard, tapping his sword on the prince's shoulders. "I, a mere mortal, hereby dub you, Prince George, Knight of the Order of Demonslayers." He then returned the sword to his scabbard.

"Now then, Art," said the prince, "what is the final demon?"
