*Part 5 of 8*

When next Art arrived at the Hickory Hedge he found the inn crowded to full with several dozen familiar faces. Half the audience had come from the other inn he'd said he'd no longer be visiting. They had come to the Hickory Hedge to hear him tell his tale, and it wasn't all that surprising they'd decide on a whim to leave their usual inn, since these were all children. The newcomers chatted to each other about what they thought would happen next in the tale. Art called for attention, then had each of them take turns whispering in his ear what they thought would be Sir Amicus's next solution. Art noted that some had called for a bigger crossbow; others called for improved defenses.

"Interesting," said Art, eyes scanning the crowd of children before him. "Some of you have suggested we use something... big. How do you suppose we would protect it all? Come now, whisper your answers to me." After a brief pause, one of them skipped up to Art and whispered in his ear, and then another, and then another, until it seemed all of them had done so. Art nodded and smiled at them. "Some of you have come up with some really good answers."

So Art told of how Sir Amicus had met with his advisors, the other members of the Order of Demonslayers, asking what it is they could do about these full-fledged dragons. How they agreed to use a bigger crossbow, but that no such crossbows could be found in all the land, none of them had ever seen such a thing and neither did their contacts. Sir Amicus had then called upon the master craftsmen in the city to devise this new crossbow, as large as could readily be carried and used by any human, and soon they had created designs for the arbalest, followed soon after with several hundred of the actual thing. Having found that these took twice over as long as a regular crossbow to arm, Sir Amicus began training a hundred men in the working of the arbalests, and with the support of the local king had recruited another two hundred shield-bearers and another two hundred support staff.

He told of how the dragon shrugged off the bolts from these arbalests just as if they were the same as the normal crossbows even as it ravaged half the army, and how the survivors broke ranks and fled before its awesome might.

He told of how Sir Amicus, disgraced, nonetheless petitioned the craftsmen in his town to work on an even larger version of the arbalest, and after several months they presented him with plans for a ballista, an enormous crossbow set on wheels, followed a year later with three hundred ballista, paid for by the shared treasuries of three of the kingdoms, for one could not afford to pay for it all. And then his Order of Demonslayers marched, three hundred ballista carried by a thousand beasts of burden, accompanied by a thousand shield-bearers, and another thousand support staff, as large an army as any one king in that land ever had.

He told of how the dragon burned through half the Order, sending ignited pieces of ballista-shrapnel flying all over the battlefield and crushing entire squadrons with each sweep of its massive wings. Of how the well trained forces, protected from the brunt of the dragonfire by great tower shields covered in newly prepared animal hide and soaked in water to ward off the heat and the flame, held the line. Of how in the end the dragon, impaled by over a dozen great bolts and spraying its blood all over, had finally toppled. Of how, when this victory became well known, the kings of the other realms ordered their own ballistas built, that they could kill the greater dragons in their lands also.

"Who came up with all these ideas?" asked one of the adults.

Art smiled and gestured in a way that encompassed all the children. "Every one of them came up with something interesting. I couldn't use them all, so I just chose a few to use." He looked at the children in the audience. "Do any of you want to tell him which ideas you came up with?"

One of them boasted that he had come up with the idea for a bigger crossbow. Another retorted that it was his idea also, and then another said he'd come up with the ballista, "so take that". Art looked at the adults and saw their dawning sense of amazement, that these children -- some of them their own children -- weren't just kids any more, not if they could come up with such ideas all on their own.

"Actually, the two of us came up with that crossbow on a wheel idea together," said another, pointing at the first person who claimed the ballista idea. "He came up with the idea of a really, really big crossbow; I thought we'd need a cart with wheels to put it on."

"How did you come up with the idea together?" asked another.

"Well, we were discussing our ideas while we were waiting for Art to show up."

Art nodded. "Yes, and your friend here came up with the idea of using soaked hide to protect against dragonfire. That was brilliant. If you three had worked on it together you probably would have wound up with a crossbow-on-a-wheel-protected-from-dragonfire as a single idea."

"So what's next?" asked another. "What's the next dragon?"

"Oh, all the dragons are defeated now," said Art, resuming his tale. He told of how the next type of demon the Order challenged was a fire-bird, a monstrous bird made entirely of living flame which could, like fire, regenerate itself---

"What?" asked one of the kids, "How can the Order possibly take on something that's made of fire itself? You can't kill something like that."

"You've never put out a fire before?" asked another.

"Yes, but how---"

"Well, that's up to you to find out," said Art. "If you don't, then next week the story will be, the Order tries its best to fight the fire-bird, none can hurt it, they all die, they all did not live happily ever after, the end."

"No, you can't do that! That's not fair!"

"Well, as you very well know these fights only get harder and harder. You giving up already?"

"No way. We're not giving up that easily."

"That's the spirit!" said Art, and clapped his hands. "All right, that's it for today. Go home and think on it, I'll need your solution next Sunday."

"You know what," said one of the kids, "we should work together on this one." Several others turned to him. "The crossbow-on-wheels idea only really worked because those two worked on it together before getting here," he explained. "If we want the story to go on then we'll have to think of something good. We'll have to work together."

"Yeah, I want the story to go on too. Let's meet tomorrow evening, we live pretty close to each other anyway."

Art chuckled as he watched them leave. It had taken a lot of storytelling to get this far, but he could start to see the change had wrought on them, on their way of thinking.
