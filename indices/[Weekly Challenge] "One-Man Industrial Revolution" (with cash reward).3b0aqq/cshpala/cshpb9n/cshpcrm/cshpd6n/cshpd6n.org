*Part 4 of 8*

"Wouldn't he need someone to shield for him?" asked the barmaid.

"Exactly," said Art, relieved that someone had come up with an answer. He then told of how Sir Amicus had then hired a pair of guardsmen to go back to the lair with him. The dragonling flew out and breathed dragonfire, killing their mounts, but they themselves were protected under the guards' pair of large shields. Only when he had readied his arrows did he call out to them to part their shields that he may loose his arrows, and even then for just a moment, so that the dragonfire never touched his bow. But the dragonling's hide was too tough, and his bow could not penetrate it. Before long the shields, as they were made of metal, scalded too much to hold any longer, and the trio were forced to flee.

Art saw that several more children had sat down to listen to his tale. He asked of them, "so what do you think Sir Amicus decided to do next?" He saw them looking at each other, so he pointed to the one farthest to his left, and gestured for the boy to come close. "Whisper in my ear. First idea you thought of." The boy did so, and then Art asked for each of the others to do so in turn.

They did. But none of them had come up with anything workable. Two had just whispered, "no idea", before retreating back to their stools.

"You're shy, so you don't have to come out and say who you are, but one of you had got the answer just right," said Art, prompting all the other kids to look at each other. Art then told of how Sir Amicus had traveled the world looking for a ranged weapon more powerful than the great bow he used, and after traveling half the world had come upon a land where the soldiers used crossbows -- Art thought of these as he had seen his master make the metal parts for one once -- and he told of how Sir Amicus had realized that these took much longer to fire than a bow, so he'd needed many more people who could use them. Sir Amicus hired a company of two dozen crossbowmen and twice as many shield-holders, spent weeks drilling them so that they could work as a team and shoot at moving flying targets with precision. He then led the company to take on another dragonling.

He told of the devastation wrought by the dragonling in the ensuing battle, how the enraged dragonling struck out with fire and claw and tail and sent the men flying, and how the crossbowmen worked to reload their shots and the shield-bearers held up their red-hot shields as the dragonfire swept over rank after rank of them. How in the end the dragon, pierced at last by a couple of bolts out of the over one hundred that had been fired, had at last fallen, after having slain two dozen men.

He told of how Sir Amicus had cut out the dragonling's heart and brought it before the high king, of the hushed awe as people realized for the first time that yes, demons could indeed be slain. Of the dawning realization that came upon them, the idea that if they braved great dangers to slay each demon in turn, that one day they would live in a world without demons, a world without fear. And with that the king proclaimed Sir Amicus the First Demonslayer, and commanded him to seek out other demons and slay them, until the last day of his life. And Sir Amicus did so, slaying a good number of dragonlings. And given the great rewards heaped upon him, soon other knights set out to slay dragonlings on their own, and together they were proclaimed the Order of Demonslayers, a band of knights that were to be given free access and shelter no matter what realm they passed, for the order's mission was one shared by all the kings in all the land.

He then told of how the Order formed companies throughout all the land, and in a few short years the men had taken down all the dragonlings, so that the next most common threat was the dragons -- with larger bodies and thicker hides by far, against which entire companies of crossbowmen were incinerated. Suffering such heavy losses, the Order despaired, but Sir Amicus had known too many victories against what were considered impossible foes to back down now.

Art then looked to the audience. "Now, this question is for all us children here, so you adults, don't tell us. But kids, don't blurt out the answer either if you know it. This is the question: What do you think happens next, what do you think Sir Amicus could do next to defeat the dragon? Think on it, and let me know next Sunday. I'll continue the story then," he said to cries of dismay from the other children. He told them he'd taken enough time out of the day as it was, and the minstrel had many tales of his own to tell after all.

Art then went from inn to inn -- the town had several -- and retold his tale at each of them. His skill grew in the telling, so that more people listened to his tale each time. And each time, he told them that he'd be continuing his tale the following week; but at one inn he told the listeners he would no longer be visiting there, and that he would tell his story at the Hickory Hedge, and that if they wanted the rest of the story they should go there on the next Sunday.

At the last of those places one of the children had remarked on how smart Sir Amicus's solution was, to which Art had said it was not his idea. He'd then called out for the kid who had suggested the crossbow idea that time around, to please stand up and announce himself. Which he did, and Art thanked him for providing the solution, for surely had he not provided the solution, the story could not go on, and that Art was merely fleshing out the story based on the answer he had been given.

He felt relieved. He didn't know how long he could go on hiding the fact that it'd been his idea after all, but even if he fooled other people, the Lord's test was not to be fooled, and Art would need them to start coming up with their own answers before they ran out of time.
