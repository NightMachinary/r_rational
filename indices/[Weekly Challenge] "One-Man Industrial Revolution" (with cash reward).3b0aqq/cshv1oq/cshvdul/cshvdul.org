Finally something simple. I can manipulate the Head of Defence more easily than I could a dog if I had arsehole scented treats.

I even managed to get him front of a virtual plane monitor. They're about ten times more expensive, but offer a distinct advantage over competing products: they look fancy and high-tech. I suppose some people might also find dispelling them from existence fun and convenient.

I just need to not fuck this up, include enough ethnic slurs and I'll be good.

“Damn bloody Rullans! What can they possibly hope to get by infiltrating DoNS?”

“You've said it yourself many times sir, those Rufucks are as fanatical as they are stealthy. The fact that I got these codes and I'm still alive to tell you is a miracle. Throughout our time working together we've seen them at every corner, always with plots and schemes. And for the past few months we've seen nothing. You know what that means?”

“That their plotting and scheming has reached diabolical levels!!”

“Exactly sir.”

“We'll contact the loyal men, form a plan, and kill all these damn Rullies!”

“Sir, we /just/ matched those employee codes I got with your own private copy. So you /know/ they represent 95% of the employees, so its curious to me why you are expecting the remaining 5% to be truly loyal?”

“Are you calling me a traitor!?”

“Look, sir, the Department of Nanocrat Security has become the Department of Rullan Security. There is no time. Every second wasted is a second Cock Prullers gain in figuring out how to penetrate Fort N. With all the Rullan-pullin-schemers, all I can trust right now is action!” “You're God damn right, Johnson! But what action!?”

Two damn years and this guy still calls me Johnson instead of Will. It doesn't matter, just a little more to seal the deal.

“Sir, I have a plan. WE penetrate the fort before THEY do!”

“Amazing!”

“But that's not enough, sir! You see, we have to ask, once it's outside of Fort N, how are we going to keep it from the slimy hands of those Foollans? Well, I've concocted a little scheme of my own. Instead of protecting it in the open, we protect in secret. I've taken the liberty of writing a proposal to create a research group dedicated to creating a 'virus scanning device'. We'll have all the equipment we need to contain the nanocrat!”

“It's genius! Let's kill them all! What was the name of that ring leader?”

“Sam Pearson, sir!”

“Yeah, that guy, I hope I get to hear him scream.”

“Ok, ok, ok, I'll stop laughing for two seconds, lets take this actually seriously. Imagine if you take it to the extreme. You obviously wouldn't say it was /moral/ to implement worldwide child slavery if it meant a net increase of one paper clip.”

“I would.”

.....

There are upwards of three hundred guards that surround Fort N at a given time.\\
The Office of the Department of Nanocrat Security is located within 500 meters of the entrance to Fort N.\\
Assuming favourable conditions, a flamite infused carin gas strike from 13 N-Class artillery guns has an effective strike diameter of 750 meters.

.....

“pffffff-WHAT!?”

“Show me one piece of data that proves maximizing the amount of paper clips isn't moral.”

“Uuuuh, how about having slave kiddies causes a ton of suffering?”

“I agree it causes suffering

.....

When a victim comes in contact with flamite infused carin gas, the gas separates, with carin entering the lungs and flamite spreading across the skin.\\
Carin exposure causes loss of bodily control in the victim leading to vomiting, defecation and urination.\\
Flamite exposure causes melting of the epidermal layer of the skin, the dermal layer remaining sufficiently intact to continue sending pain signals to the brain.\\
Repeated ennite strikes, without interference, can effectively penetrate the strongest fortress.

.....

, I simply disagree that suffering is somehow a universal bench mark we can refer to that indicates something is 'morally bad'.”

“I just feel like we kinda solved that whole 'slavery equals wrong' bit about one or two hundred years ago.”

“The reason people now agree slavery is wrong is simply because over time values and preferences have changed. Now, there's not a shred of physical evidence to show those values are wrong, but the same is true of my values. And my values are just as resolutely in favour of paper clips as yours are opposed to slavery.”

“You're crazy.”

....

Exposure to a traumatic experience may result in the development of PTSD.\\
Those with PTSD may have difficulty in falling or staying asleep.

.....

“I'm just trying to do what I think is right. It's so painful, but I am willing to put everything on the line, my entire life for this cause. And you judge me crazy! Do you even give a shit about the morals you claim to uphold? Are you willing to give up the luxuries you indulge in for the sake of the child welfare you claim to believe in so much? There's so much you could be doing to help your cause, but you don't. I do.”

.....

Will felt it necessary to supervise the emergency extrication process.\\
Will was unable to keep himself from witnessing the sight of the convulsing bodies along the entrance to Fort N.\\
Will had difficulty in both falling and staying asleep.

.....

“I still can't believe you've made enough money to afford a warehouse full of paper clips and yet you live in this shithole.”

“I still can't believe I told you about this. I've never told anyone before, don't think I'll ever do it again.”

“Well, congrats on getting into the Department of Defence I guess.”

.....

I am steady on my course. My pain means nothing if I control it. There will be only paper clips.

--------------

“Congratulations on your promotion to head, and for now, sole researcher, Ms. Sarah Hopner. You are perhaps one of the most important scientists in the entire world.”

“But aren't we just making virus scanners? I'm still not even sure why someone with my expertise is heading this.”

“You want know the real reason behind the attack on Fort N? It's this:”

I gestured at the container of nanocrat infused kalarmite.

“It's virtuanano infused kalarmite. For decades we have been looking for a way to safely experiment with nanocrat. This virtuanano material behaves identically to nanocrat, except it only interacts in the virtual plane. If it grows out of control we can simply dispel it!”

Sarah's look of shock could electrocute someone.

“Wow! Just wow! I never would have believed it possible! This changes... everything! I'm so excited I'm shaking. We're making history, we will bring unending prosperity to all humanity! The medical implications alone are astounding! We could be immortal! The universe is ours to create utopia with!”

“Yes! And we have no time to waste! Your first milestone is just to get virtuanano material to replicate without any of the safe guards we will be developing for the actual nanocrat.”

“Well that shouldn't be too difficult at all, I can get that running by myself in a few months. I can start by isolating the-”

“-One question. Nanocrat only replicates if given something to make, correct?”

“Well, when Peterson proved it was possible to create an indefinite replication condition with nanocrat, and really any other potential material with a >1 Beta ratio, she also conclusively proved the process must begin with an initializing form. After an amount of time proportionate to an initializing half-life the nanocrat's teleporkinesis will cease, switching it from a self-replicating state to a form-replicating state. Do you have any form in mind?”

“Uhh, let me think... I guess paper clips are cool, how about that?”

“Sure” she said with a smile.

.....

“Thanks for staying up here, Will. I knows it's super late, but I'm almost done! I'm about to get some needless safety scan results, but the important bit is that all I'll have to do is an hour of tweaking after that and I'll be done! The tweaks are super simple too, even you could do it! Uh... no offense.”

“None taken. And I'm very proud of what you've accomplished so far, Sarah.”

“Ok I got the results, almost time for tweaking! Wait, this is odd. What the fuck!? We have to tell-wait-were you lying about... IS THAT A-”

.....

I dragged a corpse.\\
I spent some time tweaking a machine.\\
I waited.\\
I was consumed.

The universe was consumed.
