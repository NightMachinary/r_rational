Wow people disliked this enough to downvote it (at -1 at this time). I'm not too surprised, I felt there was a lot of issues in the storytelling and was pretty dissatisfied when I posted it. There's a lot of stuff that wasn't relevant enough or at least could have been far more concise. The structure was likely confusing. It was a bit unbelievable how well Will did, the methods he employed weren't that interesting, and the other characters didn't feel like they had enough agency. Those three things really hurt it from a rational/rationalist criteria. The bombing/talking scene was also ham fisted. It just felt... eh. There were more reasons I had for disliking it at the time but I've forgotten in the week since.

I still don't understand it completely though because I thought there were worse flaws in my first story and that one won. Perhaps I'm being too harsh on the first story/not harsh enough on this one? Is there just a lot of randomness to voting patterns?
