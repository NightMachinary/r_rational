It will save you some sanity if you install [[http://redditenhancementsuite.com/][Reddit Enhancement Suite]], which gives a "Live Preview" below the text box to show all of your formatting in WYSIWYG (including any subreddit specific CSS). Otherwise, search for Markdown documentation, since Reddit uses something that's 99% that. (Alternately, just link to Google Docs or something.)
