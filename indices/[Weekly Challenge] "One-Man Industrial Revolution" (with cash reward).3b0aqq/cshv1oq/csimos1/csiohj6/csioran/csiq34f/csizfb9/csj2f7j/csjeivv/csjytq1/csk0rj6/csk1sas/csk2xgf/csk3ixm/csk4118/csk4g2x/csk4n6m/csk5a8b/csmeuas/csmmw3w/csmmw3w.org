Again, I'm /not/ saying its an assumption that X set of actions is the set most probable to be /liked/. I'm saying that it is an assumption that set of actions X (which empirically is the most liked set) /should/ be done because it is the most liked. And I go further in saying it will always be the case that an assumption will exist regardless of the criterion because the concept of "I should decide which action set to take based on criterion X,Y,Z" is not referring to any feature of reality.

For example, if you used only references to features of reality could you explain to Will why he should do what he likes instead of maximizing paper clips (in a way that would convince him)?
