It isn't an assumption though. Specific actions and experiences release hormones that trigger positive emotions. You learn what you like through experience. And because doing what you like feels good you do more of it. Then you extrapolate and correlate with bigger picture things. And once you figure that other people are people too who also want to do things they like and to have things they like happen to them (which you do because of empathy which is also biologically driven) you apply making that happen to some degree too. To what degree depends on various factors. None of all that just springs forth from a vacuum like the values of your paperclip maximizing dude who for some reason can neither explain nor really seems to enjoy his own values.

And if you only donate out of some vague and abstract notion of minimizing world suffering and if that value seems as arbitrary to you as maximizing paper clips them maybe you should reevaluate your values.
