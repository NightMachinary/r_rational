The thing is that doing things because they are liked makes more sense than no reason at all. Those actions got reinforced by our very brains before the sentence "I should decide which action set to take based on criterion X,Y,Z" even made any sense. Simply because in this case criterion X,Y,Z = 'Warm and Fuzzy'.

So the question isn't how you would explain to Will why he should do what he likes. The question is how he got to maximizing paper clips in the first place. Or why he even thinks that that is the right thing to do even now.

There is a reason why there is no absolutely perfect moral philosophy under any criterion and why all the popular ones have obvious flaws in theory. It's because the groundwork for human morality evolved biologically. Now if Will had always been a person who got some kind of positive reinforcement, hope for positive reinforcement or at least expectation for positive reinforcement of loved ones or otherwise more deserving people (be they real or fictional) through the maximizing of paper clips then it would be understandable.
