After reading the post you linked (and a fair bit of the content linked in the post) I'm confused about how its relevant. Are you implying that a feeling of guilt is at play for Will and I? Will wouldn't feel guilty about not running himself ragged in the manner described in the article (that's simply irrational). More importantly he wouldn't even feel guilt about abandoning all work on maximizing paper clip amounts completely. The reason he does work as optimally towards the goal as he can is simply because that's what maximizes the value he chose. Its essentially accepted a priori. Much like me (except with my set of preferences, obviously).
