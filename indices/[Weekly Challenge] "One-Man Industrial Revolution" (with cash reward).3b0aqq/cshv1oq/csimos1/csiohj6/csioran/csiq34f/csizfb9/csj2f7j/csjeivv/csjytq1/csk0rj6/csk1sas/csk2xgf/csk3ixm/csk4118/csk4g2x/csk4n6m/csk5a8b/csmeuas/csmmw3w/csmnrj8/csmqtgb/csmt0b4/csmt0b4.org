  That's not what the alternative is. Its a comparison between the reasons "I like it", "it maximizes paper clips", and an infinite amount of other possible reasons.
#+end_quote

No that is not the comparison. "I like it" is not the priority value here (or at least it usually isn't) but the unconscious driving factor that plays a huge part in /forming/ our values over the formative years. Utilitarianism comes from "I like it and others like things too and I am no more or less than them". Religious values come from "Lots of stuff I like will happen if I do what they say and lots of stuff I don't like will happen if I don't". Those are what I compare maximizing paper clips to. How does a person get to putting "maximizing paper clips" above all else even though everyone tells him he is wrong, including his own body and reactions, while pretty much nothing tells him if or why it is right?

  I'm claiming "what should humans adopt as the criterion for what we should do" is not a question that refers to some feature of reality.
#+end_quote

I disagree. Anything that doesn't refer to any features within reality s by definition not real. Living according to pure detached fantasy makes no sense at all on no level whatsoever.

(Happiness=Good) + (Suffering=Bad) + (I am not special) = Universal Utilitarianism

(Happiness=Good) + (Suffering=Bad) + (I matter most) = Preference Utilitarianism

(Happiness=Good) + (Suffering=Bad) + (God=Infinite Happiness OR God=Infinite Suffering) = Classical Christian Morality

Maximizing Paperclips = ?

Theoretical AIs that are into maximizing paper clips are so because of human idiocy.

  I'll answer as Will: "Just as you have assumed as true that 'you should do what you like', I have assumed true that 'I should do what maximizes the paper clip amount'. I have assumed this true for as long as I can remember."
#+end_quote

"My values, while not very precise and imperfectly executed, are much more nuanced than 'I should do what you like'. 'I should do what I like' is just what gave me the impetus to first form values in the first place. And said values can be altered. Where did your need to 'do what maximizes the paper clip amount' come from and if you happen to be the only human you know who always had said value/need since age <3 then how come you never questioned its origin?"

And if Will's answer is that he didn't question it because questioning wouldn't lead to more paper clips then I don't consider him a person. Not because of his incompatible values but because in my opinion you need agency to be a person. And he clearly had his instilled from somewhere external.
