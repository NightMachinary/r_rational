  I disagree. Anything that doesn't refer to any features within reality [i]s by definition not real.

I absolutely agree with the second sentence (in fact my point would make no sense without it), but since you disagree it then sounds like you're implying it /is/ real. So it seems like you saying that the universal reason that one criterion for deciding actions should be adopted is a real object that actually exists in the universe. If this reason is a real object shouldn't I be able to ask questions like: Can you give me some of the physical characteristics of this object? What is its mass? Is this reason flammable? Where is it? [[http://existentialcomics.com/comic/36][Does it live in the forrest]]?

You can ask those questions about objects that exist in the universe and get answers. So why is it that you can't answer those same questions about a universal reason for adopting a criterion?

And Will's response:

"Its irrelevant how nuanced your values are, how they can change, or even what they are at all. The point is that the reason behind them isn't a real object that we can both observe. For example, "questioning my values" makes it sounds as though I can put my a priori assumption that "maximizing paper clips is the right criterion" in a lab and measure its density and rightness value."
