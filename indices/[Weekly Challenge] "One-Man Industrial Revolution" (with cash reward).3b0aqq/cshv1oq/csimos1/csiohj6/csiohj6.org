Yeah, I view(/tried to write) Will as someone who is just an empathic, compassionate human being trying to do what he genuinely feels is right, like the rest of us in every way. Its just that there is one small difference, what he feels is "right" is maximizing the amount of paper clips in the universe.

If you want to empathize with his actions, just imagine what it would be like to live in a world where everyone's values were as alien and wrong to you as ours are to Will. What might you do? How would you justify your "crazy" values like promoting global happiness or whatever it is you actually value? Are they even possible to justify?

edit: Oh and thanks for the feedback! I was considering making subtle tweaks to make Will feel more human, definitely going through with that.
