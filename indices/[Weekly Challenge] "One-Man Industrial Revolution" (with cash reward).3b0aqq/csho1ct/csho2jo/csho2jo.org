*Part 2 of 2*

......

As Roko watched the creature dying in front of him, he asked “What were you trying to do? I could never figure out your motives. Only what you wanted the eaters to do. To get into the caves.”

Roko tilted his head, “Why did you want to get into the caves? There's nothing worthwhile other than space and fresh water. There's plenty of that elsewhere. The only thing remotely unusual about our caves was the strange silver-like metal.”

It chuckled bitterly, “Yes, you realized I wanted the [[http://www.ccnr.org/salzburg.html][/yureinum/]]. By letting my spies find out about your ‘plans' to seal off your supposingly most-vulnerable caves to deny us easy access, you also threatened to prevent me from ever reaching my fuel. It was brilliant, I panicked when I realized that my only chance of stopping you would be to keep you from unblocking the dams to flood the caves and cause a rock-slide.”

Roko nodded, “I tricked you into rushing the eaters to all attack at once when you saw some of us moving towards the dam, but I already convinced the swimmers to break the dams themselves beforehand and drowned all of your forces. I was trying to kill you outright, but you managed to survive hitting the rocks even though most of the other eaters died.”

Roko leaned forward and bared his teeth, “Although, you know that wasn't what I was asking. Don't make me repeat myself again, what did you want?”

It looked up to him with a solemn expression, “I wanted to go home.”

Roko twisted his snout in confusion, “From what I heard, you impressed them so much when you first arrived that they would have given you anything you wanted. If you wanted them to follow you instead, then helping them to gain dominance over the other animals in the area would have made them less willing to leave. If you wanted something from the clan, there were easier ways to go about it than force. What other purpose could you have for all of this?”

It responded as it shifted its broken limbs. Roko stepped back in unease at its disregard for the pain that must be affecting it.

“Home is too far away by foot. I needed them to build me the tools to build a way to transport home. Your clan blocked my access to the energy source.”

Roko narrowed his eyes and flashed his teeth, “/Where/ is your home?”

It gave an enigmatic smile as it glanced over, “Did you know that the stars are the same as your Sun?”

It took a moment for Roko to understand. He snapped his eyes to the nighttime sky above him as he gasped in surprise.

/If the tiny stars are truly same as the Sun, then that could mean they are specks of the same things which make up the Sun...No, it implied that they all are the same, which means the stars have to be very far away, so far that I would never reach them. Not for lives upon lives of walking./

He looked down with eyes of understanding, “If there was a simple way of getting home, you would have gotten the eaters to build or fetch you what you needed. But you focused on changing how they lived. By growing their food and enslaving the grazers to control how they breed and who was culled, they changed completely. You even got them to practice single-paired mating. You also needed to change how they raised their /children!?!/”

Roko felt dizzy with shock, “That only makes sense if you expected to live for generations!”

It bared its teeth in a fierce snarl, “I didn't even intend to land on this plant! It was supposed to be a simple fly-by on the way to another colony.”

Roko stumbled backwards against a tree.

This was huge. Ever since Kiki's death, Roko never believed the elders' stories about how all sapients reincarnated from generation to generation. If that was true, someone would have told others their past lives. Without any memories, you weren't the same being from life to life. When Kiki died to save the clan, everyone had cried as if she been removed from existence, not as if she was going away for a long journey.

Even as Roko became the leader, he had been depressed at the thought that everyone would die and /would never ever/ */come back!/*

Even with his unusual understanding of how the eaters, rippers, grazers, flyers, swimmers, and diggers thought differently from each other, he could only help the sapients to work together in harmony. This only helped to have a better life. It didn't help all the animals to die any less often and painfully as part of the “Circle of Life”.

The “Circle of Lies” was more like it! None of the deaths and fighting was right, but Roko couldn't think of any way to help and was nearing depression...until /it/ came.

If it was possible for one being to become immortal, then it could be possible for everyone to become immortal.

Roko looked at with narrowed eyes. It wasn't in pain and it didn't even seem very worried. As if it only had to worry about capture by hostile forces, not as if it would be dying.

“If you are immortal or very long-lived, then that means there is something unusual about your body which has a possible chance of being passed on to others. You also have shown an utter disregard for the lives of others. You will only use others for your goal of departure. You are too dangerous to be allowed to live.”

Realization and fear slowly began to dawn upon it's face.

Roko moved in to eat.
