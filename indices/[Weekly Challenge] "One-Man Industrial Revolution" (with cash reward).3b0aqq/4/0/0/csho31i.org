*Part 3 of 2*

......

For anyone who may be confused by the slang I used:

- eaters = omnivores

- rippers = carnivores

- grazers = herbivores

- swimmers = anything that spends most of its life in water

- flyers = anything that spends most of its life airborne

- diggers = anything that spends most of its life underground

- sapient = the uplifted animals refer those who can communicate as sapient

......

*Backstory and Inspiration*

......

I came up with this idea when I was watching /The Lion King/ and thought to myself; /what would it be like to be inserted into a world of talking animals?/

Thus the idea of humans who [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpliftedAnimal][uplifted animals]] and left the planet for them alone was born. To create the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManIndustrialRevolution][One Man Industrial Revolution]], I had the humans lose contact with Earth and experience a collapse in space-faring technology. After they rebuilt from their space colonies, they forgot where Earth used to be. When ‘it' arrived, it had crashed landed on a plant by accident. The ‘sapient' animals refer to it as an ‘it' due to it's clear differences from them and their inability to figure out it's gender (it doesn't have one as a post-human).

It was also drastically weakened because it requires large amounts of energy which was stored on the destroy ship. It was reduced to moderately well above base-line human physical levels to conserve energy. Of course this means that many sapient animals are stronger than it.

It mainly relied on it's intelligence to convince the animals to follow it and used it's knowledge to help the eaters become powerful.

Roko is a grown-up animal Disney protagonist who went on a journey to save his clan and ended up suffering a tragic loss with the death of his female love interest, Kiki. As a result of Kiki's death, Roko went on to become the youngest leader of his clan in recent history. The sequel 'movie' is him uniting multiple animal tribes to work in harmony instead of the usual predation/fighting and becoming a leader of leaders. I left out any physical descriptions because after centuries to millennia of evolution, they would have become extremely different in appearance from modern-day animals and I wanted to leave Roko's species up to the reader's imagination.

For anyone who might have felt grossed out, morally or physically, by Roko's...er...eating it, I would like to point out the fact that he lives in a world where many animals are intelligent and he is a meat-eater (carnivore or omnivore). This means that he frequently has to hunt down prey which are sapient and can communicate well enough with him to plead for mercy. While he can empathize (a rarity for any creature to have empathy for those outside of their species), he still needs to hunt intelligent creatures for survival. Thus eating it is not an unusual idea.

Sorry if you guys were expecting a longer story due to the three parts, but I felt it was important to separate everything into three different comments due to the difference between a narrative summary and a dialogue as well as a backstory to explain any facts that I couldn't sneak inside the actual story itself. If I was a more motivated writer, I would expand this into an actual novel, but the climax scene was the only interesting part to write. The rest of it was simply set-up for the scene.
