*Roko's Journey*

......

*Part 1 of 2*

......

/How do you beat an enemy who is smarter than you in every way?/

/You don't. You don't try to out think them. You don't face them in their area of strength./

--------------

Roko is hidden in the shadows observing. Patiently waiting for it to come. The preparations were complete. The only thing left to do is to wait and watch the trap work or fail.

--------------

/If you have an opponent with overwhelming intelligence, you force them into a contest where intelligence doesn't matter. Forcing a battle of speed, strength, or even specialized knowledge is the first step./

--------------

The creature first arrived in a storm of fire and destruction. When it came out of its shell after three days, the area around its violent impact was just beginning to recover.

Many wanted to kill it out of fear of what it could do and numerous others saw it as a godly figure with command of powerful fires. With multiple conflicting reactions, only one thing was agreed on, it was /dangerous/.

--------------

/However, the most important thing to remember about intelligence is the fact that intelligence is/ */adaptable/*. /A truly intelligent being will be able to learn quickly and adjust for any difficulties once aware of potential handicaps./

--------------

When the most curious eaters first encountered it, there were threats of violence as the eaters attempted to test if it was edible and display their strength in a show of dominance. Within a few days, it rose to high social status in the tribe of eaters as the right-hand of the newest chieftain, Zebe, one of the first eaters it successfully approached with an offer of cooperation.

--------------

/Therefore to nullify the opponent's advantages, one must also use surprise to strike the first blow. Even the most intelligent and powerful opponent can lose to a stupid and weaker opponent with the benefit of surprise./

--------------

Whispering into Zebe's ear, it managed to push forward numerous dramatic changes to how the eaters lived. It taught them to bury seeds in the earth in intricate ways and to preserve their prey to have plentiful tasty young. With a sharply reduced focus on hunting and gathering, the eaters spent less time migrating from area to area.

--------------

/However the enemy will be aware of its weakness and be suspicious of any situations which will lure it into a position of vulnerability./

--------------

Due to the eaters switching from a nomadic lifestyle to a stationary one, they rapidly expanded their territory. With it providing unusual weapons and tactics for attacking, no sapient could stop them. Within a few years, the eaters encountered Roko's enormous clan of rippers, grazers, flyers, swimmers, and diggers.

--------------

/Therefore one needs to use bait./

--------------

It didn't take long for Roko's clan to realize the source of the eaters' strength. After capturing some of the eaters for information, the leaders quickly amassed an idea of it's motivations. They understand it to be very weak physically, but extraordinarily smart and knowledgeable. Cooperation was impossible since it wanted unrestricted access to the caves leading below the mountains. The same caves where Roko's family lived. As the leader of leaders, Roko was the one to come up with a deceptively simple plan to trap it.
