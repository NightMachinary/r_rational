*Ending the Ending (part 1 of 8)*

[[http://fiction.wikia.com/wiki/Ending_the_Ending][Complete story can also be read HERE]]

At the end of the day Art had come back to his home to find his home burned down. After he had gotten over the shock of it, he turned to ask, "Dad, where's mom?"

His dad hugged him. "Son, your mom's not going to be coming back home today."

"What? Why?"

"All you need to know is that she'll be away for a while."

"Dad, when's she coming back?"

"Not for a very long time."

"I want to see mom, now," Art said.

His dad sighed. Listen, son, I need you to act all grown up, you understand? Since mom's not going to be here to take care of you."

"No," Art said, turning to look away. "Where's---"

"Arthur."

Art turned back, frown on his face and tears forming. "Why can't she come back? What are you not telling me?" His dad hung his mouth open. Art repeated, "tell me!"

"She's passed away. Art, mom's dead."

"What does that mean?" asked Art, but even as he asked, the tears flowed, and he gripped his dad's arms. "What's it mean, she's dead? Dad, what happened?"

"It means, it's just us two now." Tears in his eyes, his dad wrapped Art's head in his arms. Art snuggled against his chest, sobbing into his plain white shirt. "Just us."

For a long while they held their embrace.

Finally his dad leaned back and looked at Art with a thin smile, then wiped away the tears on Art's cheeks. "Art, you're a big boy now. Boys don't cry. Come now, your tears are getting on our clothes. Do you know how much it costs to buy a new one?"

Art let go and wiped away his tears. "You were crying too."

"You're right, I was," said his dad, and Art chuckled, even as more tears flowed down his cheeks.

"I'm glad I still have you, dad. You're going to stay with me forever, right? You're---"

His dad chuckled. "Yes---"

"---not going to be dead one day too, right?" said Art, staring up at him. His dad's smile wavered. "Right, dad?" His dad didn't answer. Art shuddered. "Oh no. Not you too, dad. I can't stand to lose you. Why would you ever want to be dead?"

"Son, no one wants to die."

"Then why does anyone die?"

"It's not our choice, Art. Everyone dies, sooner or later."

"Everyone dies?" asked Art. His dad stared at him, silent. Art shook his head, then shook his head some more. "No. It can't be. Dad, you told me that if someone ever beats me up, I have to fight back. Girls can just cry, but boys have to do whatever they can to defend themselves."

"Yes, and you damn well should, or they'll just keep on hitting you."

"So why hasn't anyone done anything about this dying thing? Why hasn't anyone fought back?"

"I said only fight back if you're being bullied by someone your own size, otherwise you must run away. Does death look like a bully your own size?"

"No, but you said we can't run away from death, so it's not like we have any choice but to fight back."

His dad snorted at him and shook his head. "Look at you, just heard about death a moment ago and already you're thinking about fighting it." He patted Art on the head. "You're young, son, there's many things you don't know."

"You keep saying that," said Art, arms akimbo.

"Everything is born, lives, then dies. It's the way things are. Sooner or later it catches up to everyone. No one can avoid dying forever. No one can fight death."

"Well has anyone even tried?"

"Many have. But they have all died, in the end."

.......................................................................

No matter how hard he tried, Art couldn't run away from fire. In the cold of the winter nights he'd huddle close to the fire in the middle of his home -- it had been a few years and the other villagers had helped rebuild -- he'd needed the fire to keep going, or he and his dad would freeze. But he didn't like it. Fire still reminded him of death, and that indoor fire was going to burn their house down again one day, just like it had once before.

Much as people feared fire, they needed it even more. Only by candle and torchlight could one see in dark of night. Only by cooking-fire could one roast raw meat. Only by forge and smelter could one work a slab of metal. Too much fire and one died; too little fire and one died also.

But did they have to like it?

Here he was at the Hickory Hedge inn, listening to minstrels spin their tales of heroes and quests, and this latest tale just had to be of a knight in shining armor vanquishing a dragon, one that just happened to breathe fire.

As Art listened, it struck him as strange how in these stories the lone hero or the hero plus a tiny following would always go and win the day. It didn't seem possible that all the big problems of the world could each be solved by one knight going it alone. If he were sent to fight a dragon... Well, he'd give up and run away, but if he couldn't actually flee the dragon forever, he'd find other people to help him. Having more people fight a dragon would make it that much easier, so why didn't they? Despite the stories saying these knights were fighting dragons, from the way these stories played out it sounded like these knights of old had never ever come across a truly challenging foe. That or they were stories.

The minstrel had just finished another tale to much applause, and one of the listeners had told the barmaid to fetch another round of ale.

"Storyteller," asked Art, "Why is it that in all these tales of dragon slayers, there's only ever the one hero, or at most a few companions? Why do they never arrange for a large group of skilled knights?"

"Oh, looking to become a bard yourself?" the minstrel replied, then looked around at his audience, some of whom snickered at Art. "Now, what story should I tell next?"

Art took a moment to realize he'd just been made a fool of by the minstrel. Who was he, to treat him so? It seemed every adult in his life thought he wasn't worth taking seriously. Well, it was time he changed that. "I'll tell a story," said Art, prompting a sour look from the storyteller and raised eyebrows from the patrons.

"Is it going to be as good as the ones he tells?"

"Have you ever told a story before, boy?"

"Well, no---"

"Who wants the honor of being the first to listen to the first story the kid has ever told?" That got laughs out of the others.

"And why are you trying to tell us a story when you've never been apprenticed to a storyteller? Maybe you can make a story out of that," said another.

"Just listen to my tale, you'll like it," said Art, and he made up a story of a dragon slayer on the spot.

...They didn't like his tale. From the start he was beset by barely contained laughter, grunts of derision, and a flood of pointless questions, and his storytelling ground to a halt. Finally the minstrel put an end to this travesty by raising a hand and asking the patrons, "Any of you want to hear the Song of Roland?" And that was that, all the heads turned to the storyteller. Cheeks flushed with embarassment, Art fled the Hickory Hedge.

As he walked home his mind dwelt on how poorly his story had been received. Why? He asked himself. They didn't like that he was telling a story about a dragon slayer hero, just like all the others. But why? Why was he even telling a story about a dragon slayer hero at all? He'd never encountered a dragon himself, and he'd not received any training from any of the storytellers. Who was he to think he could enchant an audience with mere words? And was that minstrel so much better than he was? Well, yes, probably. But why was he better? That, he could find out. All he had to do was swallow his pride and recognize that yes, the minstrel was better and he could learn by listening to him weaving his tales.

He turned around and marched back to the Hickory Hedge.

"Back with another story, boy?" said the first patron who caught sight of his return.

"No, just to listen."

"Well sit down then, and learn from the master," said the minstrel, then continued with his song.
