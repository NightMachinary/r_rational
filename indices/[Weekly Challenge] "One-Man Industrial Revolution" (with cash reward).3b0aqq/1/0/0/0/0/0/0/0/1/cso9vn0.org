Going from inventing Firefighters to "defeat death" is a big hurdle to jump. Personally I would have liked to see something akin to EMTs/Ambulances (but better) get a proposal and for the Prince to set the fire fighting plan in action. Then, Art continues his story as the world changes and only when he grows older does he propose the final "enemy" to defeat.

But I really liked it! It starts off slower than the Fable of the Dragon-Tyrant and the child who speaks out does a MUCH better job becoming the protagonist in encouraging youthful creative collaboration to invent endings to real world problems (rather than "make big bombs" which strikes me as the wrong method to defeat the dragon-tyrant.)
