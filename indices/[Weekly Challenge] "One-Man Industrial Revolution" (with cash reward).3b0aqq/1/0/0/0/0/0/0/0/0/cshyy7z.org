Holy cow!

It's really rare for me to read a story where I know what the ending will be like in advance and still be surprised by the execution.

Seriously, the characters had so much passion during the knighting I felt cheered that such people were going to battle death.

Bravo, bravo.

PS If you wanted to include line breaks where you have a row of periods, just replace it with four dashes (----) on an empty line.
