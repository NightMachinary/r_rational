*Part 6 of 8*

Art had then gone on to tell his story at the other inns, this time telling them all that he'd no longer be meeting at those inns but would be continuing the story at the Hickory Hedge the following Sunday. So when the following Sunday came around he found a hundred children, half of them packing the inn and the rest spilling out onto themarket street outside. Several guardsmen had been called over to keep order. As Art approached several of the children recognized him and gestured at him, and soon a hush fell over the crowd.

Art welcomed them all and then proceeded to ask them for their solutions. He noticed that about a quarter of them refused to whisper anything to Art and instead pointed at one of the children in particular. "All right, Jane, let's hear it," he said as he turned to her. "All the children are looking at you."

Jane went up to Art's ear and whispered to him.. and whispered some more, and somemore.

"Wow," was all Art managed to say. He then turned to the rest of the children, who went to whisper their solutions to Art.

Art resumed his story, drawing upon Jane's whispered answer. He told of how it was decided that the firebird must have been hiding somewhere when it rained, since the incessant falling of water -- even though it could not completely extinguish and thus kill the firebird -- would weaken it, and it would thus avoid it. So all over the realms the guards went about asking the peasants -- and anyone else for that matter -- who knew where caves could be found, to let the Order of Demonslayers know. The Order then dispatched teams to close off those caves, piling up masses of rock and earth, since it was believed the firebird, having no physical body, couldn't simply blast their way through earth. When this was done, there were few places left in all the realm where a firebird could hide from the rains.

He told of how, when the Order of Demonslayers tried to collapse the final cave, the one the firebird was using as its abode, the firebird had attacked, breathing gouts of flame at the Order and burning them to death while sending them scattering. Sir Amicus and the council of all the kings of the land - so expensive had the expedition become, that cooperation from all the kings had become necessary - had then ordered the construction of a dozen trebuchets, massive constructs capable of lobbing boulders a great distance, all of them covered in soaked hide to protect them from dragonfire, and had them brought up to just three hundred yards away from the cave entrance while it was raining. The ground, all muddy from the downpour, would have caused these siege engines to sink into them if it weren't for Sir Amicus' prescience in bringing a great many wooden rafts to pave the ground over which these trebuchets advanced. This wooden path was covered in a thin layer of mud so that they wouldn't catch fire, though not enough mud for the siege engines to sink into. When the trebuchets were brought in close enough, they launched boulder after boulder at the cave entrance, forcing the firebird out of hiding. It withered in the rain, but survived and flew toward the awaiting army nonetheless.

He told of how the Order had also prepared still more catapults to launch water at the approaching firebird. They needed tons of water, as a great deal of it had to strike all of the firebird all at once in order to put it out. The constant stream of water came from large wooden pans laid out on the ground to catch the rainwater, enough pans to cover all the nearby plains, and they refilled with rainwater as fast as they could be used. Eight hundred catapults launched water into the skies, each launch carrying enough water to put out a firebird, but the water blasts sprayed all over and none could actually extinquish the bird alone. Yet they kept striking it, so that the firebird glowed as a cloud of steam and flame. It attempted to strike at the trebuchets, but the catapults kept a constant torrent of water flying over them, warding off the firebird, so the trebuchets continued their work, launching boulders to block off the cave entrance. For hours they kept this up. Thousands lay dead, burned to a crisp, their shields melted. The firebird, weakened by the rain and barrage of water blasts, was extinguished in the end.

When Art finished telling the battle scene, the inn was all quiet, so intently did everyone listen to his tale. Then one by one the children started clapping, and soon the adults joined in.

"Damn that was a hell of a fight," said one of the adults. "Jane, did you come up with all that?"

"No," she said, and she beamed. "It was the effort of a great many of us. So many things had to be covered." She started counting fingers. "One was how the firebird could survive in the rain, what could we do about its hiding place. We had a team work on that." Four had been on that team; one had thought of caves, another of blocking off the caves, another of warding off stone buildings which would act like caves, and another the idea of getting mass cooperation in locating them all. "After that, two was how to block off the entrance to the caves." She pointed at another team; they'd come up with the trebuchets, capable of launching rocks from a long distance, as well as the particulars of how something like that would have to work; as well as the idea that the firebird would come out to defend its own cave. "Three was how to use the water. We had a team for that too." She explained how they'd realized that the fight would have to be in the rain, how one of them had thought of water-catapults, drawing on the ballista idea, another had thought of pans to collect the rainwater and funnel them, another the solution to everything sinking in into the mud. One had even calculated how long it would take to launch one of those water-catapults, and thus how many would be needed to maintain a constant barrage of four per second throughout the entire engagement, as well as all the logistics behind the entire operation including how much rainwater would need to be collected how quickly and how many people would be needed to man the entire operation. She finished saying, "We wouldn't have been able to devise the solution without all three teams working together."

"You all are damn brilliant, you know that?" Art said, eyes watering. "You've thought of everything. You've managed to find a solution to something we all thought was impossible just last week. Well done." Many of them cheered in triumph.

"Yeah, we figured there had to be a solution and knew we couldn't just give up. And as we realized last week, we work best when we work as a team. So we thought we'd all work together on it, and come up with our answer."

"All right," said Jane. "Now that we've killed the firebird, what does the Order take on next?"

Art smiled. Good, his audience wasn't about to give up yet, which meant there was hope for them after all. So he told of how with the killing of the firebird it had become apparent that there was another demon of flame, a phoenix which could live so long as any flame burned anywhere. A demon of flame that could manifest in an unsuspecting peasant's indoor fire and instantly set the entire house aflame, then be in another house a second later.

"So let me get this straight," said one among the audience. "We're supposed to make it so that for one moment, there isn't a fire anywhere."

"Yep."

"Anywhere, in all the world."

"Yep."

"When there's a flying demon that's literally made of fire."

"Yep."

"Is able to set fire to anything it touches."

"So long as it can burn."

"It can disappear and reappear out of any other flame anywhere in the world, at any time."

"Yep."

"And you can't extinguish it because if you do manage to put it out, it is instantly reborn out of another fire."

"Exactly."

"Oh Lord," the boy said, hanging his head.

"This is going to take more than just an army," said another.

"It is impossible." Several nods of agreement.

"That's what we said last time, about the firebird. We managed to put it out anyway."

"Yea, but this firebird can't be put out."

"No, it's possible. I'm sure it is."

"Sure, when there isn't a single flame left anywhere in the world. Hell will freeze over first."

"That's right," said Art, standing up. "There's no way you can defeat this one. You're going to fail," he said with a grin, then headed off down the street. Art smiled as he left. There was no way they were going to live that down.
