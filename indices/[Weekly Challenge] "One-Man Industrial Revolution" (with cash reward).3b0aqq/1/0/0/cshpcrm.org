*Part 3 of 8*

That evening Art had thought back on his thirty other ideas and applied Master Smith's reasoning to them. For them to effectively prevent death, all of his ideas required wide-scale applications. Many required substantial materials, and he doubted that people would be willing to part with that much of what little they had. Others he knew could be done but required maths and expertise which he knew he didn't have. And without being the son of a noble, merchant or scholar, he doubted he'd ever get the maths down. Several more would be awfully hard to convince people to agree to, simply because they were tedious. One by one he'd crossed them off his list, until only two were left, and he himself wasn't in any position to make those two happen, either.

It was three months since he started brainstorming solutions to death, and he had nothing to show for it. At this rate he was never going to get to ten thousand. At this rate he was going to fail the Lord's test as badly as everyone else.

Which reminded him, this was about the most darned hard test there ever was. And the most unfair. Why was he expected to achieve as much as a king, in as little time, when a king had a whole kingdom at his command? Why were women expected to achieve as much as men could, when women were expected to do as their parents, husbands, and sons told them to do, and not encouraged to think on their own? For that matter, were babies really expected to do something about death before they died, as often happened, within the first few months of being born? Why did death not come for everyone only when they all reached the same age? Then he pondered on the sermons Father Walters had given and remembered the Lord didn't care much for being fair. Or being easy on his children, for that matter.

So what was he to do? Well, what would Saint George the dragonslayer do? Art wondered.

Saint George would probably charge at it with his lance and stab the dragon with it. Great lot of good that role model was. Art just had to stab the dragon to death. Right. If Art kept putting out every fire he came across, he'd not last a winter. And Saint George would ride at it all by himself, the lucky idiot. What if the dragon had stayed in the air and never landed, and breathed fire down at the knight? Armed with just a lance, Saint George would have had no idea how to fight back. Without anyone who could shoot arrows at the dragon, he was doomed. The dragon would have burned him to a crisp for being such a moron that he didn't go recruiting allies first. Whoever made up that story had clearly never fought a dragon. Art was fighting a dragon now, and that story wasn't really helping.

Art smacked his head. It was so obvious. He needed allies. He was a knight fighting a dragon who kept staying in the air, and he needed people who could shoot it down.

But he was but a boy, a son of a farmer and apprentice to a smith, which made him a nobody thrice over. How in all the world was he going to convince someone to join him on his quest?

In the stories he had heard, in those few stories where the hero didn't travel alone, he had garnered a band of fellow adventurers from an inn. Well, he could start there. Art started walking toward the Hickory Hedge, and as he did yet another idea started taking shape. He had no money to give to anyone, to encourage them to join him on his quest. He had nothing to give, except a dream of hope, a way of thinking, and a tale with which to convey them both.

And as he had to work the other days of the week, he would have to do this on the Sundays. Art knew the Lord had commanded that no work be done on Sundays, for it was His holy day. But telling a story wasn't exactly work, either. And the deadline of the Lord's test came one day closer on Sundays as surely as it did on every other day of the week.

.......................................................................

Another minstrel now sang at the Hickory Hedge, this time singing a ballad that Art recognized as a love song. Ordering a drink, he sat down and listened to it, picking up the verse structure, the voice, the emotional undertones. Years of listening and paying careful attention to what made a story work -- as opposed to its story -- had given him a hint of how much better the masters were than he could ever hope to be, but it had taught him much.

As the round of applause subsided, Art praised the ballad for its excellent style, and praised the minstrel for his excellent taste in choosing that particular ballad. The minstrel smiled as that prompted the patrons to pass a few copper pieces his way. Then he asked them if they had heard of the story of the Order of Demonslayers and their grand quest to rid their realm of a great host of demons. To which they all said no, which of course they did not, for Art had made that up. "Ah, but then you have been missing out on a most unique tale," he said. He gave a nod to the minstrel. "It shall be quite an honor to pass along such a tale to one as worthy of the retelling of it as you." To which the minstrel could only nod.

So Art began. He told of a land far away, a world blessed with bountiful harvests, but also a world threatened by demons -- large flying monsters of all sorts. The lesser ones were dragons, but the others were far more terrible, and they were not dragons at all. And there were so many -- thousands upon thousands of them, and they struck with barely any warning, all over the land, making it so that even in such a land where none had known the fear of starving, all the people lived in fear, for they knew that one day they would meet their doom. Sooner or later, everyone wound up in the gullet of one demon or another. It was thought that the demons could not be killed, so hard were their plated hides. For as long as anyone could remember, in even their oldest tales, there had been these demons. They always were.

With relief Art noted that his audience was not as quick to cut him off as they had been the last time around.

He told of how, in this land a very skilled knight by the name of Sir Amicus had become known not just as the greatest knight in the land, but the greatest knight ever. But Sir Amicus was not satisfied with merely unseating other knights. He wanted to challenge something greater than any human, and for that he looked up, and the demons who ruled the skies above all.

He told of how Sir Amicus had set out on horseback for a demon's lair, bow and shield in hand. He had chosen the lair of one of the smallest types of demons, a mere dragonling. But as he was about to shoot, it blew a torrent of flame at him. He raised his shield just in time, but as the dragon kept breathing fire at him, he realized he'd never have the chance to nock an arrow, let alone loose one. He tried again, this time for a moment too long, and the dragonfire caught his bow and burned it away. As he fled, the dragonling flew after him, breathing more fire upon him. He was protected by his shield, but his mount had no such protection, and was roasted alive. Sir Amicus was forced to hide in a nearby cave, one that was too small for the dragonling to enter, and with his shield he blocked the dragonfire. There he was trapped, for the dragonling guarded the one exit and attacked the moment Sir Amicus tried to leave. Only after feigning his death and waiting three days so that the dragonling was convinced he was dead, did Sir Amicus manage to escape, but he vowed even as he did so that he would never to give up until he had slain the dragonling.

Art looked about and noticed that two of the children who had been playing about the market stalls outside had come into the Hickory Hedge, listening to his tale of knights and dragons. He asked them, "But Sir Amicus remembered why he hadn't been able to get off any arrows. He couldn't use a shield and a bow at the same time. So, any guess what he did next?"

The children stared at him, then looked at each other, but neither ventured to speak.

Art looked around, hoping someone would give a reply. "Anyone have an idea?"
