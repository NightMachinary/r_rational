*Part 2 of 8*

"Come in," said Father Walters.

Art entered. "Father."

"Art, my good lad, what counsel may I give you today?" he said with good cheer.

"Father, I have had this one question I've been meaning to ask for a few years now, ever since..."

The smile faltered. "Oh, might this have to do with---"

"Yes. Father, I'm not looking for a comforting answer on this one, just an honest one. Why is there death in this world?"

Father Walters looked to the window. "It seems you have been thinking on this for a long time now. It's not quite the healthy thing to be like so. You are young, you have your entire life ahead of you, but you need to move on, or you will just wallow in despair and make nothing of your life."

"Yes Father, I understand. I know I'll have to move on, and stop thinking about her being dead. But death -- I don't think I can forget that. I don't think I can stop thinking about it, either. Not at least until I know why it happens."

"Ah, that I can help you with," said Father Walters as he opened up his bible. "The question of why evil, and death, exists in the world can be traced back to the beginning. When the Lord created the garden of Eden, and filled it with all manner of living things, He also created two trees -- the tree of life and the tree of knowledge of good and evil. And the Lord warned Adam against eating the second tree, saying that 'in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die'."

"Yes, but why? Why would He put such a tree there?"

"We cannot hope to guess for what grand purpose He put such a tree there. We are after all ignorant of His ways."

"But Father, does the Lord not explain why He makes such a thing of death?"

"A young child may not understand when he is told to always return home before nightfall, and will not be able to understand his parents' reasons, so his parents need not bother to explain the why of it. But surely you're old enough to know why now, now that you are old enough to understand. We are as children before the Lord, and He need not explain Himself to us. It is enough to know that death is our punishment for the sins of Adam and Eve, for having not obeyed the Lord."

"Surely, Father, this sin is to be placed on Adam and Eve, for not listening to the Lord, for which they had died. But why would it be placed on us?"

"The sins of the father pass onto his children also. And this greatest of sins, of disobeying the Lord's one commandment at a time when only one had been given, was a crime so great that any number of lifetimes and any number of lives cannot wash it away. May that be a lesson you always remember, to guide you in your times of temptation, to always walk the path the Lord has given us, that you should avoid being punished also."

"I shall remember this and always walk in the path of the Lord. Thank you for your guidance, Father. I have much to think upon, and even more to learn," said Art, and with a bidding of farewells he left. As he walked down the dirt path to his home, he pondered:

Adam and Eve had been punished for stealing from the tree. But their children were also punished. Sure, thieves who steal are to be put to death. But would their children be put to death?

They were punished for eating from the tree of knowledge of good and evil, and not for eating from the tree of life. But the Lord was all-powerful, there was no need for Him to put a tree of temptation there. If He didn't want Adam and Eve to eat from it, then He would simply not have put the tree there in the first place.

Unless it was a test.

A test with two choices, to eat from either the tree of life or the a tree of death, where the correct choice was to eat from the tree of life, but the latter tree was the more tempting. A test that Adam and Eve had failed, and they were punished with death for the failing of it. A test that people must still be failing to the present day, that they be punished with death for failing it.

And yet they failed it anyway, they continued to eat of the tree of temptation, for all its temptation distracted people from the fruit they should be reaching out for. Distractions, such as tilling the soil, and cooking one's food, and trading of wares, and sleeping each night, and playing one's leisure time away.

They were all throwing their time away. They were all sinning.

And so they were all dying.

And that realization made him freeze in place.

The Lord had given Art His test, and Art was well on his way to failing. And failing meant death.

.......................................................................

Truth was, Art had no idea how he would go about fighting death.

He had kept track of all the ways people could die, and then despite his best efforts had lost track, there were so many. He gave up trying to count how many ways there were and just assumed there were ten thousand. That was such a large number he didn't think there could be more than ten thousand of anything. He then figured someone would have to come up with a way to prevent each of those ways of dying. Ten thousand inventions. Yes, other people could come up with those ways too but as he'd looked around and asked around, it seemed no one was interested in coming up with any of them, which meant he, Art, would have to invent them all.

With a bit of math from his friend the son of a local merchant, Art had figured out that assuming he'd lived to be forty, he had just enough days left in his life to come up with one invention per day and finish before he died. So he figured that's just what he'd do: one invention per day.

At first one invention per day wasn't that hard to come up with. With each one he thought up he exulted, knowing he was getting one step closer to successfully finishing his test. But then new ideas started coming more slowly. And now it had been a week since his last idea. Three months had passed, and so far he'd come up with thirty-one.

So he decided it was about time he started making his inventions, his ideas, into reality.

While tending to the forge Art turned to ask Master Smith. "Master, I have an idea."

"Oh, you have an idea?" said the smith, not bothering to look at his apprentice as he continued hammering away at his red-hot knife.

"I call it the big row of buckets," said Art. "The idea is simple. You have a whole bunch of these buckets in your home, all of them filled to the brim with water."

"And pray do tell, what is a man to do with such a, what did you call it, 'row of buckets'?"

"You could use it if ever the house caught fire."

"Oh. That's it?"

"Well... yeah, that's all it's supposed to do."

His master chuckled while shaking head. "Sounds like a silly idea to me."

"It's not silly," said Art. He muttered, "it would have saved mom's life." When the house had caught, they'd resorted to passing bucketfuls of water from the village well, but they could only lower one bucket down the well at a time, not enough to fight the fire. If only there was plenty of water at hand when the home had caught fire, he'd still have a mom to go home to.

Master Smith took in a deep breath, then set down his tools, got up and put a hand on Art's shoulder. "It would be a good idea, except there's a reason why we don't all keep a bunch of water-filled buckets in our homes. Can you think of any?"

After a moment Art shook his head. What reason could be more important than not dying?

"All right, think of it this way. If it's made out of wood, the wood would start to go bad, and the buckets would leak. Same if it's made out of leather. Even iron would start to rust. But let's say wemake it out of iron. Where would all that iron come from? Who will mine, smelt, and smith it? Who will pay for it, you? The farmers can't pay for it, not for that much iron. All it would do is just sit around."

Art sagged and held his head in his hands. Why hadn't he thought of that? His idea was terrible. Of course no one would have tolerated it. Of course if the solution were that simple everyone would have been doing that already, and no one would be waiting for him to come along and suggest it to everybody. Who was he, to give other people his suggestions? He was only a child, he had plenty of ideas but couldn't tell the good ideas from the bad. No wonder adults never listened to children. Why should they?
