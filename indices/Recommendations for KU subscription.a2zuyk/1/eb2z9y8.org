[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/68428.The_Final_Empire?ac=1&from_search=true][Brandon Sanderson]]: Stormlight Archive, Mistborn (original trilogy)

Anything by [[https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4721536.Mark_Lawrence][Mark Lawrence]]

[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/64341.The_Metamorphosis_of_Prime_Intellect][The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect]] - He also posts it for free his website if you google it.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32509131-dungeon-born][Divine Dungeon]] series. Kind of like Crandle in its power gathering mechanisms, but about a dungeon and way more lighthearted with really mossively terrible puns.

Phil Tucker is a more unknown author I'm rather fond of. [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29936142-the-path-of-flames][Chronicles of the Black Gate]] - a past-paced fantasy epic with a fair amount of characters, locations, and story lines. [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39980416-death-march][Euphoria Online]] - a LitRPG that I thought was pretty awesome, especially compared to most of the other books in the genre.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22878967-the-shadow-of-what-was-lost][The Shadow of What was Lost]] - Another fantasy epic, but featuring time travel!

A bit more experimental of a recommendation, but I rather enjoyed this video, [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZYNADOHhVY][Fable of the Dragon Tyrant]]
