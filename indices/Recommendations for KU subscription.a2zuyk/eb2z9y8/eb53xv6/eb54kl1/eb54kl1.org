I think it's fairly similar to other epic fantasy in terms of having multiple "main" characters and sprawling scale for locations of setting. I'd compare it to A Song of Ice and Fire but with way less text and superfluous descriptions. The ridiculous amount of description of unnecessary things is what makes Wheel of Time and Malazan Book of the Fallen hard for me to enjoy.

It's also got [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/184590-the-chronicles-of-the-black-gate][great covers]].
