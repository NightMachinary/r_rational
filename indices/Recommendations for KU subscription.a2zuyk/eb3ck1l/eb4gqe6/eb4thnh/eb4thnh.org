I'm on the opposite side of the fence on the bobiverse. You make a great criticism about the way it depicts resources, but I still like it for approaching the fun, challenges, and opportunities of uploading. Do you have an alternate book you like that explores that possibility space, IMHO Diaspora is too tied up with dimensionality, and loses all of the fun of math when exploring the coal face metaphor, to really be a fun exploration of uploading.
