Have you tried Accelerando by Charles Stross? It has mind uploads and other crazy stuff happening. Very imaginative. And it was released free under creative commons, I believe.

Perilous Waif is not exactly uploading human minds, it's more like cybernetics blurring the line between human and AI, but it is pretty fun.

And I heard good things about [[https://www.amazon.com/Outsystem-Military-Science-Fiction-Intrepid-ebook/dp/B008GZ8HEM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8][this series]] which has some uploading stuff going on, but I haven't tried it.

Also, try looking searching for threads on [[/r/printSF]], or posting your own if there are none. It's a great subreddit.
