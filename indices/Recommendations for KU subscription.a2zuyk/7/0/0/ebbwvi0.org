I've actually stopped reading Worth the Candle too, at least for now. If I had to put my finger on why, I'd say that I didn't enjoy how the protagonist alternates between "world punches him in the gut" and "his own mistakes punch him in the gut."

Have you read any HPMoR derivatives? You can convert any FFN books to ebooks easily enough. Following the Phoenix and Significant Digits are among the longer ones.
