  Is it enough that it's infinite and non-repeating?

No, it could count up by even numbers, or go 1,2,1,1,2,1,1,1,2,....

In fact, e=[2,1,2,1,1,4,1,1,6,1,1,8,...], which only has even numbers and 1.

Looking at [[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PiContinuedFraction.html][Wolfram Mathworld]], I don't see anything about pi having every number.
