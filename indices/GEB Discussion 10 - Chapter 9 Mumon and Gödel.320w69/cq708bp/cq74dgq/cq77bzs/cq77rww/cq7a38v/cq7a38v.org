The bit about Normal Number is that if pi's a normal number then pi contains every possible integer. However, we don't actually know if pi is a normal number, even though it's considered very likely by mathematicians. I once did a statistical project where I checked the frequency of each of the ten digits for the first hundred thousand digits of pi and it turned out to be equal frequency for all ten.
