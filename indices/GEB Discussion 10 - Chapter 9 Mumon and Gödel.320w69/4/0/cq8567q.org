Zen can afford one peace of mind. Its teachings are designed to "break" your attachment to rational thought. If you're like me, you've spent a good deal of your life unconsciously worshiping at the altar of Reason. The aim of Zen (as I see it) is to produce the realization that reason is just one of many available tools -- and there are aspects of life for which reason is not the best tool! Reason can be seen as a limiting force, because it causes you to disregard paradoxical statements and blatant contradictions. But these are no less a part of life. The Zen mindset is simply to see things as they are, without distorting them to fit our internal framework.
