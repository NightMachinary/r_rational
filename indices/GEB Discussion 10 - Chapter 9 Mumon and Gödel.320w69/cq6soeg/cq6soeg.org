Here's the questions from the Wikia:

1) On p. 266 DRH says that MUMON can be taken in at least two different ways. Can you think of more?

2) Looking back, can you find another implicit meaning of the Contracrostipunctus? (p. 92)

3) Find a GÃ¶del-Numbering for the pq-System and "arithmetize" the rules. Is there a way to characterize pq-numbers in a simple way?

4) Is Zen complete? Is it consistent?
