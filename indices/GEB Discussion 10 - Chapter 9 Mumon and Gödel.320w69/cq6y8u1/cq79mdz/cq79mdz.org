Thanks for the link to the spinning lady. It took a while to see how she could switch directions, but when she's facing the viewer (or when you can't see her breasts and ponytail), it becomes possible to 'switch' the directions she's rotating in. It helps by focusing only on the shadow of the legs at the bottom of the image to get the hang of mentally switching. I started seeing her switching directions every spin at the end.
