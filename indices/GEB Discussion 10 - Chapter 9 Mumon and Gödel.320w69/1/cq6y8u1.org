  What does the phrase '[ATTACCA]' which appears at the end mean?
#+end_quote

I asked that myself but the =TTortoise= at the end of the dialogue gives it away, the end of the dialogue has the capitalized chars *A*chilles - *TT*ortoise, and if you peek ahead to the =...Ant Fugue= dialog, it starts with *A*chilles -- *CC*rab -- *A*chilles -> ATTACCA. But there might be another level of meaning (this is geb right :))

- the gödel numbering of the TNT system is done using /codons/ and is composed of four different digits, which is kind of like the DNA
- G seems to be one of DRH favourite letters, it stands for:

  1. Gödel's sentence (Introduction, p. 18 & Chapter 9, 271)
  2. A set of natural numbers, the complement to F (Figure and Ground, p. 73)
  3. Goblet G (Contracrostipunctus, p. 79)
  4. Diagram G and Function G (Recursive Structures and Processes, p.135,137)

**** Prelude...

- to me it seemed almost like they talk about reading GEB, when on p. 280 /Anteater/ says:

  #+begin_quote
    /Anteater/: Have you ever noticed how in these pieces the prelude always sets the mood perfectly for the following fugue?
  #+end_quote

  Exchange /prelude/ =<=>= dialogue and /fugue/ =<=>= chapter and if you continue to read it seems like the all talk about the process of reading GEB ;)

- I enjoyed Figure 56, another picture where you switch between two modes while looking at it is [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinning_Dancer][the spinning lady]].
