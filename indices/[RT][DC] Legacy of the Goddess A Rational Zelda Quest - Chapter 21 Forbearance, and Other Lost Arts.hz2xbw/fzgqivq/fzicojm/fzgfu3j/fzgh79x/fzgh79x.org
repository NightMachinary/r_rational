*Announcement*:

There will be no voting. The next chapter will proceed from the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/hs0zuy/rtdc_legacy_of_the_goddess_a_rational_zelda_quest/fyad8fa/][previous plan]].

Taetus has been successfully marked (cost to be included in the VP ledger at the end of the next chapter).

Zelda has sent for Lensa. She hasn't arrived back at her estate yet, but when she gets there (another 1-2 days), Zelda's message will be passed along. The earliest she can expect to see Lensa is 4+ days from now.

A number of Blin have been captured as per Zelda's orders, and are being held at Southaven---a fishing outpost on the shores of Lake Hylia that has been repurposed for military use, about a day's ride south of Castletown.

Link & co have been urged by Zelda to continue on to the graveyard and return at the soonest opportunity. The next chapter will detail the results of the party's (mis)adventures.
