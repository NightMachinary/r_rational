Definitely. I really loved the meta-game aspects going on. Two teams need to week together to beat a third, but their knowledge and danger assessment of the third is difficult and constantly changing. That's especially hard to deal with when you need the best information possible, keep information usefully over sided, and activate your betrayal at the right moment.
