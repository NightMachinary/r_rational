(The second part: Ahh, yes, the [[#s][]].)

([[#s][]])

Edit: I should also note that it's pleasing that the Luck Aura is something that the protagonist can deliberately exploit by turning on and off, rather than an unexplained suspension-of-disbelief-straining Midas Touch(/'golden finger') present in certain fictions.

((I remember a daydream I had about a protagonist following a normal path of provoking ever-more-powerful figures, getting driven to the brink of death (and involving sidekicks), then making a rebound and defeating the powerful figure before going straight on to provoke the next too-powerful-to-handle figure... in any case, a sidekick getting so exasperated with a protagonist doing this over and over again like an adrenaline addict that, upon reaching a new town, the sidekick gets the protagonist to promise to /keep his head down this time/ and not provoke any powerful people's sons, then afterward by himself goes to the town's nearby Ravine Of Death, rock-climbs down the side, harvests its various life-saving magical plants and collects its secret power-boosting legacy, then right upon climbinb to the top of the cliff sees the protagonist running to the cliff-edge with a big smile, chased by a furious bearded old man, and the sidekick lets out a sigh (and keeps walking away from the cliff) as the protagonist is sent hurtling into the abyss by an explosion and sees the sidekick while passing, the smile turning into a look of surprise... *fond remembering of said daydream*))
