Edit: ...I think I should search at some point for a reddit forum in which translated chapters can be talked about. It can be quite frustrating having no comment system, or a new-registration-only comment system, when facing something like The Strongest Gene and feeling a pent-up urge to tsukkomi 'He has the Luck Aura! He's had the Luck Aura since the start of the fiction! The Luck Aura isn't just his strongest ability, it's also practically his ONLY ability! Every problem that comes up, he's been able to solve with the Luck Aura! Pretty much any problem that's going to come up, he'll be able to solve by throwing the Luck Aura at it! There is absolutely /no call/ for him to stop every single time, give up on doing something, and then only gradually realise "Wait... a... minute... this can't be done without incredible 'luck'? I can use the Luck Aura!" (again!) after several minutes! AHHHH!'.
