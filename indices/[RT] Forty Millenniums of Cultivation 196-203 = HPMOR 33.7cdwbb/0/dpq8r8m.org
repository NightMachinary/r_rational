I dunno, the multiple hidden hoverboards in various rocks trick seemed a little bit narratively convenient to me. The odds of someone being able to predict someone else's reactions so well that they had hidden back-up chips inside of a board carrying the chip, etc etc, and the way that all of those came in handy stretched credibility. If the author had walked us through a bit of Li Yao's plans ahead of time & made us wonder 'how is he going to use all of these seemingly useless items' it would have had a better effect, I think - instead I felt like the author was making it up as he went along (not unlikely, since it's a serial, but a little disappointing.)
