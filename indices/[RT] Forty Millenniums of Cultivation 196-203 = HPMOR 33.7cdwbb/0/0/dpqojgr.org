(Throwing out a tangential(?) thought; I may be abnormally genre-savvy, but it stood out to me how I immediately thought at the relevant moment [[#s][]], and rolled my eyes at this possibility not occurring to any of the other characters. Then again, I could be particularly affected by having recently read through the Spirit Sword Mountain chapters, which had a similar ploy.)

For the 'actions-prediction', keep in mind that everything would have gone even easier for Li Yao if they hadn't predicted that far. He could have gone straight to the final plan by dropping the chip on the ground (sort of? See below), but had a hidden robot just in case they were okay with going after him and overlooked it, and had a decoy chip in case they only took it and didn't break it open, and had a decoy robot in case they only found it and stopped searching. --Further come-to-think-of-it, since the true chip was found by the weight comparison, he might have done better to only have the one robot. Or a 'hidden true chip' inside both robots, the same weight.

Come to think of it, there's one forced point. His final gambit rested on being able to warn the swordspeople about the ambush (and it's notable that he could predict it so easily while the swordpeople couldn't...), but there was no reason for them not to start with (go straight to) the final chip that they correctly predicted was the real chip, in which case they would never have seen his message and he would have lost. Especially you'd think that they would do all they could not to let any more messages of his play if avoidable, after the chaos he started with the messenger cranes!

Ah, I just remembered a happy moment (in contrast with the above thoughts): I was very glad that one of the characters reacted only a bit slower than I did to the 'face unrecognisable, sent to the back' situation! (Of course, not reacting before giving the order to go the back is still much slower, if counting in action-time rather than reading-time.)
