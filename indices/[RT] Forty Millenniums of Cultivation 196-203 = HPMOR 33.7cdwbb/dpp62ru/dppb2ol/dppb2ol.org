I feel like it's hardly similar. HPMOR's got three armies with betrayals and chaos galore, FMC has two armies and a crazy guy who plays them against each other. While they have similarities, they're still very different. Especially since you know Li Yao is very likely to win, since it's still the xianxia genre, while you never knew what was going to happen in HPMOR
