Ah, but apparently Harry is Voldemort's equal and it takes a powerful wizard to confound some things. It's possible that most people just don't have the power to do so, and further possible it has been exploited before in other ways- perhaps its simply immoral or illegal to most of the wizards with the power to do it. Edit: To say nothing about the knowledge being possibly suppressed, though that doesn't explain why the bloody spell is taught. Too important to maintaining the secrecy act possibly?

Voldemort... Well I can't explain why he doesn't write a contract for every blood traitor and muggleborn if this is the case, that part is a huge plot hole to my theory, unless deep down Voldy knew they needed the fresh blood/magic to prevent too much inbreeding and the muggleborn camps, instead of being deathcamps were sex camps, two muggleborns have a half blood, and 2 half bloods in this case would have a first generation pure blood; suitable to be either married or consorted to a real purebood?
