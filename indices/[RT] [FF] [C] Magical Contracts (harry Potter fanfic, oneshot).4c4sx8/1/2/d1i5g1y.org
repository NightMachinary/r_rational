  If it actually worked, someone would have found it and abused it and there wouldn't be a stock market any more.

No, the result is that the market is more efficient, not that there is no stock market. The efficient market hypothesis is clearly false in the first place, as bubbles form and burst because stock valuation is not done rationally. “The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.”

You are a perfect example of the old joke: I see a twenty dollar bill on the street and pick it up. An economist sees a twenty dollar bill on the street and assumes if it were a real bill someone would have picked it up already.

You additionally say that being the first person to come up with an idea is rare, and that you should expect ideas, even ones that depend on new things, have already been thought of. It's not. There are many many useful ideas, and the frontier has not been exhausted in the slightest.

I might agree with you in the case of this fanfic, which I haven't read and won't. But in general, no. Good ideas can not be assumed to be common knowledge.
