Let's say that I'm in 10000 BC, and I came up with the idea of using fire to ward off animals....

There always has to be a first person to come up with some idea, particularly when the idea depends on something new (such as the scientific method in the 1700's). But being that first person s like winning the lottery. It is very unlikely and you shouldn't expect it unless it has already happened.
