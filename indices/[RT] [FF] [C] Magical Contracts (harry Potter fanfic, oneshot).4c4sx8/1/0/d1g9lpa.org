  If there is an idea that would break the setting, and it hasn't actually broken the setting, that probably means that there's something wrong with the idea.

Or that the setting is logically inconsistent. Which is actually the more likely possibility in fictional universes. If you've ever played a game of DnD with a lousy DM, you should know that just assuming the universe is logically consistent is objectively stupid, likely to miss you tons of opportunities, and a good way to get yourself killed.
