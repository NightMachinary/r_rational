One problem with this idea is that if there is an idea that would break the setting, and it hasn't actually broken the setting, that probably means that there's something wrong with the idea that Harry didn't know about.

Consider the muggle world analogy: You come up with this great idea that would let anyone make ten million dollars in the stock market. Will this idea work? Of course not. If it actually worked, someone would have found it and abused it and there wouldn't be a stock market any more.

All the easy munchkining ideas were already found and either don't work any more, never worked, or are such a part of our lives that we don't even think of them as munchkin. ("I have a great idea! If we use this thing called 'fire', nobody will ever get attacked by animals in the nighttime again! Nobody in the whole world....")
