Pre-edit: I forgot that they provide perks when you enter a world and/or rewards when you leave, so everything is based on the premise that you enter as yourself at a time/place roughly of your choosing with only what you have, and leave with what you can take with you.

1. Culture (Iain M Banks): Try to get ageless immortality and Special Circumstances training if you can. Otherwise, just get good health, powerful tech, and all the rest.
2. The Long Earth (Terry Pratchett + Steven Baxter): Get a stepper. It's a small thing to spend 10 years on, but totally worth it for defense, infiltration, and escape. The design can also be traded in the new worlds you go to if you're in need of money or chaos.
3. The Name of the Wind (Patrick Rothfuss): Sympathy + Sygaldry. Naming and alchemy, if you can do it. I'm pretty sure you can make perpetual motion machines at this point, and should now be able to make some money anywhere.
4. Warbreaker (Brandon Sanderson): You have enough powers and skills to get at least the 2000 Breaths you need to get agelessness, toxin/disease immunity, and minor perception powers. If you can get some spare Breaths to animate objects with that's a nice bonus.

That should be a safe progression that doesn't depend on genetics (Avatar, Harry Potter, etc.), infrastructure (most technology), or location (god-powered magic, geography/population linked magic, ranger skills linked to a biome). You are also ageless and immune to most non-physical types of harm so the urgency has worn off.
