I wrote a story for jumpchain a while back, to try to learn how to write. Given the restrictions involved in that one, though, it could probably be described as the opposite of munchkinry.

Instead, here are a few common tricks for jumpchaining:

Blue Feather (Harvest Moon) + Cheat Mode (Minecraft): Take anybody as companions, so long as you don't mind being married to each person you bring with you this way.

Let's Give It A Boost (Unholy Heights) + Cheat Mode (Minecraft): Double the potency of any single "item" once every two months.

Any Alternate Forms + This Is, In Fact My Final Form (Sword Art Online): Freely mix and match the qualities of all your forms together. Bonus for Song of Triumph (Aquaria), which allows you to take the form of any enemy you defeat.

Any Immortality Perk + Any Power That Grows Over Time + Generic Xianxia: Generic Xianxia has a drawback that allows you to stay in that universe for an arbitrarily long timeframe. This allows you to develop your powers as much as you'd like.

Also, I'd like to note that Eclipse Phase allows you to obtain a fully general AI, which can easily be trained for friendliness over its initial development phase.
