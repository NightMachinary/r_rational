You have a power to change any liquid into clean drinking water as long as you have a line of sight. You can change unlimited volume at any given time as long as you can see all of it at once. Otherwise you will only affect a part of it you can see. For instance if you look at a deep lake of oil you will only affect first couple of feet from a surface area as you can't penetrate all the way down to the bottom.
