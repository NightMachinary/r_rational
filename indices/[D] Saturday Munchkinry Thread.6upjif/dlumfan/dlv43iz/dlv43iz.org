Look someone in the eyes. Their eyes turn into clean drinking water. This is probably fatal.

You can now take missions to be the best assassin/sniper ever. You don't even need a weapon, just stand on top of a building and look at your target. The moment you make eye contact, even from super far away, they die a horrible death. The police are baffled, unable to make heads or tails of what's going on.

Once you gain enough funds, you start making your own money. You invest in companies under false names and then murder rival companies so your investments quickly become monopolies. You stealthily grow and amass a hidden empire, becoming a major shareholder in every company and country you desire while murdering all the rest.
