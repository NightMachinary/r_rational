  This is probably fatal.

Is it? [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2860527/][It seems like plenty of people literally remove their own eyes, and still survive]]. Especially with such an instantaneous and "clean" procedure as eye->water transformation, I'd imagine that as long as the victim received medical care in a timely fashion (which is likely, if your targets are high-profile), they would definitely survive.

On the other hand, those targets' careers would be over; the time it takes to adapt to blindness, would probably eliminate them from any higher-up political or business position (for a while, at least). So in some ways, it's maybe an improvement on assassination? In that you can remove targets from positions of power, without actually committing murder.
