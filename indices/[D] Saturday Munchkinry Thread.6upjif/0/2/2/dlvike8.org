As mentioned at best that would cause blindness. Other issue is how well do you know secret services and underground world. For instance I doubt that going to MI6 or CIA and saying "I have power to blind any person I look at" would go as well as you plan. Chances are that you would be classed as danger to the state power to dispose of president or a qeen just by looking into their eyes is not something that would be taken lightly.

Secret services have 100s of people who could kill targets reasons why people like Putin or Kim are not assassinated isn't because we don't have means to do so but because possible consequences of those would be huge and unpredictable.
