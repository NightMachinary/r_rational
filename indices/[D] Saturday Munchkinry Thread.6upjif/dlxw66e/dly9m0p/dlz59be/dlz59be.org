But the question is how would you actually do in practice , and what about the taking over the world version where you can't relly on other people to help you. What would be the actual steps from unlimited computer power to getting what you want, apart from the vague response of getting people to work on that . So basically the questions is what kind of things you could realistically do with unlimited computer power and current cs knowdelenge. And I don't think we have a way of simulating only universes that count as "good", how would you decide what kind of universes are "good "its not like we have an algorithm that can calculate how munch utility we would assign to a universe . Of couse solve ai safety and then simulate universes is a valid answer ,but I was looking for more interesting ones.
