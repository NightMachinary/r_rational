I really wouldn't assume much about the nature of the rest of the world, static or otherwise. We simply know very little about it and, with a handful of exceptions, what we do know is in character travellers tales.

I mean, yes, we're told that X empire exists. It is big and even Calneria knows about it. But would we know about the Turquoise Turban rebellion ragging in the east, or the quiet assassin war being fought between the merchant families of Xong and McFusty? Or the valiant last stand of the proudly independent mountain kingdom of Bitet against encroaching hegemony of its larger neighbours? I doubt it.
