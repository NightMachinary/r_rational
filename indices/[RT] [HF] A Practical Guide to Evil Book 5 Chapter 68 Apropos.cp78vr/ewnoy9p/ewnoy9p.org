So we haven't really learned anything about the Bard's intentions, aside from the fact that she seems to want Cat dead. Which would almost certainly mean she's against the Accords, so that's can't be what she's going for.

We know about a few things she's done seemingly on her on accord though:

1) Setting a Crusade against Praes, with Akua's Folly and making sure Black destroys the weapon.

2) Driving a wedge between Malicia and Black in the process of starting the Crusade.

3) Having Cat named Arch-Heretic of the East, and removing Cordelia's trust in the heroes, making any deals or treaties with Callow null and void.

4) Stripping the Hierophant of his sorcery. Which resulted in Sve Noc trying to recruit him and getting their fingers burnt, possibly making them more cautious in the future.

5) Unleashing the Dead King. Which was an effect of Black destroying the weapon, and which she admits to in an Interlude.

The Bard almost certainly knew to expect the ban on the sale of dwarf-made weapons with nations at war with Callow: Cat going to the Everdark at the same time that the Kingdom Under was invading was part of a story, which is in her jurisdiction. So her plan so far seems to be to corner Procer. It /could/ be that she actually is trying to kill the Dead King. But that seems to narrow in focus for this series. Not very interesting. Cordelia having some kind weapon pulled from Lake Artoise: that'll be a key part of the Bard's plan. We'll have to see what it is.
