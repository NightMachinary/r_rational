Black, in one of his interludes, came to the conclusion that you needed to defeat her three times before she is driven off - at least for a while- and that was purely physical attacks to do it. Cat's already danced through a few of the Bard's stories, and she mentions three potential setups in the conversation that could also apply to previous bardic setups to kill her.

I wonder what happens when she slips the noose on this one? Driving her off three times by dodging stories instead of using physical attacks? Maybe the Bard is out of her life forever.
