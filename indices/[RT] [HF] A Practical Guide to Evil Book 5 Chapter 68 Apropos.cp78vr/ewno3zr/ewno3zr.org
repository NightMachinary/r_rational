I'm curious if Bard is local to Calneria or if she's active worldwide. We've been told that Calneria is a backwater, with only the Dwarves being near a world power. Is this just a side gig for her, or is what's going on here really that important on a global scale? Maybe there's a Super-Bard out there who's dealing with even bigger threats on the other continents.
