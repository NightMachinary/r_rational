Remember that it 'whispers' other things before producing a result, so it can basically run a function, then do something else with the output of that function. I'd guess that there's an input translation section (converts English words for numbers into something more consistent), then there's a base-ten single-digit adder, finally a section to announce the final output. And the chapter mentioned 'code-words' or something, so I'm guessing it uses words other than parseltongue zero through nine in order to not confuse which function outputs connect to which function inputs.
