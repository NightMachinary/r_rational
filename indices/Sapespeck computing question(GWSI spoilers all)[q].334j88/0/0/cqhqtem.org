When computers add, they look up a 2x2 table of answers for (1/0) plus (1/0). When we add in base 10, we look up a 10x10 table of (1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8/9/0) plus (1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8/9/0).

In the story, their problem was they didn't have a base system. All of their numbers had unique names, making their table infinitely large.
