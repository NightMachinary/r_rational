Author here confirming that this is correct. Various other techniques that assist in /Sapespeck/ computing:

- You can manipulate the volume of the output, to distinguish between "things you want the user to hear" and "internal signals"
- You can put a lot of specks very close together into a "clump", and have a clump elsewhere distinguish incoming signals on the basis of what clump they come from. The base-ten single-digit adders form clumps, for example.
- /Sapespeck Maxima/ allows you to easily rewrite specks - even rewriting multiple specks at a time - without individually deleting and recreating each speck involved. Sometimes it might even be easier to make a bunch of blank specks with /Sapespeck/ before actually making them into a functioning system with /Sapespeck Maxima/, because once you've gotten the hang of the latter, it's just much easier.
