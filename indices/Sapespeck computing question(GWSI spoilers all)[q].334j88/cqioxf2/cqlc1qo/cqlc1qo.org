Not quite. The computing system is based on the /Sapespeck/ spell, which creates a speck at a location of the caster's choice. When a certain condition (determined on casting) is fulfilled, the speck emits sound in Parseltongue.

Conditions are based on audio-visual input at human-level scales. It can do some processing; "if a Slytherin passes" doesn't work, but "if you see robes with green trim" does.

Specks can react to other specks' outputs.

Non-parselmouths can only (as far as is known) make specks output white noise.
