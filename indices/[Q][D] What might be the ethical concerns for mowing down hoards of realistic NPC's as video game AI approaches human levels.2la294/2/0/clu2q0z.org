Ethics start getting involved when the player wants the experience to be more "real" and the player believes that "realness" can only be obtained through actual suffering instead of mere acting. The answer to "Can I ethically create an entity capable of feeling pain and then make it feel pain for my enjoyment?" seems to pretty obviously be no, but the answer to similar questions about love, friendship, sexuality, gross smells, etc. is not quite so clear-cut.
