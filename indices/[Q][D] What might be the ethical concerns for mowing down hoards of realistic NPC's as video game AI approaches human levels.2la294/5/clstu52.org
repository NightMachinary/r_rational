This might be in the problem at some point, but I don't think it will be in the near future.

For one, talking NPCs mostly, if at all, don't even have a resemblance of AI when interacting with the player. Most just are a tree of dialog responses. The NPCs that do have AI usually have an AI that is just optimized for combat or whichever is their specific function, which doesn't pose a moral problem to me.

NPCs are still far from even passing the Turing Test, and the programs that DO pass it don't have a resemblance of consciousness.
