No matter how advanced an AI might be, any avatar prone to destruction under the rules of the engine it's embedded in is still just an avatar, it wouldn't harm the AI behind it.

It's like asking if there's a control system for an FPS which is so advanced it would be immoral to shoot the other player. You're confusing an avatar and an entity.
