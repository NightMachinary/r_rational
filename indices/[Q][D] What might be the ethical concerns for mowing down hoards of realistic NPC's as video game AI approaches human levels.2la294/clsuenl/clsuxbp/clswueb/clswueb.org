I think an entity designed from the ground up and fully aware of its own black boxes is the only kind of entity that /can/ give meaningful consent. Us fleshies are just pretending. We don't even know what we want. We can't look inside our black boxes. We can only throw hypotheticals at it, and hope that the feeling we experience and predict matches the one we might one day have in a similar real life situation.
