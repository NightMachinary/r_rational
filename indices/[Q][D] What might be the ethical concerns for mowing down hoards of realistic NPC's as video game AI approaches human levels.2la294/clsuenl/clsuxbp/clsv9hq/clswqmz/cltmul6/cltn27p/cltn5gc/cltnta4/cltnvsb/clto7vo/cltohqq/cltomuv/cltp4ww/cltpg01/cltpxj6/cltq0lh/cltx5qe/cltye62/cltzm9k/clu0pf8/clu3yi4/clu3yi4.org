  I'm not sure I agree that you can have willing slaves.
#+end_quote

Of course you can. That's part of the horror of slavery. You break enough men, and some won't want to be free. Some will happily break other slaves, so that the master will elevate him in the chattel hierarchy.

And putting things like "Obey your masters, especially the good ones" in supposed "moral guides direct from God" don't help matters.

  But we can dismiss the slavery argument since the AIs aren't necessarily property.

Your scenario is that of a sentient tool happily used. Of course it's property. There would be no point for it otherwise.

#+begin_quote
  the answer is that you are such a being

Now I know you're kidding. My body has no mind separate from my brain. By controlling my body, I control part of my own self, and not a separate entity. However, when you control your drill you are not controlling part of yourself; you are, by design, controlling another entity. You decide for another what their thoughts and wants can or cannot be. Whether that control was established before or after that entity became aware/was instancied, or whether micro-management is involved or not, that's irrelevant. The results are the same: total control of the thought processes and thought boundaries of another sentient being. Mind-control.

Actually, I suspect that AI-building companies would /fight/ over who offers the most perfect control without micro-management, i.e. perfect pre-configuration of an AI instance guaranteeing total obedience of the sentience to the buyer.

Yeah, I wouldn't want to live in that kind of world.
