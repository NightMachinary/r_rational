Neither your attempted condescension nor attempted posturing bother me. Both are irrelevant to the discussion and were ignored. There is work to be done. And there are possible minds happy to do it. Utility functions that benefit us can be constructed. Yes, there are other things to take into consideration as well, but those are not mutually exclusive.

I haven't talked at all about how one might actually go about designing such a mind, or how to construct its values so that the resulting entity can be both valuable to us and happy in its own utility function.

But given the choice between a drill press that is not sentient, and a drill press that loves drilling holes and has the hobby of reading online machine shop tool magazines and keeping abreast of its own maintenance and is as enthusiastic as a human who loves his job, I see no problem. Why is it immoral to construct machines who can live a happy and intellectually fulfilling life as a drill press?
