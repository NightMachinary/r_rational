There is no inherent moral qualm in mowing down hordes of sentient entities whose explicit desire, self-purpose, consent, and maximum utility function is to provide an entertaining challenge for the player mowing them down. To treat them otherwise would be to cause them egregious suffering and diminish their quality of life in unacceptable ways.

The evil comes when you start killing AIs that don't want to die in the specified manner, who wouldn't enjoy it or be fulfilled by it, who have a better utility. As opposed to ones that want to die while giving a believable performance of an NPC who doesn't want to die.

Of course, training and building an AI is hard work. There's no need to kill it instead of simply having fewer concurrent instances of it. What does it even mean for an AI to "die"? Can you kill /math/? Does an equation cease being valid when an instance of it is erased off a blackboard?
