Off topic, but I once knew I guy who took on seven AI players in /Age of Empires II/ (raised to the highest difficulty, which is /very/ challenging) at once, by reducing the game speed as slow as it could go. That way he could spend as much relative attention on each action as the computer could.

He won, though it took a few weeks to play out the entire battle.
