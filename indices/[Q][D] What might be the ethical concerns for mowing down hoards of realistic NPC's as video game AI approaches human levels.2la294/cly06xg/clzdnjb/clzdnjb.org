Your comment smacks of sensationalism. I think we need more concrete definition on what you mean by "result of anybody else".

Even if I don't buy a watch tomorrow, I still ran a computation (I thought about buying the watch) There was no resultant effect, but time and energy was used to deliberate. And same with CPUs. If it does nothing, it may have ran computations that led to the result of it doing nothing.
