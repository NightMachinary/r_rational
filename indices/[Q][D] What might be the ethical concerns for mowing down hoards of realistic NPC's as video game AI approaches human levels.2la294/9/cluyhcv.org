I'm going to pose a slightly different question:

How realistic can we make these NPC's that are made to be mowed down, before we start significantly desensitizing people to killing other people? While our logical, conscious brains will always know "these people are fake, so it's okay", all of the input we are getting is what we'd get from an actual person dying (down the road, when technology's more advanced and the killing of characters is that much more real) So how long before that starts to take a toll on the human psyche?

Murky territory, I'm sure, but i pose a situation: I give you control over an armed robot in another room, and you're looking at the video feed. I tell you it's a highly realistic video game render (let's assume, at this point, technology's advanced enough for that to be viable) There are ten people in the room attacking you (the robot). I tell you to take them out, to win the game. You do. Then you leave, none the wiser to that you just killed 10 people, and never find out that you did.

In that situation, do you think there will be any psychological repercussions due to the stimulus despite the fact that, to you, it was just a simulation? If your answer to that question is yes, in any way, then it means we also need to examine the possible psychological toll of giving people the experience of fully immersive virtual murder.
