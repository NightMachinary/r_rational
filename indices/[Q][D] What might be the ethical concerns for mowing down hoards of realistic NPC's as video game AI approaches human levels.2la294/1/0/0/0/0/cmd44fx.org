  If a backup copy of your neural architecture existed, I hazard that you wouldn't argue that it was okay to shoot you in the face.
#+end_quote

Of course not. Just like it isn't okay for me to cut half of your body off even if you could live without it.

  Even under the circumstances of a less painful death/ending-of-a-particular-instance-of-you, what stipulations would you make about the relative time at which the backup was made?
#+end_quote

The backup should be made as frequently and recently as possible.

#+begin_quote
  About the timeliness of activating your backup?
#+end_quote

The backup should be activated as quickly as possible. I'd actually like to have it running concurrently with my other self if possible, so we could specialize and cooperate and learn together faster. I'd run as many concurrent instances of myself as I could afford, and I'd take several jobs split between those instances to be able to afford more.

  And in the case of AI, you claim that it can be set to calculating again, but even allowing for restarting the game, there's not generally a saved copy of all the user interactions, random number generator results, etc. that resulted in that particular version of the character, and generally no plan to redo all those calculations even if it were possible.
#+end_quote

Then you haven't made a recent backup. With backups the question is not "Are they dead?" but "How much did they lose?" If there are two instances of me running concurrently, and one is killed but there is a full backup as of the moment it is killed, the other instance of me does not view that as a permanent setback, just a loss of runtime. You haven't killed me, you've knocked half of me out for a while. And if we're playing a game I really like, I'd probably consent to that. If my backup were several hours to a day ago, then I've actually lost some time and when I'm reactivated I won't have those memories I lived through. I'll have lost about as much as someone who on the weekends gets blackout drunk for fun.
