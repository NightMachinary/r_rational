This is far too facile. This does not begin to cover the unpleasantness of what it is to die. If a backup copy of your neural architecture existed, I hazard that you wouldn't argue that it was okay to shoot you in the face. Even under the circumstances of a less painful death/ending-of-a-particular-instance-of-you, what stipulations would you make about the relative time at which the backup was made? About the timeliness of activating your backup? And in the case of AI, you claim that it can be set to calculating again, but even allowing for restarting the game, there's not generally a saved copy of all the user interactions, random number generator results, etc. that resulted in that particular version of the character, and generally no plan to redo all those calculations even if it were possible. I still think that it's a valid question to ponder.
