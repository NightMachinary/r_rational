This assumes we know how to create sentient entities with fully specified utility functions and we know how that functions will evolve over time. I somehow doubt our first sentient AIs will be like that.

More probably someone will hack something up that will do the thing it should do in most cases, and 10 years later someone will show it was sentient.
