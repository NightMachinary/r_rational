Value, happiness, and mind-design do not work this way. Sorry I can't spend the time to discuss this in-depth, and in a less condescending tone, but I'm busy writing a conference paper. I certainly agree with the /basic/ conclusion that life ought not to suck for anyone and that happiness is /a/ good thing, even if I tend to hold that it's not /the/ Good Thing.
