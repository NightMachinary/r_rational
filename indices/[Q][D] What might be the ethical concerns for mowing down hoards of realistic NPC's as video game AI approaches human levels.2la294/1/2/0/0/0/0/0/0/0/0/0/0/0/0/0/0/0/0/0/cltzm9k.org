A slave is a sentient being owned by another sentient being as property. Suffering is irrelevant to the definition. A "kind" slave-owner can have "willing" slaves, and they'll still be slave-owner and slaves.

As to the "ongoing conscious oversight"; I'd say that the willful design of the specific attributes of what will be a conscious, tailored mind can be considered an automation of an ongoing oversight. Indeed, it would be a /required/ part of designing such a mind (so that it /stays/ tailored). The "conscious" part of "conscious oversight" is pretty much a given in any design endeavour, so, yeah.

Finally, I really can't see how pre-existing purposes and desires are a requirement to the definition of mind-control. That would mean that you can take control of a (potentially) thinking entity with impunity, so long as you do it early enough in its development that it hasn't had time to form its own purposes and desires? Or, if I reverse the argument: do I not control a being that never had any other thought than those I allowed it to have? Why yes, yes I absolutely do.
