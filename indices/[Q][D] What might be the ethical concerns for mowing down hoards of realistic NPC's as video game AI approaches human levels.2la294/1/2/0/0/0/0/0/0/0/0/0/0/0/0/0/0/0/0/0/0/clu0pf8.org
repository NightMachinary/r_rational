I'm not sure I agree that you can have willing slaves. But we can dismiss the slavery argument since the AIs aren't necessarily property.

And as far as "Do I not control a being that never had any other thought than those I allowed it to have?" the answer is that you are such a being, and that being seems to have no problem with it, nor do you. Should we make you stop controlling your body and ask your body what it wants?
