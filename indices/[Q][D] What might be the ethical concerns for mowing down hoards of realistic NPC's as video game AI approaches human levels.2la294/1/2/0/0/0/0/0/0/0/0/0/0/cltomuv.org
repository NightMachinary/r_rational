Would you be happy to work for those things? If you are, you are the AI in question. And in principle, we could make your life not suck.

Would you be unhappy to work for those things, but are capable of imagining someone who is? If you can, then they are the AI in question. And in principle, we could make their life not suck.

If you can't imagine a being happy to work for those things, you have -- well, disproven is going to far when using an argument from ignorance -- failed to support your assertion that some things are more valuable than subjective experience. Whoever it is more valuable to is the AI in question. And in principle, we could make their life not suck.

If there isn't anybody possible for it to be more valuable to than subjective experience, then your assertion is false and you have no objection remaining to the above.
