  *Child grooming* comprises actions deliberately undertaken with the aim of befriending and establishing an emotional connection with a child, to lower the child's inhibitions in order to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_sexual_abuse][sexually abuse]] the child. Child grooming may be used to lure minors into [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_labour][trafficking of children]], illicit businesses such as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_prostitution][child prostitution]], or the production of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_pornography][child pornography]]. It is a behavior that is characteristic of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paedophilia][paedophilia]]. This criminal behaviour has been proscribed in various ways since the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Convention_for_the_Suppression_of_the_Traffic_in_Women_and_Children][International Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Women and Children]], which was agreed in 1921 as a multilateral treaty of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Nations][League of Nations]] that addressed the problem of international trafficking of women and children for nefarious purposes. The proscribed traffic was international in nature at that time. The concept of localised grooming, in which gangs of reprobates groom neighbourhood victims, was devised in 2010 by the UK [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_Exploitation_and_Online_Protection_Centre][Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre]].
