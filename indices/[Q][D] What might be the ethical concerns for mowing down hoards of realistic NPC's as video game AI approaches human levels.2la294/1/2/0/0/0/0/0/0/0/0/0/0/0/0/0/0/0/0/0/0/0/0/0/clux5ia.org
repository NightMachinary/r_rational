  I think child grooming can potentially be raised as an analogous example in addition to happy slavery, too.

That's an interesting thought, but you generally don't raise your child with the understanding that you can sell them at any time, or kill them, or beat them as you please, which is what owning a slave entails.

Granted, some parents seem to think that it's okay to beat their child, but I don't think that those parents believe that can do it because the child is /property/. They probably don't think much beyond "if my parents could beat me, obviously I can beat my children" (They probably don't think much, period, but that's another debate).
