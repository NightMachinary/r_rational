  Why is it wrong in general?

Your question is perplexing, assuming that it's not rhetorical (I hope it is).

You took a drill press, and infused it with a conscious, sapient, basically human-level mind, specially tailored (hopefully /before/ coming online) to be unable to feel unhappy about its condition.

What you end up with, in other words, is an human-like mind-controlled slave (albeit with a non-human body). I thought that humanity as a whole had already discovered how wrong that is; slavery by long experience of the same, and mind-control by way of long experience of propaganda (along with a metric ton of SF/F explorations of the concept).
