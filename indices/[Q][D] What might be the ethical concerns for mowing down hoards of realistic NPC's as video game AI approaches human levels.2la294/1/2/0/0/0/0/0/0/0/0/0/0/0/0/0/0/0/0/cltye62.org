I object to your use of the word "slave" on the basis that slaves are made to suffer against their will, and neither of those things are happening here.

I object to your use of the word "mind-control" on the basis that mind control is an ongoing conscious oversight and usurpation of an entity that originally had some other purpose and desire which it now can no longer pursue, and none of those things are happening here.
