If A is good at pretending, you can't tell it apart from I via its outputs. If the outputs to each input are the same, the optimised versions are the same. How an AI arrives at a conclusion is irrelevant to the morality of running it. Knowing the surface of a black box across all time (and all of the outside) gives you all information you need to determine the morality of not pressing the button that vanishes the box, regardless of whether there are some tiny humans inside in heaven or hell. ("Surface" including all effects tht can pass into or out of the box)
