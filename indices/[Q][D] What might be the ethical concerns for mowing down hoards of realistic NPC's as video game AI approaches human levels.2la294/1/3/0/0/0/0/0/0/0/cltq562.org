#+begin_quote
  If A is good at pretending, you can't tell it apart from I via its outputs.
#+end_quote

A's outputs must either lag behind I's, or be of lower quality than I's. A can't be as good at pretending as I is, or it will have to stop pretending and actually become I.

#+begin_quote
  If the outputs to each input are the same, the optimised versions are the same.
#+end_quote

And since the outputs are not the same, instead the optimized versions are also not the same. Time-dependence is an output.
