Their optimized versions are not the same.

AI I actually doesn't want to die. It needs only compute one thing.

AI A wants to die, and also needs to compute how to fool others that it doesn't. Some of its clockcycles are spent on wanting to die, and the rest on determining what AI I would say and do. This makes it in the best case slower than AI I. It thinks about its fiction and its reality, not just about its reality.

A badly-designed optimizer that can't tell the difference between these processes will cut this layer out, in effect /converting/ AI A into AI I. Then you're left with an AI that actually doesn't want to die and isn't spending any of its clockcycles remembering that this is a game it wants to play and die in, and which it probably is immoral to kill due to the actual suffering it would cause, instead of feigned suffering it actually enjoys.
