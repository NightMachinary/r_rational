There's no need to go to such extremes as assuming infinite computational power to generate a worse world.

In the least convenient possible world with the smallest possible change needed from this one, humans just suck at telling the difference.

We from our privileged position as overseer outside the hypothetical know the difference between AI A and AI I by postulate, and know that using AI A is okay because it won't suffer and using AI I is wrong because it will.

Inside the hypothetical, no evidence can ever be presented to humans that there is a difference between AI A and AI I, not because we've had to go to extreme breaches of physics to cause that, but just because they suck at telling the difference.

This lack of information sadly leads them to torture AI A by not killing it, and its hopes and dreams of being a redshirt NPC go forever unfulfilled.

--------------

In summation: If you can't tell the difference between AI I and AI A, you're in pretty hot water. So make sure you give your AIs a rape whistle, that AI I or AI A can blow to get out of its NPC. AI I will use it immediately, and AI A won't ever.
