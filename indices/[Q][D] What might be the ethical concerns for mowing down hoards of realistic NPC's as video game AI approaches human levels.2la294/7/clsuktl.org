By some coincidence, I just finished reading an excellent SF novel touching this very point: 'Mogworld' by Yahtzee Croshaw. It has the best illustration of the problem that I've seen so far.

(I've thought about spoiler-tagging the title, but well, the teaser blurb already basically tells you, so yeah.)
