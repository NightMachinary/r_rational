I haven't read all the links yet, so maybe this was already raised off board.

Why is "mowing them down" even an ethical question? Why should shooting a video game character actually kill it? All that shooting an AI's avatar in a video game does is cause it to shift momentarily to a different avatar (one showing blood) and then teleport to a new location out of sight of the player. Possibly it leaves behind one or more non-sentient objects (corpse of loot drop) but that's boy morally relevant.

Shooting a video game character has about as much moral weight as beating it at checkers.
