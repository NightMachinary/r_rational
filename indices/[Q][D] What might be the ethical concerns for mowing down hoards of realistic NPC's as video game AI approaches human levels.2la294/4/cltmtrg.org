It is uneconomical for video-game AI to approach human levels of intelligence in the kind of game where you mow down hoards of NPCs. There's basically no reason to invest that much expertise and computational power in building software to pilot the zombies, and, just to finish off, if you /did/ bring it towards that level of intelligence, it would start winning far more often than the human player can, ensuring the game stops being /fun/.

Starcraft bots are a significant example, with well-below-human intelligence, but significantly above-human performance at Starcraft, to the point that it's not actually much fun for a human player to go up against them. He'll just /lose/.
