Your rant is still rather weak.

Principally, the core of the story is that all the 'scientists' got killed off or turned into Hoed. That's not going to change, all the smart people who knew enough theory got disabled or killed, most people only had a functional education in aons. The only one educated in how Aons worked outside in the story that we saw was Sarene, a noble. That's the basic premise of the story, it's an oldy time world without a great education system where the smart people died. We don't really know what exactly people tried in the past with regards to fixing the city. It's something to ask sanderson sometime, if anyone else tried to fix the Aon issue.

Generally from what I've seen, most see it as a fairly formulaic novel, with mostly fairly weak characters although some do like Raoden and Sarene- perfect characters do attract much love. Kvothe, Star Wars and Luke and Rey, Honor Harrington. Hrathen and Dilaf were liked by quite a few, with Hrathen being a fan favourite.

The action scenes were generally considered quite well written, as well as the scenery scenes.

  and the writing itself is childish, which opinion I arrive at having spent three years teaching and grading the writing of eleven year olds.

It's a style that appeals to me. Not to you. It's very straight forward and easy to read. Makes the novel flow very well. Was pretty easy to get through. Calling it childish has been a fairly rare complaint though.

Some of the plotting was a bit childish in this one, like Sarene fixing the economic problems and the relatively easy winning over of gang leaders. It was his first novel. I'm not sure I'd use this as a general criticism against Sanderson. His later novels had much more complicated plots, much stronger prose.

Edit. And this continued into pms, with the person wanting to take the gloves off, insult me, and challenge me to a bet on the plotting and writing of Elantris, for any who were curious.

Edit 2. And that progressed into him blocking me because I didn't agree to his poll.
