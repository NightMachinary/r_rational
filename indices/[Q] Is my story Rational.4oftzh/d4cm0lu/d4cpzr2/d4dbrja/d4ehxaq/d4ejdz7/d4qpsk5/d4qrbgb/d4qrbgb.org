I read the book plenty carefully at the time; I didn't bother to remember it very well, on account of the entire linchpin/keystone of the plot being so dumb (your defense addresses lots of the details I got wrong, but doesn't really show the core premise to be any less lame).

The problem is that the central thing is just completely unrealistic, in the sense that /universes don't work like that./ You said "The Elantrians may have fixed the issue in time if they had not been killed," which just doesn't hold up to the cold harsh light of reality. They would have realized what was going on /immediately,/ and organized accordingly ... being "not very much liked" would not have sufficed to turn the whole thing into a mystery. Even if they'd all started getting slaughtered right away, the meme of "it's because the earthquake screwed up the aons" would have become universal almost right away, and would've been written down/remembered by lone scattered survivors, etc.

I agree that it's nice to have stories that show the negative consequences of intellectual purges, and the value of books in allowing people to climb back out of the pit, but Elantris failed to do due diligence in making such a scenario realistic.

As for the anachronism---first, I don't think "this other book did it wrong too!" is any kind of defense, and second, Robert Jordan managed to avoid any such anachronisms for some three million words; Brandon Sanderson was just sloppy. And being supportive of gay people /is/ good; the problem is shoehorning it in for no other reason /than to highlight that you, the author, are being supportive of gay people./ There were plenty of places where that could've fit in with the plot that a decent writer could've found.

Again, I want to emphasize that there's nothing wrong with enjoying Sanderson's writing and stories. But defending their quality is going to be hard to do, and I don't think you've managed to shift me, yet, if that's what you were after (I also suspect the above post isn't going to shift anyone /else/, either, but ... typical mind). There are people who'll try to convince you that Michael Bay plots are good, too.
