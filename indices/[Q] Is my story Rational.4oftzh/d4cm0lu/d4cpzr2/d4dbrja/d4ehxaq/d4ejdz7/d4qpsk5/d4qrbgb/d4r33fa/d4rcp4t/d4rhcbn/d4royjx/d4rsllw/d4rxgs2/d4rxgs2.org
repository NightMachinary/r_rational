Fair enough. Rant corrected:

FOR TEN YEARS, NOT A SINGLE ONE OF THE HUNDREDS OF SURVIVING MAGIC USERS CAME UP WITH THE HYPOTHESIS THAT EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM SHOULD'VE ARRIVED AT /IMMEDIATELY/, EVEN WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE OF THE EARTHQUAKE: THAT THE AON POWERING THE WHOLE DEAL HAD BEEN DAMAGED. Nobody thought of it, nobody wrote it down as their final, dying act, nobody sitting on their butt squinting at the basic concept of magic runes ever came anywhere close to it, until Raoden Sue happened to use his brain once. Sanderson acts like this is believable because "but but but nobody really understood how the magic worked!" which is idiotic. It's not like a law of physics that was once known and then forgotten in a dark age---it's a /deliberately constructed source of power/ that's driven by the /same principles as the smaller magical works,/ and it's entirely inane and unrealistic to posit that the knowledge of, y'know, this GIGANTIC FRIGGING RUNE was /completely lost prior to any kind of meaningful apocalypse./

Furthermore, the dialogue is stilted, the characters are dumb and erratically motivated, and the writing itself is childish, which opinion I arrive at having spent three years teaching and grading the writing of eleven year olds. If Brandon Sanderson reads my first, incorrect rant, I am entirely sorry for any degree of pissed-off he becomes, and abjectly apologize, and direct him to this more accurate rant instead, acknowledging any further inaccuracies as my own fault.

Thanks for helping me strengthen my core point by stripping out the tangential mistakes that were making my argument sound almost (but not quite) half as poorly-thought-through as the book Elantris itself.

The book sucks. I freely admit that, in my urge to unload my disdain for it, I didn't bother to go back and do detailed research to correct my impressions, which had drifted into inaccuracy in the years since I read it. My initial impression remains correct (confidence: 95%) and if I didn't have half a dozen better things to do with my money and time, I'd gladly go buy a paperback copy and assemble 30 concrete examples of its terribleness for you.

None of which would shift your opinion, /because you like Fritos and that's completely okay./
