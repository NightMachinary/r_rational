  The problem is that the central thing is just completely unrealistic, in the sense that universes don't work like that.

People don't respond in dumb, slow ways to disasters when infected with a painful disease?

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_government_response_to_Hurricane_Katrina]]

Yes they do, and a dumb slow response to a crisis was a major part of HPMOR's plot too.

I've noticed this sort of odd optimism among [[/r/rational]] readers before. Did you consider all the potential failure points of such a plan?

They didn't know what had happened. They heard a loud sound. They didn't hear a voice saying there was an earthquake that cracked the land To find out what it was they'd need to send scouting parties out over dozens or hundreds of miles to map the land and find any land disturbance. It would be a major adventure that would take weeks or months.

And some of them may have written down that it was the land, those who were smarter. That doesn't mean that people actually cared to read their mad ramblings.

This attitude of [[/r/rational]] "Why are there problems, people immediately solve any problems" is really odd given that we were founded by lesswrong people.

  As for the anachronism---first, I don't think "this other book did it wrong too!" is any kind of defense,
#+end_quote

The use of anachronisms really isn't something that the average rational reader is obliged to care about. For a start, the books aren't necessarily supposed to be in english, it's probably a translation. For a second, the average reader isn't going to know well what is anachronistic and what isn't. For a third, as Brandon notes when saying how he intentionally does it-

  I have gotten a little grief from readers regarding Kiin's family. Some think that the family as a whole feels too 'modern.' It is an anachronism that, to an extent, I'll admit. One of the quirks about the fantasy genre is how it generally prefers to deal with ancient governments, technologies, and societies without actually making its characters conform to more ancient personality patterns. In other words, most fantasy main characters are people who, if dusted off a bit and given a short history lesson, could fit-in quite well in the modern world.

  I'll be honest. I prefer the genre this way. I don't read fantasy because I want a history lesson, though learning things is always nice. I read for characters---and I want to like the characters I get to know. I like putting characters in situations and exploring how they would deal with extreme circumstances. I just don't think this kind of plotting would be as strong, or as interesting, if the characters weren't innately identifiable to a modern readership.

  My in-world explanation for this is simple. Just because our world placed a certain kind of cultural development alongside a certain level of technological development doesn't mean that it always has to be that way. In many of my worlds, culture has out-stripped technology. This does have some rational basis; I write worlds that involve very distinct---and often very prevalent---magic systems. Because of the benefit of these magics, many of my societies haven't been forced to rely as much on technology. There is more leisure time, more time for scholarship, and---as a result---the societies are more developed.

  the problem is shoehorning it in for no other reason than to highlight that you, the author, are being supportive of gay people.

Shoehorning sex things in with minimal support is well within the traditions of the book. See the frequent bondage and rape scenes scattered throughout the books.

  But defending their quality is going to be hard to do, and I don't think you've managed to shift me, yet, if that's what you were after (I also suspect the above post isn't going to shift anyone else, either, but ... typical mind). There are people who'll try to convince you that Michael Bay plots are good, too.
#+end_quote

Most of your critiques of them are based off things which are obviously wrong based on in story things. No, hundreds of years didn't pass between the earthquake and the story. No, the city doesn't power the magic. No, people don't always have immediate and rational responses to disasters. You are free to believe what you want, but it's not necessarily going to be convincing to people who remember the story well.
