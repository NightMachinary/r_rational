  OR HUNDREDS OF YEARS, NONE OF THE ACTUAL EXPERIENCED EXPERT MAGICIANS WHO KNEW THEIR MAGIC SYSTEM THROUGH AND THROUGH AND KNEW THAT THE PHYSICAL SHAPE OF RUNES MATTERED /EVER/ CAME UP WITH THE IDEA THAT HEY, MAYBE THE REASON THINGS ARE SCREWED UP IS THE EARTHQUAKE MESSED WITH THE MOST IMPORTANT RUNE.

Bolded bit, what yo cared about most-

For ten years, none of the non experts (for the experienced magicians were dead or disabled immediately after, and didn't know what had happened till weeks or months later) who knew the magic system ok based on a couple of books written by people who knew a lot but not everything about magic ever managed to recreate a complicated magic system from scattered documents.

Your core rant was incorrect. This sort of factual incorrectness and insensitivity to researching the story has pissed off authors before, when people here tell them they're irrational because their characters didn't do x improbable and unlikely to work scheme which ignores story canon, so challenging such arguments is important.
