  Nepene, I'm not sure what your goal is.

To correct factual incorrectness. I have no idea how you got me saying it was awesome from that.

  If it's to convince me that Sanderson's a good writer, you're absolutely doing it wrong.

What makes a person or a good or bad writer isn't really something that either of us touched on. We could talk about the prose, the characterization of various people, the humour, the rationality or lack thereof of various plans in the book, stuff which generally determines enjoyment. Since the actual facts of what you said were wrong and that had no effect on your opinion your opinion of the book is probably more based on the feels it gave you, the central absurd feels it gave you.

I can't change a book making you feel shitty or whatever. My hope is more that any new people who haven't made an opinion don't base it on incorrect things.

I do like the book. Given that you immediately resorted to personal insults against the fans, and have here- "who a lot of tasteless people" or you earlier describing reading a fantasy book as unhealthy a fantastic discussion was unlikely.

If you want a good discussion, it's better to base it on things that actually happened, and to not insult people who have different opinions from you.
