I get the feeling that most aspects of a "rational" story actually refer to the worldbuilding, rather than the book itself, with most of the actual content coming down to "good writing" (believable characters). I don't think characters not munchkining their way to the top means that a story isn't rational; I don't really see how Frodo or Sam could have used their wits better.

I definitely wouldn't call the rest a "B-track story". Frodo and Sam played a crucial role (perhaps the crucial role), but the tale is about the world as a whole, not just about them with some side conflict thrown in. For the same reason, I wouldn't call that the climax of the story, it puts too emphasis on something which is actually just part of a whole.
