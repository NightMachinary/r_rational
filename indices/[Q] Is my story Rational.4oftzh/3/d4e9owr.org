Gotta say, I really like the story so far (I'm in book three), to the point that it has cost me a night of sleep.

One thing I wonder is whether the Protag has either Precog, some kind of Luck-based power or an unconsious sort of defensive Telekinesis. Because the plot armour is strong with this one.

The one thing that is annoying is that the protag occasionally speculates about things he already knows. Like wondering whether a person is trans after learning in the previous book that they got gender reassignment surgery.
