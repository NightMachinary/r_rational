Thanks for clarifying. I felt pretty much the same way when I read /Mistborn/. (i.e., not terribly good, but an entertaining enough way to pass the time) I was somewhat disappointed, since my first exposure to his writing was through Wheel of Time, which I thought was pretty well done, overall, though [[#s][like you, I had a few issues.]]

For what it's worth, I read /The Way of Kings/ and found it to be both enjoyable and well-written. It might or might not be to your taste, but it's playing a league or two up from /Mistborn/. I've heard it suggested that finishing Jordan's work really helped Sanderson's writing. I can't say whether that's what happened, but the results are certainly there.
