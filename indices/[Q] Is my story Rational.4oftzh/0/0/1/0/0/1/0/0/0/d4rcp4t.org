Nepene, I'm not sure what your goal is.

If it's to convince me that Sanderson's a good writer, you're absolutely doing it wrong. If your goal is to convince /others/ that Sanderson is a good writer, I /suspect/ you're doing it wrong, but hey, by all means keep trying.

/My/ goal was to blow off steam about a shitty popular author who a lot of tasteless people think is good at what he does. I've succeeded at that goal (and at this point, I'm certainly willing to bet ten bucks that a randomized sample of [[/r/rational][r/rational]] readers would side with the anti-Sanderson camp, rather than the pro). I was interested in hearing your defense, at first, but given that the above was mostly just you repeating yourself, only louder (e.g. reiterating specific and irrelevant corrections about Elantris that I already freely admitted I got wrong, and which don't bear on its central absurdity), I no longer have faith that you're going to say anything worth hearing on the topic.

How this discussion feels, from my end:

#+begin_quote
  Me: "Thing sucks!"

  You: "You're wrong, thing is /actually awesome./"

  Me: "Er ... no?"

  You: "Yes! You're wrong, /thing is awesome./ Besides, other books do thing just as bad!"
#+end_quote

We /agree/ on what happens, in the book. Sure, in my loathing, I retrieved exaggerated memories such as thinking more time had passed, etc. But given your corrections, we have basically identical models of what actually took place in the story, and what Sanderson actually does as a writer.

I posit that it's all deeply stupid and immature and that the basic tenets of realism have been twisted around to satisfy X or Y thing that Sanderson thinks would be cool. You posit that it's realistic and clever and good writing. At this point, we're talking past each other, not engaging---I feel like I've presented arguments for /why/ it's deeply stupid and immature, and I feel like you've mainly just alternated between simply declaring that it's good (sans any actual model of why or how) and accusing my opinion of being hypocritical (because HPMOR and other parts of WoT do it just as badly, see!?). Your opinion doesn't feel particularly coherent, and I'm not interested in a third round of you saying the same exact things.

Since you don't seem to be interested in hearing a third round of /me/ saying the exact same things, either, let's just call it a day, shall we? Personally, I feel like I've won this debate, and I declare victory. You should feel free to do the same---I'm not interested enough to contradict you, at this point.
