Except that none of the specific facts you corrected were relevant to what makes Elantris an objectively poorly written book. For instance, the difference between it being a hundred years vs. ten years is marginal, not fundamental.

I repeat that I did not, in fact, want a discussion---I was willing to enter one, once you seemed to be presenting a different opinion. But all I wanted---and what I got---was to air an opinion. The subsequent discussion was (and is) unsatisfying, and I believe you are misunderstanding /yourself/ if you can say, with a straight face, that /all/ you were trying to do was correct the specific facts I got wrong.

I stand by my assertion that people who say books like Elantris are good/quality are tasteless. That's orthogonal to the question of whether or not they're enjoyable---even people with excellent taste can enjoy Fritos. It's one thing to /like/ Pacific Rim, and quite another to claim it's /well-written./
