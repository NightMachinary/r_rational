The vast majority of the Elantrians were slain by the Reod due to riots after (people apparently didn't like them much), with the stronger ones who know more magic and theory being more prone to death or being disabled due to their strong connection with Aondor fucking them up. Ten years later Raoden reactivated it, not hundreds of years later. Knowledge of the connection of the land to the aons was fairly universal, although the city shape's connection was not in any of the books they read.

The magic isn't powered by the city. It's powered by Aondor, an invisible field of divine energy which the city helps people tap into. The shape of the city was done in the distant past, and may have been based on precursor magic from Dominion and Devotion, the source of the energy field, and may not be understood by the Elantrians.

The Elantrians may have fixed the issue in time if they had not been killed. After that it would have been very tricky for anyone to fix the city, as they'd have had to fight their way through multiple gangs.

This is fairly explicitly stated in the books (other than the precursor tech stuff), it's not some deep hidden theory. You should read the books more carefully. I thought it was a nice story to show the negative consequences of intellectual purges, something humanity has commonly done, and the value of books in enabling a quick recovery to high tech levels.

On the wheel of time- HPMOR was anachronistic. Historical realism has never been a key goal of rational fiction. And being supportive of gay people is good, I ave no objection to that.
