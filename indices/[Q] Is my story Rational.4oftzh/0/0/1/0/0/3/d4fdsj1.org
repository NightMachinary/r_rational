Posting in the Sanderson-bashing thread \o/

What struck me about /The Final Empire/ was just how incredibly cliché-laden it was. The protagonist is ☑ an orphan ☑ with important secret parentage ☑ who gets rare magical powers (which, through no effort of her own, are ☑ the /super/ rare, extra powerful variant, and ☑ also come with mysterious mystical extras), then ☑ her home gets destroyed by the bad guy and she's forced into adventure, etc. etc. all the stations of the hero's journey.

The tagline is "What if the Dark Lord won?" as if that's some bit of creative brilliance. Wow, your protagonist start out as the oppressed subject of an evil empire, I've never heard /that/ one before.

I even gave volume 2 a try, because my rationalist friend was singing its praise (and back then I hadn't learned the lesson of sunk costs in fiction). But [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Mistborn/comments/2g6qka/spoilers_fe_the_most_irritating_paragraph_in_well/][I got the complete lack of self-awareness thrown into my face so hard]] I finally managed to walk away.
