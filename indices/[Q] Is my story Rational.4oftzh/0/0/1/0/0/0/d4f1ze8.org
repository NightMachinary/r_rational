Ooh, then I know an entire genre of writing that's Bad. I've described the [[/r/noveltranslations][xianxia genre]] using the exact same metaphor you just did; eating junk food.

Main character does what he wants, bows to nobody, advances through the ranks of martial cultivation at a breakneck speed due to some artifact or bloodline or whatnot, causing everybody to look down upon him right before he kicks their asses. And all the female main characters eventually fall into his harem despite him showing social skills that are nothing impressive (and sometimes he's kind of creepy), and also /everybody is a dick. Everybody in the entire world./

Probably so he can justify the aforementioned ass-kickings.
