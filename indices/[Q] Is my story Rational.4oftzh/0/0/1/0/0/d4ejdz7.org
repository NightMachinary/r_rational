In my head, it's the difference between being enjoyable-but-low-quality, and just plain bad. Michael Bay is a Bad Director, and so is Zack Snyder, but their movies can still be fun to watch. I know a lot of people who derive a lot of enjoyment out of Brandon Sanderson, and I'm not interested in doing something incredibly stupid like telling people they're wrong to enjoy a thing. But it's store-brand junk food; I think /I'm/ a better writer than Brandon Sanderson, and I'm not even at the top of the writers on this one tiny subreddit.

As a concrete example, take the book Elantris. [[#s][Spoilers]]

It's totally fine for people to love books like that, just like it's totally fine for me to eat an entire party-sized bag of Fritos once in a while. But the fact that I derive enjoyment from the Fritos doesn't make them Healthy, and the fact that Sanderson can create experiences that some people enjoy doesn't make his writing Good.
