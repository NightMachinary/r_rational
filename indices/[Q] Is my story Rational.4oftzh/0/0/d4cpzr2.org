  "But you're just talking about /good writing/."

Not quite correct. There's lots of elements of good writing that run somewhat counter to rationalfic; for instance, symbolism, narrative causality, catharsis, etc. ... You can get those in rationalfic, of course, but only from the world's own causality. I guess it's a question of author skill, but the question is what's more important to sacrifice. Plus, regular good writing puts less limits on the things the author is allowed to do; Lord of the Rings is good but it's not /rational/, because it sets its problems up with undefined magic, which is good technique (Sanderson has a good article on that somewhere) but bad "reductionist worldbuilding". (And Orcs, of course.)
