There is a larger story there that is plausibly rational, and the setting may qualify, but the /story/ is a story of Hobbits following their feelings and showcasing their racial qualities, while greater powers' greater plans move them like the pawns they are. Hell, the climax of the story is a morality play on the virtue of mercy, set up by /God/. Frodo is many things, brave, determined, even wise at times, but a rationalist hero he ain't.
