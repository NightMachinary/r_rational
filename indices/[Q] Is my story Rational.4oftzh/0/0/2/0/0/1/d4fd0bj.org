  I can't really imagine how the Fellowship could be the optimal group of people to destroy the ring. I'll have to re-read the Council of Elrond and figure out how that was justified.

Frodo was first to volunteer and has the ring, it would just be too awkward for anyone to argue. Gandalf would back him anyway, since he knows of hobbit's resistance to corruption.

Gandalf + Aragorn is a no-brainer.

Gimli, Legolas, and Boromir, I don't remember the book well enough. The way the movie portrayed it though, after that flaming row, rejecting any of them would wound national prides and ruin diplomatic relationships right when they're most needed. Bloody politics. The Fellowship /does/ need more than two competent members, but I'm sure Rivendell has its share of mighty elven warriors who are better at everything.

Sam, Merry and Pippin... Yeah, no, there's really no excuse. Frodo would stand for Sam, but they can be made to see reason, I'm pretty sure. The hobbits are all there to be protagonists, characters with room to grow, not for any rational reason.
