  Hang on, do you find that a rational story requires all (main?) characters to be rational?

No, but the story of Lord of the Rings is at its core the story of Frodo and Samwise; the rest of the characters are ... shall we say auxiliary? They aren't exactly part of the main story so much as they crossed it at some point, and then got their own B-track story to change up the monotony of "two hobbits go for a hike".

  Could you expand on this? I don't recognise it in the plot at all.

"Deserves it! I daresay he does. Many that live deserve death. And some that die deserve life. Can you give it to them? Then do not be too eager to deal out death in judgement. For even the very wise cannot see all ends. I have not much hope that Gollum can be cured before he dies, but there is a chance of it. And he is bound up with the fate of the Ring. My heart tells me that he has some part to play yet, for good or ill, before the end; and when that comes, the pity of Bilbo may rule the fate of many -- yours not least. "
