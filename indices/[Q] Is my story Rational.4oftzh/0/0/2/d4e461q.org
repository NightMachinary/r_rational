  Lord of the Rings is good but it's not rational, because it sets its problems up with undefined magic, which is good technique [...] but bad "reductionist worldbuilding".

Could you perhaps expand on this? I would call it rational, just set in a world with different laws. That these are often not directly explained in the books is, IMHO, not an issue.
