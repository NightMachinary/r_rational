I have a few ways of paring down what "rational fiction" means to me, and one of them is that there's no Rule of Cool: in rational fiction, it's not okay to suspend the rules of the world (or established characterization) in order to do something wicked sweet. You have to earn your wicked sweet moments. (Same goes for Rule of Drama, naturally.)
