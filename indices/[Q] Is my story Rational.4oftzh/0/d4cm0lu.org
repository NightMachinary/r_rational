Yes, based on first chapter.

Although, to be fair, when I tried to describe the characteristics of the rational genre to my (intelligent, well-read) cousin, he kept replying "But you're just talking about /good writing./ Like, that's not /new./"

I wouldn't worry too much about boxes ... it's more about finding the story's audience than about tailoring the story /to/ an audience (barring edge cases like a desire to promote thinly-veiled propaganda for worldchanging reasons).
