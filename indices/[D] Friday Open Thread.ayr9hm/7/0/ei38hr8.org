The following two stories are ones that I typically recommend when someone wants to read about immortality, but I want to warn you that both stories have very dark and graphic themes such as violence, slavery, and depravity, Demon in particular. Demon has situations similar to Harry from HPMOR talking about using Hufflepuff bones as weapons, but more /graphic/. Fortunately, it's only described, not drawn in Demon.

[[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008HALNFQ/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1][Wild Seed]] - It's about how two immortals relate to each other as the only long-lived humans on the planet. They have major disagreements in how they each attempt to create fellow immortal companions and there are strong themes of slavery and unique usage of social power.

I bring this story up here because it really plays around with themes of immortality in novel ways, even if no one's obviously rationalist (just enlightened self-interest at best).

[[http://www.shigabooks.com/][Demon]] - Unlike many stories, Jimmy is a complete sociopath who can only care about his similarly sociopathic daughter. He can't die and, like Wild Seed, plays with the theme of immortality in very unusual ways I don't often see in other stories. A big part of the story is solving the logic puzzles in what is causing his inability to die.
