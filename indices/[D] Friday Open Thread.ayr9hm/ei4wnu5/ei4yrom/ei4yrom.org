Have you had the process shown to you by a professional? As I understand it [[http://www.hairremovalforum.com/laser-hair-removal-research/laser-hair-removal-scarring/137/][there's some minor risk of scarring]], but I suspect if you have a handle on the procedure, that will be minimised.

Assuming you've undergone some laser hair removal already, there might be an advantage to be had to hire a professional to set up the equipment with you, walk you through the process, how much time is required for your skin to recover, what to focus on for maintaining the machine, who to call for maintenance/repair, and so on.

Keeping in mind I've never read anything on this topic, I assume it's under the same constrains as other economic processes: bigger upfront cost, but lower long-term. What you save in money is partially paid in time and inconvenience. Also, whatever the tool costs, put aside some money for replacement, repair, and maintenance purposes, perhaps whenever you actually /use/ the machine.

Penultimately, you may want to set a reminder for in a year or two to make review and reevaluate if you're still happy with doing the removal yourself, or if the convenience of not having to set up the machine, going through the procedure, cleaning it, and finally putting it back in storage is worth the savings.

Lastly, take care whom you tell people you have such a machine, don't be surprised if people come to you to have their hair removed, and maybe be cross when you say no.
