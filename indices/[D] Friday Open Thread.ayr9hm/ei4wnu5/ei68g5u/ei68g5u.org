I looked into it and the consensus on the "as seen on TV" laser hair removal tools is that they don't work very well and are basically a scam. The thought that convinced me was if those cheap, handheld devices worked every nail salon would have them and try to upsell you IPL with a pedicure. Even the one you linked below, the reviews are /very/ subjective and seem to mostly be from people who have only used it a couple of times: plenty of time for the placebo effect.

I had IPL done (I think about 7 or 8 treatments) and ~4 years ago and my hair is maybe a tiny bit thinner but not noticeably or conveniently so. I think it's because I cheaped out and got a groupon rather than going to a reputable place: a friend of mine is transgender and she got good results on her face with IPL. Also if you google for IPL horror stories you can see that people end up with horrible burns occasionally due to improper use of the equipment.

Basic things about the suitability of your personal hair for removal also need to be considered: the darker your hair and the lighter your skin the better results. I have dark hair and light skin and was not happy with my results, FWIW.

I've heard that getting electrolysis is really the only way to go for permanent results, but it's a lot more expensive and extremely slow (as someone basically uses electric tweezers to kill each individual follicle).
