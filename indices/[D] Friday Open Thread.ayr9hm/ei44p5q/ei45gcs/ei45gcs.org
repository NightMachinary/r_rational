Not sure what your university is like but from my personal experience in my bachelor's I think the topic you choose is not as important as your supervisor: which supervisors are known to be good supervisors, which are known to be bad? Ask around with past students, they will have opinions.

I chose a bad supervisor for my bachelor project because he was a good lecturer and regretted it because he wasn't very supportive and didn't review my drafts in a timely manner. A friend chose a bad lecturer and I was shocked at his choice and he said that the reason she was a bad lecturer is because she focused all her attention on her students and as a result was a really good supervisor.

Of course I'm now thinking that if this is a six month research project you might not get a choice of supervisor and it might just be more like a paper that everyone in the class submits to the professor? Anyway, maybe someone else will benefit from this advice.
