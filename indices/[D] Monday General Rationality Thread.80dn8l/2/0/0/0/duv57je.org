Why do you think sending donations to authors would result in a legal battle? How would the OC creators find out about the donations?

  Regarding transformation, it's not always enough, and in many of the cases ToaKraka listed, the works aren't sufficiently transformative, at least as far as my understanding of the law goes (copyright law is a hobby of mine). Writing a sequel to the Harry Potter series is an infringement of copyright, at least as far as the law goes, because you're taking the bones of the original series and using them in the same way they were intended to be used. Most of the successful uses of fair use that lean on "transformation" are about parody, critique, or social commentary of the original work for this reason, and there are a slew of failed cases where someone tried to defend a derivative work as transformative because while it created something new, that new thing wasn't actually transforming the original.

That's a fair point. Do you think a law should be made that protects works that aren't blatant ripoffs but also aren't 99% new content, like parody critique and social commentary works tend to be?
