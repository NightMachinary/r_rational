The large rights-holding corporations already trawl the internet looking for rights-violations. All it would really take is for one of them to get a bug up their butt about fanfiction, /probably/ as a result of a wildly successful fanfic that was perceived to be taking sales from the original series, /probably/ through a somewhat flagrant violation (e.g. someone who finishes every chapter with 'support me on Patreon if you want more chapters!').

Except that it probably wouldn't actually come to a legal battle, because the monied rights-holder would instead come after the services used for hosting and/or payment. I'm pretty sure that fanfiction.net already caves immediately to any legal gesture whatsoever, or even a polite request, given that there are a list of fanfics not allowed on the site. C&Ds would get sent to ISPs, hosting services, payment processors ... and most of them would instantly cave, because there's very little profit involved in providing legal defense for someone writing fanfic, even a popular one.

And yeah, I think copyright law is in a horrible state and in need of reform. I'm not really totally on-board with everyone being able to make sequels of whatever they want, whenever they want, because I think that would accelerate the culturally destructive nostalgia mining we see all around us ... but yeah, I'd like some kind of change.
