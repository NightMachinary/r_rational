  I'm not really totally on-board with everyone being able to make sequels of whatever they want, whenever they want, because I think that would accelerate the culturally destructive nostalgia mining we see all around us

I frown sternly on your [[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/freedom-speech/#PatJusForLimSpe][paternalistic]] view of free speech. The solution to bad movies that exploit nostalgia is /not/ restrictions that prevent the production of such movies. Rather, a loosening of copyright would allow consumers the freedom to choose between /bad/ movies that /exploit/ nostalgia and /good/ movies that /expand on/ old material, because in such an environment movies in /both/ categories would be able to proliferate.
