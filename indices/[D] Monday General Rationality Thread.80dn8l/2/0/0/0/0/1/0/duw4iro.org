  Even with regards to fanfiction? Why?
#+end_quote

Fanfiction would become commercial fiction; even though fans would still write it, there would be people writing derivative works purely as a money-making enterprise. My worry/prediction is that the market would be flooded with "sequels" to popular books, in the same way that the market gets flooded with imitators already, except that we'd be even more locked into rehashing and regurgitating the same old shit, mostly because derivative works often ride the goodwill, characterization, investment, etc. of original works, and are often read because of risk aversion on the part of the readers (and written/produced because of risk aversion on the part of writers).

People trying to write original fiction are /already/ in competition with established franchises, and that problem would only get worse if the monetary incentive starts going toward fanfic as well.

(I think the arguable point here is that more fanfic and less original fiction because of a change in incentives is a bad thing. I generally think that fanfic has advantages that aren't artistically or culturally good, but that's probably up for debate. Write a million words, and people will want you to write four million, and fanfic fills the role of expanding a universe indefinitely, which for /most of them/ is where the appeal comes from, which I think leads to this incestuousness that's already a part of modern culture that I really dislike on both aesthetic grounds and on cultural health. Culture can't survive or thrive when everything is just a remix of a remix, and putting more fuel on that fire seems bad to me. What would really help is lowering the copyright length to something like 14 years, which would promote originality while allowing free expression on cultural touchstones.)
