Donation is often used as a thin fig leaf of deniability in a number of circumstances, but the problem is that the law often cares most about /intent/. This comes up most often not in the realm of copyright infringing prose fiction, but prostitution, and the primary reason that all prostitution isn't run on a donation-based model is that even if you call it a donation, the courts will still say "if there had been no donation, there would be no sex, ergo it is paying a fee for sex, and therefore, prostitution as defined by the legal code".

I'm not aware of any actual legal test of this with regards to prose fiction, and it would probably come down to a question of intent; are people donating in order to signal, in order to show appreciation, or because if they don't donate, no work will be created? Is any of this actually provable to the level of burden required by the courts?

Except it won't actually come to that, because there are very, very few fanfic authors that can withstand a legal battle in terms of money, and very few legal organizations that would take on such a case pro bono (the [[http://www.transformativeworks.org/][Organization for Transformative Works]] might be one, but it would probably have to be a very solid case that would set good precedent).

Regarding transformation, it's not always enough, and in many of the cases ToaKraka listed, the works /aren't/ sufficiently transformative, at least as far as my understanding of the law goes (copyright law is a hobby of mine). Writing a sequel to the Harry Potter series is an infringement of copyright, at least as far as the law goes, because you're taking the bones of the original series and using them in the same way they were intended to be used. Most of the successful uses of fair use that lean on "transformation" are about parody, critique, or social commentary of the original work for this reason, and there are a slew of failed cases where someone tried to defend a derivative work as transformative because while it created something new, that new thing wasn't actually transforming the original.
