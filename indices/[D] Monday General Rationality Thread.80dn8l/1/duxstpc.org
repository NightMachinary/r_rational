So I'm taking a class mixing psychologists, electrical engineers, computer scientists and neuroscientists. We're supposed to be building a /lingua franca/ amongst each other, to conduct interdisciplinary work...

It's depressing how much of what we're really doing amounts to very basic "rationalist-type", "read the Sequences lol" stuff. One of today's engineering lessons was that the map is not the territory. Actually, that's a big lesson from the whole class, since the entire history of cognitive psychology and neuroscience often looks like one long string of mind-projection fallacies.

Such is life.
