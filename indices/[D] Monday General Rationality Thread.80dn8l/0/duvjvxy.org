Do humans have any axiomatic beliefs? An axiomatic belief it one that is inherently true; you can never argue yourself out of that belief, nor be argued from it. Some things seem extremely difficult to be convinced otherwise of, like the fact I am alive (conditional on me being able to think it), but... not impossible.

If there are no axiomatic beliefs, how far could you take this? Could you change their mind on every belief simultaneously? Could you turn a person into another preexisting model, solely through sensory hacks? I'm tempted to say no, not least for physical structure-of-the-brain reasons.

This is a silly question, but it's one of those silly questions that's endured casual prodding pretty well.
