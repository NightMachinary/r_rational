This is interesting. There exist certain arguments, such as appeal to violence, which are not logically valid that will cause me to state that my belief has changed.

However, there exist no arguments, be they sound, cogent, or otherwise, which would cause me to be less convinced that there do not exist married bachelors.

Do you think some argument could convince you that there exist married bachelors?
