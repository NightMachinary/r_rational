Alright, let me reduce this to base logic, then.

Let q(x)="X is both male and of marital age." Let M(x)="X is married."

BACHELOR(x)=q(x) ^ ~M(x) (by definition)

So, a married Bachelor would be:

BACHELOR(x) ^ M(x)=q(x) ^ [M(x) ^ ~M(x)]

Through logical simplification, we find that BACHELOR(x) ^ M(x) implies [M(x) ^ ~M(x)].

We know that for all p, p ^ ~p=F. So,

BACHELOR(x) ^ M(x) implies F.

Modus tolens, BACHELOR(x) ^ M(x)=F for all X.

Therefore, there does not exist a married Bachelor.

Therefore, any argument to the contrary is flawed.
