Are we working under a definition of axiomatic beliefs in a global sense or an individual sense? Also, why would one need to be born with this belief?

If we are working on the definition of axiomatic belief that requires all persons to share this belief and for it to be unshakable, then I am entirely unconvinced that such beliefs exist.

If we're using the definition that I thought we were using, then I as an example have many specific beliefs that derive from axiomatic logic and definitions that I cannot be convinced away from.
