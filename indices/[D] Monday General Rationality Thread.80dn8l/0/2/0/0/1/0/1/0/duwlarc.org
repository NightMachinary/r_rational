Yes, demonstrating a contradiction arising from axiomatic logic would necessarily be step 1. However, once this is done you would need to establish a new system for deriving statements from premises and convince me that it's at minimum workable.

However, given how good logic is at producing results, it is unlikely that there is some contradiction that results from the emergent properties of axiomatic logic.
