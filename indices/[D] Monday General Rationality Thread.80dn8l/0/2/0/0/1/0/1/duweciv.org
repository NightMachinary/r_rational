I believe there is a way to convince you otherwise, but it requires a mind far smarter than I, and our assumptions of nearly everything to be horribly horribly wrong.

What this would take would be an elegant thoroughly checked proof, showing that from basic logical axioms, we can derive a contradiction. Logically then, either everything follows, or one of the basic logical axioms is wrong. And if the basic logical axioms that we base our logic on are wrong, then any of our beliefs that rely on logical arguments would be weakened.

Now, you might think, that this is impossible. That there's no way we could be mistaken in our logical thoughts. That this particular event will never happen, so you can never be argued out of your belief. But to that I point out the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect][Dunning-Kruger effect]]: a well known phenomenon where people who are more ignorant think that they know more instead, simply because they are so ignorant that they do know not how to correctly assess their own ignorance. Is it not then possible, that the entire human species is actually incredibly stupid about logic, so stupid that we can't even tell that we are stupid?
