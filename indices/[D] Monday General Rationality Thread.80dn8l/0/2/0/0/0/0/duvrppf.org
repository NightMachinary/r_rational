That's certainly the same series of phonemes, but conceptually, it's not the same.

I was using the definition of "unmarried male of marital age". The definition you used had (Hypothetical) cases such that they do not count as a bachelor as I define it, despite the fact that both of our definitions were fair representations of the common concept of what makes a bachelor.

Therefore your argument to convince me relies on an equivocation fallacy, and so I find it unconvincing.

It was a good attempt, though.
