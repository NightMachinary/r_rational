  I believe there is no such thing as a married bachelor, since bachelor implies unmarried, by definition of bachelor.

"Married" is a legal state, while "bachelor" is a social one. A hypothetical friend of mine is in the last stages of his (long, drawn out) divorce while he's taking the first steps towards finding a new girlfriend.

He's a married bachelor.
