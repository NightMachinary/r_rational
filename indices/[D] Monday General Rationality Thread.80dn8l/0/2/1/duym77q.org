A possible counter-argument example: You are now suddenly in a country in which there are only two judges who have the authority to solve cases regarding marriage problems. Their verdicts are always final, and even they themselves can't change them once they are declared.

In this country bachelor Bob has signed a dubious marriage contract with Alice, and now Bob says that this contract is invalid while Alice says it is valid. Bob takes his copy of the contract to Judge A, while Alice takes hers to judge B. Judge A rules out that the contract is invalid, while judge B rules that it is valid. Thus, Bob becomes trapped in a sort of legal purgatory --- he is both an unmarried bachelor able to commence with his first proper marriage with whomever he likes, /and/ a person married to Alice who would get jailed for polygamy if he tried marrying someone else as well. He is a married bachelor.
