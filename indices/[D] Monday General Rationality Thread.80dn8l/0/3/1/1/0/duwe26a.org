Ah but that presents an avenue for attacking your belief doesn't it?

Imagine an omniscient being came to you and told you about your entire destiny in extreme precision. Would you still believe in free will then? When you know your destiny, and see all your actions match exactly what you now know they were destined to be all along?

This isn't a likely event of course, but if it does convince you that free will isn't real, then your belief in free will isn't an axiomatic belief.
