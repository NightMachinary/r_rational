I have never changed my mind on it because I literally cannot conceive of myself existing as a conscious entity without free will, despite knowing everything I do about implicit bias, cultural pressures, and psychological disorders.

I was also born with autism and have developed anxiety and depression, so it's kind of essential to my mental health that I believe there is a “higher me” capable of controlling the rest of myself. Otherwise, I'd rationalize my self destructive thoughts even more.
