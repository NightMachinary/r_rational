  I think belief in the existence of free will is one of them. I don't think it's possible for a human being to function psychologically if they do not believe they possess some degree of autonomy that is intrinsically separate from external influence.

Free will is an incoherent concept. You make choices on the basis on external circumstances, who you are and possibly some random element inherent in the process. Who you are is the result of external circumstances and possibly some random elements that lead to your birth, upbringing and prior experience. Everything ultimately arises from external circumstances and possibly some randomness inherent in the universe.

What is free will? Where is the autonomy in making decisions in ways the universe has shaped you to make them? Where is the autonomy in making decisions on the basis of random quantum fluctuations? You can choose, not because you are intrinsically separate from the universe but because you are part of the universe and the universe decides everything.
