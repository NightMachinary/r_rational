Axiomatic belief: I exist.

Not "I exist in reality", that's different. "I exist" in the sense that I am a thing. In the sense that Frodo Baggins exists, not in reality, but in a fictional story.

Without some kind of mind control, I cannot be argued out of that belief. I could be convinced that I don't exist in the real world, that I'm a fictional character of a story written by a simulated person in a virtual reality maintained by aliens who are simulated by super-intelligent robots who are being dreamed of by a mental patient in a hypothetical of a god, but at the end of the day, I still exist.
