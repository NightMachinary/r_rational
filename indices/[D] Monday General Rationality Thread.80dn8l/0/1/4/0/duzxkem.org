I'm so tired of re-iterating this point: I mean existence in the weakest possible meaning of the term. Every one of these posts saying X doesn't exist is clearly using a different definition of exist than the one I'm using, and I'm not sure how to explain what I mean any further. I literally said in the first post, that I don't mean exists /in reality/. So telling me that nothing exists in the universe illustrates that you completely missed the point. Under the weakest definition of existence that I'm using here, you can't say X doesn't exist, because simply saying that means that X now exists in your statement. That is how weak the definition of exist I'm using here is.

It doesn't matter if everything is an illusion. They are still things. Illusory things. Paradoxical things. Nonsensical things. Hypothetical things. Unreal things. Contradictory things. All. Still. Things.
