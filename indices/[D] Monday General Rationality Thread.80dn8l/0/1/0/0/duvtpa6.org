When I say "I exist", I don't mean I have to exist in any kind of time continuum, or make any kind of logical sense.

For example, I could say "squares that are circles". They don't exist in reality. They don't even exist theoretically, since squares are by definition, not circles. But since I have mentioned them, they are a thing now. Which means they exist, even if only in this hypothetical illogical paragraph.

So when I say "I exist", I mean it in the same sense. You could convince me that the entire world is an illusion, that there is no real world, that time and space don't exist, that there are no beings that can simulate or create hypotheticals for other things to exist in, that the basic axiom of mathematics reach a contradiction rendering the entire thing meaningless, and it still wouldn't change my belief that "I exist".
