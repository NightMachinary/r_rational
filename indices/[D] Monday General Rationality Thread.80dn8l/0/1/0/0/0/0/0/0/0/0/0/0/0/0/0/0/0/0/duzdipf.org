Which one?

#+begin_quote
  If a person says that 1+1=5 but still believes that if you put one thing and another thing together you have two things then they don't understand what they are saying.

They could also be trolling or crazy but with those possibilites included I would say with extremely high probability >95%.

  if reality followed different rules then our standard arithmetic would be different.

This isn't strictly true. If reality followed different rules of arithmetic then we wouldn't have standard arithmetic because we wouldn't exist. My point is that mathematics was made to model the natural world. When accountants in ancient Babylon were summing mathematical figures on a stone tablet to work out how many barrels of grain they had they weren't trying to figure out how many barrels they had in some imaginary system that had no bearing on reality, they were trying to figure out how many barrels they actually had.

There are mathematical models and formalisms of the natural numbers and arithmetic that aren't directly dependant on reality and use axioms to prove statements but the ones we generally use and refer to when we say things like 3+6=9 use axioms developed from observing reality. If you believe 1+1 does not = 2 in Peano arithmetic then you don't understand Peano arithmetic. There are formalisms that don't reflect nature but when just use normal notation without qualifications then you are implicitly referring to the normal formalisms which reflect reality.

That '1+1=2' corresponds to 'one thing and another put together results in two things' is extremely basic mathematics and I believe with extremely high probability >95% that if you can't follow that then either you misunderstand the meaning of mathematical notation or are being deliberately obtuse.
