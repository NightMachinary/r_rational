  Who are these people and what do they mean by that they don't exist?
#+end_quote

I'll get back to you on this when I have time.

#+begin_quote
  it takes mental dysfunction to believe you don't actually exist in some form.
#+end_quote

Again, this is an assertion that isn't grounded. People believe all sorts of stupid nonsense with healthy brains; we aren't built to be SMT solvers, so it's really odd to keep modelling us as one. Logic is something we've built /on top/ of our fuzzy, pseudo-bayesian brains, not something intrinsically hardwired into them. Saying someone can't believe something /because it is false/ is not only dismissive of how many people profess to, but of the basic architecture of our minds.

  If an adult is incapable of it then they have stunted or impaired brain functions.

I didn't say they were incapable of it.
