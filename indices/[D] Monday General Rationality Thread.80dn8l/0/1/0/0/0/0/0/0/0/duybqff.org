  If you don't believe you exist in any sense then what is doing the disbelieving?
#+end_quote

I am. Reality doesn't care that I'm wrong.

  A super intelligence can convince people of things they thought they would never believe but there are limits.
#+end_quote

Yes, my point is you don't see those limits by making conservative guesses. You can't get anywhere by just restating that it can't do things, because that isn't evidence of anything. It's not even evidence that a human wouldn't convince you in a spare hour!

When you're talking about a brain a billion times faster and a trillion times larger, these limits start looking more like the physical limits on what one /can/ believe, because it is smarter than you and you can only say with confidence what it can do. There are /many/ neurologically healthy people who believe they don't exist. That's real evidence. There is at least one that believes 1+1 is not 2, so I wouldn't even rule that one out.
