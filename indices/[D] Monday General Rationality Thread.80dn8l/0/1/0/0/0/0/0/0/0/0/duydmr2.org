  There are many neurologically healthy people who believe they don't exist. That's real evidence. There is at least one that believes 1+1 is not 2, so I wouldn't even rule that one out.

Who are these people and what do they mean by that they don't exist? They might believe that reality is an illusion, their mind is a perceptual theatre of ideas that doesn't actually think for itself or have complicated ideas of person hood that are expressed imperfectly (probably involving P-Zombies Edit:(Different meanings for 'I') ) but it takes mental dysfunction to believe you don't actually exist in some form. It is like a sight capable person looking out at the world and believing that he can't see. You might believe that your senses are feeding you an illusion but the sense data itself acts as incontrovertible proof that it exists.

Conservation of number is a skill that is learned in childhood. If an adult is incapable of it then they have stunted or impaired brain functions. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_(psychology)]]
