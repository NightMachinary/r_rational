I'm certain I could convince someone that some 8 digit number plus some other 8 digit number equals something it does not; this does not mean they believe that quantities appear and disappear, just that that person is confused.

Similarly, someone can believe 1 + 1 is not 2 without appreciating the implications; perhaps they simply don't believe there is a useful projection from the naturals onto reality, though they probably wouldn't have the background needed to say it that way.
