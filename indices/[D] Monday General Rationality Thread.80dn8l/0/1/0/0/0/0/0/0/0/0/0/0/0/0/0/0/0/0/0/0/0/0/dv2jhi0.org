  In contrast, I cannot point to anything in your most recent post which is an argument rather than a statement of opinion. This makes it very hard to understand what I need to do to understand your point of view, which means you are probably never going to convince me and means that I am struggling to figure out how to convince you.

Okay to convince someone of a false conclusion through logical argument you need to get someone to accept a false premise that is not obviously contradictory to their experience. For example if you are carrot farmer has lived his life out in the sun you are not going to convince him through just words and logical argument that it is and has always been impossible to grow carrots in soil because it is so obviously inconsistent with prior evidence. To do so you would first have to make a complex explanation for why the farmer's memories are incorrect and get the farmer to believe your explanation is more likely than this 'This wacko is lying to me'. The more a lie diverges from a person's understanding of reality (and the prior evidence they have already received) the more credible evidence is needed to support the lie. People assign the words of their conversation partners a very limited amount of credibility, an amount that quickly runs out when they start stating absurdities.

To convince someone that they can't count and have never been able to count requires the person to the trust the computer more than they trust themselves at which point the computer has already won. (A A.I could stick into you a simulation and use gaslighting techniques to convince you that you can't count or work as a perfect ruler for centuries to attain a massive reputation for never making a mistake before recommending that people ride their bikes upside down but that is outside of the scope here)

  E: After 5 minutes in the shower, it occurs to me that there is a fairly simple approach a superintelligence could use to convince me that there aren't the same number of circle on each side of that diagram, and a generalization of the idea that also works for the cycling example. It might be instructive to go over this, but I'm worried that this will end up in no true Scotsman territory, rather than you updating your meta-belief about people's ability to be convinced. I especially don't want the limits of my ability to inoculate you with regards to the abilities of the superinteligent (see also).

I'm extremely doubtful that you have a convincing logical argument that two circles are not two circles or so on considering that you don't currently believe that two circles are not two circles. I think trying to come up with a super intelligent false argument that way is a doomed enterprise.
