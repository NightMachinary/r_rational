Err, not true. There's plenty of people who don't believe in free will, the theory even has a name: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinism][Determinism]]. One can be convinced to believe that everything in the universe is made out of uncaring asentient particles moving according to static rules, and that free will is merely an illusion from highly complex interactions between countless particles.

It doesn't even have to be sciency, it can be a religious belief in something like fate. Plenty of people believe in fate, and believe it is unchangeable. If fate is unchangeable, then free will is clearly a lie, since you are already fated to will whatever you would will, with no freedom to do otherwise.
