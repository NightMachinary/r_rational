Well, from my perspective, the choices I am told I will make would still be choices I feel like I am making at the time that I make them. Even if I was told that I would make them, that wouldn't make my decisions or anyone else's less real.

Non-linear experiences and knowledge of the future do not undercut my belief in free will, it just means events can cause themselves to occur. What happens just happens because that's the way it happened based on decisions made.
