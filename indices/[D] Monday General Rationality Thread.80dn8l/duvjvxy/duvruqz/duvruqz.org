I think belief in the existence of free will is one of them. I don't think it's possible for a human being to function psychologically if they do not believe they possess some degree of autonomy that is intrinsically separate from external influence.

Even philosophies like Buddhism that believe the “self” is an illusion still believe that humans have the ability to choose to disassociate from the self to become free of attachments that hold a person back from reaching a better state of existence.

It's one thing to believe in fatalism or nihilism where your life doesn't matter, but to believe that you have no control over your existence at all is schizophrenic. If you don't think that you can think, then you would either continue thinking or cease to be capable of living as an organism with a brain.
