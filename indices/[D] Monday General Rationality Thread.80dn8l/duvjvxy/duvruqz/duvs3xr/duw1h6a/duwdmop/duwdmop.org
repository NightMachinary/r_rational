  I was also born with autism and have developed anxiety and depression, so it's kind of essential to my mental health that I believe there is a “higher me” capable of controlling the rest of myself.

This kind of justification is something that you can almost certainly be convinced otherwise of, and it's the kind of thing that suggests to me your opinions here are less rigorously based than you think.

We're talking about the kind of adversary who, on hearing that, would immediately start planning your next 10 years of (non-contact) mental health treatment, just in order to, in the end, change your mind on free will.
