I don't think you're engaging with this question in (what I would consider to be) the right mindset. I certainly agree that logic is injective onto reality, and I'll even take your definition of BACHELOR(x), and I certainly agree with your conclusion, but these are not beliefs that I was born with, they are not beliefs that no amount of forgeable evidence could dissuade me of.

It would be hard, /very/ hard, to show me enough seeming counterexamples of the map between FOL and reality that I don't allow its usage as you did, but I can certainly imagine there being some argument that convinces me to discard non-Bayesian arguments, and I've seen enough stupid arguments from philosophers to know that getting muddled up in this respect is something that /does/ regularly happen.

It would be less hard to convince me that BACHELOR(x) is not, in fact, by definition, something I expect I would be a lot less surprised about than, say, the sun not rising tomorrow (a fact I can certainly be convinced of).
