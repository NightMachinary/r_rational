It seems very likely to me, yes, though I don't know what that argument is else I would believe it. I think this might even be in the realm of what a very prepared, very smart person could do.

Certainly I have made mistakes about (obvious) logical truths in the past, flipped flopped on issues I thought myself certain of, and those terms are sufficiently vague and steeped in law that it doesn't seem even particularly hard to trick me somewhere.

When you get to more fundamental beliefs like Modus Ponens, it's more likely that extraordinary, potentially superhuman, effort comes into discussion.
