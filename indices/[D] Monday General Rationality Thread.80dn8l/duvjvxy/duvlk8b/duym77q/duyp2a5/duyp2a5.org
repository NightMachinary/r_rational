This is not bad. It is true that if Married(x) isn't well-defined, that is to say the some entry has output T and F, then the proof fails. However, prepositional logic in general fails for these cases, which is why there's an axiom to prevent that (in english):

An open statement with a decided variable is always a statement. (Part of the definition of open statements).

All statement are true or false, and no statement is simultaneously true and false. (Definition of a statement).

Now I admit that I did not consider an exact definition of marriage, but I am still convinced that there exist no x such that x is both married and unmarried.
