This seems like a pretty strong contender for needs-superhuman-effort, but for reasons I'm not sure I can explain concisely I'm not sold on that really being the case.

There are conceivable paths I see that lead to beliefs like "we don't have evidence for a continuum of time" and then to "everything exists only in as much as it is does from its own perspective", to which there are paths to beliefs like "everything exists to an equal extent", after which pointing to something that doesn't exist at least shakes the belief in self-existence.

I'm not saying these are /correct/ arguments, but I don't need to do so; they only need to be convincing when given by its most effective advocate, however theoretical.
