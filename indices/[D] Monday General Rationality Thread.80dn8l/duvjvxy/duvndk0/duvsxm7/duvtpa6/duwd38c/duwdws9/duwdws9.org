It isn't because it is correct, but because it is so ridiculously weak that I don't see how you could convince me that it's wrong.

Most beliefs are like towers: the belief sits at the top, and the rest of the tower are the premises and assumptions that are necessary for that belief. If you knock out the assumptions, you can topple the tower. For example, the belief that "there are no squares that are circles", relies on assumptions like squares have 4 sides and circles are round. You comment about Manhattan space is an attempt to knock out my assumption that circles are round, which would indeed topple my tower of belief that "there are no squares that are circles".

The belief that "I exist" /(in the weakest possible sense of the word)/ is like a single block. There aren't any other assumptions necessary for it as far as I can tell. That's why I was listing so many examples of assumptions you could knock out without having any effect on that belief. The existence of the world isn't part of the tower. The existence of time isn't part of the tower. The existence of other beings isn't part of the tower. You remove them from my belief space, and the single block "I exist" will still be standing there by itself.
