My response was prior to seeing your edit, which actually answered a few things on its own.

  If reality followed different rules of arithmetic then we wouldn't have standard arithmetic because we wouldn't exist. My point is that mathematics was made to model the natural world.

This is true and useful information, but it's possible for (a) this to be misunderstood, and (b) the model to not satisfy the thing it is applied to.

For the first case, I can point to a precedent among extremely smart Cambridge students (likely top percentile of global population) that both misunderstood the interaction between math and reality as you presented it here, and misunderstood some basic mathematical claims (eg. there are an infinity of reals between 1 and 2). This does not give credence to the idea that one has to be neurologically defective to be wrong about the meaning of addition.

For the second, it's easy to find places where you can't just apply the naturals; two puddles squished together does not make two puddles.

  If you believe 1+1 does not = 2 in Peano arithmetic then you don't understand Peano arithmetic.
#+end_quote

Yes, this is true, but we should distinguish this from the ability to hold opinions on the topic, and understand what the topic is. You could, after all, make the same claim about being wrong about the sum of two eight-digit numbers, but there it is clear that this is a /legitimate/ kind of incorrectness for the purpose of our argument.

  They could also be trolling or crazy but with those possibilites included I would say with extremely high probability >95%.
#+end_quote

The rest of your reply actually voids the reason I initially asked for a probability estimate, but note that what you have given is a measure of the evidence you would need to be convinced. A superintelligence would laugh at the challenge of providing evidence with the power you say is needed.
