I am finding this conversation frustrating at times because I don't feel it is really getting through that I am objecting to your claims.

It is not enough to convince me that superintelligences cannot convince someone of something by stating that they cannot do so, because my belief is that they normally can. I have been trying to give evidence for why I think this, giving examples of precedents, trying to prise apart where our opinions diverge, talking about the structure of the brain.

In contrast, I cannot point to anything in your most recent post which is an /argument/ rather than a /statement of opinion/. This makes it very hard to understand what I need to do to understand your point of view, which means you are probably never going to convince me and means that I am struggling to figure out how to convince you.

I understand that you think a superintelligence cannot convince you that riding upside down is safer, or that the number of circles is different on the different sides. Rather than telling me this, please try to tell my /why you believe it to be true/. That way we stand a chance of getting to the [[https://lesswrong.com/lw/o6p/double_crux_a_strategy_for_resolving_disagreement/][crux]] of the matter.

E: After [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/hu/the_third_alternative/][5 minutes]] in the shower, it occurs to me that there is a fairly simple approach a superintelligence could use to convince me that there aren't the same number of circle on each side of that diagram, and a generalization of the idea that also works for the cycling example. It might be instructive to go over this, but I'm worried that this will end up in no true Scotsman territory, rather than you updating your meta-belief about people's ability to be convinced. I especially don't want the limits of my ability to [[https://www.lesserwrong.com/posts/aYX6s8SYuTNaM2jh3/idea-inoculation-inferential-distance][inoculate you with regards to the abilities of the superinteligent]] ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inoculation_theory][see also]]).
