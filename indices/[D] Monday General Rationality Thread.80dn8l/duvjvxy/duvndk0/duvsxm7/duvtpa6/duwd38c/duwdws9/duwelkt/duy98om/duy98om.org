If you don't believe you exist in any sense then what is doing the disbelieving? A super intelligence can convince people of things they thought they would never believe but there are limits. It isn't going to make a convincing argument that 1+1=99 and it isn't going to be capable of convincing people that their senses don't exist barring neurological dysfunction.
