You still misunderstand. I'm not talking about misunderstood mathematical models. I'm talking about the fundamental life skill mentally healthy people learn between the ages of 2 and 7 regardless if they have any formal mathematical notation or understand mathematical notation.

My earlier post was meant to clarify that. A person can claim that '1+1=3' but if they know that 'one thing and one thing and another thing is two things' then they still actually believe that '1+1=2' but don't understand mathematical notation and are claiming something they don't actually believe. E.g someone can honestly claim that "The north pole is salty" if they think 'salty' means 'cold' and that doesn't mean they actually believe "The north pole is salty".

A super intelligence is not going to convince a mentally healthy and sober adult that there aren't the same number of circles on the left and right side of the line in this [[https://imgur.com/tWIQ2gP]] through logical argument. Likewise they aren't going to convince an experienced bike rider that the safest and most comfortable way to ride a standard bike is with their head upside down on the seat. A super intelligence could still convince people of these things using basilisk hacks, coercion and so on but not through logical argument.

  For the second, it's easy to find places where you can't just apply the naturals; two puddles squished together does not make two puddles.

You still get more of a puddle. Adding sets is different from adding quantities.
