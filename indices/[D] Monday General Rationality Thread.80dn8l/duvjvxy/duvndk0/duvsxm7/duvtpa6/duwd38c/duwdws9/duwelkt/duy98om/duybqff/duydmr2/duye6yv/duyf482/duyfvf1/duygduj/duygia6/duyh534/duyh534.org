If a person says that 1+1=5 but still believes that if you put one thing and another thing together you have two things then they don't understand what they are saying.

Edit: To further clarify.

  They simply don't believe there is a useful projection from the naturals onto reality.

This is like saying that they can believe the statement "The sky is green" because they don't believe there is a useful projection from words onto reality. The natural number system is used because it is descriptive of reality (hence 'natural'), if reality followed different rules then our standard arithmetic would be different.
