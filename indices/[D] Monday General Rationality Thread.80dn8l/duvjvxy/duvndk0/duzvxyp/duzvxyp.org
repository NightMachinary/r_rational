See: the Buddhist principle of no-self. The mind is an illusion, the brain is made of atoms, there are no ghosts in the machine, and it's possible to understand this on a gut level given enough effort. I'd recommend Mastering the Core Teachings of the Buddha for an expert low-woo explanation.

As a point of actual fact, though, "I" don't exist, and neither do "you". Deterministic events are happening in the universe, and it's computationally convenient to pretend that some of them have identities. No one is a thing, especially not Frodo Baggins.
