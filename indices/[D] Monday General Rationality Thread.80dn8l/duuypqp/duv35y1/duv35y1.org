  However, copyright laws forbid me from doing so.

There are laws against making donations to people? Also, isn't there a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_(law)][specific thing]] that legalizes works where effort was put into the end product even if it's not 100% original?

  Likewise, shortly after the completion of HPMoR (for which I probably would pay ten dollars if I could), the org. that employed Prophet Yud (pbuh) saw fit to publish another, non-fiction work of his. I was forced to confront a similar problem: Should I pay an extra sum of ten dollars (above the five-buck suggested price, which I found reasonable for the nonfic book on its own merits) and risk sending the wrong message, or should I refrain from paying that premium and risk damaging the author's future willingness/ability to entertain me? I chose the middle course of paying a two-dollar premium.

Send Yud a $10 donation with a message that mentions HPMOR and then pay whatever you want for the nonfiction book.

  or, if I could, it would be ridiculous to expect the content creator to read and interpret all those hundreds or thousands of messages

Yeah which is why petabytes of data get interpreted daily with 0 human intervention. I'm not expecting the author to spin up a database and learn SQL for this sort of thing but a ctrl+f with a few names of their works or just something that makes a word cloud out of all the messages should be enough.
