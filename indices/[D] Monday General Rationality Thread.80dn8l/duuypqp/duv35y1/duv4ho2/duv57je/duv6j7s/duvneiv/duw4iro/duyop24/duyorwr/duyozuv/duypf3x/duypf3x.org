In that parallel universe, those extra 300k books wouldn't come from nowhere. It's not like a bunch of people who don't write stories would suddenly write stories; most of the talent would be pulled from people exploring their own ideas, characters, and settings (because that's currently where the financial incentive is).

If the argument is that you can't actually read all of the books anyway so it doesn't matter how many are written, I'd disagree with that; recommendation algorithms and/or recommenders are, IMO, good enough that I actually /can/ read the top whatever fraction of books that perfectly align with my interests, especially since a good amount of work goes into ensuring that books find the right audience. Cutting the number of works of original fiction written per year in half actually does impact me then, in that case.
