Is it possible to come up with a constitution of sorts that would allow for every "right" be granted for all technological improvements. One of the key failings of the american constitution is not knowing how privacy can be manipulated with tech and how vehicles would transform work. Same with how guns and warfare might evolve.

I would think that we would only need to make laws and rights up and to the point that our technology makes each of us into some sort of god. (at least comparable to what we are now and how we can perceive how our tech may evolve.)
