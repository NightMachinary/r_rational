I found this a slog to get through.

The problem is that even once the narrative establishes how Taylor uses her power to move through an environment, it still insists on describing every little power use, movement and repositioning in excruciating detail, instead of letting the reader figure it out.

It's like continuing to describe walking by listing individual muscle contractions, instead of abstracting and saying "OK, now you understand how the baby manages to walk. So what happens next is that it walks from /A/ to /B/ to /C/".
