Virtuous Sons has been highly enjoyable.

It's a cultivation novel set in ancient Greece and it's done very well. The characters are believable and behave rationally, imo. Does not read like a typical eastern cultivation novel. The prologue (over 20 chapters long) is just finished today so now is a good time to start!
