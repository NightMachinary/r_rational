  These little excerpts were honestly surprising and touching, especially with how it interweaves the previously over the top ridiculous humor into a serious plot moment. Anybody else feel similarly on this novel?

I absolutely loved this part; definitely did a "fuck yeah" fist pump in the air when I read it. The author did a great job with this entire plot line.

My only complaint about the series is that I caught up to it a little while back and now need to wait. I binged both of the first two books (which I got access to using Kindle Unlimited's free trial) within a few days.
