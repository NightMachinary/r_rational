I honestly like this more than Mother of Learning, which was good sure but some moments in this story are just poignant. This story does emotional beats well.

Carl's background is sometimes a bit too tragic for my suspension of disbelief, but the way the author ties in his childhood trauma with story moments and later on Carl slowly moving forward is touching. Even Carl's mantra of "They will not break me. They will never break me. I will break them." never feels grating or undeserved.

The closest thing I can compare it to is Patriot the TV show. That mix of tragic and tragically hilarious.
