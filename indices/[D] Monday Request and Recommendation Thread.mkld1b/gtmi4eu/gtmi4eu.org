I just re-watched the movie "Arrival" and it made me think... the movie's main plot point is that the heptapods help humanity because they have foreseen that they will need humanity's help 3000 years in the future. Has anyone written a fanfiction about what /that/ will be? Because it sounds like a pretty amazing subject.
