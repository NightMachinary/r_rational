  She isn't "accepting" it. She cannot not accept it. That is the message of the book.

The book explicitly mentions Fermat's principle and the least action principle as examples of how atemporal physics work. Look at it from a purely physical viewpoint. The brain is just a configuration of atoms. A series of actions is just a way in which these atoms can arrange themselves and interact. Except that in a quantum mechanical world, /all/ paths are potentially real and weighed by their own action; so random fluctuations and small deviations from classical determinism are justified if they result in lowering the overall action of the path.

So you have two possible paths:

- one, the daughter is sent to school, dies, and the mother accepts her death despite knowing it beforehand without acting to stop it;

- two, the daughter is randomly not sent to school on that day, for reasons unknown

Both these paths require the mother to take an action that would be unusual from her standard behavioural pattern. In other words, we expect there to be something like a potential barrier to both these possible paths, which will increase their action. Which one ends up winning out? The major factor in play is: which one has the /lowest/ potential barrier, and which one has more different realisations (so, higher entropy: there are more microconfigurations of the path that lead to the same fundamental outcome). And it seems to me that both these factors weigh in favour of option two. The mental resistance needed to decide "fuck school, let's go have a picnic today!" is much lower than that needed to decide "I know my daughter will die and must accept this fate" (never mind that as you say there is no choice; for the path to be self-consistent, the me-that-believes-there-is-a-free-will must also believe to have freely chosen that path). And there are a lot more ways in which that second path can be accomplished. By all means, I would expect option two to be the one the universe settles on, as a matter of optimisation. This being just physics at work; no free will required whatsoever. But we need to at least accept that the human brain is configured in ways that oppose a potential barrier to certain courses of action more than others, which is entirely legitimate and in fact matches observed reality: people don't act randomly, they have patterns.
