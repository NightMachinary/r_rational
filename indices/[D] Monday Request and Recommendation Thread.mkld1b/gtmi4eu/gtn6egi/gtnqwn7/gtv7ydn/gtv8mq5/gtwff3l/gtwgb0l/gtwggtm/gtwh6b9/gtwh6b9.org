Why /would/ she do it though? Even in a self-consistent time loop, you would expect actions to be compatible with what the configuration of the universe is, which includes her character and memories. In fact, we'd expect some sort of “least resistance” path (they even bring up the Fermat principle explicitly in the book). So of course “trying to save the world” makes more sense than “randomly letting war break out”. But she still didn't have a choice: the fact that she saw those memories from the future means that future /had/ to come to pass.
