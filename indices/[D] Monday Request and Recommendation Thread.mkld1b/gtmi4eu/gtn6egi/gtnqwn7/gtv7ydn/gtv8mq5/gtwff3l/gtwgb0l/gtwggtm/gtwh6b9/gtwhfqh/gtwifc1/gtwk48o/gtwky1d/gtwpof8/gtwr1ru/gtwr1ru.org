Out of bed myself, so I can articulate better as well.

I get the concept, but in another sense, the movie's approach actually is /more/ rational.

As you pointed out, death by car accident is easily avoidable with a very short term intervention (just don't send her to school). Since by that point the MC knows heptapod, her time perspective should now be global. So her "decisions" (whatever that means in this atemporal perspective) should be self-consistent. Now the most obvious reaction to knowing that would be not to send the daughter to school, as you say. But to do so means not having the foreknowledge, which means sending her, which means she dies... etc. It's not self-consistent.

On the other hand, however, there's a perfectly consistent option that saves the daughter too: the MC just thinking randomly to not send her to school for unrelated reasons. For example, they organise an outing for that day. Maybe a bit random and uncharacteristic. But why would this be /less/ likely than a mother simply fatalistically accepting the death of her daughter? To bring up a comparison with the time turner in HPMOR - leaving the daughter to die is the numbers being factored. Randomly deciding to not send her to school is "DO NOT MESS WITH TIME" written in slightly shaky handwriting. The latter sounds a lot less complex.

Conversely, in the movie's version, the dilemma is real. The disease is part of who the daughter is. Even if genetic pre-natal screening was a possibility, the resulting daughter /would be a different person/. So there's no third way out here, even with foreknowledge. The only two alternatives are to either have the daughter, and take the good with the bad, or give it all up. And the choice that she ends up making being self-consistent is a lot more believable; especially considering how in her new state of timelessness (which probably includes seeing her own death), death itself takes a new meaning, becoming not an end, but a boundary. Sure, she only has 20-something years with her daughter. But they'll be forever there; they don't just "pass" somehow and vanish in the past. They're as real as anything else to her, every single moment of her life.
