  As time moves on, a person's death becomes more likely, and ways to stop it less obvious. Even if you knew that a person will get cancer, that will tell you nothing on what, if changed, would cause them to not get cancer. Unless it's something really obvious like lung cancer for a chain smoker. Butterfly effect kicks in.

Right but there's a million things you could do with future knowledge that you'd be constantly changing things. I'm to believe that someone does the exact same movement that they remembered doing? It doesn't work if you think they can implement the future knowledge in any way.

  That's true, and I brought it up when discussing the movie. But still, 40 years with a person would be more happiness than 20, even in an atemporal perspective. It's like having a large LCD screen vs. a small one, even if you can take it all in with a single glance you still get a lot more detail and potential beauty in the former. I would still expect her to have a strong preference for her daughter NOT dying (she does seem sad after all). The point is that in the book she has a clear choice that avoids her daughter's death. In the movie the alternatives are either a short lived daughter or no daughter / a different child altogether.

Right which is why the movie is just about free will and having the choice to do something which is completely different from having no choice at all. If you're choosing in the waveform simplification process then you're still choosing

  But living beings shouldn't be any different from anything else. You can justify an electron tunnelling through a barrier more easily than a supermassive black hole instantly and spontaneously evaporating before its time. Similarly, you should be able to justify a person deciding to have their child skip school more easily than just deciding that they will do nothing to prevent their easily preventable death. If the death is not easily preventable, the weights change!

It's not living beings. It's consciousness, just a by-product of matter, not something that does anything. Seeing time all at once doesn't actually give you the knowledge it just changes how you experience it. If we accept time travel is solvable at all then it must be the case that all that's happening is her consciousness is different, otherwise as you say it makes no sense at the atomic or quantum level where electrons will simply never align to be internally consistent with a single pass. If learning the language means electrons are sent back in time it is practically impossible due to the complexity for that same electron to bounce its way back to the exact spot it was. One maybe, but trillions?

My understanding is that all that changed was her perspective, nothing is actually different. Learning a language doesn't let you see the future.

As I said it has been a while.
