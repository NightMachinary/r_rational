  Right but there's a million things you could do with future knowledge that you'd be constantly changing things. I'm to believe that someone does the exact same movement that they remembered doing? It doesn't work if you think they can implement the future knowledge in any way.

No, but they don't remember the details of the movement. Again, the HPMOR example is funny but IMHO perfect. When Harry copies "DO NOT MESS WITH TIME" in slightly shaky handwriting, does he purposefully try to reproduce every single wiggle? Of course not. His hand is just shaking because he's nervous. But the paper will come out with the same exact text, down to the single molecule of ink; it /has/ to.

  Right which is why the movie is just about free will and having the choice to do something which is completely different from having no choice at all. If you're choosing in the waveform simplification process then you're still choosing

All the "choosing" that is being done here is that the individual, having certain pathways established in the brain that encode what we call a "personality", will be more likely to do certain things rather than others. This is an easily verified empirical fact: without it, the very concept of people having a self would make no sense. If you think this much is enough to talk about free will, then free will exists, no question. Declaring this to be false would be thinking that the Queen of the United Kingdom, at the funeral of her recently deceased husband, is equally likely to give a mournful speech in his honour or to pull down her dress and take a shit. I believe we all agree which of the two courses of action is /highly/ more likely.

  Seeing time all at once doesn't actually give you the knowledge it just changes how you experience it. [...] My understanding is that all that changed was her perspective, nothing is actually different. Learning a language doesn't let you see the future.

Yes, that is why both the book and the movie are actually quite silly in their core conceit. But if you accept the outrageous proposition that /somehow/ learning a certain alien language allows your consciousness to become atemporal, to the point where you can have visions of your yet-to-be-born child, or one such alien can come to Earth to establish an alliance for the sake of solving a future problem, then I can see no way to avoid the fact that somehow, information /is/ travelling back in time. The way it's depicted in the movie and book, this is what's happening. And so we also have that for example as soon as humanity learns heptapod, P = NP, with all the fun consequences of that.
