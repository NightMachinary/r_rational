  The whole 'you should sit out this run and try to gather more information to formulate a better plan because the fewer loops it takes you to solve the mystery, the fewer people die and you can be morally satisfied that you helped save more people' was discussed in one chapter and the very next chapter MC ditched it.

Just gonna note that this is re-visited later and the MC actually /does/ end up doing it and agreeing that it's the right thing to do. Mostly against his will, initially, but still. I'm just counting it as a character flaw. It's made pretty clear in-story that his position is pretty much wrong, IMO.

I completely understand anyone dropping the story due to the MC's bone-headedness, though.
