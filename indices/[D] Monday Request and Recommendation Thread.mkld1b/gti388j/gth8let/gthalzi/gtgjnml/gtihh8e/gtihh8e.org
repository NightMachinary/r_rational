I got a fanfiction.net notification this morning that a new Gazemaize story was up however I checked the link only about 10 minutes after receiving the notification and it was already dead.

Did anyone actually see this story? I don't know if it's some kind of puzzle or hint or late April Fools thing or what.

paging [[/u/gazemaize]] I suppose in case it's as easy as asking

this is the notification as it was received:
