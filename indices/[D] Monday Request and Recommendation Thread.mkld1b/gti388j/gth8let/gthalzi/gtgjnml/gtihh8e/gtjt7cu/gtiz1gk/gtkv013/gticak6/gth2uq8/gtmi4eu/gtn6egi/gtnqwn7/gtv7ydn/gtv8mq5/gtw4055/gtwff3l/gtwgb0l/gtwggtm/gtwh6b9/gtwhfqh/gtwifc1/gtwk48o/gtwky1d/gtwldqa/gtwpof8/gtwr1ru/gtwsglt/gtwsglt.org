  Conversely, in the movie's version, the dilemma is real. The disease is part of who the daughter is. Even if genetic pre-natal screening was a possibility, the resulting daughter would be a different person. So there's no third way out here, even with foreknowledge

Right, so it's a completely separate dilemma. Or rather, in the book the point is that there is no dilemma because there's no choice and the movie as you say makes it seem like there's a dilemma when the MC has no choice but to have her daughter.

  But why would this be less likely than a mother simply fatalistically accepting the death of her daughter?

She isn't "accepting" it. She cannot not accept it. That is the message of the book. For example, if I plugged an electrode into your spine and then walked your body to the door. Your mind would then say "I wanted to walk to the door, I chose to walk to the door." That is the equivalent of experiencing time in this fashion.
