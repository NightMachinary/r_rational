Seconding Prince of Nothing. I understand the rest of that Second Apocalypse series delves more into the setting's antagonists (and their literal, judged-by-God immorality), but the core trilogy is eactly what you're looking for. It's hard to manipulate power structures more than co-opting first their jihad, then their religious texts, then finally their governments into your own personal institutions.
