Any recommendations for dystopian sci-fi? I don't really read much sci-fi, but the small selection that I have read mostly makes it seem relatively 'normal' levels of dystopian (just on a larger scale) or borderline utopian.\\
I guess I'm kinda looking for space + aliens + cyberpunk.\\
[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/15449/quod-olim-erat/][Quod Elim Erat]] (scifi, following AI main character) has some dystopian elements. Messing with ship's minds/memories; government spying, etc..\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9271192/1/Transcendent-Humanity][Transcendent Humanity]] is very much more on the utopian side, so not really what I'm looking for. I did enjoy it, but felt it could have been padded out a good bit more.
