  Sure like an electron cloud has possibilities dependent on their orbital properties but we'd never say an electron is choosing to manifest in a certain position.

A more accurate example would be to refer to the properties of the potential it's navigating in, but yes, sure. Which is why I'm saying that there's no incompatibility between doubting the concept of strong free will and admitting that the choices of an individual trapped in a self-consistent time loop ought still to depend strongly on who that individual is, what their priorities are, etc.

Also in a way this whole thing assumes kind of a collapse view of QM. If we take a many worlds interpretation, whether more or less likely, /all/ possible paths happen anyway.
