I recognise the point that you are making though I don't remember the specifics of the books references.

Is it not true that the criticism you have is true of literally all time loops ever? The universe basically decided to have the aliens come to earth and have the humans rescue them in the future. How can that be the simplest solution?

  two, the daughter is randomly not sent to school on that day, for reasons unknown
#+end_quote

Could this not have happened literally every other day right? Every day she avoided her daughter's death because of the universe "solving" the equation in a "simpler" way by having her be spontaneous she wouldn't have any memory of. And since the context of the universe solving these problems is literally the grand waveform level I don't know that one instance of least action

If she has a picnic that day then the next time her kid dies she has to do something else to avoid it. And then you get to someone else learning it who's like "I know that I can make billions on this stock and must accept it"

But the biggest problem I see with that is:

Since she can see the future of every single moment then I don't think "accepting her death" is that weird. She already has to accept every action, from lifting her hand, which she already has a memory of, or stubbing her toe, every moment of her entire life is her accepting the future and "performing" her role in it. She starts crying when she gets to the point that she remembers she was crying, she bites her lip accidentally when she remembers doing so, she feels happy when she remembers feeling happy, etc.

If it is the case that humans or any creature who experiences time completely "accepts" their future then it makes sense that the universe would use this to resolve time loop problems by having those creatures do any random thing, including randomly travelling to a specific part of the universe (ie Earth).

Edit: My analogy would be that every human is on a railway track. Learning the alien language simply allowed her to see the rails, that's literally all it did. Since it isn't possible for her not to cope with it (unless that was the path of the tracks), or to jump off the train or do anything else but travel onward at 1s per second, so it doesn't matter how unusual the actions are in context of the future knowledge because anyone with future knowledge will already have accepted it so it only matters the context of someone without knowledge in which case having the picnic is weirder than just doing your normal day.
