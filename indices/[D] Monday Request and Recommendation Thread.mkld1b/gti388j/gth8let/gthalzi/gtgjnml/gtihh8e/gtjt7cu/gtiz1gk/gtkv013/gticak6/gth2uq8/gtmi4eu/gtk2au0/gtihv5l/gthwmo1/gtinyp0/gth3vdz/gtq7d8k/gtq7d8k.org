With having run across the SPFBO I now have a bunch of /good/ Kindle Unlimited books to read, but I'm still short on some entertaining trash. Anyone have recs? Pretty much my only requirements are that it be well-written and that there be at least some characters who treat each other decently. (Kindle Unlimited specifically.)

edit - I'm also always looking for dungeon core stories with non-murderhobo cores. I've already read or am reading Oasis Core, Blue Core, the Taylor "Woke Up As A Dungeon" story, and No Epic Loot.
