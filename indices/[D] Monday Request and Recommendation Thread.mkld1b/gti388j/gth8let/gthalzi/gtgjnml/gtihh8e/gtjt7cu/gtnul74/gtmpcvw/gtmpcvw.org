- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implied_Spaces][Implied Spaces]] has "some dudes explaining to each other how their gadgets work", except it's worlds instead of gadgets.
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperion_Cantos][The Hyperion Cantos]] has the gadget explaining, except it's hyper-tech that's so advanced it's basically magic
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alastair_Reynolds][Alastair Reynold's]] novels tend to have various kinds of gadget explaining. Pushing Ice is probably the one with closest-to-current tech.
