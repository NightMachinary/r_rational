It's probably useful to know that Maruyama is largely just adapting old D&D campaigns him and his friends had, then stretching them to make them fit the Overlord setting. I still find the series enjoyable, but it's definitely helpful to understand why he dedicated entire volumes of the series to plots that don't particularly advance the story of Overlord.
