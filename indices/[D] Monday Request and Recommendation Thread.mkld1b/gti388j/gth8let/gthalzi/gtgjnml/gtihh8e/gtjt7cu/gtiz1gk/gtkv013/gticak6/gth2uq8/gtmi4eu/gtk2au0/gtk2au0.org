I'll preface all this by saying that the first several floors of the Dungeon Crawler Carl novel on RoyalRoad have been removed from the site since the author published them on Kindle, so you have to buy the released volumes or through... other means if you want the whole story. I do think it's very worth it though. Also sorry for the upcoming wall of text, it's a bad habit of mine.

I've been catching up with the RoyalRoad novel, Dungeon Crawler Carl, and I've been really surprised by it. It does some unique things I think no other series does. It leans into over the top, absurd, bizarre, and quirky humor, but unlike other series where it's always cringe or overstays its welcome or doesn't mesh with the plot, DCC avoids all of these issues.

It's a series about humanity pretty much being instantly destroyed because of a contract or debt that just expired or such after starting in like ancient times, and the survivors are forced into a massive Dungeon and fight through the levels to serve as amusement for the rest of the universe. All the while the Dungeon and monsters and levels all "use" human culture, or whatever bastardized version the aliens see it as. There's also programs about human culture aired to the universe as well, all mostly very misrepresentative and derogatory towards humanity.

The Dungeon and crawl has ridiculous lootboxes, stupid achievement names, ridiculous items and equipment, monsters ranging from drug dealing llamas to KraKarens to a giant rolling ball made out of a bunch of noble(actual nobility) orcs all in one massive orgy all wearing BDSM gear to a feral duck that has an aura that nullifies all magic, special effects, and equipment buffs, while also being completely immune to physical damage, and so on. There's a sand mage weeb who wants to turn his sex doll to a real human and accidentally unleashes an evil god, and other completely nonsensical things. There's a town inhabited by camel beings in the current level, and it's called Hump Town. Of course, it's only business is prostitution, which is run by changelings.

The thing though, I think this all /works/. It's completely ridiculous, yes, but I never find it too overbearing or awkward or stale, even though I was not at all a fan of other comedy-oriented popular novels on RoyalRoad like Vanquier the Dragon, which has a lot of the problems I mentioned at the beginning.

This humor actually works really well with the story as well. The remnants of humanity go through this cruel entertainment for the rest of the universe, on top of the dead corpse of humanity which is being paraded around by them. The bizarreness of the ridiculous stuff, like tiny flesh eating weasels being shot out tubes, really clashes with how dark and fucked it is, like when said tiny flesh eating weasels enter a person and eat them from the inside out.

And the MC and his plans and the combat is actually pretty competent. The gimmick of the Dungeon Crawl season the MC is part of has the gimmick of infinite storage, and he really abuses it. I'm never left annoyed or unsatisfied watching him trying to progress, as he's simultaneously careful, but is still great in chaotic scenarios where things go wrong(and as you can imagine, things always go wrong in this fucked in situation). His main motivation and focus is on "They will not break me," and vows to return it to the bastards that destroyed and desecrated humanity and its grave, which I feel was well done too.

I'm honestly surprised at how well DCC mixes bizarre humor, a serious and dark plot, and competent action and game-like abilities.

A recent arc highlights this blend that I think is really done well. A sponsor gifts one of the main characters, a talking cat, a robot toy version of herself, which quotes her, but is also pretty crappy so it mixes in Garfield quotes. But, instead of Garfield quotes, it says I'mSorryJon sort of things. It's also crappily made and explodes easily, as said cat's dinosaur pet shows several times. This is basically a joke whenever a newer model shows up and inevitably explodes, but it plays into the plot later on as well, in a beautiful way.

The MC decides to take his first step, and begins setting up the pieces and steps. When he makes a smoke curtain and it "accidentally" gets used right on top of him and the robot cat, it turns its head around to stare perfectly at the MC through all the smoke and says a fitting ominous line. When he's about to show up for an important interview and ad filming, the robot cat turns around to them and tells them something along the line of "death comes for us all".

[[https://imgur.com/a/3dlCVQe][These little excerpts]] were honestly surprising and touching, especially with how it interweaves the previously over the top ridiculous humor into a serious plot moment. Anybody else feel similarly on this novel?

The series is nothing mindblowing like Worm or Mother of Learning, but I do greatly enjoy it for using all these elements and making it actually work, especially with me hating over the top comedy novels. I've been wanting to talk about DCC for months but just couldn't find the time or the words for it. I'd even put this above Super Minion and on the same tier as the likes of Journey of Black and Red for how good and unique it is.
