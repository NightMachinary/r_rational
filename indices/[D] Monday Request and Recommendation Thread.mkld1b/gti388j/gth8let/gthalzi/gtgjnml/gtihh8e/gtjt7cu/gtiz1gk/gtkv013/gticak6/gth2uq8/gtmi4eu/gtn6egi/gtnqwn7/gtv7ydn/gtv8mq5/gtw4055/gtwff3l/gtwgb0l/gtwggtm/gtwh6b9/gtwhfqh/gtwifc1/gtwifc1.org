You could argue the movie makes it less clear, yeah, but IMO that's just a matter of mixing up tropes about time travel and foresight from other stories. It's still clearly a self consistent time loop setting.

  Why would she keep her daughter off school the one day she gets killed by a car?

How could she? If she did, her daughter wouldn't be hit, and she wouldn't know that she needs to keep her home. And in some butterfly effect kind of way that probably all depends on things that have happened even before she learned heptapod.
