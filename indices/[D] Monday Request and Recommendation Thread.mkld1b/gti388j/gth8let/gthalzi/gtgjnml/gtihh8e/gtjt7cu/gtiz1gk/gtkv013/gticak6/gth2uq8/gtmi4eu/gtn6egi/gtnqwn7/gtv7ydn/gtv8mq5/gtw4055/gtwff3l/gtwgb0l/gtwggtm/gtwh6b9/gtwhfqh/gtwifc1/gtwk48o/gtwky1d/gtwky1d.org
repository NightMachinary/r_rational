I am getting it, I just think it's not as strong as you're putting it. You're arguing that the movie outright changes the setting by adding in free will. I think the movie uses the same rules, but the specific story it tells as well as the omission of arguments about Fermat's principle makes the lack of free will slightly less obvious. You claim evidence of absence, I say there's just less evidence than in the book.
