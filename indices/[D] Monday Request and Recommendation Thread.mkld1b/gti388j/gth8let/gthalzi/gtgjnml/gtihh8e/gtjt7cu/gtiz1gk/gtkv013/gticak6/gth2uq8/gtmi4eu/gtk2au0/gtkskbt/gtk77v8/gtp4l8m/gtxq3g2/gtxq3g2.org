  Maybe everyone on this sub secretly likes this story and just never talks about it

Definitely the case for me. It's not even a secret, it just feels so well-known despite little coverage that I didn't see the point in making a rec. It's on the second page of best-rated RR works, so anyone with even a tiny inclination towards LitRPGs has probably read it already---at least, that was my reasoning for not talking about it.

But I'm going to second the rec now. It's the best LitRPG I've ever read precisely because it's popcorn-y as heck, in a good way. It's very, /very/ engagingly written.
