- Shogun - Very loosely based on a true story of the first non-portuguese/spaniard european ship to land on Japan in 1600. Features the third of the great japanese unifiers from [[http://history-of-japan.weebly.com/the-three-unifiers.html][this awesome little parable]], Tokugawa Ieyasu(under the name of Toranaga Yoshi). Not historically accurate whatsoever, and pretty un-PC in a lot of parts, but still one of my all time favourite books of all time.
- Prince of Nothing trilogy - Not so much the main overarching antagonists(who are definitely just plain evil), but just about everyone else. The sequel trilogy is even more grey on grey.
- Ash and Sand trilogy - In the first few pages the protagonist eats another guy. That sets the tone for his story pretty well, but the other protagonists are pretty different. I always advise people to read until at least the story changes POV from Ruka -> Kale as the start is so rough, but if you're looking for grey morality than maybe you don't need that.
