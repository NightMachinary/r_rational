OK I got out of bed so with a keyboard it's much easier to communicate

  You're arguing that the movie outright changes the setting by adding in free will.
#+end_quote

It doesn't add free will. It just undermines the severity of the "obligation" to do what has already been done. In the book it's much more clear that she has no "choice" but the brain is happy to make it seem like she "chose" to do so anyway.

That's all I'm saying. That the choice to present the child's illness as a disease instead of as an accident is an explicit shying away from the metaphysical nature, and even message or thematic core, of the book.

There is more than just that but it's the most obvious change.

  I think the movie uses the same rules,
#+end_quote

Yes, I agree. The movie uses the same rules, she never does anything that would "break" the continuum. But, unlike the book where it's very very clear that she couldn't break it even if she wanted to, in the movie it's much less obvious than that because all of the "choices" she made are things reasonable people would make anyway.

Unlike allowing your kid to get hit by a car for no reason, which nobody would do unless they literally and physically could not do otherwise.

  You claim evidence of absence, I say there's just less evidence than in the book.
#+end_quote

I am saying the second thing not the first thing.

You cannot interpret the book as having free will in it, but the movie really emphasises that she is CHOOSING to have a kid because it's worth it. As if she has a choice. Which is why as my example was the layman who just accepts (or does not consider) free will and knows nothing about principles or determinism or paradoxes will not find their perspective challenged unlike the book where you simply cannot ignore it.

I watched the movie and read the story years ago so I'm remembering mostly what I already wrote about it.
