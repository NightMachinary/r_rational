Maybe everyone on this sub secretly likes this story and just never talks about it, but unless that's true, DCC seems like by far the highest quality to lowest coverage on this sub of any other story I've come across. It's really really great and it hardly every comes up on this sub.

Maybe because it's so unique that it doesn't really fit into anyone's requests for specific genre/story type recommendations? I dunno but more people should read it. I started it after the first book was only out on Amazon and I did not regret buying it even a little bit.

However, for folks on the fence, the Amazon "try a few chapters free" is probably enough to get a sense of the story and whether or not you will like it.
