[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/18186/the-scourged-earth][The Scourged Earth]] is probably my favorite system apocalypse. Has everything else you're looking for too, only bad thing is that it's on hiatus, probably dead. Turns out ancient aliens made the system to survive against the Scourges, which can vary from hivemind nanobot swarm to fungal infestation to multidimensional hands that build timeless artifacts and kill everything near them. Really cool world, really oppressive.
