[[https://www.novelupdates.com/series/tales-of-the-reincarnated-lord/][/Tales of the Reincarnated Lord/]] is the first thing that comes to mind. It a Chinese webnovel, but the translation is pretty good (some rough spots) and likes to poke fun of most tropes you see in other CN stories.

/Sengoku Komachi Kurou Tan/ (Chronicles of The Hardships of Komachi in The Sengoku Era) is a manga/LN that is about a girl who studies agriculture being transported back to Japan in the 1560s. I prefer the manga over the LN, since the way Japanese write (stylistically) doesn't really translate to English.
