I just binged through [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/40290/demesne][/Demesne/]], and while it's not about civilization building per se (more like settlers/homesteading), it is pretty interesting.

  Out on the frontier of a new continent, the wizard Lori and her group of settlers try to build a community for themselves in a land actively hostile to intelligent life. With their wits, their will, and their newly built Dungeon to protect them against the Iridescence, they should be fine. If they can survive the wild animal attacks. And the supply shortages. And other settlements poaching their people. And famine. And bandits... A slice-of-life fantasy story.
