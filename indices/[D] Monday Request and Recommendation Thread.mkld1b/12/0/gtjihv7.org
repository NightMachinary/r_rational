I'll de-rec this one.

  his inner monologue shows that he's aware of his impulsiveness and is moderately intelligent.

Which counts for shit since he doesn't try to improve himself and keeps holding the idiot ball. Admittedly, some of his plans fail hilariously (forgets to pose outside hero tower during time-stop run lol) and I could rationalize it as a normal man having his nerves fritz in high-intensity situations but there is a limit to how many times I can do it before it breaks my suspension of disbelief.

Hell, his whole reason for not sitting one loop out and watching the aftermath (who knows, maybe the perpetrator will out themselves) rather than running idiotically into the fray loop after loop when the bombs can kill even the top heroes is because it's morally his duty to save everyone. (MC doesn't like how he might be killing people with his inaction even if his ability might not spawn new universes where the people are dead.) Now I agree with the duty part but to pursue it so badly despite knowing he might be dooming millions of people each run tells me it's nothing more than a feel-good reason: Oh praise me because I'm trying to save the world. We don't even conclusively know if the bombing is happening only in his city or throughout the world!

The whole 'you should sit out this run and try to gather more information to formulate a better plan because the fewer loops it takes you to solve the mystery, the fewer people die and you can be morally satisfied that you helped save more people' was discussed in one chapter and the very next chapter MC ditched it. God. I dropped it then.
