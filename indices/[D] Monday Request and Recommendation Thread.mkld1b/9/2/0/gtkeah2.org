Well, I'm not disagreeing buuutt... covers are like really, /really/ important and these clearly work well despite the cringe. Arguably, covers are more important than even the book's synopsis. This is because, particularly in the kindle/ebook environment, competition is fierce and you need to convince a scrolling potential reader to click on your book instead of all the other books they're presented with. There are two, dead-simple strategies to do so:

- *People like people, especially faces.* Our meat-brains are evolutionarily programmed to respond strongly to other people, and in particular, faces and their emotions. This is why so many youtubers put big, emotive, faces in their thumbnails--it draws clicks.

- *Sex sells.* It sounds a bit eugh but just like people like faces, people like looking at attractive people. Putting scantly clad women and eight-pack adorned men on covers often comes across as tasteless, but it works, time and time again. More specifically, it attracts more readers than it turns away, so it works.
