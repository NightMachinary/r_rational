My opinions run pretty counter to this community lol. My current favorite litrpg is Ar'kendrithyst. It's not great at first, but 130 chapters in I'd call it some of the best that litrpg has to offer. As always, ymmv.

I hear good things about continue online, which is supposed to be more character study than litrpg adventure. I started it a long while back but didn't continue being chapter 10 for whatever reason, maybe I'll give it a try again. It's done too.

Of these, I don't think either have good writing, compared to the standard that you'd find in good published fantasy. But Ar'kendrithyst does get close at times after the author solidifies his style.
