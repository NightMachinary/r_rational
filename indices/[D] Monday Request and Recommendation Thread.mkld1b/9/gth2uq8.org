[[https://www.amazon.com/Apocalypse-Fairy-System-Systems-Book-ebook/dp/B091CX1T54/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8][Apocalypse: Fairy System]] is out. This is the sequel to Apocalypse: Generic System, a decent litRPG that I thought was reasonably intelligent. In this one the main character has been kicked out of the main RPG system, and is sort of poking around in the guts of the system without actually using it directly---he now gains power through dealmaking, a la the fey. I enjoyed it, sometimes I had questions about the worldbuilding, but it's so much better than most worldbuilding in this genre I had few complaints. Barring WTC, this series is probably about the best the litRPG genre has to offer, which, unfortunately, is saying fairly little.
