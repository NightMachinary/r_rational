On top of the mangadex issues, SB/SV are also down. If Reddit has an outage, I will officially have nothing to do (besides work) during the workday. Anyone got any good platform recommendations? Ideally something I can navigate on my smartphone, ideally something where the content isn't just brainless memes. (I have reddit for that.)
