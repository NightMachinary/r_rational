I'll start off with a new one, [[https://myanimelist.net/anime/46095/][Vivy: Fluorite Eye's Song]] I have only seen the anime (2 episodes so far) so I can't speak to how well it maintains its tone if a Manga or LN exist for it.

Classic AI / Time Travel shenanigans, with the caveat that AI here are very utility function bound. They have a singular purpose, and fulfill it. So the AI sent back in time has the goal to (seemingly) stop AI development at all costs, while his accomplice is a Singer android. Her purpose is to sing and make people smile.

She eventually helps out of a want to continue singing, and making people smile, but not in an ignorant of the rest of the world kind of way.

I'm enjoying it as so far the only main characters are AI, and they have sometimes opposing secondary goals / methods for approaching a problem due to their differing 'missions'.

The animation is good as well, I'm going to keep watching.
