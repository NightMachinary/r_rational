How about [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-last-angel.244209/][The Last Angel]], in which humanity is a newly subjugated race under a multispecies empire in the style of Halo's Covenant?

The protagonists are human conscripts sent ahead of the more "civilized" alien species on a mission to explore a suspiciously derelict capital ship.

For physical books, I'd recommend Alastair Reynolds' Revelation Space. It's got the grim/grimy/corporate space future setting, and the central mystery revolves around artifacts left by inscrutable aliens. Very aesthetic and a good plot. I've got the second book in that setting sitting around somewhere and I really need to get to reading it.
