I've been enjoying the heck out of [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/40290/demesne][Demesne]], a dungeon/city-builder with a highly rational, if misanthropic, protagonist. The setting is well-conceived, and the main character has her share of flaws, yet shows a great deal of competence. The author frequently displays a marvelously dry wit. At times, it is even apparent to the reader that the protagonist is being hoodwinked, arguably for her own good.
