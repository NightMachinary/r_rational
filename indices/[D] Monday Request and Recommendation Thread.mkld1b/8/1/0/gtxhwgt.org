I finally got around to reading this, and it's really very good. The prose is a breath of fresh air, in that it's actually /good/ (unlike the majority of cultivation and LitRPG, garbage), and also without the typical hyperanalytical and "modern" feel you usually see on [[/r/rational][r/rational]].

"Cultivation novel set in ancient Greece" is also an understatement, because the plot is really, /really/ interesting in its own right, and the character dynamics are brilliant, enough to hold up the entire story alone. There's a lot of depth and imagination put into it.
