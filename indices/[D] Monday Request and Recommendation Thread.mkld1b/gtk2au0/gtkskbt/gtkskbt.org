I liked your wall of text.

I think the story works because it balances two layers, a serious layer in which Carl has to think strategically and wrestle with the ongoing tragedy as an existential issue, and the layer of the farce, which is only mildly entertaining in itself, but which is aesthetically self-consistent and provides a lot of grist for the strategic layer. Dumb jokes can be introduced as jokes, and they flesh out the motivations of the organizers, the AI, the political factions, and so on, but they also are details that a shrewd Carl can take advantage of, or which provide clues to the current scenario. The book also does a (really) good job at foreshadowing, where threats are telegraphed and then come to fruition at appropriate times. It doesn't usually feel as if the author is just making things up in the moment. I also like how Carl is always on the hunt for new strategic options, he never breaks the system completely open, which always winds up being unsatisfying except in a denoument, but scrounges up enough new options to move forward.
