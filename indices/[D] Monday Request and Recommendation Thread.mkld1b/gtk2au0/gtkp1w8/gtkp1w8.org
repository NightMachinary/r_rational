I really enjoy the series as well. It reminds me of the best portions of Gantz where the action is great, its darkly funny, but at the same time its also grotesque and horrifying at the same time. Every level more of humanity is killed, the jokes are being perpetuated with genocide in the background, and its obvious that the main character has gone more than a little crazy from his experiences.
