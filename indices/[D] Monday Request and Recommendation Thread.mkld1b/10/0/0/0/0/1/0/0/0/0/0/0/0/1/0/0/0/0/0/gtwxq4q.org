  Is it not true that the criticism you have is true of literally all time loops ever? The universe basically decided to have the aliens come to earth and have the humans rescue them in the future. How can that be the simplest solution?

Wouldn't the alternative involve the extremely powerful, interstellar, future-aware civilisation deciding to NOT do anything about its own demise? Either way, it's kind of hard to weigh the possibilities. But yes, the general reasoning would certainly apply and is very qualitative.

  If she has a picnic that day then the next time her kid dies she has to do something else to avoid it. And then you get to someone else learning it who's like "I know that I can make billions on this stock and must accept it"

As time moves on, a person's death becomes more likely, and ways to stop it less obvious. Even if you knew that a person will get cancer, that will tell you nothing on what, if changed, would cause them to /not/ get cancer. Unless it's something really obvious like lung cancer for a chain smoker. Butterfly effect kicks in.

  Since she can see the future of every single moment then I don't think "accepting her death" is that weird. She already has to accept every action, from lifting her hand, which she already has a memory of, or stubbing her toe, every moment of her entire life is her accepting the future and "performing" her role in it. She starts crying when she gets to the point that she remembers she was crying, she bites her lip accidentally when she remembers doing so, she feels happy when she remembers feeling happy, etc.

That's true, and I brought it up when discussing the movie. But still, 40 years with a person would be more happiness than 20, even in an atemporal perspective. It's like having a large LCD screen vs. a small one, even if you can take it all in with a single glance you still get a lot more detail and potential beauty in the former. I would still expect her to have a strong preference for her daughter NOT dying (she does seem sad after all). The point is that in the book she has a clear choice that avoids her daughter's death. In the movie the alternatives are either a short lived daughter or no daughter / a different child altogether.

  If it is the case that humans or any creature who experiences time completely "accepts" their future then it makes sense that the universe would use this to resolve time loop problems by having those creatures do any random thing, including randomly travelling to a specific part of the universe (ie Earth).

But living beings shouldn't be any different from anything else. You can justify an electron tunnelling through a barrier more easily than a supermassive black hole instantly and spontaneously evaporating before its time. Similarly, you should be able to justify a person deciding to have their child skip school more easily than just deciding that they will do nothing to prevent their easily preventable death. If the death is /not/ easily preventable, the weights change!

  My analogy would be that every human is on a railway track. Learning the alien language simply allowed her to see the rails, that's literally all it did.
#+end_quote

She's on a railway track whose design must take into account that from a certain point onward she will be able to see the railway track, which in turn affects the shape of the railway track, for a sufficient number of iterations until the shape stabilises. The book makes it look like instead there is an outside authority that simply decided her "fate" and she can only accept it, and knowing makes no difference. But in real life, even if this may be entirely deterministic, past information affects our actions. The part where it feels like free will may not exist is the deterministic aspect. So her actions should be similarly deterministic, but determined by both past /and/ future information.
