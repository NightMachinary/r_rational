My personal favorites are Utsuro no Hako to Zero no Maria (also known as HakoMari) and Overlord.

Overlord has an anime and is more well known, in it the MC is isekaid to a fantasy world with the same mechanics and servants of a MMO he used to play with his friends. Very OP MC and very dark, though it may not look like it at the beginning. You may like it if you liked the misunderstandings of Tanya the Evil and aren't completely oversaturated with OP main characters. Rich and interesting world, often more detailed than the protagonists.

HakoMari has seven or so volumes, and each one of them has a "theme" or "game". The first volume has time shenanigans going on, and it's not told in a chronological order. Can also get pretty fucking dark, though your millage may vary. If I had to describe it in a sentence, it's kinda like a mix between oregairu and a misery murder?

Really really good, not sure if the english translation is up to standards. The first volume was probably my favourite, so if you end up not disliking it not sure if it's your type.

Each volume deals with a specific situation that can be solved and thought by the reader, with a main group of characters, each of them with defined but changing goals and personalities to which shit happens.

For another type of overview, a being is making people's wishes reality, and this is a very bad thing.

Also often recommended is Spice and Wolf, which is a ... economic slice of life romance? Something like that, haven't read it.
