I've had discussions and put forward recommendations myself in previous weeks for Overlord, I might find one of the detailed ones and edit a link in here later once I'm at my computer, bht it's important to point out that the author of Overlord is definitely weird.

I mean volume 4 is about the main character taking over a series of Lizardma tribes that are dramatically weaker, basically as a test run to make sure everything is working right. It's a stepping stone the average novel author would spend maybe 5 chapters at most on, and instead Maruyama writes a whole novel on it. And ~90% of it from Lizardman's perspective. So there's definitely a weird take on worldbuilding and character perspectives across the novel, and temporary viewpoint shifts, or ones that last the majority of a novel or two, regularly happen. Also Neia is the protagonist of novels 12 and 13 and she is definitely Best Girl imo, so yes, the perspectives and characters are capable of being very engaging.
