/Mediterranean Hegemon of Ancient Greece/ is a Chinese fic I've started reading recently about a Chinese guy that gets transmigrated into the body of a Greek mercenary right before the legendary /March of the Ten Thousand/. After that he goes on to found a kingdom and introduce modern tech, but I haven't gotten there yet.

I'm still in the early chapters so can't say how good it is, and the translation isn't great, but it's clear the author/SI is very knowledgeable about ancient greece. I'm particularly curious how the author is going to handle ancient greece's... "idiosyncratic" male sexuality, especially given china's censorship laws and antiquated social norms.
