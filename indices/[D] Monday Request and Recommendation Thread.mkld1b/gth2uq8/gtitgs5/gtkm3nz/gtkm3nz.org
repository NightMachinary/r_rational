I think it's good writing for a litRPG, and the author gets some things about human nature, economics, and the mechanics of leverage and bargaining pretty well. But it's not good writing, period, if that makes sense. I think the fast pace the author seeks is counter to the character moments.

Any litRPG recommendations, then? Most I've read are pretty bad, and I'm down to slum it, so that kind of says something.
