  My current favorite litrpg is Ar'kendrithyst. It's not great at first, but 130 chapters in I'd call it some of the best that litrpg has to offer. As always, ymmv.

I listed it as a suggestion in the recommendation thread a few weeks ago, and I keep going back and forth on it. I really enjoyed it for the first few dozen chapters, then it felt like a repetitive slog to the point where I almost was going to write a follow-up recommending /against/ reading it, but then after 100 chapters the main plot finally started moving forward again and it got me hooked. Now up to about chapter 117 and I'm still really invested in it.

I've had such whiplash from this novel, haha.
