  Which part did you find to be a repetitive slog?

I felt like a good 60+ chapters of the book was a repetition of "a new character asks for Erick's help, he immediately runs to assist in a new location, develops a new magic to solve the issue, gets a power up, and then never uses his new magic again and the new characters only get mentioned from time to time." Rinse and repeat. There are some breaks, like the Jane PoV chapters, but generally speaking it feels like Erick gets pulled into a new direction every time the author has something else he wants to focus on.

How about a dozen chapters on growing citrus trees and chocolate? Dragons keep getting mentioned; let's have some chapters about dragon essence! We've mentioned other countries and cities - let's have some arcs where Erick or Jane go visit Oceanside or hunt unicorns so we can show other places off! How about a town management section?

Now, don't get me wrong, the world building and exploration of the magic system are some of the strongest points of the novel. But it feels like Marty Stu Erick is constantly getting pulled into B plots that leave a lot of the interesting plot hooks and characters to languish. I liked his growing relationship with Al, but then he hardly gets a mention for dozens of chapters. I wanted to explore more of Ar'Kendrithyst (the city itself), but it took the story almost 100 chapters to finally get back around to it. The most recent arc puts Erick solo, meaning no mention of Poi or Teresa or Kiri or Jane or any of the characters we've grown to care about. Meanwhile at the Feast, we get introduced to dozens of new characters, many of who only show up once or twice while Erick continues learning new magic at a rate that baffles the best practitioners in the world; his Marty Stu status grows and grows.

I guess it feels like ADHD (which I have). The author gets an idea in his head and HAS to focus on it, dropping everything else to do so. The pacing gets really messed up, and while the topics the author focuses on are /usually/ interesting, I don't find them interesting enough to justify dropping the other interesting things that had been brought up long, long before. Erick's been made into the vehicle the author uses to explore all the parts of his fantasy world, but I want to know Erick's story, not go off on a tangent quest about a crime syndicate that puts bombs in children who are part of a society I didn't even know existed until over 100 chapters into the novel.
