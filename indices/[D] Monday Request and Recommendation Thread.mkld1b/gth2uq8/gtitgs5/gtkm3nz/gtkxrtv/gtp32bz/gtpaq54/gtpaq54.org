Which part did you find to be a repetitive slog? When I started reading it I had a lukewarm opinion until book 1 ending. From then it has been a steady increase in quality to what it is now. Chapter 120 is one of my favorite chapters from a fic on RR. I did find some of the Daydropper arc a bit of a slog but looking back it was more because I was expecting Ar'Kendrythist to be an action novel instead of a slice of life with moments of action.
