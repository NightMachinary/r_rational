I liked it but not as much as the first book, mostly because of my own hangups though. I keep noticing that the author writes everyone... distantly. We see moments of weakness and vulnerability from characters but they are brushed off and then a punchline for a joke happens, or something. Like yeah, I get it, it's not a serious story, but these vulnerable moments really help elevate the story. By the end of the book, it's like I know Jeb, but I don't really /know/ him you know?

Anyway, a solid 8/10 book. I don't think it's the best litrpg has to offer, but it's probably the best rational litrpg out there other than WtC.
