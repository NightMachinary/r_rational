My personal favorite is the series “So I'm a Spider, So What?” It's an isekai featuring a high school girl reincarnating into a spider in a fantasy world. Her classmates were also reincarnated, but that's reaching into the overarching plot. It's my favorite isekai and litrpg, and I love the author's take on it. Some people in previous weeks had some problems with it, but for a light novel series, the author does some truly exceptional things.

You should know how lazy isekais and litrpgs are in lightnovels and animes, it's always the same template worlds and plotlines, the same tropes and cardboard cutouts, the same lazily implemented game mechanics to be cool. I really love how Spider approaches all this by actually making an isekai where the elements really matter. Where it's important that there's always a Hero and a Demon Lord, both recognized by the System, clashing. Why there's a game system, why this typical isekai element exists, and so on. In one moment when the MC gets a notification that an Administrator makes a skill just for her, she realizes how strange it is that there even is a game system in the world, and that there's apparently at least someone managing it, and watching it, and realizes that such a being would basically be a god. The human reincarnations also wonder why all the skills are explicitly used for war and combat. The reincarnations actually realize how strange and unnatural all this is, instead of just taking it for granted like basically every other series.

The System and game-like elements are done fantastically. I suppose there might be some gripes or issues people may have with it, but I honestly think there are no plotholes regarding it. The battles are clever, and everything from the beginning to the end, powerscaling, and the power of other characters is well-defined and explained. There's no stupid things like "MC uses the System the Gods invented to kill said Gods" like you might typically see. It also relates heavily to the overarching plot and story, and I love how it's used to play into the mysteries and unraveling the truth. The System and game mechanics are done a lot better than most of the popular RoyalRoad litrpgs even imo(well of course excluding Delve's System).

I like how the MC is written as well, she's really one of the main things selling the series. She's your typical antisocial high school gamer, and gets reincarnated in terrible conditions. Her narration and personality are fantastic and full of life, and really works well with how light novels are typically written. If I talk about what I like about her, I'd spend several paragraphs, so I'll just say there's a good reason why fans all love her so much.

There's so much more I could say about this series, but I'll end off with a passage from an interview with the author about an "interesting" decision he made with a certain early-game opponent:

Editor: Speaking of which, how come the Araba fight ended like that? In many "rising to the top”-type stories the protagonist feels good after they gathered enough power to defeat the final boss, but the Araba fight was nothing like that.

[Baba: I wanted to embed the message that "winning is different from victory”

Editor: Different from victory, you say?

Baba: Winning against Araba was fully Kumoko's personal feeling, while Araba didn't have any self-interest in that battle. Kumoko was able to overcome her trauma by defeating Araba, but I thought about what that victory meant if I looked at it from bird's-eye view. And so I had the unease that, if she was able to defeat and overcome her trauma known as Araba, then it means that Araba was nothing more than a hurdle with the sole purpose of making Kumoko satisfied? I thought no, Araba should have his own way of life. So I didn't use him as a hurdle and tool to make Kumoko feel good.

Editor: Looking at it now, that might have been unsatisfactory if she had won there normally.

Baba: I also wanted to make it into a "meaningful battle” for Kumoko, so she would live on in the from then on precisely because of her battle with Araba. I thought that after leaving the labyrinth and fighting various powerful enemies, the existence of Araba would get blurry with time. Her battle with Araba turned Kumoko into who she is today. His warrior-like way of life definitely influenced Kumoko's way of thinking, and I think that's the reason Araba turned into such a memorable character.]

And this opponent is a Dragon who never says a single word throughout the series.

There's an anime of it currently airing too! It has some...issues, but most fans are happy with it, and I will also add that it leaves out a lot of the details and explanations that elevate this series to the next level in terms of concept.

One last thing that really sells the novels are the [[https://imgur.com/a/K816Tq1][gorgeous illustrations]] by Tsukasa Kiryu. They're phenomenal, in each and every volume.
