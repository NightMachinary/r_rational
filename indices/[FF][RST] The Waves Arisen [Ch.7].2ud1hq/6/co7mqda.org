Shadow clone is OP. Being able to make a copy of an object that can become the original across large distance is to unidamned powerful. If all it takes is chakra coating then the shadow cloned object becomes a sort like a quantum entangled photon, when one is destroyed the other becomes real.

Being able to share memory between multiple clones with no mental problems is a few steps away from having all of the info in the world and a possibility to solve any sort of problem, I hope there is a conflict escalation where Naruto has to use all of the knowledge just to survive.

Marriage counseling part was nice, that's a good application of psychological knowledge on a situation with people who have too much power in their hands, I hope there will be more of this on used on other people and their problems.
