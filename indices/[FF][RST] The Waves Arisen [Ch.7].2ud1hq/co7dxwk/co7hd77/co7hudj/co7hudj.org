Ugh really sorry to be annoying but I'm still not sure this makes sense.

#+begin_quote
  A few days later the examinations were due to begin, but foreign guest ninja had been gradually trickling into Leaf for some time.
#+end_quote

This can either mean something like the following, just as general background information:

#+begin_quote
  A few days before the examinations were due to begin, foreign guest ninja had already been gradually trickling into Leaf for some time.
#+end_quote

But then it's weird it say "had been," and "later" doesn't make sense because it puts sets the "current time" as "a few days before the examinations were due to begin."

Or it can be a sentence that "takes place" in the narrative timeline a few days before the tournament. This is weird too, because there is just some background information and then,

#+begin_quote
  The three of them sat quietly in the waiting room
#+end_quote

which takes place three days later. There's a timeskip of a few days, but nothing happens in the first "time period" except for some description, and it isn't clear why the information couldn't be given while they are sitting in the waiting room, even if it is given before you state that they are in the waiting room, in which case it would turn into something like the revised version quoted above.

Does that make sense?
