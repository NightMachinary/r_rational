I'm not sure the numbers in this chapter make sense.

We were told repeatedly in previous chapters that genin die like flies during military missions, but now it turns out that 80% of them actually die during /exams/, and it would appear that /chuunin/ actually do a bulk of military dying (unless they also mostly die during jounin exams?).

I suppose, this makes more sense, that chuunin are baseline soldiers, while genin are recruits in a sadistic boot camp from hell, but it still seems inconsistent. Am I missing something?

I should note here, just in case it's relevant somehow, that I have no prior knowledge of Naruto canon.
