FTL communication isn't immediately exploitable in this setting. Transporting an object still requires a copy of the object to be moved. I don't think shadow clone is described as making the 'original' a clone, too.

Living with the experience of twenty people (and then twenty people with the experience of twenty people, and so on) is insane, though.
