Great chapter. I really like the pacing of this story.

Some comments:

It wasn't clear to me that time passed between this:

#+begin_quote
  The chuunin exams officially began a week later, though the foreign guest ninja had been gradually trickling into Leaf for some time.
#+end_quote

and this:

#+begin_quote
  the first phase of the chuunin examinations had officially begun.
#+end_quote

Also this line really confuses me for some reason:

#+begin_quote
  or one tenth of the total number for each year it took to make chuunin rank
#+end_quote

Also:

#+begin_quote
  There was a story that his mother had once assassinated an almost-invincible foreign ninja by jamming spiders down her throat, and building a web to clog up her lungs.
#+end_quote

Nice.
