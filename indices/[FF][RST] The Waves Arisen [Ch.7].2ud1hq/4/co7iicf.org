No exploration of the Byakugan? What.

As described in chapter six, it's essentially a super power. Seeing through everything from every angle as far as normal eyesight? That's local omniscience.

The caveat is that he can't keep it on all the time, or at least not for all his clones at once. Plus severely worse Hyuuga relations.

How much does it take to keep active? We know it costs 100 times more to activate than to keep active per second. We know a normal ninja replenishes 86k mc per day, (if they can handle it all) and that Hinata apparently can keep it running for "a few hours" before she has to rest. Presumably this is due to her total mana cap, which may be ~100k mc. At three hours to emergency reserves (10k mc), this is ~10 mc / second to maintain and thus 1k mc to activate.

This is sufficiently small to cause the original Naruto to always keep it on for himself, due to the increased security plus the sheer learning potential seeing everything at once gives you. It makes sense if he wants to avoid antagonizing the Hyuuga for a short time, but he will have to use it openly at some point, and it's very suspicious for two teammates to have eye patches.

However, it should be obvious to the Hyuuga that Hinata has switched eyes. She returns to her clan to sleep. They could easily see her eyepatch or different eye color. With this as the case, Naruto might as well just get an eyepatch and keep the eye technique permanently active.
