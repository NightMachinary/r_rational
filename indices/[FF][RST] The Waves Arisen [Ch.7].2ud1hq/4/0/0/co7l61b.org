In all the costs, have you at all considered the losses? I mean, that people often don't have a good chakra control.

Naruto had sucky control in the beginning. Did his techniques use more chakra than they do now? Would someone else get kagebunshin at 1mc per clone with perfect control and someone with really bad at 3mc? It looks to me, like your costs are fixed and the control does not matter.
