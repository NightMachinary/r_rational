Good to see Naruto thinking through the possibilities, and the potential to use other means than direct confrontation to obtain the other scroll. I know Kiba's team aren't meant to be the strongest people Naruto will face, but the confrontation came off a bit like they were "ignorant normals" being led around by the nose by superior rationalists who had outmaneuvered them. I'm hoping Neji's team will use some of the same strategic thought and maneuver Naruto's team are using to make their face-off more interesting. Given Lee's outburst in the first part, and the single-mindedness the Hyuuga have displayed so far, it'd be very cool if it were Tenten were the brains of the outfit. Her canon tendency towards weapons and seals suggest some good munchkinry potential, at least.
