I've always sort of figured that goals and such can be right or wrong about as much as they can be orange or pine-scented. That is to say, it's incoherent to even suggest it.

People go after their goals, the moral rectitude of such is defined by the masses. Success or failure is determined by how well they achieve said goals. Are they correct to want these things? Again, it's a nonsense question. We want what we want, and we can optimize within that space. And yes, some goals and values are ones that the majority of people would consider "wrong" or "evil". But so what?

Also about strife and such in stories - generally (according to my own limited sample size) it's put in there to give the protagonists an opponent. To make them work for their victory instead of just having it. It would be a pretty boring Hero's Journey if it consisted of "and he lived happily on his farm for the rest of time the end"!

We don't value these things in and of themselves though, what we seem to value is earning things. Hence many paradises seeming flat - there's nothing left to go do or earn or strive for. Naturally it's kind of ridiculous, if all our base needs were met, we'd find more things to go do. If there's one thing humans excel at, it's complicating things.

More on this later if you want, I've got to run for now.
