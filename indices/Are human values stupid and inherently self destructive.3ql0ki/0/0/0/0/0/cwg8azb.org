"I'm criticizing human values for being slapdash and self contradictory, rather than designed with intelligence."

I suppose I've just never encountered this tendency you mention. Are you sure it's as widespread as you seem to think it is? Many people hold value-packages that are perfectly self-consistent, often clustered around a core value and built off of such.

Also some people like villains because they're generally powerful and successful - or other positive traits we'd like to emulate. Otherwise they wouldn't serve their story role very well. Also they tend to appeal to "the darker parts of our nature" too, as cliche as that phrase is. Who hasn't wanted to just cut loose and start smacking people now and again? Seeing someone else do it, even a fictional someone, is cathartic. Nobody sane would argue that humans are perfect or even "good" all the time, but that doesn't make us monsters.
