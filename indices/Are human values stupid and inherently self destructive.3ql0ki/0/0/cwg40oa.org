I'm not sure if human goals and values, collectively the things that make us happy, /can/ be defined very coherently. We have names for various concepts we refer to as these things, but are they correct? Can they be correct? Are goals and values not variable between people? What designed them -- dumb evolution. With a huge fudge factor thrown in to allow for new environments and threats. Goals and values can be wildly divergent, either because of upbringing or because of the way one's brain grew. It might make one person happy to have everyone on earth be stupider than him and worship him. Another might be made happy by occasionally being able to kill someone who bothers him. Another might like to make everyone happy, but only in certain ways.

I think a good way of being able to see this is to look at the stories we like. The strife and hardship and cruelty in these stories are something we like, aren't they? They fulfill some sort of value for us. Perhaps we wouldn't really like to experience these things. Or really inflict them on others. But they fulfill /some/ kind of value. Just like before mechanized war and nuclear weapons, having a "good" war was something that a lot of people considered "fun" and valuable. The horror of war is a modern concept, not something that is a pillar of reality. And consider how flat and sterile and pointless most "after paradise was achieved" descriptions feel. Are the things referenced here simple things that can be reduced to mating, self preservation, and reproduction? Or are human descriptions of human values hopelessly flawed because we are a bunch of kludges that survived, not something that makes sense?
