Human values are built on human instincts, and those are designed for maximal efficiency in a low population scenario, where food is punctually available and predators chase you on a plain.

Survival of your social unit was primordial.

Today, your family unit in the Western world has been reduced to just yourself.

Stress-release mechanisms and seemingly rationally-motivated decisions work all wrong in our intllectual, technological world.

Reward loops meant to encourage us to vary our diets, play games to improve motor skills and appreciate patterns to help us exploit our environment have been captured, distilled and enhanced by advertisements, drugs and superfood.

Human nature is not inherently bad.

It's just that the very same nature is driving fully conscious minds into analyzing themselves, finding their weaknesses, then using them en masse against their fellow man.

Think about this next time you wonder while people wear 'brighter than white' clothes.
