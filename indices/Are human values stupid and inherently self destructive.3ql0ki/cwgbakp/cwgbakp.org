Getting a few basics out of the way:

This does not belong on [[/r/rational]]. I suggest taking it to a philosophy sub, or to [[/r/nihilism]] (if there is such a thing, which there probably is).

  I only just had the thought and probably shouldn't be posting.

Any time you find yourself saying this, /stop/ and don't do the X that you think you shouldn't be doing.

Moving on:

The question itself is based on a false premise. Goals are not universally held, so there's no point in talking about "human values" or "human goals."

As to consistency: goals can be consistent or inconsistent based on the person. Most people share a basic package of evolution-installed goals, which you can find on the bottom of Maslow's hierarchy. Not everyone has even these most basic goals, which makes it even harder to have this conversation. These goals are relatively consistent; inasmuch as a person's goals are inconsistent, it's because they have goals that were installed by culture or personal choice. These goals may be inconsistent with the evolutionary goals -- for example, a firefighter likely values protecting others more than personal safety, to the extent that he's willing to run into a high-danger environment like a burning building. These high-level goals might be inconsistent with one another -- someone might have the goals "be honest" and "be rich". When presented with an opportunity for theft, one of those goals has to win over the other. To this I say: so what? People are usually aware of the contradictions, and the choices we make on an individual and culture level help us to self-modify such that the goals become more consistent.
