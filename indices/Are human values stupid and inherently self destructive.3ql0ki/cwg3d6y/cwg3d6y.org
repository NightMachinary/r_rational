I think part of the problem is you're using an incoherent definition of "human values" here. What human values? Self-preservation? Intellect can certainly help with that one. Reproduction? Not universal, and often selects for intellect anyway. Helping people? Being smarter can help define that and also subsequently achieve it.

Also, aside from human values, what else would motivate someone? While it's interesting to explore non-human values, it's also important to remember we don't really have any actual examples of any to go look at - only those which are imagined by particularly creative humans using that intellect given to us by that idiot evolution.

Furthermore, just because you can solve problems more quickly with advanced intelligence doesn't mean the actual execution of said solutions is quick or easy. Even if you can conceive of and design say, a super bacta tank that can grant immortality, it might well take forty years to actually develop and design the thing.

Sorry to counter a ramble with a ramble, but I hope it helps? If not, I'd be happy to expand on anything or address something I missed.
