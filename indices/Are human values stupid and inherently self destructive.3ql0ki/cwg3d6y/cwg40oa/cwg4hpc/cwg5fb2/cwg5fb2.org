  Also about strife and such in stories - generally (according to my own limited sample size) it's put in there to give the protagonists an opponent. To make them work for their victory instead of just having it. It would be a pretty boring Hero's Journey if it consisted of "and he lived happily on his farm for the rest of time the end"!

I think there's more to it than that. Why do people like villains so much? Why does thinking of the Simurgh in Worm give me a chill of pleasure? Why does personifying death, the destroyer, taking all from us, snuffing out a universe of perception and memory with each person it kills, make conquering death so feel much more attractive than just thinking of it as something very bad that happens to everyone? Is one of our values having or imagining strong enemies? Watch the first Terminator movie. Is not Arnold's character attractive for some reason? Something the director realized, which was why he gets added to the hero's party next movie, with another, even worse villain added, who is also attractive as a character for some reason.

I'm not criticizing particular values, I'm criticizing human values for being slapdash and *self contradictory*, rather than designed with intelligence.
