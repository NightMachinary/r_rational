Hey, I have a question about the biweekly challenge in general, and thought I'd ask here. Is it allowed to enter multiple stories separately for a single challenge? Metafiction is kind of my jam, and I've already got two separate ideas which I'd both like to enter.

Pedantic note: It's immanentize, not immanetize. You made me re-check my already uploaded story :)
