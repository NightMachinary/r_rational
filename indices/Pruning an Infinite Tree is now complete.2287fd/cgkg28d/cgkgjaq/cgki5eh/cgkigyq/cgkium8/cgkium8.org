Okay, thanks.

I see what you mean, but there are tags that are most often used that give a hint. The odd name of this title caught my eye, and the rest is me-being-lazy-and-chatty history. This conversation was helpful in resolving those burning questions. But wait, there's more.

Thanks to the interest generated by OP answering my original comment, I went to read the "Introduction" section for this story. There are, well, /problems/ with composition and grammar even there, in the first thing a new reader might see. That isn't a good sign.

I'm interested in whether the rationalist fiction experience payoff is worth a slog through the apparent first draft hell of the work of an author with very... /casual/ English usage, and a questionable commitment proofreading. Does my even complaining about this answer my own question?

Right now, I seem to be having more fun talking about it then I am currently estimating I'd have reading it. Obviously.
