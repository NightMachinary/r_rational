Wait. One doesn't see the "interesting-ness" of the premise until the end? Doesn't that make the thing drag, if the most interesting part is saved?

Or am I misunderstanding, and you mean something like, "the final reveal is the most interesting part?" Which might or might not be questionable world or plot building, but makes more sense as a subjective evaluation of a good rationalist fic.

In any case, I'm not looking for or demanding a review myself, but a blind link seem a little pointless. For example, I thought it was fantasy, based on the little post icon I got. A single sentence, or a short explanation like you gave, helps me know why I should spend even the ten seconds to follow the link.
