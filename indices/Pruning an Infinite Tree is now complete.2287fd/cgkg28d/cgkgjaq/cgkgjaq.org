I'm not the author.

Are we doing reviews now? I try to include one in most of what I post, but it doesn't seem like that's really a thing.

But it's a pretty clever piece of scifi. It does drones well, which isn't something any novels really do yet. None of the characters are stupid. The explanation for how it all works is pretty clever. Reminded me a bit of the style of permutation city, although there was nothing really in common. That or some of qntm's more esoteric stuff.

It has an interesting premise, but you don't really see that until closer to the end.
