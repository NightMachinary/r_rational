Not the ending itself, but towards the end. The beginning explores the world a bit, but you don't get any explanation for the powers until probably the last third. The world isn't bad, but the mechanism behind the powers is obviously the point. Everything else is backdrop.

I'd say it hits its stride at around half-way point.

Most of the links that get posted here seem to be pretty much blind :/
