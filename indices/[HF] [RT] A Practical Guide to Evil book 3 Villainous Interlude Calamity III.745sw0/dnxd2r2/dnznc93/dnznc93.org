It's a good comparison, since the Soul of Cinder is a pretty heavy reference to a lot of the PVP community's tactics and builds in the earlier Dark Souls games, and the character himself is a sort of combination of all the Lords of Cinder that had come before him. A lot of the bosses in DS3 were references to PvP is previous Dark Souls games, actually; off of the top of my head, the Abyss Watchers were probably references to fight clubs where a bunch of red phantoms would be summoned to fight each other, and the Lothric Princes were a reference to the Gower's Ring of Protection.
