Hm. Seems like Nicae fell and half the heroes are dead in exchange for the Captain. (RIP my favorite calamity ;_;) Does that count as a draw? Because it seems like a pattern of 3 is in the making for Bard vs. the forces of Evil.

I guess the sisters are together in death now. And we didn't even get to see Captain's third aspect, dang.
