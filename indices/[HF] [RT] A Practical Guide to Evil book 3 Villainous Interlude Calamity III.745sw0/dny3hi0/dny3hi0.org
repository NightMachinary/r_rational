What a muddled chapter. I went back and forth on where the axe was going to fall - Captain, Warlock, Black...

I am still not convinced that Captain was killed, because like Black says:

#+begin_quote
  “Third, I needed the monster to be the one attacking,” the Bard continued nonchalantly. “That was the easy one. Love, Amadeus. Love always fucks you over. All I had to do was suggest Champion join White after the wall fell, and your dear friend stepped in.”

  It wouldn't be enough, Amadeus thought. They'd only fought once before, and not on that story. *There (sic) lacked weight.*

While Champion is from a culture of more, er, "traditional" heroes (a la Heracles), she is given the opportunity to leave in the last chapter.

#+begin_quote
  “I don't suppose you could just go back to Levant?” Sabah asked. “Leave the Empire alone. I'm fairly sure Black would not pursue if you just stuck to your borders.”
#+end_quote

Not to mention that Sabah still has her unknown third aspect to rely upon. And Wekesa fails to confirm before being cut off. AND Bard uses the future tense describing how Sabah "will die." She's already been wrong about who would bite it with Hedge/Warlock.

On the other hand, it could be argued that the Beast could be killed:

#+begin_quote
  “She's not fighting Captain,” the Bard said. *“She's fighting a monster...."*
#+end_quote

... because by the end of the fight, Sabah lets the Beast take over. Similar to the Nemean Lion, it's definitely a traditional story for the hero to kill the beast that preys upon virgins. But it does feel lacking compared to, say, the story of a woman avenging her sister's death. And even if the Beast is killed, that's only one aspect of Sabah - she's no longer the Cursed, she's the Captain. I weigh the odds in favor of her being seriously injured or losing an aspect over her being killed. But I'm not, like, going to flip a coin on it!

Meanwhile, two heroes are (seemingly) confirmed dead, White is severely injured and likely a captive of the Tyrant, and I can't imagine Champion is feeling too great after her fight. The side of Good doesn't seem to be looking so great right now. Granted, Black is beaten to hell and back, Warlock is close to being tapped, we don't know the outcome of Ranger's fight with the Queen of Summer, and Assassin is very oddly MIA after seemingly being tasked with taking out Bard (Interlude: Cadenza). So I guess Evil's taken a beating too.

Black's reaction to Sabah's possible death seems... odd. He's laid out plans to kill each of the Calamities, and knows it must happen sometime or Catherine's in deep trouble. So it doesn't seem like he should be too upset if she did die here.

I dunno, overall it feels like this was anticlimactic. Although the fights were awesomely described. And props to the last line:

#+begin_quote
  “This one feels like a sin, doesn't it?” she mused. “Remember that, when the gears start turning.”
#+end_quote

... which, if you missed it, references the Legion's famous motto:

#+begin_quote
  “One grace, victory. One sin, defeat.”
