Lat we saw he she was in a different domain though, and we know from the previous champion vs black encounter that Wekesa can't actually see in those.

So, A, she's already out and dead/dying, or B, its to signify that she is out of his reach. Moments before bard says: “She's not fighting Captain,” the Bard said. “She's fighting a monster. ‘s why I picked Champion. The domain, big guy. She was bound to let out the Beast in that.” (like literally 2 lines earlier)

So either Bard doesn't know that Captain is already dead, or cap dies in the max ten seconds that passed
