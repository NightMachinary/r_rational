I don't think Tyrant is a reliable narrator. I think he has more insight than most characters, but I believe he has significantly less figured out than he thinks he does.

Additionally, Bard definitely believes she pulled it off, but she's been mistaken before. Tyrant has blindsided her at least twice in this arc (Hieroarch, and taking White).

The door is open for unexpected shenanigans. However, I don't believe Sabah is walking away from this one.
