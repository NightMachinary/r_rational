Do you /really/ want to know?

I'll give you this much of a hint -- consider who's involved:

- A couple dozen Sound ANBU. Fanatically loyal to Orochimaru.
- Anko. A high-A-rank ninja. Smart, vicious, and absolutely /done/ with anything that gets between her and getting her kids home...even if it means her death.
- Orochimaru. Rationalist. Psychopath. Crazy prepared. One of the best, if not /the/ best ninja alive, he's more than a match for any non-Kage and can give most of the Kages a run for their money.
- Kurama. In terms of raw chakra he is by far the most powerful being alive. A bijuu with literally billions of years experience at manipulating chakra and a thousand years of watching human history unfold, he's been trapped inside one person after another for almost that entire time...and now he's out. With no restrictions on what he can and can't do, so long as he protects Team Anko.
