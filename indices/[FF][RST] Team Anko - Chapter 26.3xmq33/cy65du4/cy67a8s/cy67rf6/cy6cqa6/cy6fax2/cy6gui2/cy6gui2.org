Points of order:

1. Orochimaru fought Itachi at a handicap, needing him alive, while also being in a weakening body in need of replacement.
2. Itachi has a powerful bloodline that eventually evolves into literal godhood.
3. Orochimaru still escaped that battle alive.
4. None of this is cannon to Team Anko.
5. [[/u/eaglejarl]] only said that he is /one of the best,/ leaving the possibility of being the very best open.
6. [[/u/eaglejarl]] is the author, therefor his word is WoG.
