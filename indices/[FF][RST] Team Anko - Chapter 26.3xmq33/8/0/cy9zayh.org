Yep. It's a military term. e.g. "Police up the barracks" means to pick up all the junk and tidy things up.

I had the same issue in 2YE. I wrote "the undead had invested GrÇ«fhamr". I got a bazillion people gleefully writing in to tell me that that should be "infest". Nope. Infest would mean they were inside; invest is a military term meaning "to surround a town or other objective".
