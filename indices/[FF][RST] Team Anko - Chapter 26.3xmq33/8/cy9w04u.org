I believe I found a typo in ch 13

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11087425/13/Team-Anko]]

"police... kunai" -> "polish... kunai"

unless policing has another meaning, like keeping clean of or something, similar to how someone might police a neighborhood?

EDIT: Well, I'm seeing it used later to refer to picking up kunai, so it's probably just a word I'm not familiar with.
