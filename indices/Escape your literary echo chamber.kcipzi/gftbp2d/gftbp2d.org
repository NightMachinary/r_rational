It works I guess?? It recommended only modern crime mystery books. Some other oddball stuff like sword art online was the only one I recognized.

I won't be reading any of them because I absolutely detest any books set in modern earth but it definitely gives new options.

My echo chamber is comfortable and cozy. Good books all around.
