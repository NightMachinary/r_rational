I got a strange mix of religious literature (which challenges my views alright, but not in a productive way), socially left literature (which mostly aligns with my views, go figure), and Hunger Games (....sure).

To be fair, I put /Atlas Shrugged/ on my list since I enjoyed the book in the "it's terribly written but has a heart" way people usually enjoy web novels, and in that category it's my favorite by far. When I took it out, I got "Rationality: From AI to Zombies" as one of the first (anti?)recommendations which is just /wowsers/ level of terrible predictions.
