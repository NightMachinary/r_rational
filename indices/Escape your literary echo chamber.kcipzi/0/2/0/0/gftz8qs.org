We're talking about John Dies at the End here, right? I read that back when it was a web serial on his website before that website got merged into Cracked. I guess he's written several other books since then that I haven't read... and also it's probably been about a decade since the last time I read JDatE. Pretty certain I still have a copy of the book, but it's probably currently in a box in storage.
