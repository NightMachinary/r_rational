Not quite sure this works. I put in Prey and Making Money, two random books I enjoyed, and got 90% young children's literature, 5% books I already read (including a David Wong book, which doesn't feel a bubblebreaker for Discworld readers in the slightest) and 5% stuff that just sounded outright atrocious, not out of my tastes.
