To some extent the books which center around Miles do have that lens. The others generally don't; while there are certainly people who are unambiguously villains, their villainy tends to be defined by their vicious and callous disregard for human life rather than by which side they're on.

This is particularly true for Cordelia's Honor (the omnibus in question), and especially true for Falling Free, which is entirely standalone and features a heroic engineer and one of the best "take the thing apart and put it back together in a different configuration" action sequences I've ever read.
