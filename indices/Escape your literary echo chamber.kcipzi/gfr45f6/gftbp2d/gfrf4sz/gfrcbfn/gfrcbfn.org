It's somewhat extreme but it definitely shows books I haven't read or considered reading. Got a lot of poetry, some romance novels, and a Christian historical fiction novel (which is a genre?) about King Hezekiah, which which sounded interesting until I realized it was a historical fiction novel and not a religious themed fantasy novel.
