  The Powder Mage Trilogy - Maybe, although I really don't want to read another book glorifying the military.

If you're on the fence for this one, I will confirm that it absolutely is glorifying the military (though less than I anticipated when I started the series), but that I really enjoyed it regardless.

Also, if you want a series that is similarly thick with intrigue and politics, but without the focus on the military, may I suggest The Tethered Mage by Melissa Caruso. It has a somewhat unfortunate love triangle subplot that was kind of annoying, but the worldbuilding and plotting is great and the main characters had a lot of moments where I was pleasantly surprised by them avoiding making the obviously stupid decision.
