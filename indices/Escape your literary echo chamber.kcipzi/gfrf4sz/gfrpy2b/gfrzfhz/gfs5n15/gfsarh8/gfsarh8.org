Did you read it in Spanish? Because if not, you didn't dislike his prose, you disliked the prose of the translation. You've gotta give translated works a bit of leeway. Sometimes a bit-and-a-half.

There's apparently some controversy around the available translation, because the woman he married shortly before his death has the publishing rights tied up for the original translations that Borges himself actually collaborated on with the translator, and she had a new translation commissioned because the original translator was getting 50% of the royalties.

Borges' influence is quite a bit wider than one arc of Worth the Candle. You were in your late teens / early 20s a decade ago if you were in college at the time. I think you're doing yourself a disservice if you allow your opinions to be swayed by the opinions of a teenager / young adult, even if that teenager / young adult happens to be your past self.
