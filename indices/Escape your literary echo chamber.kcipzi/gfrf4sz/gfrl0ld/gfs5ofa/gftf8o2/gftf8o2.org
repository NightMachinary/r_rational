As the other commenter said the worldbuilding is awesome--sort of dark gothic high fantasy, very memorable. The magic system is also totally iconic, I'd say on the order of Sanderson's Allomancy, but with bells instead of metals. Also necromancy rarely gets a fair shake in fantasy, this is the exception.

To be 100% honest with you I haven't read these books since middle school, but I absolutely adored them. Gotta find my copy of Sabriel and start again.
