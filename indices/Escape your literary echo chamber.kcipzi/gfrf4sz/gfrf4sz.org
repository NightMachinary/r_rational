I had a hard time getting it to pick books. Eventually, I picked the widest selection of books that I enjoyed which still felt representatives of my tastes.

American Gods - Gaiman (All sorts of Gaiman really)

Men At Arms - Pratchett (I have / read every Discworld book)

Tortilla Flat - Steinbeck (I have / read almost every Steinbeck book, especially the comedies)

1776 - David McCullough (I read a lot of History for my job, sometimes for fun).

2001: A Space Odyssey - (I like old school sci-fi, and this felt like the easiest one to find).

Watchmen - (I read all sorts of comic books; ditto on it being easy to find)

​

In response my top 12 was:

2 volumes of Naruto - No

2 volumes of Bleach - No

2 young children's books - No

Rick Riordan's Percy Jackson - No

Borges - Absolutely not. I loathe him, and I loathe the story they recommended.

Abhorsen by Garth Nix - Maybe

The Powder Mage Trilogy - Maybe, although I really don't want to read another book glorifying the military.

Vorkosigian Saga - This one I've come across, but I'm still leaning towards no for the same reasons above.

​

I've got to say, I'm less than impressed. It seems far too focused on sci-fi / fantasy and children's lit.
