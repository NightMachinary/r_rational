I guess the Losara Sigil will enforce the oaths, and any oath which wants to have a chance to be voted will include something like "I will not slaughter my whole sigil for personal gains".\\
Also there might be cabals formed to disincentivize this sort of behaviour.

Add to that that mighty don't actually gain much from killing someone much weaker it becomes pretty unappealing to actually do it. Sure you get to keep the Sigil-Holder-Level of power, but what use is this if you are not going to have sigil, bc nobody is going to follow you afterwards again.
