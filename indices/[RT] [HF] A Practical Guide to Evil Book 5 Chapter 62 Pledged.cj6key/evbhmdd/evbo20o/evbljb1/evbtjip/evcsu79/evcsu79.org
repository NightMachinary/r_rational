  But also what stops someone from getting the sigil vote and then immediately, or i suppose close to the end of nine years, killing the whole of their sigil?

The same thing that stops them from doing it now. Dzulu have so little night that they're more useful just as embodied gophers and infantry than they are for harvested night. Kill all your dzulu and (especially with Cat's provision for switching sigils) you'll be left with not enough Night to solely defeat every other sigil and establish dominance, no dzulu willing to join your sigil, and probably the enmity of Sve "Let's maybe try not butchering each other this time" Noc.
