I wonder what the results will be of the concentration of power into the office rather than the Mighty themselves. Also, how will Sigils merge or die?

(If you die while in office your power gets rolled into the Night that is the office, right? And this office is Sigil-specific. And you're in a war, where the office holders are battle resources...)
