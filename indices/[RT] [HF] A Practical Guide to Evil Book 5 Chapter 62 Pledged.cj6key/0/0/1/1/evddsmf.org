Which is part of the fundamental contrast between our world and theirs, I personally love the look at democracy through the lens of, this is Evil and will almost definitely lead to abuses of the limited power given in order to maintain control of the masses. Democracy just kits the mild of evil in this world so well, because it means you have to 'fight' for a position, to prove you deserve it and have enough people agree for you to obtain it, like gaining an evil name. While gaining a Good name is just someone unilaterally saying, "I'm here to give you power and skill so you can do what I say." Which perfectly reflects the idea of the heaven ordained ruler.
