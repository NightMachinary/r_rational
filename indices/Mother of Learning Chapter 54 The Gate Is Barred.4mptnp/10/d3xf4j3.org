Wow. What an excellent way to end an arc - just like with the first one, with protagonist being completely, thoroughly outplayed. They didn't even catch a tail of Red Robe - looks like he left looong ago.

My thought is that the solution to their problem would be some kind of brute-forcing. The obvious DragonBall-ish plot of recovering every part of the Key aside - maybe it can unlock the Gate, maybe it can't - they are still in a pocket dimension. Perhaps it is possible to simply break through the anchor point. We already saw an example of breaking a pocket dimension open. With enough power, it's possible to do just about anything, possibly including escaping an extradimensional prison.

At least time to figure things out they have in spades. Or not, if the Guardian will drop another bombshell on them in the next chapter and say that they only have a few restarts till the loop cpllapses automatically (I think the first part of the next chapter will be Zorian and Zach questioning the Guardian for everything it knows).
