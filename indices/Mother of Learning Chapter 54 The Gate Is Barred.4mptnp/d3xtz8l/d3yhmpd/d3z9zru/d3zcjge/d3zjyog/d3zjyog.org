1) IIRC he does not know that it's Zach's marker. He only knows that this marker belongs to the only time-traveler left in the loop.

2) I meant that we judge the actions as incompetent without knowing that background. But to pursue this argument further I need to reread end of arc 1.

Also, he could've improved a lot during the loop.

I am not too confident in this theory, but would give it 30% probability.
