It just occurred to me that I now know the real reason Zorian couldn't find Red Robe with the detection spell. It's not that Red Robe lacked the soul marker, Red Robe was just already absent from the loop. Damn. The theory never even occured to me before, yet now it seems a very likely explanation, in hindsight.

The conclusion that Red Robe doesn't have the soul marker was actually influencing a lot of my estimations about a lot of things, and now I need to reevaluate everything. Damn.
