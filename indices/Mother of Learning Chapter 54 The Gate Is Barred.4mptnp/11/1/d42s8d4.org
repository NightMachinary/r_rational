I think there's still a lot of questions with that interpretation. Why did RR bother to ambush Zach if he already knew how to leave the loop all along? We know he messed with Zach's mind at least once.

It's enough to make you consider the tinfoil theory that the current Zach isn't the real one or is RR in disguise.
