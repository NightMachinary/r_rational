It's a way of tagging characters - useful when dealing with fan fiction, where the same name in different stories can be quite a different character.

I don't know its origin, but it avoids ambiguity, since an exclamation mark is never (that I know of) actually used in the middle of a name (whereas Adjective Name might well be a legitimate name in many stories), plus if it's a grammatical exclamation mark, it should have a space after it.
