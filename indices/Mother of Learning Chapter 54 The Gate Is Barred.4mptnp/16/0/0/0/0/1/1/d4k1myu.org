Remember how Zorian's first 7 months in the loop had Zach missing from it? I figured RR was inferring the time period from the beginning of Zach's absence after Quatach-Ichl soul melded them. He didn't know exactly what happened to create Zach's disappearance, but he knew it was something major, and upon finding out about more time traveler(s), decided that their entry was the cause. At one point early on, Zorian wonders if was actually an even longer period of time for Zach's absence, that he himself wasn't even conscious/aware, which is definitely possible, since most estimates put Zach at a bit under 3 years in the loop during that confrontation with RR.

It's interesting to note that we don't know exactly what was going on with Zach during those first seven loops. Did he truly not exist in the loop, or was he unconscious the whole time and his condition was masked by either RR or his guardian with news of "his disappearance"?

That leads to another question about whether this is Zach's true soul in the loop, and whether Zorian's is just a duplicate, if Zorian's is a duplicate, and gets merged on top of real soul upon leaving the loop, that should have some interesting effects. It would probably raise Zorian's max mana reserves from 32ish to 64ish for one thing, boosting him up to 40ish immediately upon leaving the loop, probably without significantly negatively affecting his shaping skills too.
