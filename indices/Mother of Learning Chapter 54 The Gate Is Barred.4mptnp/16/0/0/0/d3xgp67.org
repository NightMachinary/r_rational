Oh, he surely did, that's why Zorian's ritual showed only Zach.

But I meant that he has not used it himself. The ritual was described as medium-level stuff at best. Entry-level, really. No need of soul sight or /even/ soul-awareness.

If RR is a rational master soul mage that got into loop by deliberate marker duplication, that ritual is the *first* thing he does in chapter 25. Consequently, there is no chapter 26 for Zorian as he is annihilated. Not using it is a major major major fuck up for RR if he knows it. Conclusion: he is not very good at soul magic.
