This story has been going on /eight years/!? I just discovered it a few months ago! Now if the third arc is going to be as long as the first two, I'm going to have to wait four years for it to be done? Maybe I should just wait and read it all at once, like a physical book...

edit: Either way, I guess, props to nobody103 for writing a great story and having the dedication to keep going so long.
