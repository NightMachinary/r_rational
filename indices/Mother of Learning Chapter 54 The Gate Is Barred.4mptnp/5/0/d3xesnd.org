Do you realise what the key is, by the way?

#+begin_quote
  the Key consists of the five imperial treasures of the first Ikosian emperor. The ring, the crown, the staff, the orb and the dagger.

Five treasures, five equally important parts of the key. It is quite obvious they aren't in order-it would be unlikely if they were.

Dagger. Likely a ceremonial blade-a mage has little need for weapons. A thing of beauty. Perhaps a magical implement. Basically, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athame][Athame]]

Crown. Either a literal crown, or just something that goes on your head. Likely something delicate, with masterful craftsmanship, so it might be better to call it a Diadem.

Staff. Likely the first thing one thinks of when they hear "wizard"(that or the hat). A masterful item, crafted by the best spell formula craftsmen you can think of. A symbol of Magic.

Orb. A [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globus_cruciger][globus-cruciger]], an item that is useless in it's own right, but serves as a symbol of royalty, an Insignia of sorts.

Ring. Too small to be of any actual value-magical powerhouse is the Staff. No, ring is not an item of magical power, it is instead a symbol of political influence, of Nobility.
