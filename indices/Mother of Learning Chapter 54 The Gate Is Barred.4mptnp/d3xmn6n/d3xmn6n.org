Nice to get closure (for the moment) about Red Robe. I think I'm going to enjoy this (the things taking place after this) more than I would have enjoyed what Zorian was worried about!

(And if they can do it for one, then also for many; 'none' also works, though bleaker. I also absently wonder if there are any plans for Zorian to talk with his more-famous brother at some point, in reality or not. (Not that I'm saying there should be if there aren't.))
