I have a mechanical question about how this gate thing works.

Given the contents of this chapter, activating the gate seems like a deliberate conscious decision. To activate the gate, presumably you have to be nearby or something. The gate takes a snapshot of reality and starts the loop.

So when every loop begins, shouldn't the original looper be standing right outside, excluding Zach as the originator?

Seems like this implies that RR is the original, and Zach accidentally got pulled in somehow. The theory that 'the marker is in his bloodline' sounds odd considering how confident everyone is that there is exactly one controller at a time. You would imagine that having happened before if this was the case.
