To be honest, I am really not happy with simulation theory. Specifically because it causes a huge cluster-fuck of clash with substance dualism MoL universe so smoothly runs on. Magically waving hand and saying 'turns out time travel is actually possible' breaks fewer things in comparison.

Oh well.

Now that we know Sovereign Gate was in Noveda's possession explains how Zach got in the loop: by virtue of his bloodline.

How does RR start looping? One hypothesis was via blood magic, when Zach got beaten by non-looping-then RR and got blood-magicked for the marker and mind-magicked for the marker operation manual and then memory-wiped. Bonus points: blood magic actually explains RR's affinity to tacky clothes. With that in mind RR could be basically anyone who was more or less capable before the time loop. That excludes both Boranova (was a silly theory to begin with) and Daimen (he simply won't be hostile to Zach if they had ever met)

Speaking of Daimen, I suspect the theme would be Zorian making peace with /all/ of his family. He started being annoyed with them, now he's changed his opinion on Kirielle, Fortov and his mother (IIRC?). I guess he'll need Daimen's help to find some of those artifacts and in the process they will become friends, ^{and} ^{^{grow}} ^{^{^{a}}} ^{^{^{^{pair}}}} ^{^{^{^{of}}}} ^{^{^{^{wings.}}}} Time travel is powered by the magic of friendship hue hue hue.
