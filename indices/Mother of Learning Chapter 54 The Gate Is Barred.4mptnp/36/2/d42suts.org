Now things are really complicated. The primordial may have been a red herring all along since it's the interaction of pocket dimensions that really stop the time loop from going longer. Therefore, it might be that Zach was NOT the original looper but rather got in accidentally via his bloodline interacting with the Gate.

So what if RR was the original looper who activated the Gate? He might have done so for his own purposes (Cyoria invasion).
