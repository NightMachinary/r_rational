True that Red Robe leaving the loop would have explained the lack of his soul marker earlier in the story, but what I'm trying to say is that it didn't make sense motive-wise then. Why would anyone leave a time loop early? From everyone's perspectives, there was no such thing as only one person leaving. It was reasonably assumed that everyone would be able to escape and in that scenario, leaving early is a *terrible* move since your enemies will jump to monstrously strong heights in a blink of an eye. Therefore it made the most sense for Red Robe to still be in the loop.

It required a shift in the understanding of the actual nature of the time loop to understand why only one person could leave, from which the deduction that Red Robe left early becomes trivial.

While people could have deducted that he left early, we pride ourselves on reading stories where characters make intelligent decisions and it would have required an amazingly mind-boggling amount of stupidity on Red Robe's part to give up such a huge advantage even with multiple time travelers around. With multiple time traveling enemies, you either end the loop for everyone or keep a very, /very/ low profile.
