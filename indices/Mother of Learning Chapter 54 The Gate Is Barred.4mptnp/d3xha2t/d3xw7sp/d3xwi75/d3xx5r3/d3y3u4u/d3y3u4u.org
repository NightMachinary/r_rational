It could be a rational as readers of the story to accept this theory prior to this reveal if we considered that RR didn't know that the time loop would persist after he left. Meaning the deduction is not simply "RR has a soul marker - he just left the time loop", it's deducing "RR left the time loop thinking the risk was too high and he had gained enough power, not knowing that the time loop is still persisting because a controller is still inside".
