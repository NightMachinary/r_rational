I'm inclined to believe that, should this explanation have been provided ahead of time, not in-story, for example by someone here, in the [[/r/rational]] discussions, everything would have clicked very well and I would consider this theory one of the most likely to be true.

Edit: I wouldn't say the likelihood of the theory would be more than 50%, just that it would look the most likely out of the multitude of theories floating about. I'm amazed no one even contemplated the possibility that Red Robe already left the loop, even given the evidence that his soul marker cannot be found. Everyone just accepted the in-story vague explanation that maybe Red Robe found an alternative means to enter the loop.
