  now it seems a very likely explanation, in hindsight.

No it wasn't. The main insight was the fact that one could "leave" the loop early without ending the loop itself. I mean before, we all believed that ending the loop for one person would end it for everyone since that's how "time loops" and not parallel dimensions apparently work. Why was there any reason to believe that one would just "exit" the loop early?

So what I'm trying to say is it wasn't very obvious at all and there's no need to beat yourself up for mistaking parallel dimensions for a time loop. And I totally agree with you about reevaluating everything. ARGH! ;)
