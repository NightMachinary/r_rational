I'm not so sure it does. If the most important function of souls is to be a living record of who a person is, then how can you make a copy of the person, attached to the same soul, that does /not/ record changes? I think you have to copy the soul(s) if you want changes to be transient.

Moreover, Batak talks about the soul needing a body, even "just an ectoplasmic shell". That doesn't sound like shining a hologram, but rather like the body does indeed 'contain' the soul. Batak may not have specifically talked about souls being copied, but it stands to reason that the gods could do it (given sufficient power to create souls, full understanding of how they work, and access to the original).
