It's possible that a soul is read into a person's brain and changes are written back into the soul. If reading and writing are two separate functions, then the simulation can choose to allow the read function and disallow the write function.

As for souls requiring a "shell", if you use a projector and don't have a screen, you won't see an image. The body is the screen that allows the soul to manifest.
