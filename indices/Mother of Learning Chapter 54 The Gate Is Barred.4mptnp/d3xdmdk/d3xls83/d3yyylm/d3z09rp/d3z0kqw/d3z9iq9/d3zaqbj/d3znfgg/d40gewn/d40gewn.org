Right, I forgot that undead still have souls. [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/47/Mother-of-Learning][Chapter 47]]:

  [Golems] were just as tireless as the living dead, and had no souls for the necromancer to mess with.

  Simulacrum, presumably just takes this to the next level. [. . .] It is also possible that simulacrum is not charged with mana, but with spell-ammo instead, where the caster's soul does all the mana shaping work in advance.

I would agree with this, except that for a construct to cast spells, it usually needs to be covered with complex runework, e.g., Sudomir's dragon. Casting ability is extremely narrow. Also, correct me if I'm wrong, when mana is structured ahead of time, as with spell formulae, the result is that the resulting effects are specific and constrained spellwork.

While I admit it's possible that a simulacrum is just another (likely lesser) version of that dragon construct, I think it's more likely that simulacra utilize soul magic and a tentative link to the caster's soul in the place of runework. I say this assuming that compared with the caster, the simulacrum indeed has shaping skills and similar yet paired-down casting ability.
