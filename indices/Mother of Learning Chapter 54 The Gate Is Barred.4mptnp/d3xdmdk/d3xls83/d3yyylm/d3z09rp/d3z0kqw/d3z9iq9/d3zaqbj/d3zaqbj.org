Good points.

  Zorian is not necessarily reliable and may be biased by the church's dogma.

I believe Zorian discussed simulacra with Batak after his confrontation with RR. Zorian gave little weight to the ideas of the religious prior to these discussions, but who knows if that affected his description of RR's simulacrum.

  Batak's assertion that a simulacrum does not have a soul is not entirely consistent with other evidence.
#+end_quote

I find it more likely that in the history of magic, simulacra have undergone significant research, including the examination of those with soul sight, so I believe Batak when he says simulacra have no soul.

On that note, it would be interesting to learn about the difference between the undead, golems, and simulacra. Clearly magic alone is enough to sustain these constructs, although it seems the simulacrum (imperfectly) uses the caster's soul as a blueprint.

  if the spell had a lifetime of only a few minutes I think it would be limited to niche applications and be relatively unknown

I disagree here. A decently powerful clone of a competent mage, even short-lived, could be quite useful. Outside of a time loop, dungeon clearing could be done without mortal risk to the mage through divination, arcane eyes, and simulacra for particularly risky fights.

Also, if the simulacrum spell is well-known, the question of whether the spell has a soul /must/ have been answered by a competent soul mage at some point in history. I imagine for the church to not object to the spell's usage, some priest with soul-sight examined a simulacrum and concluded no soul was present.

--------------

Like you, I doubt simulacra rely exclusively on ambient mana. I also agree that it's most likely that the simulacrum links to the caster's soul somehow to make use of their shaping skills and, I would guess, mana reserves.

--------------

Indeed, I don't think simulacra are precisely equivalent to how the gods or the Sovereign Gate read souls to copy an individual. Rather, I think simulacrum is an attempt to replicate that feat, but a poor attempt. I imagine the simulacrum is more like using the blueprints of a car to make a sketch, whereas what the gods and Sovereign Gate do is akin to building a duplicate car from the blueprints.

Yes, I feel copying souls poses problems, as does "resetting" several million souls every restart except for marked souls.

The solution I mention looks at souls like data on a harddrive. Reality reads data from the soul and /usually/ updates the soul by writing in new data. However, within the timeloop, new data is not rewritten to souls except for souls that have the marker.

Other ramifications of this hypothesis is a clean explanation of simulacra: The spell uses an imperfect soul-read function to create a copy of the mage. Because the read function is imperfect, the simulacrum is imperfect and weaker than the original and needs to be infused with a portion of original caster's mana to operate. Furthermore, the imperfect read function means soul mages cannot look at the simulacrum and see the soul it reads from. Also, since the spell only uses a read function, information from the simulacrum does not update the original soul. Alternatively, the simulacrum reads from the soul only briefly, then stops, and this is why soul mages cannot see the soul that produced the simulacrum. This is a like a brief look through a dirty window and drawing what you see---the image you saw was smudged out and the drawing is anyhow just a facsimile.

By contrast, the Sovereign Gate and the gods read perfectly and continuously from the soul when copies are made. This means soul mages can look at the copy and clearly see the original soul. This is more like looking through a clean window; you can see the actual object beyond the glass.

The lich phylactery is also makes sense in light of this: Unlike the simulacrum, the lich's body reads from the soul continuously. If the body is destroyed, the phylactery acts as a backup device to continue reading from the soul.

Lastly, this soul hologram hypothesis means that souls are indeed neither created nor destroyed by the Sovereign Gate, which fits with the mythos. Remember that priests are connected with spiritual beings, which used to include gods. It's not unlikely that the reason people believe souls cannot be destroyed is because divine beings simply admitted that fact to humans. It's conceivable that every divine being refused to answer such questions or lied, but I doubt divine beings as a whole would act so homogeneously.

P.S. You keep referring to the priest as Barak. I didn't realize the US President was so religious. ;)
