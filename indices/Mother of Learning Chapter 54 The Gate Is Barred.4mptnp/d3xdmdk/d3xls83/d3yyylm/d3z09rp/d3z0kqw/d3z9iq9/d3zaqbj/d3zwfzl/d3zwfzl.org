I really like your speculation on the nature of souls in this series if the reason that simulacrum don't appear to have a soul is because they are an imperfect copy(comparable a program missing an important variable assignment). In the context of this series looking back it seems soul magic can be explained in the likes of a coding language developed by this worlds gods. In this case if the creator of the Sovereign gate had accurately deciphered the language then it makes sense how they could do things seemingly impossible through the "normal" brute force attempts to manipulate the code without knowing the underlying structure.

I hope we can get a larger understanding of this underlying structure in the future it would be interesting to see if the gods of this world actually developed the world in the manner of a programmer.
