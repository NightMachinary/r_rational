Whether the dragon was undead or not is an open question in my mind. Indeed, most undead do not have their bodies covered in runework, but most undead aren't flying dragon skeletons that shoot destructive rays. If the dragon's soul was still present, would Sudomir have been able to control it through his mind? Perhaps. I'm of the opinion that he simply used the bones of a dragon to make a golem that can be controlled by Sudomir psychically. Again, it's speculation.

On that subject, how do undead work? If you start with a corpse and then reanimate, then how do you have access to the soul? Wouldn't the soul have already "left"? Does raising the dead bring the soul back from the void? If a corpse is risen without being powered by a soul, is that just a flesh golem?

I'd love to hear nobody103 comment on this.

  However, a simulacrum does not need to be infinitely flexible to be useful. After all it's a disposable body double that is meant to be used in a very dangerous situation. It is more useful than a golem in some situations because destruction of a golem is costly and it takes more time and preparation to create. OTOH you can conjure simulacrum with zero cost (other than your mana, ofc), get it killed and then create it again and again.

At this point, it's speculation. I do remember that Zorian said a simulacrum is infused with a portion of the caster's "skill and magic". That can be interpreted both ways: Does the caster pre-shape a bunch of spells for the simulacrum to cast? Or does the simulacrum weakly read the properties of the caster's soul, and thus create a limited facsimile of the caster, shaping skills and all?
