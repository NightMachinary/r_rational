  However, it seems reasonable that it can have some functions outsourced to souls.

Yes, that makes a lot of sense. He could even power it using human souls seeing as he has that freaking soul well.

I agree, but that's so uncharacteristic of the stereotypical necromancer who raises undead from the deceased. But nothing says MoL has to be stereotypical, and I think that solution is pretty clean.

To be perfectly clear about the problems with raising corpses using their departed soul, this mechanic would imply the body anchors the soul even after death. In that case, a necromancer could access hundreds of human souls by going to their local graveyard. Necromancy shouldn't be /that/ convenient.

One solution is that undead are generally powered by animal souls, which explains why most undead are feral. On the other extreme, you have undead made with human souls---vampires, liches, etc.
