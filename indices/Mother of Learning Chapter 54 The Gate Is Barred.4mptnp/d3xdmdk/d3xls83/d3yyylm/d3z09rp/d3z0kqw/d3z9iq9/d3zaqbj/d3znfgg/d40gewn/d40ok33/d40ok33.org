You're right, but Sudomir's dragon is quite probably an undead. Possibly automated by the original dragon soul, even. That would explain the casting ability.

In any way, the runework is just a complex pre-built spell boundary. (ch 11)

  "Tell me, what are spell formulas?" [...]

  "It's the practice of using geometric shapes and various sigils to modify spells, usually in order to strengthen wards or amplify spellcasting," said Zorian.

  "Really? How do they do that?" asked Nora in mock curiosity.

  "Err... they limit mana flow along pre-determined pathways?" tried Zorian.

  "Yes!" agreed Nora. "They limit, that's exactly what they do! I can't tell you how many mages think they're some kind of inherent amplifier or something. Drives me crazy, I tell you. Of course, most modern crafters use special materials that are inherent amplifiers, but that's something else entirely. Anyway, you know the point behind structured spellcasting, right?"

  "The narrower the effect of the spell is, the more mana efficient it becomes. Structured magic creates a spell boundary to forcibly narrow down effect space into something manageable for a human spellcaster."

  "And spell formulas are the exact same thing, only with more pronounced benefits and drawbacks," said Nora.

The end goal is to make mana flow form a certain geometric shape.

You can implement the mana limiters in your construct on a physical matter and get a golem, or you can use your personal mana for the task to the same effect. Except with golems you can take your time, with simulacrum you have to cram all of it in a single invocation. The end effect will be inflexible in both cases: it won't be able to cast anything you haven't prepared it to cast in advance. It can't do unstructured magic or even supercharge a magic missile.

However, a simulacrum does not need to be infinitely flexible to be useful. After all it's a disposable body double that is meant to be used in a very dangerous situation. It is more useful than a golem in some situations because destruction of a golem is costly and it takes more time and preparation to create. OTOH you can conjure simulacrum with zero cost (other than your mana, ofc), get it killed and then create it again and again.
