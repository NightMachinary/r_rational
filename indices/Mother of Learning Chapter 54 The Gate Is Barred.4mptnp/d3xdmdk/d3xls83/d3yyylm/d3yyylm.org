  it appears the sovereign gate not only recreates the material world from a snapshot, but souls too

There's another solution that's pretty interesting. I looked up that one priest's discussion with Zorian about souls and found this bit from [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/51/Mother-of-Learning][Chapter 51]], emphasis mine.

  *"According to some stories, [using the soul, the gods] could even create an identical copy of a person, indistinguishable from the original in every way."*

  "Copies of people?" Zorian frowned.

  "It is not that strange," Batak said, waving his hand dismissively. *"The simulacrum spell does something very similar.* While simulacrums are in no way f awless, they are suffi ciently real that some people have argued the use of the spell is inherently unethical. They believe that every time a simulacrum disperses, a person dies."

  "Do you?" Zorian asked.

  "No," Batak shook his head. *"Naturally, I follow my Church's dogma, and it states that only things with souls are considered people. Simulacrums do not have them."*

Note that nothing in the above is said about using souls to create a duplicate soul, and yet exact copies of a person can be made that are utterly identical to the original. This suggests that people's bodies don't necessarily need to /contain/ a soul. This could mean that souls could exist in the spiritual dimension like a lens. "Mana" shines through the souls, projecting a hologram/shadow onto the material realm and this is what creates consciousness.

The simulacrum spell is a secondary reproduction from the hologram, so does not appear to have a soul. The SGate, however, simply requests the hologram to shine into a looping version of the material plane, but does not feed any new data back to the souls except for souls that bear the mark.

This means souls don't need to be created or destroyed and there doesn't need to be any conundrum between original and time-loop Zorian. This solution is also more energy efficient than creating souls every loop then discarding them afterwards.
