Yes. Also:

- How many loops ago did the controller leave? (While the guardian did say that "the time loop cannot end while the controller is inside", it is not operating in its intended condition. If the Red Robe left THIS loop, I would not completely trust the loop to reset in the traditional way, so it may be worth trying something moderately desperate in the remaining days.)
