It's a neat find, but unfortunately, Zorian has been actively meddling in Sudomir's town by that point. We know there was an assassination attempt in the next chapter, so maybe this was a result of Zorian getting killed in his sleep.

Plus, he had already cast the detection ritual in ch 32, and got two markers, not three.

I suspect RR got out on the 3rd or 4th month after ch 26. By the time Zorian finished his 'vacation' he was gone.
