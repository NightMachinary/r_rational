My guess: RR probably left in chapter 33 when the loop ended early for no reason that Zorian could figure out. Right after that restart is the 2nd time he tries the tracking ritual. Still, don't know why RR wouldn't show up the first time he attempted it, unless RR was off continent for some reason.
