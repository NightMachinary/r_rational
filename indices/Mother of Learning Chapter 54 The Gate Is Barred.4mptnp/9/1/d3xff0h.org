  So my first thought to the problem of only one person leaving is that we might already have the answer to that- much like the Cyorian matriarch did, Zorian could bring Zach's memories with him, or at least put a packet in his head, etc.

Except the person has already left the +building+ Gate. Zach would be the 2nd one to exit, which would break 'only one exits' rule and that makes room for Zorian as well. If 2 can leave the Gate, then 3 can, too.

Memory packet OTOH would be a catch-22: pre-loop Zorian has no skills to read it.
