How do you explain Zorian's soul gaining in magical strength whereas an unmarked soul such as Taiven's does not? If both their souls are drawn by the Gate from the material plane, what distinguishes them? If the Gate merely resets from a physical template and the people it creates are simulacrums connected to their original souls, shouldn't all the souls record and preserve their experiences, regardless of whether they are marked as the controller or not?
