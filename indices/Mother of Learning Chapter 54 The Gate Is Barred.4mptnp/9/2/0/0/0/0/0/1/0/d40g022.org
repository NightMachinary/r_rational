That's an interesting perspective. The time loop would then be a feat of dimensionalism and soul magic. I know the author Domagoj has a new (and largely unpopulated) world-building website that will eventually contain more details of the magic system and hopefully describes the nature of soul magic. I wouldn't be surprised if it works a lot like computer code, as you say. For the sanity of the gods and the creator of the Sovereign Gate, I hope the syntax of soul magic doesn't look like Assembly.
