The undead use enslaved souls as a mana source and dead flesh as a body. I assume this is because the body still has some affinity left for the mana generated by the captured soul. However, the soul can be powering up anything else (i.e. a ward scheme). In terms of versatility this is the best option. However, it is unethical.

A golem is a spell-formula-powered physical construct. They can be charged with mana, can use ambient mana and can utilize crystallized mana.

A simulacrum then would be a non-physical construct. The fiery vortices from battle for Sudomir's mansion are similar. As is homing missile: once spell pattern is formed with mana, the effect can go on it's own for some time. Simulacrum, presumably just takes this to the next level. Instead of a simple homing function it has some useful AI. The mana that is pumped into the simulacrum does not dissipate because it is already contained by a spell boundary. It is also possible that simulacrum is not charged with mana, but with spell-ammo instead, where the caster's soul does all the mana shaping work in advance.
