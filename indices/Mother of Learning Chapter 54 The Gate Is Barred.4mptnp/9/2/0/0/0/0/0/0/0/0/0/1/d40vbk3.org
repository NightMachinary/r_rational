You're right, the dragon could be a sophisticated golem. However, it seems reasonable that it can have some functions outsourced to souls, i.e. movement and remote control work just like in Zorian's golems, however it's reasonable to assume that the enegry source is a soul-trap or a direct feeding link to the big soul well.

  If you start with a corpse and then reanimate, then how do you have access to the soul?

I guess you just have to start with a living subject... Or set a soultrap in advance.

  At this point, it's speculation.

It's reasonable speculation when it comes to determining use cases for those options. Necromancy is technically great, but morally bankrupt. Golems are costly. Simulacra are cheap and disposable, but require a great amount of skill. This way each option has clearly defined advantages and weaknesses.
