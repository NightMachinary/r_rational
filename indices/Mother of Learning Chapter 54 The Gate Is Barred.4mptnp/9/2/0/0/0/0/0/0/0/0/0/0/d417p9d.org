  On that subject, how do undead work?
#+end_quote

Undead are golems that use souls as a substitute for an animation core. That makes them a lot cheaper and quicker/easier to make than regular golems. The soul has to be from a creature that had similar form to the body it is animating, so you can't use animal souls to animate humans. Likewise, you cannot use human souls to animate animals and other radically-different entities. Obviously, the quality of the animation is the highest if you have a soul that was originally matched to the body in question, but any human soul will do to animate most human bodies.

The soul also serves as a convenient power-source, which makes undead easier to use outside of magic-rich areas.

  If you start with a corpse and then reanimate, then how do you have access to the soul?
#+end_quote

The soul stays anchored to the body for a while after death, unless the body is totally/heavily destroyed. After a while, the soul moves on to the spiritual planes and is beyond the reach of necromancers. A necromancer needs access to the recently dead so they can capture their souls before they move on. Getting access to the dying in their last moments can be tricky, so most necromancers resort to producing their own recently deceased corpses (through killing).

  If a corpse is risen without being powered by a soul, is that just a flesh golem?
#+end_quote

Yes. Golems and undead are both animated constructs, with the main difference being what serves as their core.
