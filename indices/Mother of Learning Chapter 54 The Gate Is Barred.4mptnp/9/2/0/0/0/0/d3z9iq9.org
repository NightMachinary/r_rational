I read your post, and perhaps it is a misunderstanding on my part, but I do not belive you addressed the principal issue of how the marked souls are treated differently from the unmarked.

Zorian comments on this in Chapter 27:

#+begin_quote
  Zorian was quite sure that the time loop didn't pull back every soul back in time -- if that was the case, every mage would feel the difference after a dozen or so restarts as their shaping skills miraculously increased overnight. Plus, there are 'normal' necromantic killing spells that forcibly banish the soul from the body to kill people and Zorian had occasionally seen them in use during the invasion. If every person whose soul was banished from their body ended up dead at the start of the time loop, the number of inexplicable corpses showing up at the start of the time loop would have started to pile up quickly and everyone would have realized something was very wrong by the time Zorian was brought in. So all in all, *clearly the souls of regular people who were not time travelers weren't affected by anything that happened to them in previous time loops*.

For any theory to be plausible it must account for this effect.

We have been given a number of pieces of information on the function of souls and simulacra, though there are still ambiguities:

*Souls cannot be destroyed* (Chapter 27):

#+begin_quote
  Killing a soul was impossible. They could not be destroyed, only modified. Everyone said so -- the teachers, all the books he had read discussing the topic, Kael the amateur necromancer... hell, even the goddamn lich had said so in one of his offhand comments back when Zorian was first brought into the time loop.

*All entities with a soul possess personal mana; personal mana is used for casting magic* (Chapter 22):

#+begin_quote
  Personal mana was something that all things with a soul possessed in varying amounts, and it was attuned to the person producing it -- it bent easily to its creator's will, and was innately more malleable and controllable than anything else they might use to power their magic, since it never resisted the caster's efforts to shape it
#+end_quote

*Life force is a special type of personal mana that keeps the body living* (Chapter 51):

#+begin_quote
  life force was simply a special type of personal mana that wasn't part of a mage's mana pool and was used exclusively by the body to keep itself living and resist foreign magics. Since the amount of life force rarely varied much between humans, and couldn't be used to power spells, the academy instructors hadn't spoken much about it.
#+end_quote

*Personal mana turns into ambient mana within minutes of leaving its creator* (Chapter 39):

#+begin_quote
  "Shame it's only useful for powering items," Kael said. "Having some kind of personal mana battery would have been a nice way of side stepping your limited mana reserves. Have you looked into making such a thing? Even if it only lasted a few weeks, that should be enough to be useful in your circumstances."

  "Of course I've looked into it," Zorian scoffed. "It's impossible. Personal mana loses its affinity with its maker rapidly once expended, becoming indistinguishable from ambient mana in a matter of minutes."
#+end_quote

*Souls not only possess mana, but produce it and continue to do so even after death* (Chapter 48):

#+begin_quote
  Souls though... souls continued producing mana, even after death. It was what made them so valuable to spiritual entities like demons and was one of the reasons why undead were so much more convenient to use than golems.
#+end_quote

*Souls act a record for a living entity* (Chapter 51):

#+begin_quote
  "...souls are very mysterious things," Batak said seriously. "They have many functions, most of which we can't even understand, much less influence. But their most important function is not, as many mages believe, that they allow one to produce and shape mana. It is the fact they serve as a living, breathing records of everything a particular entity is."
#+end_quote

*Souls record the form of an entity's material body, and can be used as a template to create a new body* (Chapter 51):

#+begin_quote
  "The gods originally gave souls to living beings in order to record their thoughts and forms, so that their lives may be preserved after death and their deeds properly judged in the afterlife," Batak said. "For that reason, the gods, who had intimate knowledge of how souls worked, were capable of many miraculous things. So long as they had access to a person's soul, they could bring them back to life, even if their bodies have been reduced to ash and scattered into the winds. They could peer into their soul to examine their entire life from the moment they were born. They could restore a person's youth by regressing their forms to the state they once possessed. According to some stories, they could even create an identical copy of a person, indistinguishable from the original in every way."
#+end_quote

The most detailed description of a simulacrum comes from Zorian's observation of Red Robe's attack on the aranea (Chapter 26):

#+begin_quote
  But something was wrong, the sedatives didn't seem to have any effect on the robed man and many spells also failed to have any effect. Even stricken immobile, the man somehow managed to defend himself effectively, exploiting any openings to fire off strange purple beams that slew anyone they hit instantly. They were slow to cast and only targeted single opponents, so their losses were light, but it was still frustrating. Finally, one of the purple beams hit one of the human mercenaries and his companions lost their nerve, responding with a barrage of glowing lances that tore straight through the robed man's shield and impacted his chest.

  For a moment, the matriarch was afraid that they had killed the man, making all her preparations and plotting meaningless... but the reality turned out to be far worse than that. Instead of erupting into a shower of blood and gore, the robed man simply... turned into smoke.

  The opponent they had been fighting hadn't been the third time traveler in person. It had been merely an ectoplasmic shell infused with some of his skill and magic. A simulacrum, meant to test the waters and distract them.
#+end_quote

Note that Red Robe's simulacrum was not physically identical to a human: it was more resistant to certain types of attack and when severly damaged turned to smoke. Zorian describes it as "an ectoplasmic shell infused with some of his skill and magic", and seems to think this synonymous with "simulacrum". In Chapter 51 Batak specifically refers to "the simulacrum spell", strongly suggesting that "simulacrum" refers only to this specific technique, quite distinct from the gods' ability to "bring [a person] back to life, even if their bodies had been reduced to ash and scattered into the winds" (though nonetheless based on the same principle of using the soul as a recording device). Batak further describes the simulacrum spell as "sufficiently real that some have argued the use of the spell is inherently unethical", which appears to imply that though a simulacrum is a mere ectoplasmic shell it forms a replica of the original's mind and is capable of acting as an independent intelligent agent.

Batak's assertion that a simulacrum does not have a soul is not entirely consistent with other evidence. He says "the soul needs a body, even if it's just an ectoplasmic shell... but the body equally needs a soul", asserting that an ectoplasmic shell is an adequate substitute for a body as far as a soul is concerned yet implying that an ectoplasmic shell could not survive without life force from a soul.

That a simulacrum can perform magic strongly suggests it has access to personal mana. One possibility is that the simulacrum is temporary and has a finite reserve of personal mana that it is invested with when created. Zorian's decription of Red Robe's simulacrum as "infused with some of [RR's] skill and magic" supports this, but Zorian is not necessarily reliable and may be biased by the church's dogma. The simulacrum's store of personal mana would lose its affinity "within minutes", and that would dictate the lifetime of the simulacrum. Batak apparently expected Zorian to know of the spell and it is well known enough to be the topic of ethical discussions; if the spell had a lifetime of only a few minutes I think it would be limited to niche applications and be relatively unknown, which is apparently not the case.

If a simulacrum used ambient mana directly it could last longer but would be "harder to control" and "substantial, prolonged use [would result] in sickness and insanity". Red Robe's simulacrum posed a potent threat to the aranea and a force of battlemages; that it could have done so using ambient mana stretches the bounds of credibility.

The other possibility is that the simulacrum remains connected to its creator's soul, which provides it with a supply of personal mana for life force and casting of magic. Batak's assertion that a simulacrum does not have a soul could be interpreted as a combination of a simulacrum not having its /own/ soul and religious dogma. This would also imply that a soul is not strictly restricted to a single body, but can form connections over a distance. As the simulacrum has its own mind it would not be directly controlled by its creator, but it would share the same mana pool and other characteristics determined by the soul, such as shaping ability.

The Sovereign Gate does not appear to create simulacra (in the sense of an ectoplasmic shell) in its pocket dimension, rather it creates fully realised bodies in a manner more comparable to that described as within the gods' capabilities. Every person in the pocket dimension has a soul whether marked or not, this is observable; yet the unmarked souls reset at the end of the loop. I think the Sovereign Gate either has some mechanism by which it can create copies of souls (though this poses many problems) or it can somehow reset a soul back to an earlier state, which also seems implausible.
