  So my first thought to the problem of only one person leaving is that we might already have the answer to that- much like the Cyorian matriarch did, Zorian could bring Zach's memories with him, or at least put a packet in his head, etc.

This wouldn't be a complete solution, ideally you would want the soul, not just memories to be preserved. Knowledge is power, but there's a great deal to be said for a powerful magical core as well.

This brings up an interesting point: it appears the sovereign gate not only recreates the material world from a snapshot, but souls too, with the sole exception of those with the marker. This, along with the soul trap, implies that souls aren't quite extra-dimensional, but are tied to a specific material dimension or plane. Appropriate application of soul magic could perhaps be used to manually extricate a soul from the Gate's dimension and insert it in the real world.

If the copy of Zorian's soul from the Gate dimension were either sent back to the real world through some dimensional shenanigans or carried there physically in a soul trap, I think it would be reasonable for it to try to attach to his original body and successfully merge with his original soul. As Zorian did not enter the gate through the normal means this may be the only way for him to effectively "exit" the loop.

Soul magic may be a vital component of the solution in addition to dimensionalism. Even if dimensionalism proved successful, it could potentially lead to an interesting situation with two Zorians running around in the real world. Of course, this wouldn't be an issue if the younger Zorian had already died due to the invasion.
