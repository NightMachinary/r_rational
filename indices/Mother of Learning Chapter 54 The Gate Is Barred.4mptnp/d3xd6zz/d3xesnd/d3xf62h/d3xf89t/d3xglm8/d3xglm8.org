[[http://unsongbook.com/][Unsong]] is another serial ratfic that runs on exactly that brand of insane troll logic. It's catchphrase/arc words/major theme is "This Is Not A Coincidence Because Nothing Is Ever A Coincidence".

It's very good, especially if you like the Kabbalah-Punk aesthetic (as analogized with steampunk). Well researched, wonderful world building, and it somehow manages to be both a Douglas Adams or Terry Pratchett style parody while also being a rational fic.

My only major qualms with it are that the main characters are the more impulsive form of genius, as opposed to the chessmaster type characters who remember to look before they leap. They're good at finding their way out of tight spots in ways that get them into tighter spots. Also bad at realizing they might want to pause for a bit and really think their plans through.
