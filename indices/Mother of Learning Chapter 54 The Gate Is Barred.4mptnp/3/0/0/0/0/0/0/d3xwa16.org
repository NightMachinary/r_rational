There are other explanations for why the time loop shut down when the primordial was summoned. At that time there was another point of contact between the (accelerated) pocket dimension and some outside world. Maybe this interfered with the time dilation? It's mentioned repeatedly that in order to achieve high time dilation you have to isolate a part of space from the outside world.

What if each month is allocated a slice of real time, and with this additional point of contact time accelerated to the point that the time slice ended within seconds instead of weeks?
