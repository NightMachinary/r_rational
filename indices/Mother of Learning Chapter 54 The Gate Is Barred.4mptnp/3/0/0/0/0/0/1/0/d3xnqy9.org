On the basis of observations from within the loop, such as its timing, I agree that it is most likely the Gate was activated at the time the loop begins: the Gate takes a snapshot of the material plane upon its activation and uses that as a template for each reset.

However, in this scenario the Gate was activated before the invasion was visibly underway or the imminent primordial summoning known, so it apparently merely a coincidence that the activation of the gate is timed to effectively counter theses events.

The alternative is that there is a causal link between the invasion and primordial summoning and the activation of the Gate, that the Gate was activated specifically to counter these events. This seems less plausible on the basis of most of the evidence, but the likeliness of a causal linik is evidence all of its own.

Regardless of which scenario is correct, I think Zorian's speculation that the Gate would appear to be activated only for an instant is likely correct.
