Keeping it locked up is still dealing with it. The original commenter was wondering if it was a red herring, but my point was that it's obviously plot relevant no matter what occurs.

My guess is that all of the mana wells hold primordials. Either the primordials generate the excess mana coming out of them, or the naturally occurring wells (from the dragon below?) are needed to power the dimensional prison containing them. As the early Sarokian Highlands ward question told us, ambient mana is needed for more extensive wards. I can only imagine what a dimensional prison costs in terms of mana--I suppose it's possible that their own mana fuels it, or the gods themselves supply it.

Either mana origin would explain why you can't just absorb ambient mana directly--it basically comes from demons either way, and will corrupt you if you don't carefully purify it first.

It's possible Zorian will prevent the primordial from being released, but with the reveal of the massive mana battery/weapon as Iasku Manor, and all the focus Zorian has been putting into dimensional magic, he might figure out a way to re-imprison it.

  Even though, in the real world, the cultists will be able to summon demon hordes as per their original plan.

Zorian (or allied priests) will probably be able to summon Celestials to counter them. The gods may be gone, but their servants aren't.
