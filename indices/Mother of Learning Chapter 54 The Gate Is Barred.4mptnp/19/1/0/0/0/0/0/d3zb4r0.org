I just saw this quote on a forum:

#+begin_quote
  "You are shielding yourself from divinations," Red Robe said in his distorted voice. "Good. *At least you're smarter than that fool Zach.* Can you believe that even after all these decades in the time loop he still hasn't learned how to hide himself from the most childish of locator spells? You, on the other hand, have been in the time loop for, what? Three, four years? And you already know how to shield yourself from my soul perception."

  Zorian said nothing, trying to sink further into the crack he was hiding in and wracking his brains for a way to lose the man. It was fortunate that Kael had taught him how to shield himself from soul sight, because Red Robes was apparently a motherfucking necromancer!

RR knows to a limited degree who's who apparently. And has soul-sight.
