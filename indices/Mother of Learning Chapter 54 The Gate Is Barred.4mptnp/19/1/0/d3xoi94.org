You could be right. He met Zorian ~30 mins into loop SK+1. He had the upper hand and chased him, but being foiled waited for Zach to come to the settlement. That time he was forced to flee, so he ambushed Zach at the start of SK+2, forcing Zach to flee. Those were the only two times he could face Zach and be certain Zorian couldn't intervene. After that there was always the chance Zach had recruited Zorian during SK+2, so he left the loop.

Ok, I think it's much more likely he does have a marker but didn't want to risk another fight with a mind mage.
