Zorian's TODO list:

- Obtain as much information from the Guardian as possible - there should be a countdown until power runs out, at least.
- Find the people responsible for starting the loop in the first place - they should be in the loop and have the knowledge required. Actually, if this is an exact copy of the original, in the moment the spell was cast, those people should be casting the spell at the start of the loop.
- Find out a way how to exit the loop. Possibly brute-force your way out with dimensionalism
