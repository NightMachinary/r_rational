True. Though it would be more accurate to say they're in a state where they have /less/ of an incentive to screw each other. If Zorian were for example to work out how to mind magic Zach into being highly loyal, then he would have a much simplified path to money and power upon exiting the loops.

Not that I think Zorian would do that, or that he has that capability, but it is still an incentive and Zach certainly doesn't know the full extent of Zorian's powers.
