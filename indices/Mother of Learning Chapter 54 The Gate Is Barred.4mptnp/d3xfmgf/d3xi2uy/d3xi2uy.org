except that xvim never hated zorian. the only reason he was making him do boring shaping exercises every restart was because he couldn't remember making zorian do boring shaping exercises in previous ones. once zorian becomes more skilled at shaping, each new loop after that has xvim trying to find out how skilled zorian actually is, because remember he didn't remember it from the previous loops. Eventually, zorian's shaping skills are so good that xvim ends up thinking that zorian is an imposter, and that's the first time zorian tries to explain the time loop to him. agree that red robe is a prominent character that we already know of. it would probably have had to be someone who had the chance to steal Zach's memories of how he entered the loop and how to use it, as well as getting a soul marker of his own. I doubt it's the caretaker of the novedas, because we haven't even seen that guy yet. early in the story, each loop would start with Zach beating up his caretaker and then running away, or at least that's what i remember being said.

so what recurring character would have a reason to manipulate the ibasan invaders?

quatach-ichl's spell cast early on seems to be responsible for bringing zorian into the time loop, but we don't see him cast that spell on anyone else with them. whatever happened to bring red robe into the time loop should depend on this spell. maybe red robe is a remote controlled construct of quatach-ichl himself. when he cast the spell, he clearly wasn't aware of the time loop, and probably thought Zach was a soul mage. whatever quatach-ichl did must have

1. included both him and zorian into the time loop with Zach
2. altered Zach's soul, or added something to it.
3. copied Zach's soul marker to both himself and to Zorian
4. without knowing about the time loop

This also would explain red robes connection to the ibasan invaders. he was with them all along, but when he found out the true nature of the loop, he was more concerned with escaping the loop then using it to increase his power, because zorian made him think there were many time travelers, and he had already proven that his invasion plan would work in zorian's first loop, provided that zorian and Zach can't follow him out.
