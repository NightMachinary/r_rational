I'm working purely of my own Google-fu here, but they seem to be called [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterizationTags][Characterization Tags]]. Fanlore is [[http://fanlore.org/wiki/!][pretty unhelpful]] on the 'why' bit, and other than that, there's an [[/r/OutOfTheLoop]] [[https://m.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/1qqsgy/where_did_the_convention_of_putting_an/][thread]] from just under a year ago that's mostly just the one commenter copy/pasting from the sites I just linked.
