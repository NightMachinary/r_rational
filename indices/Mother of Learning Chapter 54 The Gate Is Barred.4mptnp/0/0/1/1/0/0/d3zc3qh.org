What was he supposed to do, stay behind and increase his chances of failure on the off-chance that the code is bugged? He thought he was fighting multiple time loopers, at least one who was a better mind mage than he and one who could beat him in single combat half the time. And he thought there were more than two of them. Running is completely sensible under those circumstances. In order to get better odds from staying he needs to beat down and successfully mind-wipe a whole lot of people without them committing suicide or losing even once.

Running has better odds. The fact that random chance conspired to make the 10% chance crop up instead of the 90% chance does not mean that he made the wrong choice with the information he had.
