Maybe he thought he was stronger than Zach? If he won without Zach committing suicide then he'd know exactly how many enemies he has to face and be able to remove one of them from play (by wiping Zach's memories and thus crippling his magical ability for a long time). He could then make decisions based on knowing how many others there are and who they are.

Alternatively, if Zach was the centrepiece going around re-implanting people's memories into them every loop like what was happening with Spear of Resolve, then removing him would basically remove the other loopers as a threat.

Attacking Zach isn't a terrible move in certain world-states, though it's one hell of a risk in others.
