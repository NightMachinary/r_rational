To be fair, the only reason why more than one person can leave (I assume the story isn't going to end with the time loop running out of power and Zach/Zorian dying) is because "don't implode with the user inside" was given higher priority than "implode when user leaves."

Considering how bugged to hell the entire system has become there was no reason to believe that this would be the case.
