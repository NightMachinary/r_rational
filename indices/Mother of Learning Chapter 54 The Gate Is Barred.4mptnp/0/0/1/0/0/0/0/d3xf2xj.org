Yep. After he killed the spiders he probably had a cold shower and then realized he had zero way of knowing if he killed all the travelers or not.

Then he'd realize at some point they'll figure out only one of them can escape and everything will go FUBAR if even one of them leaves before the others.

So I'm pretty sure his escape was literally panic running, maybe even a few hours after he killed the spiders and Zorian off.
