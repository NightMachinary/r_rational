As far as i can tell, the gate IS active in-loop, since we just saw Zorian interact with it, and its purpose in loop is to be the bridge back to the main world. The researchers are just incapable of noticing it.

Also we don't know for sure that the researchers were part of the group that activated the gate in the main timeline.
