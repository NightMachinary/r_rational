There's probably a way to identify him in the time loop anyway.

There was something off about the current chapter. In the real world the sovereign gate was successfully activated. In the parallel world, the researcher was saying that "I had high hopes that the upcoming planetary alignment and the resulting amplification of dimensional magic might be the key to getting it work, but no such luck."

So they think it's impossible to activate the gate, even though it happened in the real world. What changed? One possibility is that RR is missing and was the person who provided the missing pieces in the real world.

Even if it is something else, there is probably a lot of information to be gained here about the start of the time loop.
