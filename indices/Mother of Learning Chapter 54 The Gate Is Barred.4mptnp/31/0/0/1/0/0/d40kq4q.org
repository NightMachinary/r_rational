Hmm. I think the coin wouldn't work so easily in a different context. After Zorian intervened and burned the vampire, whom Quatach-Ichl hated, and Quatach-Ichl casually announced an obligation to hunt him down to satisfy his superiors, Zorian offered to bribe him. In that specific context, QI's reaction was to catch the coin. But if you just randomly threw it at him, he'd probably treat it - rightly - as a threat, and shield himself from it.
