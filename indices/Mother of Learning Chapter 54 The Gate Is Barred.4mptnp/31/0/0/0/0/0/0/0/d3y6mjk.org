The point is, he has good chances of not going down peacefully. Zorian and Zach, however skilled they are, are not gods. They don't know who Red Robe is. They exit the loop, they wake up in their bodies, and then what? Their best bet is probably to spy on Quatach-Ichl, since Red Robe is likely to approach him with invasion-related information, but that isn't easy at all. If that doesn't work, Red Robe could spend an arbitrary amount of time staying low, commiting unseen atrocities, selling classified information to Eldemar's enemies, building dead man's switches, and so on.

Of course, that's assuming Red Robe won't do a stupid/smart thing and check on Zach at the star of the End.
