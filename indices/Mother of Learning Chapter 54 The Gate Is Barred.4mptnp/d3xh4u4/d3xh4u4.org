Zach really sounds so naive, I'm not sure but it would have been nice to mind read him before he understood the full capabilities of Zorian's magic. Good thing Red Robe isn't that great at mind magic, it would be really nasty if he implanted some dangerous compulsion on Zach triggered by someone learning of him or trying to attack him.

I so wish I could have the matriarch's mind magic. Just thinking of the possibilities, implanting compulsions to work harder and focus better, create algorithms to automatically detect bias or emotional issues... mind magic truly is subtle yet extremely powerful.

Please don't make it like that. This story has been doing great without any unnecessary romance so far!
