You don't need to hope, because you just need to read more closely...

  It was currently the second day on his self-imposed rest, and he was lying on his bed, reading a rather silly piece of fiction dealing with time travel. It was a book about a man who went three years back into the past to prevent a devastating war and save his lost love. The story was more amusing than Zorian thought it would be when he started reading it, but that was probably just him - the story was supposed to be a romance, not a comedy, it's just that he personally couldn't take it very seriously.

  The time travel spell was powered by love, of all things - what kind of magic was that?
