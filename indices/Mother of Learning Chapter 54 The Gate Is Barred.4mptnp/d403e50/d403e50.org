Man, what a whammer. Unlike the end of Arc 1 though, this time Zorian isn't completely cornered; there's a clear way forward in the form of the Key that the matriarch spoke of, so it definitely felt more anticipatory than despairing at the conclusion of the Arc.

About the last chapter, did anyone else notice that Zach's curb-stomping of the aranean webs were kinda foreshadowed? Novelty says it in [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/23/Mother-of-Learning][chapter 23]] - that "any mage powerful enough to cast [Mind Blank] is also powerful enough to take on the entire aranean Web all on their lonesome". Which is pretty much what ended up happening.

Also...recently I started throwing in my lot with the "Red Robe is Veyers Boranova" theory. While it's true that Daimen is most likely to be Red Robe in terms of opportunity, having found /something/ in Koth that most likely relates to the Sovereign Gate - he has no motive. He's an adventuring archaeologist, what does he gain from burning Cyoria to the ground? And if he wants to improve himself and keep all that skill once the time loop is done, he doesn't need to come all the way to Cyoria to do it.

Veyers, on the other hand, I've come to realize recently fits the psychological profile of Red Robe surprisingly well. Aside from that "possible fallen noble" thing discussed on chapter 50:

- Veyers was "an asshole" and seems to have a short temper; this fits in with his rough, perhaps even reckless personality displayed (that line he shouted at Quatach-Ichl, for example - "Watch it! That could have killed him! I told you I need him alive!").
- Veyers didn't get to move on to third year of the Academy, implying he's not a very good mage; this explains not just the fact that Red Robe isn't all that competent (crude control of mind magic; relatively unimpressive showing vs Zorian, vs Zach, and vs throwaway students in chapter 26; being clearly treated as a grunt by Quatach-Ichl), but that he's desperate to use the time loops to improve himself in a way he never would ordinarily have (probably blood magic, at the very least improving his physical strength, as well as his quick exit as soon as he realized he no longer had control over the course of things).

If Veyers and Zach even failed out "together", before the time loops started, that might even explain why Zach was hanging out with "Red Robe" at first and why he was in such a good position to backstab Zach.

Though of course, there's still a few unexplained bits. Like whether Veyers actually failed the certification exam before being expelled - the story wasn't explicit on that, though that might still make him desperate to gain a future as a mage if he was barred from any other mage academies. And how he even entered the time loop to begin with, since Zorian's entry should be virtually impossible to repeat, and only now did Zorian and Zach learn about the "admin" feature of the Sovereign Gate.
