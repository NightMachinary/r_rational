That's assuming the loop recreates their souls every restart. It's entirely possible that the time loop simply shunts everyone's souls from the original reality into the time loop, then shunts them back into their bodies.

If the loop does create entirely new souls each restart, then what happens to the souls at the end of every restart . . . ? Supposedly, the souls are not destroyed, but who knows? Maybe the souls are just released into the ether except for the souls of Zorian and Zach.
