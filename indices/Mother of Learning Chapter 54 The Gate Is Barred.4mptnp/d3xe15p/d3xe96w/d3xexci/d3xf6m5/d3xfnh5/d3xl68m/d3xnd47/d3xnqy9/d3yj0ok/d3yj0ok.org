I think you're onto something when you say that they got lucky with the Gate timing - although it wasn't coincidence, either, because the same planetary alignment powers the two phenomena.

This sheds more light on the legend about living '11 lifetimes'. Ordinarily, I think you're supposed to get more than a month in the simulation. But just like there's a failsafe to restart it if the Controller gets killed, I'd say that it auto-restarts if anything tries to connect the pocket dimension to another one. So the Primordial summoning trips the reset switch.

Maybe, if they can prevent the summoning (since Red Robe is now absent!), then they will have a much longer restart, with enough time to travel overseas and hunt down the Key?
