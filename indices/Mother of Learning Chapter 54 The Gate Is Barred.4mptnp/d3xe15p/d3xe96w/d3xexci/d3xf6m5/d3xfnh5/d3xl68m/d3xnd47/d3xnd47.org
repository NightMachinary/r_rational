I find it more likely that the Gate was activated at the beginning of the month. That way, it was a copy of the world exactly as it was upon activation. Also, Zorian talked about how this time loop is essentially an extremely accelerated pocket dimension, in which fraction of seconds will have passed in the real world while decades and centuries could have passed in the dimension. This would make no sense if the Gate was activated at the end of the month. (Although I will admit that this explanation was mostly informed speculation on Zorian's part.)
