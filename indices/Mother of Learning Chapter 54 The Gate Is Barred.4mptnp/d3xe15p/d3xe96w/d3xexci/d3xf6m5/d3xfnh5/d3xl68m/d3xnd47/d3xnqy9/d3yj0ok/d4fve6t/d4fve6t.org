Further evidence that stopping the summoning will extend the restart:

In chapter 6, where Zorian is just becoming accustomed to the restarts, he's not making any big ripples and Zach is out of the picture (presumably unconscious), and Zorian repeatedly confirms that the restart ends at "2 past midnight" (probably 0:02am, although theoretically it could mean 2:00am). Yet in chapter 40, when Red Robe has abandoned the invaders and Zorian is helping to defend against them, it lasts until 2:39am.

So, the reset time is not a fixed point. And from chapter 52, we know that summoning the primordial triggers a reset, and that with no help from Red Robe, no demon support, plans thrown out of whack, not at the peak of the planar alignment, and the city being somewhat prepared, the invaders were still powerful enough to complete the summoning. So we can presume that, if Zach and Zorian don't interfere, then the summoning will succeed every time, which would explain why the reset is so consistent.
