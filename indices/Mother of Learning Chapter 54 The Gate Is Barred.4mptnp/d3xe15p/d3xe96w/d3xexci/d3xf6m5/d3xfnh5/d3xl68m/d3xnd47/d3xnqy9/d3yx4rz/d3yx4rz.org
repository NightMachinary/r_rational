The causal link would be the planar alignment. Major acts of dimensional magic---summoning a primordial, using the Gate---are most likely to occur during this period.

The only issue with this concept is that I would expect the Gate to be activated at the end of the month rather than at the beginning because presumably, it's the end of the month when the planar alignment occurs. However, it may be that the entire period surrounding the planar alignment allows these kinds of dimensional feats, rather than only the last night of the month.
