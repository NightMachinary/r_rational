That's a terrible plan. Don't get me wrong: it's a creative solution and mechanically might be viable, but if plan A is "dimension hop through a primordial's pocket dimension into the late stages of an invasion which is supported by a time traveller" it might be time for a new plan.

The idea that the primordial could be permanently destroyed by trapping it in the Sovereign Gate's pocket dimension is interesting. That might be viable even if the primordial's dimension isn't used as the exit point. Even with both Zorian and Zach acting together it may still be difficult, perhaps verging on impossible, to prevent the primordial summoning in the real world with Red Robe acting in opposition. In that case it would be quite valuable to be able to render the primordial unable to be released even if the ritual is completed.

I wonder, too, why exactly it appears the pocket dimension resets when the primordial summoning completes. One explanation is that the Sovereign Gate's original activation was somehow tied to that event, that it was activated specifically to stop the summoning and if the summoning occurs in simulation, that loop is of no further value and is terminated. Alternatively, the primordial may trigger some sort of failsafe in the gate and it will always reset rather than allowing the primordial to enter. Such a failsafe could be due to either the primordial threatening the stability of the Gate's pocket dimension or for the risk posed to the Gate's controller by the primordial. If this is the case then such a safety mechanism would have to be disabled before your plan in any form could be implemented.

There is another factor to consider: if the gate was activated in the real world in response to the primordial summoning (perhaps by Zach), then Zach and Zorian exiting the gate through the normal mechanism would put them in a destroyed Cyoria with a primordial on the loose a mere instant after the Gate's activation relative to the real world's timestream. It may be that the primordial is no longer in its pocket dimension and can't be summoned into the Gate's dimension even if the time loop did not reset.
