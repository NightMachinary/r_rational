If they can get the alternate dimension to not immediately destroy itself as soon as the rift to the Primordial's dimension is open, then they might be able to enter the Primordial's dimension after it leaves, trapping themselves there and the Primordial in the alternate one, which will self-destruct at the end of the month anyways (potentially permanently killing the Primordial), and the two of them will get summoned at the end of the month by the invaders in the real world. Although that would still mean that most of the people they know will die in the real world in the invasion, if Red Robes participates. Added to that is the fact that the invaders would actually be able to summon a lot of nasty creatures like they originally intended, and which is impossible for them to do during the time loop.
