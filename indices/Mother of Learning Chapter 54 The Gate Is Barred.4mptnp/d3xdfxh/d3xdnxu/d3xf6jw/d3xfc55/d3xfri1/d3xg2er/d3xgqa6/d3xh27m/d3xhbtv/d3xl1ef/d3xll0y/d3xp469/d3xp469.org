Eeeh, its ok, with this flag its just her brother anyway. People in fiction towards its end tend to be perfectly ok with any sorts of prior maltreatment if it is familial for unknown reasons ;) And you shouldn't judge someone based on their association either, much less based on the race of said association (seriously, that lich has never done anything bad to our knowledge now has it!?) :P

Btw, wasn't Zorians best friend that annoying guy who we only saw for a very few chapters rather than Zach? Or am I thinking of another novel now?
