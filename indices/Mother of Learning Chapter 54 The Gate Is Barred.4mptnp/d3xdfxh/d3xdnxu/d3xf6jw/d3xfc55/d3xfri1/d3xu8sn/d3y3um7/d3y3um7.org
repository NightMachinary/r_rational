If Zorian and Zach exit the loop they will enter the real world a nanosecond after RR has. If getting rid of the marker takes longer than ten minutes needed for the detection ritual (and it should), then Zorian should be able to detect RR's whereabouts at least once. From there RR's identity could be investigated.
