That really depends on how the time-loop works. The soul-killed aranea showed us that souls are necessary for life, so everyone in the loop definitely has a soul. So, does the loop recreate the souls at the beginning of the loop and then let the souls drift into the ether afterward? Does the loop grab all the souls from the real world, use them in the loop, wiping them clean each restart so no one maintains memories/abilities?

One definite possibility is that when Red Robe left the loop, his soul left the loop. Now, whenever his body is recreated, he is just a soulless husk.
