I think RR's motivation to leave the loop was twofold: one, he was concerned about mind/soul magic endangering him, and two, he figured that with other time-travellers running around making changes, his efforts to fine-tune the invasion were mostly pointless. He quit while he was ahead and /thought/ that in doing so, he would erase the others.
