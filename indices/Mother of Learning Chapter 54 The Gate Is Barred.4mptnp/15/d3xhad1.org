I feel like this explains some questions:

The reason why RR never used the "soulkill" on the others is because the loop prevents you from doing it on yourself. Just in case you do it by accident, it'll prevent you from rendering the time loop pointless.

The reason why Zorian never sensed RR through the soul marker is because RR wasn't in the pocket dimension anymore.
