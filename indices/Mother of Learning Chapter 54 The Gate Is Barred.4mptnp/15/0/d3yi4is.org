I'm pretty sure that the only reason RR didn't soulkill them is because he didn't get a good chance to. After he attacked Zorian, and Zorian blew himself up, RR had a whole restart to worry about how many loopers there were, and what kind of mind magic they might have (one of his real weaknesses). Plus, there was no point in further experiments on the invasion, since he knew that those other loopers were disrupting his plans - which he figured would not be relevant to making the invasion work on the outside. I reckon that's when he decided to get himself to the Gate and quit while he was ahead.
