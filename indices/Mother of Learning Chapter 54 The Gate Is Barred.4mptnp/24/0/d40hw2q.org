I always thought Veyers Boranova theory was mentioned ironically, but you make a good case that it /is/ a possibility. Looking at Soulkill:

- Quatach-Ichl calls RR a whelp, so it's possible RR is young.
- As you said, RR's aegis was overpowered by several students. When Zorian was holding combat training sessions with his classmates, I don't think his aegis would have had that problem, or maybe just barely. If RR were a competent mage in his forties, I can't see that happening.
- After arguing with Quatach-Ichl, RR tries to read Zach's mind, but Zach punches him in the face. RR's response is rather infantile, slamming Zach's head repeatedly into the ground. Even QI comments on it.
- RR seems familiar enough with Zach to call him a fool for not making better use of the time loop. There might be history/a rivalry between the two.
- RR is described as way too strong for his build. This just might mean he's ridiculously strong for a person, or it might mean that RR is a smallish person---Zach and Zorian's age?
