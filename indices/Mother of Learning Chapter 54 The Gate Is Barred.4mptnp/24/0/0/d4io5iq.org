Or a competent mage who has been looping (much) longer than Zorian. Yeah, this isn't someone who has been diligently practising their magic in every restart.

Furthermore, this is someone who thinks it's worthwhile to keep optimising the invasion over and over /even though they don't have demon support and even though Zach is changing things and so the real thing will be quite different/, and also even though it's already brilliantly successful, and the primordial summoning will make other property damage irrelevant. Why would he do that, instead of focusing primarily on reconnaisance, or better yet, personal development? Perhaps because he's bitter and twisted and enjoys watching Cyoria burn as thoroughly as possible every month?

And Boranova is a Noble House. Zorian has already discovered that some (not all) Houses might be glad to see Cyoria gone, because it's such a strong supporter of the Crown.

/And/ when RR was directing the artillery spells, he targeted the /empty/ third-year academy residence building (not exactly a tactically important target) /in the first barrage/. Grudge against the academy, perhaps? "You wouldn't let me into this building, so watch what I'll do to it!"
