  If Veyers and Zach even failed out "together", before the time loops started
#+end_quote

I guess I didn't fully explain my thought on that though, since if this actually happened Zach would've needed to somehow be re-admitted to the academy before the school year starts. It'd look unusual, but probably wouldn't be hard with Zach being an archmage at this point.

Not that I know how valid the possibility might be. I just wanted to speculate a possible point of commonality that might have brought on an association between Zach and Veyers, if they didn't have any before.
