  Veyers didn't get to move on to third year of the Academy, implying he's not a very good mage

There may be more to it than this. He didn't fail his certification; he was /expelled/, after a /disciplinary hearing/. And Zorian thought to himself things like, "it seemed there were some things that just couldn't be overlooked, even if you were an heir of Noble House Boranova" and "it was a disgrace they hadn't expelled him sooner."

Therefore, Veyers Boranova did something reprehensible. And something serious, because political influence and wealth weren't enough to rescue him from expulsion. This could fit with the fact that RR practises both necromancy and mind magic.
