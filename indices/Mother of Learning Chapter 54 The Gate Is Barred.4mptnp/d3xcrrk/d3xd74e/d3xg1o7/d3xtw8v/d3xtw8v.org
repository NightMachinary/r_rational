See, what you're consistently forgetting (or intentionally ignoring for lulz) with your obsession with that girl and her bicycle is that the episode was /brought up a second time/ several chapters later. /That/ is what made it likely to be a Chekhov's Gun. I'm sure if we scoured the story for irrelevant episodes, we'd find scores that are not brought up again, and haven't "discharged" (yet) as Checkov's Guns, and probably won't.

Also I think what you call "Chekhov's PTSD" (presumably, seeing Chechov's Guns in everything) is called [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTrees][Epileptic Trees]] in TvTropes terminology.
