Couple things to contemplate: The time loop didn't shut down after the controller left. Was that because the designer didn't bother to shut it down, or that it /couldn't/ be shut down that easily?

The Soul Kill spell - there's a direct link that the creator of the time loop had considered the safety of the controller. Which means very bad things if we consider barring the gate as not something natural but rather /artificially included by the creator as a safety./
