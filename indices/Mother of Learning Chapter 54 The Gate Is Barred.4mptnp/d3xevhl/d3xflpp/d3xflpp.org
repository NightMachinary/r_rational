  The time loop didn't shut down after the controller left. Was that because the designer didn't bother to shut it down, or that it couldn't be shut down that easily?

Nah, it's just programming stuff: the trigger to shut down the loop is when "there is no Conrtrollers left inside", not when "a Controller leaves". I can actually see a few reasons to make that trigger instead of the other, but in general, they are identical for intended use of the Gate, so there doesn't have to be an actual reason for the choice of a trigger.
