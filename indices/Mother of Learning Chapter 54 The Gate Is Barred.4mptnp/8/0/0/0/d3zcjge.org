Time to fold that tinfoil hat in half and put it away again. Zorian knows what Zachs soul marker looks like and has the power to track it with a spell. Therefore Zorian can trivially confirm that Zach is not RR.

Also that's not what fundamental attribution error refers to. fundamental attribution error refers to choices and actions, not levels of competency, and is certainly not a multi-use clause to ignore any inconvenient evidence in a character's actions. You would need to then posit that RR allowed himself to be mind-fucked by a mind mage /one purpose/ as part of a hideously complicated plan with a high chance of failure.
