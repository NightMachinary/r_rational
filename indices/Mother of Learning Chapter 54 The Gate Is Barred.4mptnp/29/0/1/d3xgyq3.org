I'd like to think that I've got at least a semi-fair chain of logic here. Enough to move me out of "wild guess" range (where I would put Damien) and within spitting distance of "a preponderance of evidence."

Any guess will be a reach, even the right one. There would be too many red herrings and false leads. It's just that kind of story.

What, specifically, do you disagree with?
