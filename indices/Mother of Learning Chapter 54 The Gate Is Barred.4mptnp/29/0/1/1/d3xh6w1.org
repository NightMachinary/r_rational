You do know if red robe was Xvim, he would have had Zorian tailed since the first couple restarts. He had himself seen Zorian wild progress through the restarts and he would've done something at the very least. Any way you can explain why Xvim didn't outright deal with Zorian right away or tailed him? I doubt Zorian is the first to join the loop so he could've done the very same thing he did to the arachne but not before mindwiping Zorian.
