I'm going to make a prediction.

The fact that red robe is anonymous, to me, means that he very definitely is someone we have met. That, coupled with the fact that no one is "missing," indicates to me a high likelihood that the time loop has been recreated each time with an "ignorant" version of red robe (whoever he is).

As far as I can tell, there's only one person with whom Zorian has recently started interacting with in-depth. Someone powerful. Someone immune to mind magic (for no discernable plot-based reason). Someone who's expressions would indicate that he seemed to HATE Zorian in the past, but whom had recently, suddenly, and almost inexplicably become friendly. And it happened almost immediately after Red Robe disappeared.

I said it back when I first read the chapter that had Red Robe in it. I had no idea how it would be possible, but it fit the plot structure too perfectly.

"Somehow," I had said, "Red Robe is Xvim."

(Edit: Just reread the relevant chapters - starts at 39. It fits, but only if you assume that for some reason Red Robe delayed exiting for a few loops. Or there's some other explanation for the slight delay in Xvim's change of character. I can think of several explanations, and this is the kind of story that would have one or two little twists to throw off its intended audience.)
