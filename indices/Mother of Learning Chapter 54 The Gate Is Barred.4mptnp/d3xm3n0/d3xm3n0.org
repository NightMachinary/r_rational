Standing by my theory [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4ji3zc/rt_hf_mother_of_learning_chapter_53_phantoms/d37bixc][RR = Tesen Zveri]]. Although I'm less confident he is using the memory packet method, I'm still not sold on his having a marker. He was sighted the two loops after SoulKill, then gone. He knew during those two there were more time travellers but never did the simple ritual to find Zorian? He contended himself with attacking them both in the settlement, then Zach at home the next loop, then apparently just left?

I stand by my assertion RR is a crappy mage, only his loop override spells are any good, which points to memory packets.

In this chapter we learned he gave the crown the sov gate, and it sounds like more than a month ago(inspections are routine etc.).
