The security for the time magic research facility is pretty hilarious. Love to learn abit more about the purpose of the research. Somehow Zorian missed gathering information of the gate from both researcher, i mean they both studied the artifact for a long time prolly would have some knowledge on the artifact.

On the other note, i'm so looking forward to the worldbuilding post coming up. A friendly advise on how to start the ball rolling is with the class -> teachers -> curriculum -> school before expending out. This helps adding flavor to story's characters with will make the character more relatable. It would also give us a clearer view of Cyorian's formal education and how it's cirriculum was being taught.
