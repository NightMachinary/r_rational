Treasure hunt seems imminent! Ring, crown, staff, orb, dagger...

So, this might be a silly assumption, but... does anyone else think that the crown mentioned is the one Quatach-Ichl is wearing?

  Encased in gold-decorated armor, with a scepter held tightly in one of its skeletal hands and *a crown full of purple gemstones*, the creature looking like some long-dead king risen from the dead.

Time to go hunting for other possible Chekov's guns...

Staff: Lots to look for, none that stick out in my mind. Unless the lich's scepter counts as well? 2 for the price of one?

Ring: Chapter 8:

  "I wonder what's keeping the saplings confined to that ring of trees," wondered Zorian aloud. "This meadow should be a copse of trees by now.

  Zach blinked. "I never thought about that," he admitted. "You notice the strangest things, Zorian."

I think that might have some potential, but I'd prefer an actual physical ring. Haslush has a metal ring that converts alcohol to plain sugar - not exactly an artifact fit for an emperor.
