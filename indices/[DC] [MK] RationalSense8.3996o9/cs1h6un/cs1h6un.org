Try for a polyamorous relationship immediately. You are going to be living with these people having access to your mind for the rest of your life. So try for the best possible connection.

Focus on specialization. If all skills can be shared then figure out what you are better at learning than everyone else in the group and learn it. Of course if it turns out that a skill can be enhanced to superhuman level by having more than one person independently learning it, then there should be an overlap of at least two (or more depending on how skills scale up with number of people) people knowing the same important abilities.

If everyone focuses on learning the same thing at the same time, then skills should be acquired very quickly. More so if it's things like combat where the group can 'see' both sides of a fight. This translates to better problem solving.

Since there's a telepathic connection, it can be abused for whenever information needs to get from one part of the world to another very quickly without anyone else outside of the group being able to intercept it.

Sorry I don't have anymore ideas since I haven't seen the show. Thanks for the interesting thought exercise.
