It's called Worm/Parahumans. Amazing read, if you're into smart, realistic characters in a smart, realistic world. Although the character isn't a rationalist, but some of the ideas she comes up with are amazing, and almost every single character arc is amazing and lands perfectly. One of my favourite stories of all time. And it's available free.
