honestly, I would not consider the superhero genere to be 'real world'. superhero and supernatural are settings that take place in an approximation of the real world, and keeping the mundane part of the world 'normal' really prevents them from being rational. the moment things get properly rational, you start moving away from the real world very quickly.
