Rationalists in the real world tend to be people who talk about reproducible research, programmers, or people who talk about reproducible research who are also programmers. Not the most exciting basis for a sizzling novel.

Kidding aside, I think the problem is that rationality is only mildly useful in the real world. Most people get by fine with hand-me-down heuristics and rationalists have to treasure every moment their self-training actually helps them. If this were otherwise, the world would be run by rationalists, which it most certainly is not.
