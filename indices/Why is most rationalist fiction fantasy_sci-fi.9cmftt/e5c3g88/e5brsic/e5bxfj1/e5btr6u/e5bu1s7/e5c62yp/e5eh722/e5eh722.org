A fantastic setting helps remove real-world baggage. This makes it easier to explore the heart of a philosophical dilemma.

Let's say I want to explore the idea of bail. Bail lets us free some factually innocent defendants defendants. But it means that some number of innocent people will be victimized by factually guilty defendants.

You could do this story in real-world Baltimore. Maybe the city is considering some bail-setting algorithm. The problem with real-Baltimore is that real-Baltimore is profoundly corrupt and racist. So, to anyone who's familiar with Baltimore can side-step the philosophical dilemma and just say that, no, obviously you don't let corrupt racists use opaque algorithms in their judicial system.

Re-write this into a fantasy setting, and we can rule out the non-philosophical objections. The algorithm isn't closed-source nonsense from a corrupt company; it's a spell with a precisely known failure rate. The king isn't a closeted racist; he's a dragon who hates all bipeds equally.
