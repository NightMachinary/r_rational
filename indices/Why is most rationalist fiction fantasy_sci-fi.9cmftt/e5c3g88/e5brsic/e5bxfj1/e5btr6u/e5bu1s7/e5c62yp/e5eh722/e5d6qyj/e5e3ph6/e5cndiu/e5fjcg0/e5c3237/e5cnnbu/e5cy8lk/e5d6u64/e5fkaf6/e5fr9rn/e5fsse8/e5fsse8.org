Depends on how you define "run the world", really. In as complex a society as we have right now, even the most powerful person holds probably a ridiculously small amount of sway over the whole thing. Sure, compared to us commoners, we may feel that a President or a CEO (forget Kings and Queens, most of those are blatantly just for show at this point) can take grand decisive actions. And in some cases, yes, some of them might find themselves taking potentially history-steering decisions. However, being able to take action and being able to control the consequences of that action are two very different things. Human society is like a massive enraged bull that is launched in a crazy run with too much momentum to be steered in a single sharp turn. A lot of processes are so big, no single decision or action can affect them. I think if we really had a full picture we'd find out that the world really isn't ruled by anyone in particular; people do things for their own purposes but most of the time it's the unintended consequences that dominate the results.

So, yeah, there are less-known powerful people, in fields outside of politics, that are probably leveraging more rational skills (though social skills are still very important for them to reach those positions). But even them probably don't hold as much power as we might think.
