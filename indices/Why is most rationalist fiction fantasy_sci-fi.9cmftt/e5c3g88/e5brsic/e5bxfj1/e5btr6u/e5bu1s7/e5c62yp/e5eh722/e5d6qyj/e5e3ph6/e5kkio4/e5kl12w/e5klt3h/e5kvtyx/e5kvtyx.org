If you liked metropolitan man, then you'd like most star wars rationalist fiction. The Sith are just human force users, but evil. Essentially a person, but with precognition, telekinesis, mind control, and a whole host of other powers, dedicated to increasing their power at all costs. Given that you didn't know what a Sith is, I think you'd actually like most rationalist fiction, once learned what they were about :)
