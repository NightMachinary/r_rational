Anything is possible, but I don't think it would be easy to do. To invent an example pitch:

So far as I know there's no such town as Hiram Missouri, so we could make up whatever details we want.

But, genre convention is that made up towns are assumed to be typical for their region, just like made up people are assumed to be normal (read: not secretly dragons or something)

So, I could assert that no one in Hiram Missouri is racist. Maybe the prosecutor is ONLY upset about an online dispute about crypto currency.

But readers are going to go into the story looking at things via a racial angle, because that's our expectation for how that conflict would play out in that region.

To some extent, my very premise would be taken as apologetics for actual-Missouri. And this would make it hard for people to get into the story.

I'd be better off just saying that its a corrupt sherrif who arrested an elf
