Not all rational fiction is about finding exploits in the world the story is set in.

Aside from that though, you can put the main character in unusual circumstances where they have choices to make that don't generally come up for most people. I can easily imagine a rational Pride and Prejudice kind of story or even a rational Dan Brown style thriller.
