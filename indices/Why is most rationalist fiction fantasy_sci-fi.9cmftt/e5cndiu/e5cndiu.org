I wrote a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7mvsux/d_rationalist_fiction_that_takes_place_in_the/][post about this]] a while back. My opinions remain mostly the same.

I think rationalist fiction in the real world is trickier to write, but still could be pulled off in an interesting and satisfying way. It needs to have the right sort of scope and setup. For example, I have a real-world rationalist story in mind that revolves around some high school kids trying to navigate a thorny personal moral dilemma in which simply going to the authorities or telling parents is not obviously the correct solution. If I ever get around to writing it, I think I can make it sufficiently interesting to capture people's attention. In a real-world setting, rationalist plots about exploiting resources for maximal gain are nearly impossible to write for the reasons stated by others in this thread; but plots about flawed, emotional people trying to self-actualize should remain unaffected.
