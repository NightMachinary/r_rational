Something I believe I would really like to see is rationalist fanta-history. It takes a real history geek to pull it off properly, but it would be amazing to see someone pick a reasonable divergence point, some pivotal event in human history where a random occurrence could have tipped the scales decisively on a macroscopic level (for example, "Gavrilo Princip fails at killing Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo", "Joan of Arc is killed by bandits on her road to meet the Dolphin of France", "Constantine is killed during his struggle for power and does not become Roman Emperor, thus never officially recognising Christianity") and draw the logical conclusions from that.

Other than that, thrillers and mysteries are certainly potential ripe for exploitation too. Other genres, less so, because if a story isn't driven by some kind of rational enquiry to begin with, then there's nothing special about making it rational - it simply means it'll have a realistic setting and hopefully characters written well enough to feel like they have motivations and needs and aren't just plot devices. But that's a characteristic of a lot of good literary fiction.
