  The world is run by intelligent people. Only intelligent people know its a bad idea to be seen as the one running the world.

Not nearly that straightforward. Most likely, sure, /total dumbasses/ are not at the highest levels of power. Those that look like they are are probably putting up a bit of a facade (consciously or unconsciously) because it makes them look more innocuous than they are, it makes their opponents underestimate them, and it makes them more appealing to the sort of people who hate feeling looked down upon by those they perceive as smarter than them. But that doesn't mean ruling is about rationality. The one thing that really matters in power is being able to handle humans, and humans are far too complex a subject to be predicted and manipulated by simple rational means. It could be possible, in theory, but not for another human; our brain just doesn't have enough computational power. So the people who really end up being best at manipulating other people use heuristics and algorithms that evolution baked into our brain for the sake of social interactions, and often probably follow gut feelings more than rational chains of reasoning. There's some thinking in there too of course, but you just can't solve people the same way you solve a differential equation.

This is also a good reason why sci-fi or fantasy make a good setting for rational fiction. Magic or advanced technology are black boxes that transform knowledge into power. We can already appreciate how knowledge matters more in terms of social status in the present world than it did, say, in Hun society in 200 AD. If technology becomes ever more complex and more powerful, we can imagine the relative power conferred by rational vs. social skills increasing proportionally. In a world in which a single sufficiently knowledgeable person, by technological or magical means, can blow up whole countries, the balance of power is radically upset compared to what we're used to.
