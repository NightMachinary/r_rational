All these answers are fine, but a big part of it is that most rationalist writers are SF/F nerds rather than lit fic nerds. A story about a rational/ist character trying to take down a corrupt CEO or working as a private eye who stumbles upon a conspiracy would be great reads, but nobody in this community is interested enough in reading or writing that kind of material.
