Think i agree completely more or less.

I would still say however that those you mentioned right there, are usually people known by everyone, by virtue of that being their skill, but most people who really "run the world" (as much as a unpredictable world can be run) are not well known at all, and i would say much more rational than those the public commonly thinks of as holding great power.
