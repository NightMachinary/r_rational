I'll assume you've already considered the cases in which a clearly fictional setting can present more interesting optimization problems than a real one, in which case:

Not to be impolite, but writing a story set in the /real world/ and showing the main character succeeding in any significant way through "cleverness" increases the smartass potential of the work. That is to say, the more realistic the world the main character /unrealistically/ navigates through is, the more likely people will think you're a smartass writing blatant wish fulfillment. Whether or not you're /actually/ a smartass writing wish fulfillment is irrelevant, as is whether or not doing that is actually a bad thing. The point is that, in the end, negative judgement has been rendered, and people dislike being negatively judged. What science fiction and fantasy does is put a little cushion of unrealism around the work, to soften the incredulity of any person that wishes to criticize the work in bad faith.

Yes, I realize this is a vastly complicated and mostly bad reason. It's why holding yourself accountable to the opinions of others is a bad thing when it comes to writing, because you end up twisting your ideas in all sorts of absurd ways. To summarize:

1. You come up with a fictional idea.

2. In writing that fictional idea, you impart a layer of realism to help its intended audience feel emotionally resonant with the work.

3. In consideration of critics, you add a layer of unreality to the idea that was already fictional to begin with, in the hopes that they won't suddenly and conveniently forget the story is fictional when the time comes to criticize you.

4. But wait! You can't forget the people reading it in good faith, who would appreciate something with more connection to the real world...

5. Repeat ad infinitum until your wall of writer's block stretches into the upper atmosphere.

So what you see in rational fiction is a contrast between our mission statement (making realistic works of writing) and our fears (being the next Eliezer Yudkowsky, impaled on a critic's lampoon for sounding too sure of himself).
