you dont see much fiction on the scale where rationist fiction would work for the real world.... start with a small town. set up a corrupt system of neopotism and stupidity. now add a smart guy. why is he there? easiest answer will be family, but could be something else.

so ya got a smart, honest, hardworking man visting his dear sick aunt out here in a small midwest town. he sees how the HOA and cops and bureacracy have hurt his aunt over the decades, so hes motivated to put an end to that. and now you have a rational fic of a man tearing apart a corrupt town, where the cops WILL pull him over and break his tailight just to ticket him... and arrest him for 'resisting arrest'. and then you get the tricky 'but how do we resolve this plot?' question. the proper way to handle it is slow and boring and full of lawyers. the entertaining fiction way tends to much less realistic however.

maintaining suspension of disbeleif for the heroes victories is the tricky part. is it more spy fiction, crime fiction, or mystery? there are different styles that could work.
