Hey, three other commenters here before me. You all very clearly stopped paying attention after the first sentence. Read the second sentence again. The phrase "believable super powers" in the first sentence clearly refers to /large amounts of mundane money and power/, not to supernatural abilities, and all the Worm recommendations are drastically off the mark.
