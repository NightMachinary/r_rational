It leads to much more interesting results than real life would allow. If you're substantially smarter than the people around you, say in the field of business, you can make a successful company after years of work, but you're not going to fundamentally alter the history of even your country. Even in science/engineering, it would realistically take years or decades to make significant progress over the state of the art, and the most significant improvements that a single person is capable of making would be tools that primarily other people use to affect change. It doesn't make for a good story. In a fictional world with new and exploitable rules, a single person can meaningfully change things (i.e. make good drama for a story) in a short time without the author having to actually become proficient at a real life field. Similarly, the author can define the limits of the new rules, and isn't constrained by real life limitations that they would need to spend a lot of time researching.

If you have a story set in the past, where the protagonist doesn't necessarily need to be smarter so much as have a bunch of conclusions memorized (how to do chemistry, how a computer should be built, how to make steel, how to do science, etc. All things that are easier to know the conclusions that other people made than work it out yourself), then you have an uplift story. See A Hero's War, which is kind of a blend, because the protagonist primarily gains power through applying magic to make memorized machines work better or easier to make than through pure innovation on the magic system.

Also, math. Any real life field will generally require math, and the people who went through the effort to learn all that advanced math generally don't become authors.

Edit: One more thing: large conflicts that CAN be solved by a single person or a small group... already have been. Unless you want your story to focus on a much smaller scale than most authors are willing to write about, your story would need to be about societal change rather than the actions of a few people. An extremely competent group of diplomats is not going to be able to realistically resolve the situation with North Korea, fighting climate change is a global effort, corruption can be exposed but requires lots of other people to actually expunge, etc. Small numbers of people just aren't enough to fully solve a conflict, which generally isn't very satisfying narratively. People can be leaders of a larger movement, but they are hardly doing everything by themselves.
