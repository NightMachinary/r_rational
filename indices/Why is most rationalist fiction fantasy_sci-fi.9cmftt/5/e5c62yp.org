The closer you come to reality, the greater the scrutiny placed upon your work becomes. Consider a near-future, hard scifi story about a startup in chemical engineering. Such a startup would depend on some form of breakthrough to become relevant. This breakthrough would be the only break from reality, basically an additional axiom of "what if". Everything else would have to be derived from it. To properly explore the idea, the author would have to be a chemist themselves, or do extensive research that equals a chemist's background in the narrow space of the idea.

Now consider all the soft scifi / fantasy stories. The author is practically unrestricted to make up the rules, and their word is effectively final. In rational stories we demand a self-consistent system. Yet, the complexity of such a system is still trivial in comparison to real chemistry / physics / etc.

Beyond, the reader usually demands some greater scope of ability to effect change than what they are capable of in real life. Power. Influence. Overturning the status quo. Something beyond the mundane. I doubt you'd find reading about the day-to-day workings of an office clerk very compelling (it might be a different story if its a magical office clerk, or in the far off future with all these new gadgets!).

Whilst still maintaining that beyond-the-mundane level of impact, the author will be hard-pressed to write a compelling piece featuring present day reality. Most authors writing for entertainment have no history of making a significant impact on reality themselves. The people who are actually changing the world as we know it, are busy doing exactly that. Entrepreneurs, researchers, politicians, influencers, ... Most of these do not write. And what writing we have of them is mostly (auto)bibliographical, highly technical or propaganda.

If you wish to read about reality, I suggest non-fiction, e.g., historical accounts (rise & fall to power, war stories, ...), biographies, investigations into corporations and their dealings, etc.

Finally, in my opinion, most fictions recommended in this subreddit only excel at being rational(ist). Apart from these very worthwhile ideas, the writing is average at best. Especially the fanfiction stories suffer from this.

Consider "Pokemon: The Origin of Species", a greatly lauded work in this subreddit. The author tries hard to re-imagine the Pokemon fiction to be more sensible, and the actions of all characters involved to be more in line with it being some form of 'reality'. At the same time, the author wishes to communicate rational concepts and their implications on the characters' behavior. Yet, fundamental questions of a society living in such an environment are not discussed. It's still an adventure story with survival elements. Would you really send your 12 year old child into life-threatening situations (even if they mature faster)? With only one pokemon to start out with, when your status in society would enable you to arm them with more, or at least send an escort with them? Similarly, the economics of being a trainer are very much brushed aside.

In a way, the superficial inconsistencies have been polished off, only to reveal the deep cracks in the foundation of the work. Mind you, the story is still enjoyable. However, I reel at the lost potential by confining oneself to a specific known universe. The work could be so much more if it investigated what a society with combat pets ("pokemon" / "digimon" / ...) looked like in a more realistic way, investigating the societal effects thereof.

Of course, from the author's point of view, the story is different. An established universe leads to significantly less setup. The world can already be presumed to be known. Often the characters are also well known. Hence, only modifications of the status quo need to be stated. E.g., in "Pokemon: The Origin of Species", the author pretty much never gives any real descriptions (characters, scenes, ...). The focus is fundamentally only on the actions of the characters: Blue being a trainer, Red being a researcher, and Leaf being a journalist. In these actions the rationality is presented and dissected as an educational piece.

Now consider switching the same educational piece to reality. The author needs to provide far more description, setup and explain much more for the reader to understand. Reality is difficult. It requires far more effort to conceptualize (with too many rules, many of which are hard to grasp). Fiction is a simplified model, enabling the author to hand wave most of the difficulty away (placing it under your suspension of disbelief) and only introduce as much complexity as desired.
