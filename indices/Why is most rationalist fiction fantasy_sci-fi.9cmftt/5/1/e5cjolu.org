Worth the candle is a great example of the opposite of TOoS: the IRL author is writing a story set in a world which he himself has built. The reader is given in depth description of /anything/ unusual. Even further, the author has written the character as a twisty sort of mind who inverts or avoids tropes, which requires the protagonist to explain what he's seeing, but, also, the world he is in /also/ slightly twists those ideas.

So you have the author creating a narrator. The narrator has created unusual things in his various worlds which he describes. The world he is in has produced mutations of those ideas which require description. The /game layer/ requires description.

In the end, when the work is complete, a motivated individual could theoretically produce an encyclopaedia which might rival one from that world.
