Indeed, "Worth the candle" comes with a plethora of imagination and originality. The author explicitly shows that one's fantasy does not have to stop at generic game classes, and the usual elves-dwarves-humans trifecta that incurs. There's more to imagination than Lord of the Rings and Dungeons & Dragons.

Yet, if I may be so bold, the plot -- as far as I have read it -- is very generic. I have read countless survival stories, and I am growing very tired of them. While "Pokemon: TOoS" tries to distract from survival by interspersing it with other content, it still suffers from the same fundamental plot objective.

Personally, I wish to read stories that try to achieve something greater than bare survival. Living in an industrial nation, I hope to avoid threats to my well-being by not stepping into these situations in the first place.

Instead, I prefer reading about difficult decisions. How people form their opinions, how they convince others of their narrative, and how they act on it. Consider Giovanni in "Pokemon: TOoS". That is a character I can relate to. He ruthlessly pursues his goals, whilst making the hard calls, and living with the consequences of his choices. Beyond the shiny exterior (and whatever illusions we tell ourselves), reality resembles this web of complexity and competing priorities. There are no heroes or villains. There are only humans with motivations, goals, plans, desires, and incentives. Real people driven by conflicting ideals, but constrained by realpolitik.

To me, that's far more intriguing than planning the nth survival of the hero (of which I am absolutely certain, the book isn't finished yet) and his party (each of which, in most stories, will never suffer any form of permanent damage against all odds to the contrary -- and if so, it will be cured in approximately 5 to 25 chapters).
