Writing real world rational fiction is a lot harder, because it vastly increases the amount of time and effort the author has to put into 'studying'. A lot of the fun of rational fiction is watching the main characters develop clever tricks, and exploit holes in their world's physics/magic systems. This is relatively easy to write, because the author designed those systems themselves, and has plenty of freedom to explain why this clever trick isn't common knowledge, or why the main character was the first person to invent this magical device, or develop this stratagem.

If you write rational fiction in the real world however, you greatly limit how much cleverness you can show, because you have to work within a pre-existing system, that all of your readers know as intimately as you do. If you write your character pulling off some kind of clever financial get rich quick scheme, there's a chance your going to have a reader who actually works in finance, and will tell everybody exactly how bad that clever plan actually is. If you write your character inventing something awesome, actual engineer will be on standby to explain exactly why it wouldn't work; if you have your scientist character discover something, you'll have actual scientists in the comment section screaming about how unlikely it is they discovered it first/how physics or biology or chemistry doesn't work that way.

The best way to get around this kind of thing is to write about jobs very few people have (like super spies), or to introduce some kind of new, never before seen element into the story; something nobody has any experience with... and that often is going to be magic, or some kind of scifi element. Things that let the author be clever, without having to worry about experts critiquing their plans, because they're the only expert that matters when it comes to the magic system they just invented.

There are so few real world rational stories, because setting it in the real world greatly hampers the amount of clever stuff you can have in the story, because suddenly you have to put so much more work into justifying everything. If HPMOR was set in the real world, people would start asking questions about Hogwart's safety regulations, or why battles were allowed, or just how expensive such an awesome school would cost, or why it was allowed to operate with so little oversight, etc... Setting in a magical world silences all those questions, and lets the author focus on being a good writer instead.

And also world-building is half the fun of rational writing. Creating a standard fantasy or sci-fi world, and then trying to make it consistent and sane, is fun. Writing about how rational agents would react to a sudden shift in the Force heralding the appearance of a strong Sith user, is almost instantly entertaining. Writing about how rational agents would react to the sudden appearance of a powerful new terrorist group is less instantly fun, about a dozen times more complex, and at least 60% harder to write.
