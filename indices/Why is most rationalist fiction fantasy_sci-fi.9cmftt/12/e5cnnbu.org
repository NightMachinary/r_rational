If you want to make individual characters' stories actually interesting and have narratively satisfying stakes in a real world setting in a rational fic, you need to find a way to make it so that the smartest, most competent, most powerful agents don't swoop in and make all of your protagonists' work moot.

In the story I've been writing, my solution is to have the smarter more powerful characters working on harder problems which require spending more resources. The protagonists are valuable not because they are the best in their fields, but because they are disposable and so can be given more risky tasks which are less vital and don't require as much skill. And all of the more talented people in their fields are spending their time on other more difficult tasks. But just because the protagonists' jobs are relatively less important doesn't mean they aren't making a critical difference towards the good guys' ultimate victory. Basically they're a force multiplier. One of the protagonists is one of the last surviving members of an organization that started a social movement to promote rationality to the general public in order to help prevent an authoritarian regime. He uses the reputation of that organization and his association with it as a way to help increase funds and employee recruitment to beneficiary organizations that are trying to save the world.

Even when one of the protagonists appears to take over the world, in reality he's just a puppet and figurehead, but his actions still matter because he's the one interacting with the public directly and he needs to keep up appearances.

Also, another important thing is to stick to what you know as much as you can, and when you can't you should have smart, sensible knowledgable editors on hand to check your work for consistency and realism. This makes it easier to write stories set in or near the present rather than the future.

That being said I've probably spent more time editing and fleshing out my story than actually writing it. I don't know if that's a universal trait of good rational fics set in a real-life contemporary setting, but i suspect that it is.

Also, I suspect that rational fics set in real world are just a kind of hard sci-fi by another name.
