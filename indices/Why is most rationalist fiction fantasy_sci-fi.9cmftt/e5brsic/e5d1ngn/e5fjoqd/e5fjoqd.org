  I can easily imagine a rational Pride and Prejudice kind of story

What would you say is /irrational/ about "Pride and Prejudice" though? The setting is, obviously, realistic. And while the tone is satirical and thus not always entirely natural, all characters have believable wants and needs and reasonably feel like real people. It's a story about, well, pride and prejudice, so of course they don't act fully rationally, but that's par for the course for humans. Unless you want to make a rationalist version in which Liz Bennet is actually a genius budding scientist lady รก la Ada Lovelace, in which case, I'm reading that XD.
