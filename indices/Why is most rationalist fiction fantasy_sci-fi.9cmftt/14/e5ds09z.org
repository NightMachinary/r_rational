I'd point out here that there is a subset of detective/mystery novels which are rationalist fiction set in the real world; Sherlock Holmes of mythic stature (not necessarily the actual books, I suppose) is just as much ratfic as Worth the Candle or Practical Guide to Evil.

His modern spoof-in-part of Psych's Shawn Spencer has ratfic-self-insert levels of super-analysis and super-observational powers but also perpetually possesses the idiot ball, but I would genuinely recommend watching at least the first episode if you're interested in deconstruction of rationalist fiction tropes.
