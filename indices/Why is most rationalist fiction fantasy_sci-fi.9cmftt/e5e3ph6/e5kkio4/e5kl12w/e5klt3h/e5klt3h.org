Mystery, non-violent crime, general fiction without alien species (or whatever a Sith is?) or "special effects" or action. In practice I'm extremely picky so I kind of read non-fiction most of the time :( I did enjoy Metropolitan Man as an example of rationalist fiction, I have tried rading some others but couldn't stick with them.
