I don't know about you, but the most "rationalist" sci fi I started on as a kid was Theodore sturgeon. The man straddles so many sci fi sub genres with his writing, it is unbelievable.

But under it all, what he's most writing about is people and emotions, even if they aren't... Quite Human. Likewise, John Wyndham. "Midwich cuckoos" and "chrysalis" are almost literally Mirrors to each other in terms of perspective.
