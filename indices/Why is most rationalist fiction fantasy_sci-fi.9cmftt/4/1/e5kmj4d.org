I agree that it is hard to write large scale conflicts and real change in fields of work, but I don't see why it has to be those things. What about everyday scenarios where you simply have conflicting goals? Of characters competing, trying to anticipate the actions of the other, obscuring their own motives, patterns and signals so their opponent doesn't learn from them, managing perceptions while avoiding theirs to be, things like that, but with personal goals instead of anything grand. Most regular fiction books aren't so lofty after all. And if you need fixed rules you can have them enter actual competitions or other gamelike situations.
