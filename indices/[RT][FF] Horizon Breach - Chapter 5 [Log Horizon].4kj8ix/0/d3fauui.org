Players once trapped in a video game world find a way to connect it to the original world... but since the video game world is a real world in its own right, they get to keep their powers, and people back on earth can figure out how to use them as well. Politics ensue.

Log Horizon fans will get the most out of this, but it's written so as to be relatively understandable by people not familiar with the source material.

Still looking for a beta! PM me for details.

Had another deleted scene in here, but didn't replace it with anything, so this chapter's shorter than normal. I've decided to put deleted scenes and side stories in chapter ten, though, so you'll see them eventually.

Incidentally, because I have two of these threads on the front page (which is sort of a waste) I've decided to post the threads for two chapters at once at the same time, although my actual update schedule will remain the same.
