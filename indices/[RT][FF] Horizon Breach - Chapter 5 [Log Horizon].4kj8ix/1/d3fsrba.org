Interesting chapter, I'm curious to see what will Tetra do now. Changing gender and appearance back to his original one would be easy and would help with interacting with her parents, but on another side it would be also interesting if she went as Tetra, as she's a very food proof of that world's capability in gender switch.

Interesting that they are now mass producing the sex change potions, that could be a great resource to trade with the Earthlings, assuming it does work on normal humans.
