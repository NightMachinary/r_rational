I found it neat how Tetra is comfy in their own gender in the 'whichever body I am, I'm me' sense, rather than the 'only a male/female body is me' it commonly seems to take the form of. To my understanding, anyway, which is admittedly rather tiny.

Agreed that genderswap potions are gonna be a sought-after trade commodity, though, right alongside health and possibly poison-cure potions (provided stuff like 'cancer' reads as poison).
