I think people are putting way, way too much weight into story logic.

/Practical Guide/ has so far done a lot more commenting on conventions than following any set of conventions (besides a general "the protagonist keeps winning and becoming stronger").

Black has built his career around finding ways to win despite story conventions. While many specific engagements have (probably) been decided by story logic, most large-scale conflicts have been a matter of logistics and ideology. The entire half of the first book has involved almost nothing but number-based military tactics.

Some events are decided by story logic, especially the most pivotal events. But not /everything/ has to be. The idea that the Pilgrim will somehow "reform" either Cat or Akua in a way the will lead to their inevitable death seems incredibly stretched at this point.
