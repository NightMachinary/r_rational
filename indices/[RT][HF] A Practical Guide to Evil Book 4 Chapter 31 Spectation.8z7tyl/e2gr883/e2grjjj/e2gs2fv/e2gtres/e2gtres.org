Or he saw Akua in Catherine's body and was aiming for her to join the party from the very start. If she's bound by the same oaths as Cat when she's posessing her, then the story may be applied to her while she, say, is let out to fight against the crusaders in Callow's hour of need again.

I mean, this was before the negotiations where Catherine turned the tables (though, given how Grey Pilgrim didn't need to signal the intermediary or prince Amadis, the redemption narrative might not have been an improvisation), but all four sentences said by the Pilgrim to Diabolist on her throne [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2018/06/04/kaleidoscope-vi/][in Kaleidoscope VI]] can be viewed both as ones said to Cat and to Akua:

  “Child,” he said, tone appalled. “What have you done to yourself?”

  “Surrender,” the Great Elder said. “Abdicate. It is not too late.”

  “You would argue this, after slaying thousands?” the Pilgrim asked.

  “And you think your reign a better alternative?” the Grey Pilgrim asked calmly.

Note that the second one is a response to "I see you've been tossing around resurrections like they're godsdamned solstice treats, too. Charming. Not going to have any long-term ramifications at all.” The third one is a bit of hypocritical nonsequitur if applied to Catherine's actions during the Battle of Camps, but we've been past that. As a reaction to finding out that Diabolist is still out and about, howerver, it sounds far more reasonable (especially as a response to "This doesn't need to turn into a Named pissing contest.”).

In that context, refusing to help Catherine was raising the pressure that made her either fold (in which case the redemption is applied straightforwardly, since she now has to fight everyone that previously backed her to "amend her sins"), or resort to the drastic measures he no doubt saw her considering, which gives the next batch of heroes narrative advantage and makes her let Akua out more frequently, who either backstabs her (which brings us back to Evil turns on Evil) or behaves like a decent person until she has a chance to contact the Pilgrim again (which, aside from story of an artifact backfiring on its owner, would allow him more control over her "character development", or at least trick the villains to their doom).

I realle hope for Catherine figuring out a way of this trap, now that she heard the word "redemption" and can think about how exactly Akua is planning to get out.
