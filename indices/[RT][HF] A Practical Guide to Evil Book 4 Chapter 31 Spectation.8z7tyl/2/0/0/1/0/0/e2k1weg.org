Yeah there is, I don't expect it to happen at all, she is just one of the few women in the series who seems capable of a wholesome relationship, and I think Cat is a bit past caring too much about social faux pas, I'm honestly surprised she didn't try to sleep with her just because she could, Cat has never struck me as someone who restrains urges that aren't actively harmful to her (like the drinking).
