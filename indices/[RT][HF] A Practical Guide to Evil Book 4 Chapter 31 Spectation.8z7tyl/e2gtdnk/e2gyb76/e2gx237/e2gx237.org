I rather love seeing other people's description of Catherine. The way Thief is speaking, you would think that Cat is Archer with a crown. Though Thief has never known Archer before she turned Masego-sexual.

  She's kind of petty, her temper's foul and if Hakram hadn't stepped in she'd probably be a drunk. She ogles every pretty face that shows up even if they're our enemies, and she cannot for the life of her shut the Hells up even when she really needs to.

Also, nice brag with the pretty face bit here.
