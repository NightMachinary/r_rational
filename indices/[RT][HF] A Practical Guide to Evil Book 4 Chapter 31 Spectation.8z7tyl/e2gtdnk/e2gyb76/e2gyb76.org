I got a lot more respect for Thief from this chapter. Well written, intelligent characters are awesome.

Also, I think that Akua is playing a three level game here. 1. Getting into an argument 2. Losing the argument in order to further her redemption 3. Through the argument itself, and not the outcome, change both her and Thiefs role in the story.

I think she's aiming to be the Devil on the shoulder with Vivenne as the opposing Angel.

No matter which tier of her plan works, she wins. If she wins the argument then she could start to influence thief, gaining a foothold that way. If she successfully throws the argument without being found out, then she furthers her redemption arc, and third, she can transition her role in the story to being a somewhat humorous, permanent addition, gaining a more permanent presence in Creation.

Or I'm thinking too much into it.
