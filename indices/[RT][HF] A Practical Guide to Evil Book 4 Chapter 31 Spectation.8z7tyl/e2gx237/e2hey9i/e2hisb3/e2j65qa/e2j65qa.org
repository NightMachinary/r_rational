Honestly, I wish she would just get a do it at some point with anyone, I feel like she has way to much sexual tension built up, she has always been a very sexually aware character and I feel like not having an outlet for it is putting her on edge. I honestly can't blame her too much though because her options for companionship are really limited, as much as she seems to have slept around when she was younger the current her doesn't seem into casual anything, the only characters who I think could give her any kind of meaningful relationship are Thief (who is, as has been explicitly stated, painfully straight), and Anne Kendall (who we don't know all that much about really, besides that Cat trusts her in charge of Callow and the she finds her /very/ attractive).
