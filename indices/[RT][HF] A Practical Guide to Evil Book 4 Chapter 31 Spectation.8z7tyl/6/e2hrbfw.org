So this has undoubtedly been mentioned in previous chapter reviews at some point, but what we've got here is an AI in a box scenario yeah? Immoral/amoral agent trying to get out, moral agents needing the invaluable information it can provide, and a gatekeeper to serve as the balance.

If that's the case, Thief seems to be behaving in a less than optimal fashion. I guess it could be argued that her emotions vs. Ubua are getting in the way, but still, you'd think she'd have set some ground rules for herself and Cat early on and then stuck to them. Things like limiting information going in, not letting the entity fraternize, and above all else not getting into petty arguments with it for the sake of your ego.

This last chapter kinda violated a lot of rules that I'd assume were pretty basic, for no other reason that I can see than to kinda-sorta show Cat that Akua is still scheming to get out? Is that really vital information that needed to be proved? If Akua is as intelligent and evil mastermindy as everyone thinks she is then Thief trying to one up her in the manipulation game seems a needless risk to take. Thief's already had to move the goalposts from "fate worse than death" to "she's a valuable resource that Cat promises to get rid of 'when no longer needed'", so I'd say the gatekeeper is on the path towards failure already.

Dunno, I just think if Thief wants to avoid her worst possible outcome of Akua getting freedom then she should really be pushing for her to be locked up in the dark and not spoken to until absolutely necessary.
