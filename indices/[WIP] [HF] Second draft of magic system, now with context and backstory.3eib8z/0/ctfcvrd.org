How does the magic work? Supersaturated nanobots? Where or on what is the FAI running? Supersaturated nanobots? How did anyone who couldn't command the [supersaturated nanobots] survive the war? Why weren't they converted into people able to use [supersaturated nanobots] with the wave of the hand of a [supersaturated nanobot] user in order to be better at killing the other nation full of [supersaturated nanobot] users? Did this advanced civilization do anything in space? If so, what? If not, why the hell not? Where does the information powering the [supersaturated nanobots] come from? Are there any artifacts of the SAT or FAI that don't gibe with the common explanation of "magic"? Why that particular restriction, when all it would do would be to segregate people /more/ and lay the foundations for an uneven class structure? If the goal was to prevent violence, why was [supersaturated nanobots] made something that would be /most/ useful for combat?
