I think questions about how the magic works will actually be unknown to us. Hard science fiction often assumes that the technology of the future will be future versions of present technology combined with technology based on current science. This is almost always wrong. Future technology will be partly (depending on how future it is) unknown to us because it will be based on science we do not yet know. Some of that science will overthrow our current understanding of the world. So I think that it is much more realistic if we do not understand how the magic works at all.

I do however, have several questions about the historical scenario here. First off, elves seem to be a single race with singular features. Why? If given the chance to alter appearance, people have different preferences. Second, elves living thrice as long as humans is actually fairly short. Why did no one improve their lifespan? Third, why did they never go into space? (Or did they?)

I also have questions about the FAI. You have given it five directives. But these directives can conflict. Without some kind of ordering, it seems that the meaning of these directives is unclear. Is it acceptable to alter minds in order to fulfill any of these objectives? What about making any of these objectives less likely? The machine is forbidden from killing sapient beings. Does that include letting such beings die or is it limited to directly causing their death? These answers radically change the possible actions the FAI can do. Also, how aware is it? Can it know what everyone is doing or is it somewhat limited in that respect?
