About the elves... to me it makes sense that after however many thousands of years their population should have more traits in common than their transhuman ancestors did. The example I have in mind is that on /average/ the original transhumans were taller than normal humans, but there were some unusually short ones. Now though, elves have less variation in their height. On the other hand, they do still have a much wider variety of vibrant skin, eye and hair colors than humans.

The original transhumans extended their lifespans with the intent of living forever, but the way they did it was... imperfect. They could live two hundred years and age more slowly, but then they'd need regenerative medicine to undo that aging. They had that kind of technology, but their civilization is gone now so today's elves only have that two-hundred-year lifespan.

I don't know if they went into space. I think they didn't get far enough to find aliens.

The FAI's directives are flawed and I'll need to work on them a lot more; I know that. The ones in this post are sort of like placeholders.

Thanks for your feedback.
