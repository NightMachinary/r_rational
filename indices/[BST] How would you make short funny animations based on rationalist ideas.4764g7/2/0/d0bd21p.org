My ultimate dream is to create something like Rick and Morty, so I'm going for more grown up kind of stuff(not nsfw, but not for kids either).

I guess the main challenges are to figure out what are the most useful and interesting ideas to express, how to express them in small chunks, and how to do that through funny and entertaining jokes/stories/dialogues.

Thinking about TA is a good advice, maybe if I'll have a specific person in mind it'll be easier to understand what to say and how to say it...
