I really like the art style in [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqaG1FR-OIM][The Old Town]] and I can certainly see you making successful videos that look similar. However, if you want them to be popular, you might want to consider getting someone else to read your scripts. I realize that your voice doesn't actually sound like it does in that video, but I can hear a bit of an accent in your [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNgOKjd2ahM][vlog]] as well, and my guess is that this would decrease your chances of success. I could be wrong though. Sometimes an accent or distinctive voice can be a benefit, and I don't really know how to predict such cases. Anyway good luck!
