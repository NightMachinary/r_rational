Thank you for the advice! Yes, I do have an accent, but I'm working hard on improving/eliminating it, and it's already better than it used to be. There's a lot of other skills I need to keep working on, especially writing and comedy, so speaking is just one of many things I need to improve to make my videos successful. I'd rather not outsource it, so I'll just keep trying to get better until it's good enough.
