I'm probably never continuing this, unless I decide to start a story series written in "the Dimension of 1950s Republicanism" without other reference to the Erogamer continuity.

For those who aren't familiar with the style, this is written as "the future as described in pre-1970s science fiction". Including, for example, the fact that Akio speaks with a written accent; I would not otherwise write a story in which somebody had a written accent like that. Or in which I bothered to look in on a military commander's thoughts about whether the medical officer was pretty, etcetera. If either trope strikes a modern reader as jarring, it's meant to be so.

Not posting this to [[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-erogamer-original.5465][the original Erogamer on Questionable Questing]] because they have a rule against multiple accounts (which is the kind of rule I usually obey without strong reason otherwise) (so I can't make a throwaway account) and I prefer not to reveal which account there is mine. It might also violate their Rule 8: No Politics, but that's a moot point given the previous one.
