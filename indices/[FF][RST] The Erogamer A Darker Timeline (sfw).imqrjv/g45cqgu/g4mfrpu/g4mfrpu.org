The other thing that got the Republican party the way it is was Nixon's "Southern Strategy" of appealing to the racist vote. My impression is that by the 1950s there were racists and anti-racists in both parties; racism and civil rights were an important political issue, but not a /partisan/ political issue. When LBJ managed to get the Civil Rights Act through the Senate, he remarked that they had just lost the South for a generation; the Democrats ended up as the party of civil rights and the Republicans eventually turned the South red.
