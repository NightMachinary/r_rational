Not sure if it was intentional but your attempt at writing Akio's accent was pretty piss-poor. Japanese-accented English doesn't replace every l in the spelling with an r. Japanese language just doesn't have an l or an r phoneme in it, so English learners often can't remember which one it is when speaking (and it can go either way, so "rabbit"->"labbit" is as likely as "hello"->"herro").

Anyway, words like "would", without an audible l, are not affected.
