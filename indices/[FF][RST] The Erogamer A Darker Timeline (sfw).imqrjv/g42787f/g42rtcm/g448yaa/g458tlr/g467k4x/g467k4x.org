  Most of my stories are presents for somebody or other. When Jane Yolen asked me to write something for her anthology  Dragons and Dreams, the recipient I had in mind was Robert Heinlein---who (to my complete astonishment and delight) was a fan of the Young Wizards books. It's been impossible to forget the time he brought up  Deep Wizardry in the middle of one phone conversation. “I'm a Navy man,” he said. “We don't like sharks. You made me like that shark.” A pause. “That was a dirty trick.” And his laughter...
