After Marc has outlined his speculation, the rejoinder could be:

"It... it might have been the climate. After the Chernobyl nuclear reactor exploded and irradiated Europe we became too afraid of nuclear power to save it. The republican party was backed by corporate interests. When it was determined that we needed to slow down our industry to save the climate, they blocked it. They began to deny the problem. They started lying. If once you tell a lie the truth forever becomes your enemy. Soon they needed to deny science to defend their lie. And all good honest men fled to the democrats."
