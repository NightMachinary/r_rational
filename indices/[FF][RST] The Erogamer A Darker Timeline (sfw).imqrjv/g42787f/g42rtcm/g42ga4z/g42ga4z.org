Your prose remains very pleasant to read.

I enjoyed the ambiguousness of the title, with the readers probably having differing thoughts than the characters on which timeline is the darker one. It works especially well due to Cindy's canon pessimism coloring the explanations she gave them. Their reactions may have been slightly too strong though. Not sure if I would jump straight to mass scale biological accidents when hearing of Trump's presidency. Granted, as a European, I did feel some disbelief when I heard he was elected.

I am missing the twist at the ending. Marcus is Charles' grandfather, if I recall correctly, and Heinlein is ofc a sci fi writer who in this timeline apparently was a moon base creator instead. But what detail did Cindy change? And what does the last line mean?

Edit: ah, the last line refers to Akio's joking comment. Still don't understand what conclusion the commander reached.
