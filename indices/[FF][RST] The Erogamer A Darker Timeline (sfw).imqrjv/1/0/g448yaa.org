Diane Duane's short story /Uptown Local/ is in some ways pretty similar.

Though it's also simultaneously /Young Wizards/ fluff (fanfic by the author? She even does self-insert fic on Tumblr), urban fantasy, science fiction, and a Heinlein tribute from a friend. Not sure if there's a free version online, but I'll recommend anything in the setting and this is a great entry point.
