I've come soliciting help from people who have finished the chapter:

I've stopped reading at the problem about =the story of how General Hideyoshi fooled the Mori clan's undefeated psychic warlord at Himeji Castle into falsely believing that he was surrendering?=. I don't want to read on and =admit to ignorance without at least trying to figure out the answer=. But I must ask before hand - is it even possible for me to work out the answer? And important follow-up question - does it rely on mechanics of the story so far, or if I happened to know a perfect psychic in our real world (no Pokemon world), would it work there too?
