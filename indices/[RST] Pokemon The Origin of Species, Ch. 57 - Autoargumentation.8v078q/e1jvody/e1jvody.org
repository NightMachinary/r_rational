This might be my favorite chapter yet! So much nuance, moral ambiguity, mystery, and relatable emotional discomfort from Red's perspective. I really found myself sympathizing with him throughout this chapter, while earlier in the story there were times where I perceived him as being more of a rationalist ideals mouthpiece than a real individual. I honestly would never have expected that a cruise ship arc of all things would turn out to be so full of feelings and foreboding tension despite nothing of note really happening yet. While I feel a bit guilty for it, I hope that Red's romantic anguish will keep on tormenting him for a bit longer without any kind of convenient resolution- I believe in character growth through hardship, after all! Also welcome aboard Pikachu, I wonder how long it'll take until he evolves into Raichu! Oh, wait a sec...
