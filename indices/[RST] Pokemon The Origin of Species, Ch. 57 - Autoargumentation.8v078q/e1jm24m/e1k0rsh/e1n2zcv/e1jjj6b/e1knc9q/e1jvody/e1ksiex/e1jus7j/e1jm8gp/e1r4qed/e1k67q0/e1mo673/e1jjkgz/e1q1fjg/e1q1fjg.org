Okay so first off, it seems to me that Raikoth is more of your suggestion for the real world rather than something actually having to do with the plot. Nonetheless, I do think it opens up an interesting discussion on the topic.

First off, I think the proposal of having other people perform your suggested experiments is a bit flawed. A lot of research takes multiple attempts and multiple hypotheses to be successful. For example, if your goal is to create a chemical that turns Charmanders blue, you would need to test multiple mixtures and dosages of various different chemicals. So it really doesn't work for things like the millenium problems, IE the 7 math problems that some school said "We'll give a million dollars to the first person who solves one of these problems". It might work for sociological studies. However, a simpler solution would be to have experiments be routinely reproduced (which is ideally what should be happening right now).

Personally, my biggest problem with academia is not the quality of their information, but their willingness to actually spread that information. We are literally in the Information Age. There has never been more of a desire for people to know what the fuck they're talking about. The problem is that the people with the most quality information, the people who actually do research in their fields and know what's going on, are not willing to spread that information. You can't get mad that people are following shoddy information about climate change when they are doing nothing to make their own information available to the every day person. We don't have biology professors manning Tumblr blogs that keep us up to date with are frequent breakthroughs in genetic research. We don't have philosophy professors writing reddit posts explaining in layman terms the ins and outs of Nietzchian philosophy. We don't have a climate change database outlining the various studies and inventions in that field in a way that the normal person can follow along. The two examples we do have of academics putting their input on a subject, Askhistorians and Askscience, are absolutely fantastic. But those two subs don't cover everything, they only cover what there's an interest in (which is also a problem with your betting suggestion), they don't provide a strong database (although askhistorians tries to), and they don't really keep up with updates (if there's a breakthrough in a certain scientific field, it's doubtful it would be covered on askscience).

And it's not like people are unwilling to learn. Whenever a professor shows up on the internet, they get quite a following. I highly doubt [[https://www.facebook.com/thekarenbrown/posts/10215764784460167][this facebook post]] on immigration would get half the attention it did if the author didn't mention that she was a professor in the opening paragraph. Piero Scaruffi, who's actual profession is performing lectures at Stanford and Harvard on cognitive science and artificial intelligence, is very well known among music fans for his exceptionally controversial opinions. And probably even more notable is Jordan Peterson. His fame has the same roots as Tomi Laren and Milo Yiannopolus, ya know the people who acted like bashing political correctness was some revolutionary concept, but his fame has proven to be much more sustainable. The people are starving to hear some actual intelligence in the cluster fuck of stupid that is the internet. It's time people with the actual power to do so actually go ahead and do it.
