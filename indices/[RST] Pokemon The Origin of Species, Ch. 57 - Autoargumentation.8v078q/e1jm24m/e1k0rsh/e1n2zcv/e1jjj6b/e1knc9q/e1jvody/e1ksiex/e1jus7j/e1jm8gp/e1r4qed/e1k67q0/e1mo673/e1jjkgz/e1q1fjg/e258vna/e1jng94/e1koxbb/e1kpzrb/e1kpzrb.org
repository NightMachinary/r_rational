I feel like the anime version of Team Rocket, re-imagined as scientists trying to impress Giovanni, rather than grunts with the same role, would be only characters I can see being foolish enough to use stolen cloning tech and try and solve the "absent mind problem" in some genius but shortsighted way that ultimately ends up creating a Pokemon with a human like brain.

Why go through the trouble of laboriously growing a human-pokemon hybrid, when you can use this reconstruction technology to essentially "insert" a human-like brain into a Pokemon body (ignoring how complex actually doing this would be, of course)? Only this time, instead of a potential psychic god, James and Jessie end of creating a snarky Meowth that is essentially a weak, pacifistic, walking existential crisis.
