Definitely agree that information should be more widespread and accessible. The pokemon world already sort of has that cultural achievement, at least when it comes to pokemon, with the availability of pokedex. But even then there are some secrets, and there will always be incentives to keep information hidden, either for personal benefit or just as part of the system that funds its creation or vetting.
