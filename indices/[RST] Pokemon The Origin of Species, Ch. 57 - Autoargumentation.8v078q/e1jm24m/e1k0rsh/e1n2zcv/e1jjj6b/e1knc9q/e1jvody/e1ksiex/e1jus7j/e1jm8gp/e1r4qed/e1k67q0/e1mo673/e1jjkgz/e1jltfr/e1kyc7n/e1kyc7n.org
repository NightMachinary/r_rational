  "Well, if we could just collect a bunch of dead matter for the elements and work out the algorithms to perfectly duplicate a pokemon, carbon, hydrogen and oxygen will get you most of the way there for most---"

  "People aren't going to want most pokemon, they're going to want the rare and powerful ones. You think most people have a ton of iron lying around to turn into a steelix?"
