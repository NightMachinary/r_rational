Another issue is that only some of real world research (in particular in medicine/microbiology and psychology/sociology) works this way.

- Take a biologist looking for new species in the rain-forest. He doesn't go there to test some hypothesis, he goes there to find previously unknown things.
- Or consider a physics experiment like the LHC. In this case people actually came up with the device to test a hypothesis (that the Higgs boson exists). But the LHC can do much more than that. It generates all kinds of data that is used to answer all kinds of questions, and also to replicate all kinds of previously results.
- Take a chemist trying to find ways to manufacture graphene. They have lots of hypotheses like "this slight tweak to the process will improve yield" or "this route might work". But ideas are cheap, and there actually are lots of theories to generate them. The actual work is in doing the experiments. Prediction markets might help to determine what goals to focus on. But to be able to bet on detailed hypotheses requires expert knowledge that only very few people have, the same people who are qualified to do the research. This knowledge about nitty-gritty will never be written down, because a lot of it is intuitive, instead it is something that phd students learn as part of their education. Additionally, it is very easy to quantify results, you either made graphene or you didn't. So p-hacking should not be a big problem.
- What about exploratory research? Say a new disease pops up, and you want funding to go collect some samples and look at them through a microscope (or for someone else to do this). What hypothesis should be put forth here?
- And I'll not discuss mathematics, which is not really an empirical science anyway.
