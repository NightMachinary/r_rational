Hey everyone, welcome back to a special early chapter! I published today because I'm heading to Scotland tomorrow to teach at ESPR. This means edits to this chapter may be a bit delayed, and after ESPR I'm heading to SPARC in Berkeley, so I've got a busy month coming. I've already written a lot of the next chapter, so hopefully I'll be able to keep the monthly streak going. If, however, no new chapter is up August 1st, I'll try to have it up as soon afterward as I can.

As usual, all feedback is welcome, and to any readers who may be at either camp, feel free to come say hi!
