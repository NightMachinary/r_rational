Cloning? Leaf would totally shove red into a machine and get a more romantic version of him.

Also: Leaf oughta do something 'bout protein. At that rate Red's gonna end up with Sabrina.

Pikachu evolving? Can't wait 'til Red says "Pikachu, use Thunderbolt!".

  Once they and their pokemon are tired out, they decide to try some of the assorted drinks from the room's bar. Leaf opens one of the miniature liquor bottles, some kind of plum flavored rice wine that they both take turns sipping and making faces at as they try to acclimate to the taste. Red's lips tingle each time they touch the bottle mouth, and he's not sure if it's from the alcohol or from his knowledge of what was just touching it. Soon his cheeks feel flushed, which he's pretty sure is <em>not</em> from the alcohol. Or not exclusively, anyway.

Unrelated news: nobody noticed that the Alolan forms fanart of the gen 1 kids had Leaf drinking /lemon/ juice. [[https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/2528236]] (NSFW)

Trivia time: what would happen if Articuno and Moltres decide to roost at the same place? Would Moltres set fire to an ice chicken? Moltres turns into blue fire? Zapdos decides to intervene because of a type advantage?
