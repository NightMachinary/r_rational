Not OP, just butting in with a comment. Unless the first part of dialogue ends with a comma and the next part includes a verb denoting speech (e.g. "said"), the part in the middle is its own standalone narration with no direct relation to the spoken dialogue. Though, I can definitely sympathize with how the arrangement of names not conforming to the expected pattern throws the reader in for a loop.
