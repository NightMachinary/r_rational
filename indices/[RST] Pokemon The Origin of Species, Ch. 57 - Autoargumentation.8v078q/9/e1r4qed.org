Let's begin, shall we?

#+begin_quote
  This time the options are all plant pokemon
#+end_quote

For some reason, I never thought of eating plant pokemon. I imagined they had cheaper regular plants

#+begin_quote
  Leaf takes his hand, warmth spreading from the contact all the way up his arm and through his chest 
#+end_quote

On point as always

So leaf is giving social advice is cute. And the fact that I'm finding the lessons usefull to me, is worring

#+begin_quote
  "See if you can find your own group to infiltrate."
#+end_quote

No! Don't let me - I mean - him alone to socialize! He won't survive!

#+begin_quote
  Yes Future Red, but I currently have no control over my legs as the thought occurs that dying of awkwardness may be impossible, but suicide as a cure for awkwardness is not.
#+end_quote

So, my empathy towards Red is reaching a point I didn't thought possible

#+begin_quote
  You fools, you've DOOMED US ALL!
#+end_quote

...is this a reference to SAO abridged? More likely SAOA was referencing a movie now that I think of it

#+begin_quote
  or from his knowledge of what was just touching it. 
#+end_quote

So childish, I love it

#+begin_quote
  this is a boat after all,
#+end_quote

HAH, this story creates memes now

#+begin_quote
  should also be able to be copied
#+end_quote

Daystar, you are a madman. You are actually going to canonize the emerald glitch

#+begin_quote
  fairly mindless way
#+end_quote

Ohhhh. So they weren't able to copy the psywhatever

#+begin_quote
  he just went through a battery of tests.
#+end_quote

That was a intence sequence indeed. I enjoyed it quite a lot. Well developed

#+begin_quote
  Or scream
#+end_quote

Maybe her pokemon rights ideals are clashing? I wonder how different you could consider eating this charizard from artificial meat

#+begin_quote
  They probably just put together something impressive enough to show for investors.
#+end_quote

Leaf is shooting very strong points. Enough to make me feel troubled

#+begin_quote
  and not eventually get upset at being stuck with one?
#+end_quote

One moral dilema after another. I'm liking the tone of this chapter

#+begin_quote
  Hi... Paul
#+end_quote

And back to the memes. Nice tempo

#+begin_quote
  Check my room?" Red asks as he suddenly sends his powers out toward Pichu, 
#+end_quote

I love how we have shifted from the deep moral questions to two children hiding their misbehaviour from an adult. Tense in a completely different, more naive way. Great job Daystar.

#+begin_quote
  and Red turns to see her blushing furiously. It makes her look particularly pretty.
#+end_quote

Cute leaf best leaf

#+begin_quote
  Red... you are the worst liar
#+end_quote

Yes. Yes he is.

#+begin_quote
  "I refuse to feel bad about that." "You left the TV on?"
#+end_quote

Their silly moments together are nice

#+begin_quote
  pikachu
#+end_quote

I'm going to miss the smol mouse

Also amazing chapter. Maybe one of my favourites, for completely different reasons than the others. Keep up the great work!
