Figured there'd be something along these lines popping up. If things can be constructed via pokeball/container, no reason why a living being can't be.

I do wonder how psychic interference/stimuli will work out in the case of cloned pokemon. IIRC the only abilities that have been shown so far are all sensory and communication based, so if there's some kind of body snatching/controlling ability some psychics can use then it might be possible to shape a clone's brain to basically build a mind. It would probably be way less effective than a natural born pokemon, but it's something interesting to think about at least.
