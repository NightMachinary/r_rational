Sorry, not trying to take your words the wrong way, it just reads to me like a /relative/ flaw rather than an absolute one.

It definitely is a failure mode for the system, and Red brought it up himself in his question of "what about research that doesn't generate enough interest for funding." It's not meant to be framed as a perfect system, just a better one, either mostly or purely.
