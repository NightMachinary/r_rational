I would add the additional caveat that the author often has plots that are very interesting in their basic concept, but get dragged down but stuff like power-level inflation, random side characters, and harem-genre tropes. Likewise, the author has lots of characters that could be interesting (Index has a lot of potential), but get ignored in favor of introducing more random side characters, who in turn are ignored for new characters right as they start to get interesting themselves, or they are ignored for super bland characters (i.e. Touma to some extent, but Hamazura is a tumor of blandness and plot armor that needs to die or be ignored).
