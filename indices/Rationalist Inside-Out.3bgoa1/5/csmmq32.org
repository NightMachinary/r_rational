It would be one eight year old humanoid avatar inside a grimdark Jurassic World mental setting. Mostly pools full of mindless fish and hungry, scurrying, scared little mammals. Oh, and somewhere a clever little lizard with delusions of grandeur, stomping all over everything. It's barely cadged, and sometimes the power to the park defenses goes down, or the one lone frightened human has to venture into the greater park area to fix something that breaks, and leave the neat little tourist concession stands that do nothing but provide her with empty comforts.
