Boring is usually the term to use. Show up, eat, chat maybe a little, slip out when you've had enough. Especially with that many people, you ought to be able to bail just about anytime.

My only contribution to industry differences is that the type of company to throw a big event is the kind of company who thinks that by so doing they don't have to pay as much, since after all, fun is a compensation of sorts, right? The best companies I've worked for don't have events (outside of maybe buying lunch from time to time) because they respect us enough to just pay us and not try to be all buddy buddy.
