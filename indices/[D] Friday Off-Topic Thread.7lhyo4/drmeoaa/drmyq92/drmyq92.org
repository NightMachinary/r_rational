If I've got nothing better to do or someone to hang out with, I might go for the food, maybe participate in a few things that seem fun, then leave early unless I have a compelling reason to stay.

People who don't know how to take a "no" very quickly lose the privilege of deserving truth from me, and start to get answers that will make them explicitly in the wrong to keep pressing afterward, like "I can't, I'll be out of town on a quick trip to visit family" or "I've got a family member in from out of town, who I rarely get to see" or similar.
