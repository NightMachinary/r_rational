  And finally, how to avoid answering questions that I don't want to answer because I find them to be too personal -- without offending the people throwing those questions (who may or may not be looking for a reasons to get offended)?

Just lie. If someone asks personal questions they have no business knowing the answers to, just make up crap. Practice with the easy stuff. Always lie about your age, birthday, middle name, etc. Never answer truthfully questions about your family. These aren't your friends, they aren't part of your social circle, they have no business knowing any of this crap.
