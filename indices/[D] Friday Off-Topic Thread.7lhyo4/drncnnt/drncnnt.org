Two days before Christmas, two days and a week before 2018. I'm mostly taking a vacation and being burned out (only one day before I get back to Paris, yaaaaaay!), but I've been thinking about my New Year resolutions, and I want to write my thoughts down.

I feel like I've been getting into a rut last school year. The excitement of being in a coding school, working on actually interesting projects has faded, the projects have started to feel less like challenges and more like /work/; same thing for my internships.

Since September, I've been trying to get myself back into the mindset of having dreams and working to achieve them. I've started to work on my video game project and to exercise regularly, but next year I'd like to pick up the pace permanently.

Wildbow's advice for personal projects is "do something and stick to it"; where you commit to following a schedule, and over time you gain enough momentum that it's harder to break your record than to keep going. I've never managed to get into that kind of momentum for more than a few weeks. I'm going to try again in 2018, hopefully taking into account the errors of the past and all that.

Which means I need to figure out what I want to have achieved by the end of 2018. My tentative list is:

- Learn about important computer science fields: system administration, networking, machine learning, package managers, sandboxed package managers, computer graphics, modern UI, and advanced programming language theory.

- Get a distributed network of back-ups and VMs so I don't have to constantly re-install everything.

- Release a playable, "I would pay money for this"-grade version of The Tesseract Engine.

- Participate on at least one Open-Source project; I'm leaning between Atom, Dlang and Battle for Wesnoth.

- Learn about and learn to use as many useful applications as I can; whether phone apps, web apps, Windows apps, or browser extensions. Learn about and set up self-hosted versions of apps I already use.

- Work with a friend on one productive project per month. These projects would be anything from blog posts, RPG scenarios, drawings, mini-webcomics, animations, small games, small maps for a game editor, fanfics, etc. Every project would have a hard one-month deadline, after which we'd switch to something else.

- Keep exercising on a regular basis. Practice parkour out of a gymnasium on a regular basis (I've only done it indoor so far).

Also, learn at least three music instruments, two martial arts, six foreign languages and star in the lead role of a box-office Hollywood movie.

Seriously though, I think I have a fair shot at keeping to at least half of these resolutions. I'm trying to find commitment mechanisms that are more opt-out than opt-in, and to set myself up with reliable friends who will keep me working when my motivation falters. A lot of it depends on what I manage to get done in the two next months of free time I have (January and February); whether or not I manage to get on the right track.

By the way, The Tesseract Engine updates will resume next Saturday :)
