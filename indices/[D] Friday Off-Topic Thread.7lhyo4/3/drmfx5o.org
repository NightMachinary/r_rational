Weekly update on the [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/11QAh61C8gsL-5KbdIy5zx3IN6bv_E9UkHjwMLVQ7LHg/edit?usp=sharing][hopefully rational]] roguelike [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbyTOAlhRHk][immersive sim]] Pokemon Renegade, as well as the associated engine and tools.

Some actual code progress!  I finally was willing to admit that I had bitten off more than I could chew in selecting Ember and Symantic UI, so I tried to figure out what to move to next.  I considered just doing it all in Unity targeting WebGL, WebForms in ASP.NET, and saying screw the web and just doing it in a mono-friendly WinForms app.  You might (or might not) notice that all of these are in C#; I was certainly pining for something familiar.

After about a day's worth of waffling I sucked it up and took the recommendation of some of the kind-hearted souls on Discord and just started doing basic html/javascript using first bootstrap and then jquery/jqueryUI.  It was certainly nice to have a system simple enough that problems were obvious again, and throwing things together has been much faster:

So not much to look at, but functional (for all of the two things it can currently do).  Now that I have a foundation to iterate on, and a workflow that, well, works, things ought to move much more smoothly. Over the next couple of weeks I think I can (with the help of our friendly neighborhood Discord) knock out a decent visual port of the old Bill's PC and start hammering out some functionality.  I'll also get a web server set up, I think, so that people can start tinkering and offering feedback.

I'm going to skip next week's update, since we've got both Christmas and New Year's coming up.  See you in 2018!
