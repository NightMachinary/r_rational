Hey, reread HPMOR either way, it's great. I've done it like a few dozen times over the past 3 years.

Also, H - I can't even bring myself to type that, it just looks /sooo/ terrible - that acronym you used there has the full word "patio" in it. I strongly prefer HPIO. I'm just sayin', y'know? Nobody calls HPMOR "HPATMOR" lol

Seriously though, thanks, I'm glad at least a few people are looking forward to it, I promise this fic isn't going to end up being abandoned, I just made its existence known to the public about a year too early. If you haven't looked at it in a while, it's been edited significantly in the past few months. I actually edited it again in the middle of this very comment, between typing this sentence and the last sentence.
