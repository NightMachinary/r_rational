I said many months ago that I was going to release the first 10 chapters of /Harry Potter and the Irrational Odyssey/ all at once on Christmas day. That's three days from now.

- We've been trying to sell our house for the last two months. At one point I tiled and grouted the kitchen floor all on my own and I got sick of it by the last day so I sped through the grouting, but that requires a lot of force to force the grout between the tiles, so I impinged my shoulder or pulled my rotator cuff or something and couldn't lift my right arm for like two weeks. Not, like, lift it up over my head, I mean lift it from its resting position at my side. It was excruciatingly painful. It's still sore most of the time right now, and it's been over a month since I regained full range of motion.

- TMI, but I've had an internal hemorrhoid for like two weeks.

- Also, stress and seasonal affective disorder and sh*tty life circumstances don't make good bedfellows.

I haven't been mentally and emotionally in the right headspace to edit. I don't just need to go through and line edit and clean it up, I need to do developmental editing, restructure things at the plot level. I'm just not willing to put out what I have right now, it's not "there" yet, and it's mostly the fault of chapters two and three. Those two chapters are going to make or break /the entire story/. I've been working on this goddamn thing for over two and a half years at this point and I'm not willing to eff it all up now just for the sake of meeting an arbitrary deadline that most people aren't even aware of in the first place.

Sorry to disappoint the maybe like 0.01% of you who read this comment and felt disappointment.

I'm going back to binge-watching Stranger Things now.
