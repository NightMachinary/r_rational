Hmm. This does not seem to me a satisfactory answer to the question of "Why not join the Discord to continue having these discussions" if the source of distress is that you want to still be able to have conversations about politics with rational people.

If instead your main concern is that people you've had discussions with have openly mocked your suffering and seem unable to engage in reasonable discussion, then you should be trying to avoid those conversations or people as much as possible. I suggest blocking them, as engaging with them sounds like a waste of time at best and actively masochistic at worse.

If their very /existence in the world/ is what's causing you distress, like you cannot have peace as long as you share a planet with people that vile and unreasonable, that is the much more important thing you need to figure out how to address than how you should feel about the subreddit ban.
