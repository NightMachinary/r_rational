I think we have different ideas of what an ideal forum is like, but I'll offer two points (personally, mod hat off here):

- empirically, moderator-less voting does not work at scale to keep an active subreddit on topic, and they tend to devolve into general community spaces and then low-effort memes. Essentially, there is no /distinctive/ will of the majority related to particular topics, even if many people would like a topic-specific space. One of the mechanisms that users can use, as a supplement to voting, is... moderators! [this is how AlexanderWales was added and eaturbrainz moved down the list]

- almost all of our users arrived under the current moderation policies, and all of them have stayed. I think this is at least partly attributable to the moderation. If you think a different policy would be better, I encourage you to start a new forum for it and let users decide which to use!
