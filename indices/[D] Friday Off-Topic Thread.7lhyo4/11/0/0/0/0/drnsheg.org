I mean, I made a post and responded to a few other people, then came back at the end of the day to discover hundreds of comments that got pretty uncivil so people just threw up their hands and called it off.

I have depression so of course I immediately blamed myself for all of it, but even if that weren't the case I still wouldn't feel wronged by the mods. They aren't obligated to give me what I want when they never promised it to me.
