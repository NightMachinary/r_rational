You are not to blame for what anyone does or say. The question you asked about ideological purity/rights and whether or not it should apply to people who oppose it was a fair and valid topic to discuss.

I would say that you shouldn't feel regret or guilt for bringing it up. The fallout is on everyone who said unpleasant things. Also the discussion didn't seem too terrible, but rather it was just the last straw in a long line of political discussions leading to an unhappy conclusion.
