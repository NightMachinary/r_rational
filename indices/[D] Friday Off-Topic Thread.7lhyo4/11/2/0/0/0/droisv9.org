Yes, absolutely - that discussion was not unusual in any way, I just happened to have seen too many dissolve into non-communication lately.

[[/u/trekie140][u/trekie140]], please don't feel guilty - (a) it wasn't your fault; (b) you were quite reasonable in both content and tone, and (c) this particular discussion was not particularly upsetting. The rules change is a recognition of persistent collective failure, /not/ a reaction to that specific thread!
