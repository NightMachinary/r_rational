I'd prefer the creation of a politics weekly thread or more probably a politics top-level comment that's automatically made on each Friday off-topic thread under which all political discussion must be contained. From time to time I enjoy discussing politics. It disappoints me that this is no longer a possibility on this subreddit.

That being said, I have seen bad expansions of politics into places where it ought not to go (such as the Monday General Rationality Thread) and I understand the rationale behind the ban. It's certainly simplest to go with an outright ban.
