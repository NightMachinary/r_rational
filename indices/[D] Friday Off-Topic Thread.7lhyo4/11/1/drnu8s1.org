Huh, I'd wondered at that particular ban. So you're the culprit!

Lol, but seriously, mind giving me a summary on what exactly went down? I find it somewhat impressive that a topic in a sub based on rationality was so divisive that the mods banned it. Like we could probably discuss the relative merits of bestiality and not get that topic banned, so I was very curious to hear about American politics getting the axe.
