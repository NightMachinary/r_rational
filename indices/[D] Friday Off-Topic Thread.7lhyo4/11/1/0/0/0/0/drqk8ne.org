Specifically propaganda? IMO no. What /did/ happen was off-topic discussions that led to me being called in to moderate, at least once a week for more than a month.

And please note that we haven't banned discussion of politics! There are six-and-a-bit continents^{*} full of interesting political events, and even larger scope for (rationalist?) fictional politics.

^{*} depending on how you count Antarctica, Canada, and Mexico

To summarise, I put a fairly high value on keeping [[/r/rational]] as a neutral venue as far as possible consistent with the aim of discussing and promoting rational[ist] fiction. Discussion specifically of US politics was harming that without commensurate benefit and is banned. Blanket bans are themselves also quite harmful, of course, and I do not want or anticipate ever needing to institute another. So /custodiet ipsos custodes/, Noumero, and if in doubt just send us a modmail (or start [[/r/rationalusapolitics]]!)
