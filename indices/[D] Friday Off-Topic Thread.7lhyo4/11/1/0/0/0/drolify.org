Sure, but did that happen on /this/ subreddit? At all, or frequently enough to warrant such measures? Or is there any reason to pre-emptively stop it from /possibly/ happening, at the cost of denying people the ability to discuss politics in a semi-sane environment?

I agree that political discussions turned notably divisive even here, and that /if/ "propagandistic shitposting" starts happening on [[/r/rational][r/rational]], a blanket ban would be a reasonable response. Still, I don't think that [[/r/rational][r/rational]]'s political discussions turned unpleasant enough to warrant this /so far/, whatever happens on other subreddits.

But... fine. I don't really care about USA politics, and there's [[/r/slatestarcodex][r/slatestarcodex]] for people who do. But I'm trying to be genre-savvy, so [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_they_came_...][I'll be keeping an eye on you, our Powers That Be]].^{1}
