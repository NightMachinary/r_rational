[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7j2qas/d_monday_general_rationality_thread/dr3mk8b/][Nothing much.]] It was pretty civil, except that at one point [[/u/trekie140][u/trekie140]] looked through the opponent's post history and noticed thons participation on [[/r/The_Donald][r/The_Donald]], which u/trekie140 assumed makes thon inherently unsuitable for rational discourse. At that point [[/u/eaturbrainz][u/eaturbrainz]] posted in mod-colour, with every appearance of agreeing with u/trekie140 and declaring thons intent to look through u/trekie140's opponent's contributions to that thread "to see where the propagandistic shitposting begins". [[/u/CouteauBleu][u/CouteauBleu]] argued against u/eaturbrainz's possible abuse of moderator privileges; [[/u/PeridexisErrant][u/PeridexisErrant]] agreed with u/CouteauBleu, then suggested the ban, to u/CouteauBleu and u/eaturbrainz's agreement.

Personally, I think that blanket ban is an overreaction, but I didn't read all previous discussions (immediately prior to and immediately after Trump's election, for example), so maybe it's justified in the light of past incidents.
