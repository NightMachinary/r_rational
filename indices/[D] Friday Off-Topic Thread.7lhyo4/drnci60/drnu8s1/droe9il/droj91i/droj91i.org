  Personally, I think that blanket ban is an overreaction, but I didn't read all previous discussions (immediately prior to and immediately after Trump's election, for example), so maybe it's justified in the light of past incidents.

As a mod of other subs, I've had to deal with propagandistic shitposting before (Likudnik rather than Trumpist). /It was unpleasant./ I'd rather have a blanket ban we can enforce without trouble than have to spend my own time writing constant little notes to some absolute jackass arguing about why one propaganda post is intellectual enough to fit on the sub and another is too shitposty and got removed.
