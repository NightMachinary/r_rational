If you are feeling guilty and want to do something to make up for it, I recommend sending PMs to apologize or to say that you have no hard feelings against others and that you just wanted to clear the air so no one is uncomfortable on this subreddit. Maybe look back at the comments to see what mistakes you made and what you could do differently in the future?

Hope this helped.
