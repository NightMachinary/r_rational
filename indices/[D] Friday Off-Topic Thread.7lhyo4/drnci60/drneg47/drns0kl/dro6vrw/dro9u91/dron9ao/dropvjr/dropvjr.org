I had forgotten about blocking, that would make things easier. I think I will join the discord, I've calmed down since we last spoke. It's not so much the /existence/ of evil that hurts, but being reminded of it and my inability to do anything about it.

I face crushing despair every day, the key to coping with it is focusing on something else. So for the past few days I've just stopped thinking about politics. It helps that I've been too mentally exhausted to think about anything.
