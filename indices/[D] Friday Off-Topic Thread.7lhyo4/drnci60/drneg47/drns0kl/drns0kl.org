Because I was trying to have a discussion with rational people about very important beliefs that I'm questioning before I put them into practice, and it resulted in the mods declaring I can no longer discuss them on this sub.

I can't help but feel singled out by a community I identify with. That's why I've been afraid to post anything here since the ban. I also still haven't found a satisfactory answer to the question I asked and don't have another community of critical thinkers to turn to.
