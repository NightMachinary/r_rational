  The purpose of moderation is to remove items that obstruct on-topic discussion. However, on a platform like Reddit, much moderation is redundant, because the users can moderate themselves with upvotes and downvotes. A person that dislikes political discussion can downvote and hide it because it isn't relevant to the thread or to the subreddit.

This is not the case. Unmaintained, vote-only subreddits deteriorate into what you see on the default front page - the voting mechanism is not strong enough to keep subreddits unique. People make too many exceptions for "this doesn't belong here, but I agree with it".

I think it's important that some subreddits are loosely moderated; but also that more niche ones are moderated much more invasively. In th end, if the moderation of a subreddit doesn't agree with many people, they will make their own fork.
