The purpose of moderation is to remove items that obstruct on-topic discussion. However, on a platform like Reddit, much moderation is redundant, because the users can moderate /themselves/ with upvotes and downvotes. A person that dislikes political discussion can downvote and hide it because it isn't relevant to the thread or to the subreddit.

  Many people don't bother to consider relevancy when deciding whether or not they should upvote or downvote a [[http://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7jj0h5][submission]] or comment, and instead vote based on whether or not they like the item.

If the users don't want their discussion to be constrained to a single topic, why should the moderators impose it on them? Maybe this is representative of a transition from a distinct, topic-defined subreddit to a vague, community-defined subreddit. Anyone who doesn't like this transition can upvote and downvote to oppose it, and can leave if he's overborne by the will of the majority.
