Oh no, quite the opposite: appealing to a niche is the best way to pick up initial views. So you can just say "paranormam romance slash" (albeit more elegantly) and immediatelly convince the contigent of readers who like that stuff to check it out. That lets you use the rest of the summary to draw in the people who don't necessarily like yaoi, but might overlook it to get what they want.

I did something quite similar a while back-- I knew the contigent of readers who liked log horizon would be so starved of content they'd read basically whatever I wrote, so I was free to jam all the rational/transhumanist appeal I wanted into my fic to (hopefully) capture that audience as well. (But also, I confess, for author appeal.)

Really, probably the best example of this stuff is eaglejarl's work. I know going in that there's going to be polyamory, and in all likelyhood a long author's tract about how its great, but I can tolerate that because I'm hankering for all the other elements he puts in his work.
