Second mostly independent point, but you know how they always say, "grades aren't everything. Lots of people who do really well in school aren't successful". I really worry that's me sometimes. I know I can get all A's if I work hard enough in almost everything. The only class where I really didn't feel like that was true was German. I can get an A. I know the steps to doing it and and general despite my focus and motivation problems I even manage it the vast majority of the time. I'm not sure how to translate that into life in general sometimes.

OK back to work now.
