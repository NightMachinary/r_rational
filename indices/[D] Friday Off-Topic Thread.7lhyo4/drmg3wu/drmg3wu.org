Is it too soon to talk about The Last Jedi?

Screw it. I'm talking about The Last Jedi. To be more precise, I want /to talk about talking about movie/, because the discussion of the film is filled with fallacious reasoning and hardly any communication despite the enormous quantity of dialogue occuring.

First, a disclaimer: I never watched any trailers and wasn't spoiled on anything which happened before I saw it. Even so, I personally didn't like the film very much, but that's mostly because I didn't like The Force Awakens or anything it did with the franchise. However, I really do feel that The Last Jedi did many things which only exacerbated those problems without actually doing much that was "courageous and praiseworthy".

Anyway, here's what I've observed of the film's reception, both online and offline:

- The film is truly polarizing. By the time credits roll, you have a pretty strong opinion of whether it was a good movie or not. This seems to be by design, and if so the creators certainly succeeded. However, this quality also means that there is very little middle ground to be had.

- There are/were vocal hate-mobs on both sides. It's stupid but true, and definitely colored the immediate reception and discussion of the film moving forward.

- The original Star Wars trilogy is more of a sacred cow than ever This is one of my biggest dislikes of the new trilogy. If someone says "it's like poetry, it rhymes" one more time, /I am going to vomit/.

- The movie has high highs and low lows. Liking or disliking the movie largely depends on which one outweighs the other for you.

With that out of the way, let me talk about somewhat spoiler-y things:

I don't have the heart to go on. The two sides are continuously talking past each other. It's nonsense. Reading [[/r/StarWars]] is an exercise in futility these days.

At least the memes are good.
