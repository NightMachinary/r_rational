You could change your tag to something that will let anyone who is waiting on the release know that it isn't coming anytime soon while being meaningless to anyone else, something like "thermonuclear magical girls indefinitely delayed", that way to everyone who doesn't know about your story it looks like a reference to a fic they haven't read.
