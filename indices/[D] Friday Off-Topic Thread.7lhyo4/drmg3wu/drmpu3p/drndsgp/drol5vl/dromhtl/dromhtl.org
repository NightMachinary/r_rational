  One of the themes of The Last Jedi is the need for leaders rather than heroes.

What? The Last Jedi in no way had that theme. There was some dialog early on that made you think that it would, but that dialog gets contravened since in literally every scenario, personal heroism won the day, it didn't actually had that theme. The masterminds (Leia, Snoke, the purple-haired lady whose name I forget, the FO general) had their contributions dwarfed by the personal prowess of the characters who actually got the majority of the screen time. Snoke gets offed by Kylo, not some elaborate plot. The purple-haired lady's plan to save the fleet only works because she goes full kamikaze, rather than any tactical genius. Leia does no leading when unconscious.

This star wars movie, just like all the previous ones, has a theme about how the actions of a few are what end up deciding everything. Incidentally, that's not a theme I like (because despite your protestations, themes are subject to personal taste), but one I tolerate because it's so omnipresent I'd have ignore the majority of works if I wasn't willing to consume stuff including it.
