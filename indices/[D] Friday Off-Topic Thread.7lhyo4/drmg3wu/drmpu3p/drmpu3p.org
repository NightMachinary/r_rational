Congratulations Rian Johnson, you've done the impossible: You made /Revenge of the Sith/ look good.

I have a list of grievances with this movie longer than my arm, but topping the list is this:

#+begin_quote
  Darth Vader in /A New Hope/: The power of the Death Star is nothing compared to the power of the Force.

  Luke Skywalker in /The Last Jedi/: The power of the Force is nothing compared to the power of the First Order.

As for people /telling me why I hate it/... screw you guys. I hate it 'cause it's bad, and I can develop a very extensive case for why this is. Bad storytelling, poor characterization, stupid messages and themes. What's confusing is the [[https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/star_wars_the_last_jedi][92% of professional critics]] who gave positive reviews. I'm not sure whether it's kinder to suppose they're lying, or that they have bad taste. I suspect they're trying to rate the movie as they think a fan would rate it, but not being fans, they really can't.
