Modular origami provides an easy way to make gifts that look /significantly/ more impressive than they actually are. You don't even need to be an expert in paperfolding.

0. Get a few hundred Post-It Notes (or generic square sticky notes). (Tip: It's okay if the side lengths are unequal by a millimeter or two, but any worse discrepancy means you should look for a better brand of sticky notes.)\\
1. Make a [[https://www.origami-resource-center.com/waterbomb-base.html][waterbomb base]] with a sticky note. (Tip: Start with the adhesive strip on your right side and stuck to your folding surface. Use valley folds for the diagonals, then take the paper off the surface and into your hands and make the first non-diagonal fold by squashing the paper up all at once. Rotate the wings around and repeat for the other non-diagonal fold.)\\
2. Make a [[https://www.origami-resource-center.com/preliminary-base.html][preliminary base]] with another sticky note. (Tip: Follow Step 1, then invert the result.)\\
3. Slide the preliminary base on top of the waterbomb base. Try to ensure a snug fit---but not /too/ snug. (Tip: The preliminary base should have its adhesive strip on the inside of one edge. Fit the edges of the preliminary base to the wings of the waterbomb base in this order: First, the one with adhesive; second, the opposite edge; third, the other two edges.)\\
4. Fold the protruding corners of the preliminary base inward, over the edges of the waterbomb base. This is a /module/.\\
5. Repeat steps 1 through 4 until you've made twelve modules. (Tip: /Do not/ stop at eight modules and try to make a square antiprism or a gyrobifastigium in Step 6. The angles will be too tight, and the finished model will look bad.)\\
6. Assemble the modules into a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuboctahedron][cuboctahedron]] by sliding the tips of the waterbomb bases underneath the edges of the preliminary bases. (Tip: If a connection is difficult, /be gentle/. This goes /double/ for the insertion of the final module.)

Steps 1 through 6 should consume about 45 minutes. Examples of the final product can be viewed [[https://boards.4chan.org/po/thread/558840#p559188][here]].

I feel as if two people could have fun with criticizing each other's pornography collections in detail.

  Ugh. Why did you even bother to /save/ this photo? That bikini looks absolutely horrendous.

  Duh, that's exactly why I saved it---for laughing, not fapping. Look at the fat bulging around the edges, as if she were a gelatinous cube in a corridor two sizes too small!

  That basketball player looks /terrible/. I hate those "sweat" and "armpit odor" telltales.

  Well, so do I---but, in this particular drawing, I found that the body and the clothes overrode the minor details.

  Hmm... I can see your point, I guess.

  Why have you labeled all these images =futanari= when they include testicles? That's incorrect, you idiot.

  I prefer the ones without testicles, but I stopped particularly caring literally /years/ ago. I just assume/pretend that each one that has balls also has an axe wound hidden behind them.
