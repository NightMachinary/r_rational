The vast majority of the stuff you talked about I un/fortunately have no reference frame for, so I'll address the one thing I do have some ideas about.

  I am aware how unachievable this is, but I want my supernatural romance thing I'm writing to become the next Harry Potter. However I don't think I care enough about this goal to put the time / money into it that would be required so I am mostly content: but I feel I should mention this?

The idea I get, looking at the relatively-recent crop of massively successful, trendsetting books (e.g. harry potter, hunger games, twilight) is that they share a number of qualities:

1. They have widespread age appeal. Your book should be, in effect, PG-13. You don't need to get 8-9 year olds in your net (they don't buy books anyways) but you should have something that precocious 11 year olds want to read, without being so aimed towards kids that middle aged people don't read it. This is a bit of a truism, to be fair, because if it was easy to make your book appeal to everyone, everyone would do that. But hyper-popular novels seem to follow a few guidelines: cursing should be censored, fantasy-fied (Odin's nutsack!), or used very sparingly; sex scenes shouldn't be in the first book, and should be fade-to-black or be extremely vague; violence should be thrilling, rather than graphic; no puzzle that readers are expected to solve should require education beyond a straight-C high schooler; and no moral conflict should have more than three sides (the viewpoint character's side, the antagonist's side, and optionally an "objectively right/wrong" side).

2. They contain escapism tailored towards the era these books were released in. Different varieties of escapism work under different circumstances. The hunger games started getting released around the time of the financial crisis, so the rebellion of the lower classes against the exploitative bourgeois resonated. Twilight has similarities, in the sense that the vampires are rich as shit and don't have financial issues. I can't really speak about harry potter (I'm not qualified to do in-depth analysis of the late 90's) but you can look at a lot of fiction released in the wake of either the great recession, or earlier, 9/11 that provide a way for readers to escape from the realities of the world we find ourselves in.

3. They have widespread genre appeal. To make a truly popular work, you need to appeal to the greatest amount of people possible. That means an action/adventure plot with a romance subplot (or a romance plot with an action/adventure subplot), plus a dash of slice of life for decompressing after action scenes. The amount of romance versus action should be tuned based on whether you're trying to apply to a predominantly male or female readerbase, with the understanding that men are stereotypically less tolerant of romance than women are of action.

4. They're the trope codifiers, not the trope creators. There were magic academies before Harry Potter, postapocalyptic YA dystopian novels before Hunger Games, and vampire supernatural romances before Twilight. But what these novels did was take an existing genre, and codify it so well as to make it mainstream. More recent works in their respective genres are now compared to those works, not necessarily because those works are shining beacons of quality writing, but because those works did such a good job of assembling the right components together, and welding them together into a cohesive, commercializable whole.

5. Extending from #4, while these works were at the forefront of new fad genres, these works weren't the first works in their genres to get attention. The genres they belonged to were already making headway and already attracting readers; and these works took advantage of that to get initial publicity, and helped the genres reach critical mass. Let's look at rational fiction, a much smaller phenomenon, for comparison. With stuff like Clarke's third law gaining prominence, we've already been seeing much more intelligent worldbuilding in recent works. Works like HPMoR and Worm didn't singlehandedly cause a revolution. Instead, they took advantage or an existing trendline, and then crystallized these trends into a recognizable formula-- the rational/ist fic-- and in turn, these books get more famous as people read other works in the genre because they're so central to it already.

So in sum, to become a worldwide hit, a work should follow the following strategy:

1. Find an up-and-coming genre that's still underground (for now.)
2. Write a work that codifies the genre in its modern state
3. Tweak it so it's maximally commercializable.
4. Hope you roll a nat 20. If not, restart from step 1.

Note that nowhere on this list is advice about writing /well/. Because the thing is, only writers really care that something is written well-- most everyone else just wants to be entertained. You need technical accuracy because easily apparent mistakes will cause you to lose credibility, but you don't need to write /Infinite Jest/ to get popular.

Now, the question is, can your paranormal romance fulfil these criterion? And even if it can, do you want it to? Targeting a niche market can be both less risky and more (emotionally, albeit not necessarily financially) rewarding.
