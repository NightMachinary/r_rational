Thanks for that, it was a wonderful post and a great writeup about "how to be JK Rowling" and has basically put into words while I'll never be able to do that: much like someone who sings in the shower and dreams of being on stage but doesn't want to go to the effort of attending open mics, taking vocal coaching, etc, I just want the stupid crap I'm going to spit out naturally to somehow be met with reverence and awe that I've done no work to earn. So, I will stick to singing in the shower :)

So yeah, my writing project is going to be a vanity project and I might chuck up to $1,000 into it to get some fancy covers / professional editing / vanity print a copy or two. More realistically goal-wise I will honestly feel like I've reached a huge measure of success if I get 10% of the following animorphs the reckoning has, or sell, like, 10 copies on Kindle to people I don't already know.

The big problem is, again, I don't want to do the work, I'm that wanky artist sort of persona who wants to produce stuff to make themselves happy rather than to make ends meet. I've lurked [[/r/selfpublish]] for a while and it's insane all the time, money and effort that it takes to publish a book (things beyond what you've already laid out, because once you have written an awesome story that ticks all the boxes you have to market the hell out of it so that way someone will pick the damn thing up...).
