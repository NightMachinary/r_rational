  We joke that the whole thing is slash fiction of something that is actually good.

Yeah, it being slash unfortunately kills any chance of mass market appeal-- hetero men basically won't read it, and a large contigent of the older-women population would prefer straight romance so they can self-insert. On the plus side, now that you know mass-market isn't in your future, you can maximize author appeal to no end! Good luck.

(That being said, see about self-publishing on amazon's service anyways. If dinosaur sex can make money, you almost certainly can too.)
