So what you're saying is I should make sure the summary doesn't mention the gay aspect at /all/ and then when the readers get up to the part with the kissing they go "ohh the main character wasn't feeling weird because Love Interest is a vampire, he's feeling weird because he wants to get into his pants" and then they go "damnit I want to know what happens...."

(I'm guessing more likely I'd be getting a bunch of angry reviews from those people along the lines of "this book is alright until the dudes start kissing, BEWARE")
