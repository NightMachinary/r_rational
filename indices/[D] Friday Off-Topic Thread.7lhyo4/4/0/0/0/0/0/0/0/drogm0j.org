The thing is, most of the time, readers of your book /won't/ be buying it. They'll be reading it for "free" with kindle unlimited (there's a flat monthly fee), and you'll get revenue depending on how far they read. So the trick is, you get a summary good enough (or with enough niche appeal) to get people just browsing randomly to check out your work, and get the quality of your work high enough that those readers keep reading, and eventually advertise your book for you via word of mouth and 4/5 star ratings.

I've seen a bunch of ebooks on amazon that I would under no circumstances purchase, but would probably at least check out if I had a kindle unlimited subscription.

And as a tangent to that, while pretty much no straight male would /buy/ a yaoi work, speaking from my personal experience reading fanfiction, some might at least check it out if other parts of the story look interesting enough. They might drop it halway through, but you'll still have made money.
