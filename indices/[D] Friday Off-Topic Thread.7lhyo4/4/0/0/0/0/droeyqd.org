The niche is gonna be "Me and my BFF" (who is also the coauthor).

More generally it's probably some sort of general female empowerment niche that is hitting all the "strong female character" that is happening these days - though what I'm working on now has very few female characters, sigh.

It's in a weird place because it's both got very elaborate worldbuilding and vampire powers that make sense (if I do say so myself) but it's mostly focused on characters me and my BFF think are cute couples getting together and smooching. We joke that the whole thing is slash fiction of something that is actually good.

I /do/ want to see if I can make my fairly-hard-to-munchkin gargoyle (think: golem/can be given orders that he follows) be munchkined into a paper clip maximiser temporarily. He's sentient and lived among humans a long time, so he's able to use his knowledge and experience of humanity to avoid basic level papperclipper... but I am going to move this line of thought to the munchkinry thread.
