  So... a copy of my resume? Here's my list of skills in my resume:

I meant it as "What else could you do if you quit your job?", but sure.

I definitely get the urge to just... get more skills, even if they don't directly translate into a new job or raise. Consulting does seem pretty in line with your other objectives, money aside.

Have you seriously explored that possibility? Maybe you've left it aside on general principles, but if you looked deeper into it you'd find a better-paying consulting market for your skills or something? (I'm kind of grasping at straws here; your life seems optimized beyond my abilities to give useful advice)

Joyeux NoÃ«l!
