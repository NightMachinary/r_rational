I've not seriously explored the possibility of consulting, I probably should. I'm not sure how to even start, unfortunately. I have a friend who is an IT consultant and I might pick her brain about it. I think I'd love to do some sort of nutrition consulting online (diet plans or something), though I don't have a qualification for it. Then again 90% of nutritionists are less qualified than I already am so maybe I should look into it. I wonder if any of them do work on Fiverr?

I've got 6 months before I earn my 3 months paid leave from my job so not going to think about leaving until I get that sweet sweet paid leave.

Well, apart from "similar job somewhere else", I'm good at cooking so I could probably do some sort of cafe type thing. I love trying new recipes so a food blog would be great but that's so much work and so unlikely to be liveable so put that in the "famous author" pile. I don't know. This sort of stuff was on 80,000 hours and I didn't take it seriously enough even though I really probably should given how I'm feeling right now.

That's like one of the nicest things anyone's ever said to me. I know I'm lucky and I have a great life on paper, I just wish I could be rich and famous but not put any work into becoming either of those things, you know? :P
