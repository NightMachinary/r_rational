  Once you have your government-approved paper of Being an Important Person, why would you ever go through the mind-numbing bureaucracy of university studying for another... what, 5 years?
#+end_quote

No idea. Mid-life crisis for that guy I guess. This post is probably my start at the same thing.

  Is that something that works well for a government career?
#+end_quote

Not really. But I like the hours in the government and the lack of bullshit that private companies have; though not all companies are the same.

  What are your marketable skills?

So... a copy of my resume? Here's my list of skills in my resume:

- Very experienced in project management, including scoping, budget management, design reviews, management of external contractors, and consultation with internal and external stakeholders
- Financial management skills, including managing budgets, forecasting expenditure, and reporting
- Aware of OSH policies and legal obligations, with experience on construction sites
- Able to prioritise, organise, and complete work within set time and manage conflicting demands
- Reliable in meeting deadlines and producing high-quality outputs
- Highly organised to complete projects on time and within budget, meeting scope and quality requirements
- Comfortable working in a team, including supporting others and seeking expert advice
- Skilled at thinking laterally and recognising opportunities to deliver projects in innovative ways
- Communication skills, including interpersonal skills, report writing, and preparation of contract documents
- Keen interest in technology and desire to use it to streamline processes and procedures
- Typing speed over 100 words per minute
- Good working knowledge of Microsoft Windows, GNU/Linux and macOS
- Familiar with the Microsoft Office suite (including Project and Access) and \LaTeX
- Familiar with programming, especially macros in Microsoft Excel
- Experienced with automating and simplifying existing processes
- Familiar with a variety of specialist software packages, including ArcGIS and AutoCAD
- Conversant in English (native), French (advanced), Italian (intermediate), Thai and Esperanto (novice)

Probably have others - I'm quite charismatic, really good at writing/communication, very quick at doing things, etc.

I really do enjoy project management. I also wish I was experienced enough to be able to make money consulting, set my own hours/etc, since that would be ideal - could work less, charge more for my services, and attend classes on the side. I think that might be something I could do with a dietetics qualification more than my engineering qualification.

I also think that there'd probably be some people who would think a dietician who is also a qualified traffic engineer is a big selling point, so I might be able to leverage that somehow? I'm sure there's a startup that would love me-in-5-years.
