Wait, is that something people do in real life? Once you have your government-approved paper of Being an Important Person, why would you ever go through the mind-numbing bureaucracy of university studying for another... what, 5 years?

  I am aware how unachievable this is, but I want my supernatural romance thing I'm writing to become the next Harry Potter

I'm guessing you know this, but you usually have to write at least one or two other works before you get your The New Harry Potter.

  I feel like I'd be happiest living an "independently wealthy" lifestyle where I just study a lot of different things and then work in the field for a while and then get bored and go learn new things

Is that something that works well for a government career?

When I think of "multi-class" life builds, I think of people working as independent or contractors, doing a lot of networking, etc. I have a friend who wants his future life to be like that. (I'm more after the "domain-specific Renaissance Man" ideal, personally)

What are your marketable skills?
