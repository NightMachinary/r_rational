Not sure what to do with my life and I think I should probably make a decision.

Current qualifications:

- Engineering degree and ~5 years experience in project management (traffic engineering)
- Computer science degree but with no coding experience
- Speak French OK (B1/B2)
- One third of a health degree (focus in nutrition)

Current work situation:

- Very stable full time government job with a boss I don't like working for very much
- Very likely to get an opportunity to work a very similar job in terms of pay/stability/etc by doing job
- Take 1 day a week off during semester times to study completely unrelated nutrition degree because I find it really interesting

Current academic situation:

- I've gotten a high distinction for every unit I've studied so far and per above I've finished a third of my course, which includes units across several difficulty levels but does not include much of the complex chemistry I'll be doing starting next year.

- For the most part I really enjoy it but assignment season can be very stressful

Current living situation:

- Poly, two stable partners (5 years / 10 years respectively)

- Really shitty house that has lost some but not value since we bought it, needs expensive repairs in the medium to long term, really just needs to be bulldozed

- Love the area we're living in

Current extended family situation:

- Me: Things are pretty good

- Partner #1: I hate his family for Complicated Reasons, but we're hopefully going to patch things up over the next 6 months

- Partner #2: His family doesn't accept us for being poly, his sister hates us, his parents side with her, it's very sad for all concerned.

Current financial situation:

- Me: earning a decent wage but taking a 30% pay cut to attend uni; essentially supporting the family

- Partner #1: Lost job this year, will be studying full time to be a maths teacher in 2018 and in 2019 will be fully qualified teacher with basically a guaranteed job. Comingled finances.

- Partner #2: Doing phD (his second but who's counting), not expected to earn money until 2020, doing part time data science job. Finances not combined, pays "board" to cover his room in the house and all groceries/bills. This is about half to a third of his weekly income.

My current general desires/stream of consciousness:

- I want to spend ~6 months in a francophone country and become fluent (C1/C2) in French, this is a childhood dream. Achievable: in the middle of next year I get 3 months of paid time off, I should be able to take that at 50% pay and make it six months. I am planning on taking this time in 2019 after P#1 has finished his teaching studies (both partners want to come with).

- I am aware how unachievable this is, but I want my supernatural romance thing I'm writing to become the next Harry Potter. However I don't think I care enough about this goal to put the time / money into it that would be required so I am mostly content: but I feel I should mention this?

- I just want to be able to do whatever I want without worrying about money but due to the household's financial situation I'm very much forced to keep working my engineering job.

- Although I'm studying "to be a dietician", I'm not sure I actually want to be a dietician in terms of what they actually /do/, even though that field is hugely varied (you can be clinical/hospital/corporate/public health/do online stuff/etc the possibilities are really endless). I just want to have the knowledge a dietician has.

- I probably want to do the 2.5 kids white picket fence thing and my government job is definitely the place to spend my reproductive period due to the excellent benefits

- I should probably do EA or earn to give or whatever?

- I feel like I'd be happiest living an "independently wealthy" lifestyle where I just study a lot of different things and then work in the field for a while and then get bored and go learn new things???? Or maybe I'd really enjoy being a housewife?? I like baking and wish I had time to keep the house clean????????

- I actually really enjoy project management but feel underworked in my current job, this is unlikely to change as I really struggle to get my boss to give me more work to do for some reason ???????

So yeah that's where I am at the moment. Going to take it one year at a time. Starting on the complicated chemistry units next year to work out if I even want to do organic chemistry for the next 6 years of my life. 2019 we'll do the France trip. Then in 2020 I'll have some idea what my white picket fence will look like...
