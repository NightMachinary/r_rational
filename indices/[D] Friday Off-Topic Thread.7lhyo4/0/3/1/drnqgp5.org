I feel like you misunderstood the "Jedi must end" theme. The audience is never supposed to /agree/ with it, we're supposed to root for Luke to /overcome/ it as his character arc for the film. Most people in the audience haven't succumbed to the bizzare "Jedi are just as bad as the Sith" fanwank that seems to be weirdly popular in the fandom.
