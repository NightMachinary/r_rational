yes, i know but if they already do such a thing to then later make it so luke only overcomes it then why even bother. When i see that this movie "did something new" i want to vomit. The status quo was still upheld. There will still be jedi and sith. It also would be more interesting to actually explore the whole "Last Jedi" thing and not only present it as another thing to overcome.
