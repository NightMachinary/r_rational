To use an allusion, the story is in development hell. It's not as feminine, magical, scientific, or happy as I wanted. It will eventually be written, because this specific story deserves to be told and I'm the one to do it, but it's not at all a project that I wake up in the morning desperately eager to work on. But I will! I haven't forgotten! I will!

Also I got a job on top of school and was diagnosed with severe depression, so that happened.
