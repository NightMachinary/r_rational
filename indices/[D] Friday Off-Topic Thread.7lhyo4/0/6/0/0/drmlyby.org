I apologize if it came across as accusatory or impatient: I merely wondered what happened to the project. You're entirely free to work on it until you're satisfied with the result, and I'm glad it's not stillborn.

I'm not sure if the quoted segment is an exaggeration or not, but in case it's not: I'm pretty sure that majority of people here share my view on this. Unless the dislike is caused by something else?
