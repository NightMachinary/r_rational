I have mixed feelings about TLJ. It's flawed, but I think I'd rank it in the top half of the "main sequence" SW movies (not counting /Rogue One/).

Here's the thing: a lot of common complaints (or variants thereof) about TLJ, could apply to /any/ of the SW movies, even the sacred original trilogy.

In the fiery trash heap that is TLJ discussion, I came across [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_3_W4GRb44][this very level-headed review]]. One of the narrator's best points, I thought, was this:

  Every /Star Wars/ movie sucks. I'm one of the biggest SW fans, but you gotta admit, this shit's dumb.

  But, it's still awesome.

  We just make different excuses for the SW movies that we enjoy.

  I've talked to people who hate TLJ, but then they say they love the prequels; they come up with all sorts of excuses for why those movies are good.

  Basically, this is the kind of series where you really need to just accept the dumb stuff, and enjoy the stuff you like.

It's disappointing to see people throwing such extreme hate towards TLJ. It's perfectly fine if you don't like it, but you can't point at every flaw in the movie for reasons why it's "bad", while ignoring similar (or much bigger!) flaws in the SW movies you like.

/Empire/'s one of my favorite movies of all time, and is now critically acclaimed, but it's got plenty of problems. Heck, when it first came out, [[http://www.nytimes.com/1980/06/15/movies/moviesspecial/15EMPI.html][the New York Times reviewed it as boring and pointless]].
