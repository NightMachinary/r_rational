There were so many utterly baffling things about the movie. I feel like my recollection of the other entries in the series is inaccurate enough that I can't really judge its relative merit, but I didn't come away with a great overall impression.

There was one moment in particular that immediately undercut all the explanations for the way things played out in previous movies. No spoilers here, but regulars here may work out what I'm referencing.

Imagine if, in the sixth book of Harry Potter, Harry used his dose of Felix Felicis (liquid luck) to devise an improved version of the potion, iterating upon it until he had attained an alchemical Path to Victory.

The audience would probably have otherwise assumed that that wouldn't work, even if no explicit reason for that was apparent. After all, if the solution was so easy, why was it not already done? Why didn't the Order of the Phoenix use it, why didn't Voldemort? And now that the secret is out there, won't everybody just do that all the time? Shouldn't this massively change the world of Harry Potter?

The new Star Wars movie has a moment like that. I can only assume some writer needed a way to get themselves out of a corner, but in doing so they made so many triumphant moments of the series seem utterly pointless.

I think Star Wars, especially Disney Star Wars, isn't really my style any more.
