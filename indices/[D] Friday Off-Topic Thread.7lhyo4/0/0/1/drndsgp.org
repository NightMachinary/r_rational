Personally speaking, while not a fan of star wars in general (I've only seen bits and peices of the original movies, and read through a novelization of #3 ages ago, but most of what I know is through cultural osmosis), I've loved the 3 most recent films. Part of that's just the fact that I fetishize dogfighting (Poe is easily my favorite character), but the rest of it is for reasons I suspect fans would feel the exact opposite about.

Number one: Rei. I like that she's a competent character who drives her own plot, makes her own decisions, and in general is a "strong independent woman who don't need no man +except kylo ren+." In that sense, she reminds me of Taylor from Worm or Catherine from A Practical Guide to Evil, works I am also very much a fan of. Sure, she takes up a lot of attention from the plot, but that's fine because she's a deuteragonist anyways, but I think that attention is well deserved because of her tendency to be proactive. It's for those same reasons that fans think she's such a mary sue, and maybe she is. But I'm signficantly more tolerant of mary-sue-ness than most fans would be, so it's a non-issue for my enjoyment.

Number two: plot similarities to the original star wars trilogy. This one is pretty simple. Fans aren't very interested in seeing the exact same story repackaged, but I'm seeing this plotline play out for the very first time (excepting for all the other hero's journeys I've seen, anyways), and the CGI and SFX is miles better than the originals.

Number three: thematic issues. I personally haven't spent enough time talking to fans to understand why they don't like the themes in rogue one, but for me it's fundamenally a non-issue. There are a number of themes that I disdain (anti-technology hippy dippy stuff, predestination, and of course the laundry list of stuff I'd vote against at the ballot box), but aside from that I'm willing to swallow a lot. A /good/ theme enhances the story, but otherwise I just ignore thematic elements. For reference, I enjoyed Sucker Punch purely on the basis on its fight scenes. That being said, the whole "actiony characters taking action" thing (Rei, Finn, Poe) thing /is/ a theme I enjoy, so I'm all for it.

Overall, The two main-series star wars films have been (depending on how I'm feeling at the moment) 7.5-8.5/10 films for me (would recommend to a friend; would recommend they shell out to see them in theatres) and Rogue One was an 8-9/10 film for me.
