Ah, yes. Just so. /The Last Jedi/ takes this away, doesn't it?

/Themes/ shouldn't be things one agrees or disagrees with. They aren't /policy preferences/. One of the themes of /The Last Jedi/ is the need for leaders rather than heroes. I'm fine with that theme /in isolation/. But not in *the middle of a freakin' heroic tale*! The story ends up undercutting it's own theme (like when Rose stops Finn from his suicide run against the cannon; she saves him from his heroics at the cost of everyone else's lives).
