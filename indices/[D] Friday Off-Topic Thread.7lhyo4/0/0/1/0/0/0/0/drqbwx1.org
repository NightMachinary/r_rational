  In literally every instance, personal heroics led the resistance to its destruction. When they end with numbers in the single digits, it's hard to say that "the day was saved". Every time someone tries to do something heroic, their actions made the situation worse and brought defeat closer.

  Let's go with that same case: purple-haired lady's plan to save the fleet. She fuels up the transports so that the resistance can hunker down in the old rebel base while the FO goes past. And then, when the FO exposes the transports and begins targeting them, instead of recalling the transports to the cruiser where they can devise a new plan, she decides to go out in a blaze of personal heroics by sacrificing herself to "save" the transports. But her plan had already failed. It no longer matters if the transports reach the planet because the FO knows that's where they are. Her personal heroics cost the resistance their last chance to get away.
