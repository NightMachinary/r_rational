  And note that just because 92% of critics give it a positive review, doesn't mean it's a 92/100-scored movie; it just means 92% of critics recommend seeing it over not seeing it. I found it good enough to say it's worth seeing, but I'd still only score the movie around a 6/10.

While that distinction is worth making, I'm not sure it's useful. As a movie-goer, my question is: should I spend my money at this movie? The critics said yes. They served me poorly. While I would eventually wish to see the movie regardless, I could have waited and seen it at the cheap-seats, or rented from Redbox.
