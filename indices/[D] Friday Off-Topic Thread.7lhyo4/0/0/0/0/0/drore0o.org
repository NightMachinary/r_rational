I think that says less about critics' general utility/ability, and more about their specific utility to you. In other words, your tastes clearly do not align with those of most professional film critics.

But just because they served /you/ poorly in this instance, doesn't make them bad at their jobs, or liars.

A better approach might be researching the critics who DID agree with you, to find those whose tastes more closely align with yours, and listening primarily to them for future films.
