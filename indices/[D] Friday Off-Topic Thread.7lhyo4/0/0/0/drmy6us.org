  What's confusing is the 92% of professional critics who gave positive reviews. I'm not sure whether it's kinder to suppose they're lying, or that they have bad taste.

Is it possible they're reviewing it objectively as a film, whereas you're looking at it through the eyes of a hardcore fan?

Not to say individual reviewers can't be biased, or have bad opinions, or "be lying".

But if I hated a movie that 92% of professional movie critics gave a positive review...I would just figure that movie must not be for me, not that it's objectively terrible and that 307 of the 334 critics who reviewed it are either wrong or liars.

*EDIT:* And note that just because 92% of critics give it a positive review, doesn't mean it's a 92/100-scored movie; it just means 92% of critics recommend seeing it over not seeing it. I found it good enough to say it's worth seeing, but I'd still only score the movie around a 6/10.
