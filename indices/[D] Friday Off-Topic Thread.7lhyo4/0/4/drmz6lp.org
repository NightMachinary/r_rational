Yeah, very little of what I've seen of why fans who love/hate it hits the mark for why I hated the movie.

My thoughts on the film are [[http://daystareld.com/the-last-jedi-review/][on my site]] for anyone interested, but the basic gist is that the characters are unacceptable levels of idiotic to the point where there's practically no tension or investment in anything that's happening, and the rules of the world are tossed out in ways that /will/ break the story if future writers don't retcon the hyperspace tracking and using hyperspace as a weapon.
