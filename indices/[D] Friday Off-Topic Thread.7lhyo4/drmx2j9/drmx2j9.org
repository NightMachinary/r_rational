Heroes Save the World has [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7lkgw0/heroes_save_the_world_ch_63_michael_williams/][returned to life today]]. The current Sequence of chapters is going to be completed over the course of the next week, and then it'll go on a brief hiatus as I continue writing the next bits, attempt to not flunk out of grad school, and so on.

--------------

As some of you may know, I write worldbuilding supplements and related resources, which I publish through DriveThruRPG.

Earlier this year, I told the sub about Species Shock, a Kickstarter campaign for a book that would dig deep into a fictional alien species and its world, evolutionary history, culture, and other characteristics, and release the whole thing into the Creative Commons.

The campaign went well, and I'm pleased to announce that [[http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/227722/Agloanikoi-The-Gameplayers-Species-Shock][Species Shock is available for free]]. It's 74 pages long, so there's a lot of meat there, and while it's written from a hard scifi perspective I have heard of at least one person planning to adapt it for fantasy.

You may also be interested in [[http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/200950/Strange-Nations-A-Worldbuilding-Resource][Strange Nations]], a collection of "drag-n-drop" cultures that can be easily inserted into most settings and a wealth of supplementary information on such topics as low-tech methods of long-distance communication and the many uses of cactus. Strange Nations is also free.
