Oh don't worry, I'm not stressing out over the fic itself, it's just the stress from life preventing me from finding the correct chain of events through chapters 2 and 3. I complicated it for myself by requiring that I show and not tell, so instead of Quirrellmort delivering a three page long expository infodump there's going to be a Pensieve involved. I already have all of the topics of discussion and all of the events, what I don't have is how to order them chronologically.

And yeah, I remember you offering to beta this thing all the way back in January, I apologize for teasing it too early, I should've known better than to think I was getting close to the finish line lol

For what it's worth, I think based on everything I've experienced in the past year that I only really need two really dedicated months to get this thing edited to the point where I think it's publishable, it's just that I don't know when exactly that two-month period begins yet.
