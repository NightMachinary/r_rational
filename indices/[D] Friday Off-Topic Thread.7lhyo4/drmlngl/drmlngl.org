So, imagine the USA were a dystopia where Mexican immigrants are summarily executed by the cops if they're caught, and it is the official policy to do that.

Then one day, Trump decides "You know what, reading the Mexican immigrants' rights is a huge wast of time, let's not do that anymore". And it starts a HUUUUUUGE controversy, with thousands of people protesting online and making Youtube videos with titles like "Miranda rights are for EVERYONE" or "Mexican deserve to be read their rights too!".

Being unfamiliar with the US' situation, I ask "Does it really matter if Trump wants their rights to be read? If they aren't read, it'll come up at the trial and the judge will be constitutionally required to let them go, right?". To which people tell me "No, you don't understand, Mexican immigrants are actually executed without a trial, so they don't have an occasion to invoke their constitutional rights". I say "Wait, what?" but it's too late and the other guy is already back to shouting "Miranda rights for everyone!"

This is roughly [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/12/18/links-12-17-silent-site-holy-site/#comment-580111][how I feel]] about the net neutrality scandal right now, and about [[https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2009/10/us-internet-is-slow-expensiveand-the-fcc-has-proof/][the "Internet in US" situation]] in general.

--------------

This is an area where I'd appreciate explanations from anyone familiar with the logistics involved: why does the US have so many regions under oligopoly as far as Internet access is concerned?

I'm still looking into it, but as far as I can see the answer is "because the FCC never seriously enforced its local loop unbundling regulations". Local loop unbundling is when whichever company owns the cable that connects your house to its network has to lease it to any company that asks. Unbundling your local loop and not doing it is spectacular. It seriously reduces the cost of setting up a new network, which allows competition on a "unattainable libertarian fantasy" level.

So of course the US doesn't have it. Or does it? I'm guessing that some states implemented it better than others. Again, I'd be very open to better info if anyone can provide it.

(also, apparently setting up your network can be way harder in some states than others depending on their [[https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/06/verizon-supports-controversial-rule-that-could-help-google-fiber-expand/][utility pole legislation]])
