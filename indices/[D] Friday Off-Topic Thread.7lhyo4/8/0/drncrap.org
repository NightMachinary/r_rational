  This is an area where I'd appreciate explanations from anyone familiar with the logistics involved: why does the US have so many regions under oligopoly as far as Internet access is concerned?

Because on one side, we have libertarians (regulatory capture is the great evil! Monopolies don't exist!) and on the other side we have the socialists (Monopolies are the great evil! regulatory capture doesn't exist!) and never the twain shall meet. Or more explicitly, because gerrymandering + the primary system partially cancels out the chief advantage of first past the post voting (a trend towards centrism) and since pork barrel spending got outlawed, there's no incentive for true compromise.
