  Is this something that gets better? Are there strategies for managing this?

IME there is a bell curve to this mystical energy. Some people still have energy left to do learn an instrument, sing in the choir, go running, others just collapse on the couch.

For me there was some kind of positive adjustment, but 40hrs were just too much to have energy for fun left.
