I'm completing my first week back working full time after a semester of classes. I remember this from sumer, but it's coming back strongly now. 40 hours a week just feels like too much for me. I get home and I feel like I have no time or really energy for that matter. Is this something that gets better? Are there strategies for managing this? I don't think it's that I don't like my work. I do, I enjoy being a programmer a lot and while the company I'm at now is by no means where I intend to stay, it's nice enough and I like my coworkers. It's just that as childish as it sounds I'd like to be able to like look at Reddit more and maybe work on some of my own projects or learn some new tech or science.

It doesn't help that I need more sleep than I think the average, but it's what it is. Are there any companies seriously offering lower work weeks? Say 30 hours with 6 hour days maybe. I'm really feeling like I'd take the pay hit right now.
