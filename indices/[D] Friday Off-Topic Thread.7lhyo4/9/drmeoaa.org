1) What has been your average experience with corporate events so far? How dull, unbearable (or, in contrast, interesting and rich with potential of making social connections that are valuable and interesting to you) do they generally end up being for you? 2) Have you noticed any difference in quality depending on the industry that the event-organiser corporation was operating in (e.g. governmental sector v.s. financial \ banking v.s. IT etc)? 3) How do you usually react when the management tries to force you into attending such an event, and seemingly can't understand and take a "No" for an answer?

Also, how can I make this oncoming experience at least somewhat bearable for me? I think there's gonna be 100-150 people present, and usually I start panicking and freaking out even when I have to attend a gathering with only 20+ people that I don't know too well.

And finally, how to avoid answering questions that I don't want to answer because I find them to be too personal -- without offending the people throwing those questions (who may or may not be looking for a reasons to get offended)?
