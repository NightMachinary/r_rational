Damn, sasapariller. That's some Ace attorney stuff right there. Or was it Higurashi?

Unresolved threads in no particular order: - Randall Flagg/story jumper? - We've got two people poked and dying at the moment. Is it really the lion that's going to be revived? - Who's the narrator of Aslan's story? It's got to be the dad, yes? Deeply religious, maybe; maybe just super jaded. Presumably narrators are immune to Aslan's "Stop Time" geass, so it's nobody at the table. Also note that either Aslan can selectively turn off the geass, or people who have broken stories before (Skylar) have an easier time breaking it. - Where's Delmutt in all this(helping at the stadium)? Is the Dog about to Yoink something(doggies no like boring)? - I likes the color, but using color for Haley and regular for Sean means that the author plans to have Sean be the narrator for the majority. I wonder if there's a use case for third person.
