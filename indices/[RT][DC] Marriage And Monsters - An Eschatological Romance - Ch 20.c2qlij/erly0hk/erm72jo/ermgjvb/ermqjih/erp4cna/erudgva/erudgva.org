  I'm a bit concerned with the party imbalance.

/This/. It's been present since the beginning of the story, but is getting more pronounced as we go along, and has really ramped up now, especially since Sean is basically her 'weak spot' in /every way conceivable/. Not just emotionally, but if he dies her entire story is likely to unravel. It's rapidly appraoching the "Superman Dillema" levels where you have one super-godly character and a bunch of normies running around together, when they should clearly be tackling /completely/ different problems.

  Sean seems to have misunderstood the chinese room thought experiment because he made it sound sensical.
#+end_quote

What's nonsensical about the Chinese Room thought experiment? Makes perfect sense to me. It boils down to "A sufficiently advanced program can be mistaken for sapience". Maybe it was easier to accept since I'm a Mass Effect fan and the game world is full of examples of this, called VI's.

  O'dim and for the tower
#+end_quote

I don't see Randall Flag every saying "For the tower!" in any way that isn't ironic. Considering his primary goal is to /destroy/ said Tower and undo all of existence.

  Ooh, I'd be leery of evil spells when you don't know what metaphysics you are running on.
#+end_quote

It's running on Pathfinder logic, which is heavily modified 3.X logic from the D&D days. A lot of it doesn't make sense. In theory, Infernal Healing is an 'evil' spell because its component is devil/demon blood, and thematically the spell enhances it and puts it in your body to repair it. That's roughly like saying eating meat from an evil cow is an evil act because the evil substance sates your hunger.

  I don't understand. Why can't you have +5 pistols?
#+end_quote

Because a +5 pistol gives a +5 /enhancement/ bonus to *your attack rolls*. Yes, the weapon is magical, but its giving its buff to you.

Why she doesn't have her 8 million+ simulacra cranking out fat stacks of +1 /shocking, flaming, thundering, frost, corrosive, dry load, phantom, Bane/ (of each creature type seperately) ammunition is beyond me. Bane ammo makes you 10% more likely to hit, does more bonus damage than any two other damage mods, and ignores all the damage resistances (but not immunities) of the foe. It'd be messy carrying ammo of different Bane types for different creatures, but I'm *pretty sure* Magical Beast (Aslan) and Outsider-bane (Randall) weapons would work really well right about now. Humanoid (Human) would probably be the most common, though. Being able to fire them underwater or in a vacuum, while also doing a little of each of the elemental types of damage (letting you see what the target resists and is weak against) seem like very handy additions.

Nor why those pistoles aren't of the /distance, ghost touch, glamered, impervious, merciful, plummeting, seeking, shadowshooting, silencing, and veering/ variety. They would have extended range attacks that can optionally not kill the target, hit things that are ghostly or not fully in our dimension, knock flying enemies out of the sky, ignore cover and concealment for the purposes of hitting things, make no sounds when they fire, can create their own quasi-real ammo, and appear to be any object of similar size that the wielder desires--an illusion that goes away when they are used to attack.

I know the writer doesn't want them to munchkin too bad, but I /really/ can't understand why those pistols don't have /Merficful/ on them, given Sean's nature. He'd have guns that can blow up objects but would be able to shoot someone unconscious rather than kill them--something he could turn off if he needed lethal attacks. Combined with the Phantom ammo, eh could literally shoot someone into unconsciousness and they'd have no wounds or bruises from the ordeal. I also don't know why /Seeking/ (ignores concealment) and /Veering/ (ignores cover) aren't on there, either. Even being able to see a creature's pinky toe behind a bush or sticking out around a corner would let him shoot them as if they were standing in the middle of an empty street. Combined with Sheriff's skill at weapons, he'd practically be a Roland Deschain clone, able to shoot entire /towns/ of people, but not actually have to kill them in the process. Only things with obscene amounts of health (fully grown dragons, for instance) would be able to tank that for long enough to stop him.

Of course, this gets back to the power disparity bit. The power disparity /has/ to be intentional, otherwise we'd likely see stuff like this.
