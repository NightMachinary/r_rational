  This. It's been present since the beginning of the story, but is getting more pronounced as we go along, and has really ramped up now, especially since Sean is basically her 'weak spot' in every way conceivable. Not just emotionally, but if he dies her entire story is likely to unravel. It's rapidly appraoching the "Superman Dillema" levels where you have one super-godly character and a bunch of normies running around together, when they should clearly be tackling completely different problems.

Ya. I think he's splitting the story here actually. Haley is too powerful, so she'll be off screen while Sean does 100 pushups a day in hell. Feels a bit contrived, but we'll see.

  What's nonsensical about the Chinese Room thought experiment? Makes perfect sense to me. It boils down to "A sufficiently advanced program can be mistaken for sapience". Maybe it was easier to accept since I'm a Mass Effect fan and the game world is full of examples of this, called VI's.
#+end_quote

The chinese room thought experiment is supposed to be proof that AI's can't really think. That they can't have understanding (unlike humans). Sean's explanation (and apparently yours) is that a 'chinese room' chatbot style program could exist. That's a much weaker claim. Even mass effect VI's aren't really chinese room programs, because when they are sufficiently advanced and powerful they become a true AI.

  I don't see Randall Flag every saying "For the tower!" in any way that isn't ironic. Considering his primary goal is to destroy said Tower and undo all of existence.
#+end_quote

His mercs were shouting 'for the tower.' Not sure why, but mainly it just solidified the reference.

  It's running on Pathfinder logic, which is heavily modified 3.X logic from the D&D days. A lot of it doesn't make sense. In theory, Infernal Healing is an 'evil' spell because its component is devil/demon blood, and thematically the spell enhances it and puts it in your body to repair it. That's roughly like saying eating meat from an evil cow is an evil act because the evil substance sates your hunger.
#+end_quote

Our logic says that there's no reason Infernal Healing should be actually evil, but pathfinder metaphysics says it is capital E Evil. They haven't really mapped out how pathfinder and real life logic interact (eg have they tested if the squareroot of 2 is 1.5?) So I would be very leery of using something that is specifically called out as being Metaphysically Evil, even, or especially, if I can't understand why.

  Because a +5 pistol gives a +5 enhancement bonus to your attack rolls. Yes, the weapon is magical, but its giving its buff to you.
#+end_quote

I'm not sure why he would say that a +5 pistol is enchanting the user to make them more skillful instead of simply being a much better weapon, as that isn't stated or implied in the rules (iirc). Things that buff a creature will simply say so. For instance a masterwork weapon has a +1 bonus to hit (just like a magic +1 weapon), but is clearly not enchanting the user, just the weapon being of high quality.

  Why she doesn't have her 8 million+ simulacra cranking out fat stacks of +1 shocking, flaming, thundering, frost, corrosive, dry load, phantom, Bane (of each creature type seperately) ammunition is beyond me. Bane ammo makes you 10% more likely to hit, does more bonus damage than any two other damage mods, and ignores all the damage resistances (but not immunities) of the foe. It'd be messy carrying ammo of different Bane types for different creatures, but I'm pretty sure Magical Beast (Aslan) and Outsider-bane (Randall) weapons would work really well right about now. Humanoid (Human) would probably be the most common, though. Being able to fire them underwater or in a vacuum, while also doing a little of each of the elemental types of damage (letting you see what the target resists and is weak against) seem like very handy additions.
#+end_quote

No idea. Even if they are acting limited by 25000gp they can get a lot if you enchant a single ammunition with that.

  Nor why those pistoles aren't of the distance, ghost touch, glamered, impervious, merciful, plummeting, seeking, shadowshooting, silencing, and veering variety.
#+end_quote

I get the impression they haven't actually started crafting at super speed in the demiplane so are limited to 25kgp. Doesn't really make sense though. You do need a base +1 so can't fit quite all of those on.

He can also just equip thousands of contingent items, that are contingencies to go off when he twitches his thumb or whatever. That's assuming that standard push a button magic items don't work for him for some strange reason. Get some traps to reapply his buffstack at the necessary intervals and he's at least moderately competitive. I guess pathfinder removed polymorph, but did they remove all the ways to mind switch (depends on how many splat books you allow)? Gate in something awesome and do a true mind switch. There are lots of ways to make Sean awesome, though admittedly not quite as awsome as Haley.

Seems like the author doesn't want them to be complete munchkins, just paddle in the shallow end. Really though, once the author allowed infinite wish loop, the, err, genie was out of the bag, so might as well go for broke. I'm guessing it doesn't really matter since he's having stories fight at the level of narrative, not straight mechanical power.

The issue of imbalance is even worse here, since Haley is super intelligent, wise, and charismatic. Why would Sean be the point man in the trial? Why would he come up with the plan, and Haley not be able to think of a better one?
