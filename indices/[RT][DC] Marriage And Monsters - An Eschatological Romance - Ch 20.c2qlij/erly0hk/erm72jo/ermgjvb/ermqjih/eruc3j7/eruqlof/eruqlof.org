Other fun things include making an arbitrary amount of clones as the spell in the pocket dimension. That's both biological immortality (because a clone remains in stasis and does not age, so wait 30 years and kill yourself and you de age when your soul hits the clone) and each one is a get out of death free card.

Also they should have spent a full lifetime in the new dimension. It would have taken what, a few hours real time? Then just use the clone trick to de-age Sean again, only be gets a +3 age bonus to all his mental stats too for hitting venerable, and Haley hits great wyrm level power so she can cast 9th level spells in her own right. Like time stop. Or power word - kill.

I'm imagining the look on Flagg's face when a new Sean teleports in 6 seconds later as the clone activates, and its great.
