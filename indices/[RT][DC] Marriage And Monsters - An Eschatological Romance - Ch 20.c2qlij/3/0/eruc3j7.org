/Heal/ is a 6th level Divine spell, so well within the realm of Wish.

Of course, the rules on Wish *specifically state* that it can be used to bring back the dead.

Sean and Haley are still fairly low-to-medium tier munchkins, and haven't really tested their abilities to find their limits in the real world. At this point they should have already experimented by finding some roadkill or dead people or the like and tried to bring them back, both in the real world and their pocket dimension, to find out if its possible. Same with healing magics, creating simulacrums of their foes to interrogate them, divinations to locate their enemies and resources they need, etc.

  It would be kind of bullshit narrative wise if conflicting story logic only prevents Haley from using magic on others as it is intended to work

From this chapter we learn that magic should work on them /just fine/ if they 'accept' her story as their own and become part of it. The only people that resist this seem to be the narrators.
