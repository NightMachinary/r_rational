I can't see how a simple /heal/ spell doesn't fix a slit throat. It cures basically anything up to death. Maybe toss on a break enchantment to fix any curses on the dagger.

Even if there is narrative conflict, Sean is as fully in Haley's narrative as he can be, and her magic should overrule any other stories. It would be kind of bullshit narrative wise if conflicting story logic only prevents Haley from using magic on others as it is intended to work and not others from using their magic on them.
