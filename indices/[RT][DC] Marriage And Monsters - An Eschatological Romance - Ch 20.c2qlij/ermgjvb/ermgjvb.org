"I threw that debate you know" /understatement of the week/

The pink text for Haley's narration is a neat idea, although with my awful eyesight it does make it slightly harder to read. I don't know what the limits are for formatting on AO3, but might I suggest using different font styles as a substitute?

If I'm to be honest, the last couple chapters lost me on the meta-narrative thing that was going on. The explanation given to the 10 year old really helped clear up what was happening. And now I can't help picturing the Ultimate Showdown being canon in this story.

Also, what in the hell happened to Randall Flagg's narrator to make a Gold Dragon fail a constitution check? Goddamn it must suck to be that guy.

Also also, I totally called it that the dagger was going to be Aslan's demise! Looks like I can chekov at least one of my predictions as coming true! Score's now 18-1, ball's in your court, Formerly.

Also^{3}, if there's one thing I know about web serials it's that backlogs never last, so don't worry too much about trying to keep an unsustainable schedule if time conflicts prove to be a long term problem. But that's a bridge for another time I think. Rest assured we'll still be here whenever a post comes online.

Last Also, if you do find yourself in a coma, may it be of the food variety (with Freedom Day just around the corner and all).

Seeya on the next episode of +Dragon Wife+ M&M's!
