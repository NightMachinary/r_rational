  Also, what in the hell happened to Randall Flagg's narrator to make a Gold Dragon fail a constitution check? Goddamn it must suck to be that guy.

Rolled a '1'. Critical fumbles still happen on saving throws.

Beings as R.F. is a monster of primordial chaos that seeks to undo all things orderly and sane, I find it as no surprise he messed up his narrator in some horrible fashion. It fits. Besides, Stephen King put himself in the Dark Tower series as a character, so its established in their own personal canon that the narrated characters can cause harm or influence the narrator. It's a bit meta, but it fits perfectly in this story with R.F. seeking out his own narrator to do terrible things to him.
