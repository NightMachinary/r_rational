  Feels a bit contrived, but we'll see.
#+end_quote

Not so much contrived as /necessary/. They pretty much have to split to handle problems that they are able to handle, because having them together means one of them is always in dire danger of death or the other is just bored as problems are handled with a snap of the fingers.

  The chinese room thought experiment is supposed to be proof that AI's can't really think. That they can't have understanding (unlike humans). Sean's explanation (and apparently yours) is that a 'chinese room' chatbot style program could exist. That's a much weaker claim. Even mass effect VI's aren't really chinese room programs, because when they are sufficiently advanced and powerful they become a true AI.
#+end_quote

I don't see how it's proof they can't think at all. The primary difference between an AI and a VI/Chinese Room is self-awareness, ie: sapience. The secondary difference, derived from the primary, is that an AI can modify its own behavior, something that the Chinese Room can't do. You can't both fake self-awareness and consciously modify your own behavior. If the machine is capable of doing both, it /is/ actually self aware and sapient.

My personal belief is that AI can't be created directly, but starts in a VI-like state that has to achieve full AI status through adaptive learning and processing of sufficient input. But that's neither here nor there.

  His mercs were shouting 'for the tower.' Not sure why, but mainly it just solidified the reference.
#+end_quote

Most likely. I wonder if the author has read the entire Dark Tower.

#+begin_quote
  So I would be very leery of using something that is specifically called out as being Metaphysically Evil, even, or especially, if I can't understand why.
#+end_quote

Why? Only Pathfinder's metaphysical good or spells/abilities that target said Evil would apply. Since there aren't any of those that aren't controlled by Sean's story, then there is no threat.

#+begin_quote
  I'm not sure why he would say that a +5 pistol is enchanting the user to make them more skillful instead of simply being a much better weapon, as that isn't stated or implied in the rules (iirc).
#+end_quote

You make the attack roll. The weapon doesn't make the attack. Like in the real world, guns don't kill people, people kill people easier using guns. You the player roll the die, and add the stat's that your character has to add to it: BAB, Dex modifier, all sorts of various other mods including luck, competence, etc, etc, and /enhancement/ bonuses. The weapon enhances your roll.

If it makes you feel any better, I offer a second explanation: Sean is not a Pathfinder character. He /doesn't have an attack roll to modify/.

#+begin_quote
  but is clearly not enchanting the user, just the weapon being of high quality.
#+end_quote

I never said that it enchanted the user. I said it applies a bonus to the /user's attack rolls/. It has nothing to do with magic. If the weapon somehow granted the *Weapon Focus* Feat to the user for its own attacks, then Sean would still not get that bonus. If it offered a /luck/ or /competence/ bonus somehow, it still would not work for him.

#+begin_quote
  Even if they are acting limited by 25000gp they can get a lot if you enchant a single ammunition with that.
#+end_quote

You don't wish for the item. You wish for the materials to /create/ the item. "I wish for the equivalent of 25,000 GP in materials that are a suitable contribution toward the end goal of crafting a /+10 pistol/." Repeat as necessary.

Don't have the crafting feat? Make a custom item that grants you the feat. Worried about XP? She's passively generating a lot of self-XP over time simply by existing for some reason. Use it.

#+begin_quote
  You do need a base +1 so can't fit quite all of those on.
#+end_quote

At least two of those mods are a flat +GP value, not a +1 bonus. And you can 'upgrade' items with the crafting rules. They don't have to be crafted or wished for all in one go, although it would help to create the 'base' form (the equivalent of a +3, which makes 18,000 GP worth, and whatever other flat +GP cost mods will fit) with the Wish and then add to that.

Oh, it takes time? Demiplane. Oh, the rules say you have to compare it to real world time? Make four pistols, give him two now, have Simulacra working on the other two ultimate weapons. *NOTE*: The Author might actually have those going on in the background.

#+begin_quote
  guess pathfinder removed polymorph, but did they remove all the ways to mind switch
#+end_quote

They didn't so much remove it as 'nerf it from its godly broken state'. As it is, the Mind Switch must be able to affect the targets, so again it needs to be part of Seans story or those who are directly opposing Haley... and I'm not sure I'd want to give my enemies a dragon body. As Sean is the Narrator of it, I doubt they'd work on him.

#+begin_quote
  Why would Sean be the point man in the trial?
#+end_quote

Why bother indulging in their story at all? Pathfinder is all about a collection of plucky heroes rising up against tyrants and overthrowing them, saving their world from destruction. Make it the /Pathfinder/ story, not the /Narnia/ story.
