Notes while catching up.

I have quite a weakness for dnd and dragons and litrpg with real stats, so this is right up my alley.

I'm a bit concerned with the party imbalance. The imbalance isn't just power. Haley starts out as the rational and moral one, then gets dragon body powers, dnd spells, and instant attribute and skill increases. Any one of those would be OP. Together they really do completely obsolete Sean. She even takes knowledge engineering first so he couldn't even compete if software development suddenly became relevant again. Maybe the story will just be fast paced and over before she gets super powerful? You can keep making situations where Sean is somehow relevant, but it will get more and more contrived as time goes by.

Sean seems to have misunderstood the chinese room thought experiment because he made it sound sensical.

The 'effective altruist' callout is a bit cringy. Maybe that's intentional, or maybe it's just me.

She jumps to 'It's narrative causality' really quickly with rather circumstantial evidence. What about putting those rationalist skills to work and figure out how you might test that hypothesis?

Similarly the freudian ego/id/superego is a bit of a random. Like maybe its true, but she just jumps on that explanation... I did really like the 'kill the crazy one not the sane one.'

Aslan is properly horrifying here (as he should be if you don't grant him the assumption of perfect benevolence from the start). He also seems to already have connections with hardcore merc groups. Has Aslan been in contact before the Swap?

I'm a bit concerned about the 'mega crossover' angle. In my experience they very rarely work. Too many moving parts maybe. Not clear yet how it will function in this story though.

Similarly whenever you introduce meta-narrative it gets weird. I find it emotionally disconnects me from the story and characters, and makes me generally unengaged in the events, since the story has already said the events and consequences are happening for a meta-narrative reason rather than the features of the world, and actions of the characters.

O'dim and for the tower? And working with Aslan. That's not a great sign...

He's assuming they gave the actual address of their bunker. Is that really likely?

Ooh, I'd be leery of evil spells when you don't know what metaphysics you are running on.

Oh I didn't realize Charles was the narnia kids dad. Interesting. Glad he got a moment of awesome. But... taking advice from R.F. is a bad idea.

Typos chap 17:

Haley closed her eyes, did the math required by the feat. It reallywasludicrously easy. Thehardpart was going to be keeping me alive.“Rulethree.Youdo not threaten my husband.”

Well they can always wish for rings of 3 wishes. And he can use that (with no xp/gold cost). Not sure what would happen if he wished to be a fast maturing gold dragon.

Sure is going at a fast pace.

Not sure what great insight he has had into himself. 'Death is change?' Yeah, a particularly terrible type of change. Was he not always going to look for ways to improve himself?

Haley, at least wish up some inherent stat buffs for the poor sod. And make some contingency items of wish that are controllable by him.

"We spent some more time working around the rules, and discovered that any magical effect that applied to the weapon would work just fine. So no +5 pistols for Sherriff, but we could produce one that applied any effects to its ammunition." I don't understand. Why can't you have +5 pistols? Besides cost.

Oh, she can't age in the demiplane? Shame. She should still be able to work on her sorcery right?

"So we can't count on help there, aside from the fact that I am narrating, in some fashion, so my survival may be assumed." Err, I wouldn't bet on it if I were you.

"There may be a God, capital G, out there. Given what we know about stories I'd say it's almost a guarantee. But Aslan was never the real deal." I don't see why the stories would tell you that. The capital G is usually used to denote the three Omnis. Being part of a story would kinda preclude that.

In what way did she think she earned the power, so that she's upset to learn he gave it to her? Doesn't make sense to me.

If she can be her own narrator, she's even more OP.

The children are actually children, and he's attacking their religion half the time. Why don't they have Haley and her stratospheric stats do the debating?

Well I guess Randall understands that talking is a free action, if he can do all that before Haley can do anything. Why wouldn't he have a bunch of awesome contingency items and buffs up is the question. Maybe Randall popped an AMF silently or something?
