nobody103 is an accountant :)

I cannot find exact quote, but he was asked about why he does not write the story from multiple points of view. He replied that he limits himself to Zorian only because otherwise the progress of the story would slow down a lot. So that's why this information might have ended up in wiki as foreshadow. You see it as random fact, I'm saying it's at the heart of the story. I'm pretty sure (if there is) such conspiracy, it will be fully revealed by the author.

It seems this is the discussion where the opposite parties are even more sure about their own opinion. I'm pretty sure there won't be more like 10 chapters of the story left so we will learn soon enough
