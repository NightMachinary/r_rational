I feel the same way. The gate (and its required artifacts) seem like an automatic failsafe to prevent Primordial incursions. The royal family had no clue how to activate the gate, and it hasn't been activated since Shutur-Tarana founded the Ikosian empire, which was at least 2000 years ago.

There have been multiple planar convergences since then, but no godlike mages.

  "The Controller is marked by the Key, by the Maker, or by its agents," the Guardian said. "I am not aware of what criteria were used in choosing any particular Controller. It is ultimately irrelevant to my purpose to know such things."

  "But the Key is lost," Zach said, frowning. "Scattered across vast distances. And if the Maker is a god like you suspect he is, well... the gods have been silent for centuries. That only leaves his agents. Who would that be?"

The maker has to be a god (given the gate was made out of a primordial), the key was separated and unusable before the time loop, and the agents are likely angels.

I'm pretty sure it looks into the future before a convergence, detects whether someone will try to release a primordial, then picks someone who has several traits.

1) Large mana reserves (which it then amplifies), which the time loop provides enough time to gain more control of. (but a divine blessing likely helps with control, as well.)

2) General good nature (unlikely to want the world ended, anyway.) Zach tried to get to know almost everyone at the Cyorian mage college, and generally hates being alone.

3) Locally based (so they know where to start looking, and have more reason to prevent the primordial being released.)

The major problem with this theory is that the gate triggered early, resulting in fewer loops. That was confirmed by the Guardian of the Threshold. If it's designed to detect and prevent a primordial being released, why would it be designed to trigger on the actual day of the planar convergence? That leaves too little time to loop, especially as the biggest expenditure involved is ending and restarting a loop, not keeping it going.

I guess that could be due to an angel trying to do the work of a god, and messing up. The max time the gate can operate at is capped at a month (due to ethical reasons), so I suppose the gate could copy the state of the world a month before the planar convergence, and use that state when triggering later, but maybe that requires a god to do, and the gate/angels are more limited?
