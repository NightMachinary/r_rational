Good point, but there are more possible scenarios:

4) The efficiency of the loop rises quicker than the amount of days left until convergence drops, so the number of days spent may still rise. Maybe the loop is capable of millions of restarts at its peak.

5) The simulation is not technically bound to end with the primordial release, so the controller can train after the release. Inconvenient but doable and the inconvenience may be worth extra 700 years of training for some controllers.

  The intended time was the planar convergence.

The gate is a tool. The intended time of activation is when the Maker decides it serves the purpose best, and the guardian specifically stated that he has no clue as to what the purpose is. That is "between the Maker and the Controller".
