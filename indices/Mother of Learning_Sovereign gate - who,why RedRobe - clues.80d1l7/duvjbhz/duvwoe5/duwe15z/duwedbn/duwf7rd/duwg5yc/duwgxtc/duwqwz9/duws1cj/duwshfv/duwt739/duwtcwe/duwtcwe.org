So you're saying Zach is an unreliable narrator here? He didn't know it wasn't something he always had so he just assumed it was? I can see that, but you should have said that in your first explanation.

Edit: Still, it's disingenuous to claim that:

#+begin_quote
  There is not a single word in this quote indicating that this was the state of affairs before the loop.
#+end_quote

You don't have to believe Zach here, and it is textually supported that he's a bit over-confident and assumes things he shouldn't naively. But the text does explicitly support the face value interpretation of him having the divine blessing before the loop. I can agree it's not /conclusive/.
