Not true.

Or rather it can be true, but you can't have data on this. Mana magnitude is measured in magic missiles. Zach (and Zorian) did not measure their mana before their first class in battle magic (or whatever that class where they got to fire magic missile rod was). Zorian did not know his mana reserves before chapter 2, and there is no indication Zach did, especially considering his lack of academic success.

  If there's divine intervention, why put some immature boy, why not put high profile priest with huge weight to remediate situation during the loop?

Why does it matter if the controller has 1000 restarts (80 years!) to mature in the loop. Unless you throw in an old geezer, the time within the loop outweighs all prior experience. And that's not to say that Zach is nobody. High nobility, wealthy, high natural mana reserves, not evil or corrupt, friendly and outgoing. He was a shitty mage, but that's exactly the flaw the loop can eliminate.
