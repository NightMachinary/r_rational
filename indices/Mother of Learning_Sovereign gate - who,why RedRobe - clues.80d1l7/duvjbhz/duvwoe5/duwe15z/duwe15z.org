Yup, pretty hit the nail on the head here about divining what happens during upcoming planar alignment and activating the gate if something suspicious shows up.

The premature activation may be not a mistake but intentional instead. Sure, it cuts down on the number of available restarts (how much, by the way?) but on the other hand it allows the controller to be buffed as early as possible. Suppose the gate was activated 1 day before the aligment. Sure, Zach now has, let's say, 10,000 months inside the loop. But he has *one day* to fight the invasion in the real world, and that is all that matters. One day is simply not enough to persuade and mobilize anybody, to craft golems and steal whatever artifacts you want for the mission and so on. It is clearly sub-optimal to activate the gate that late. Given the choice I would definitely take the option with less restarts, but more time to prepare in the one timeline that /actually matters/.
