We know very little about primordials. If I'd state that gods bounded primordials to their dimensional prisons with a similar spell like anchored teleport Zorian is using I can be as right or as wrong as you are.

If the kids (humanity or whatnot) feels like they want to take on primordial for some time, gods are not interfering with that - it will be pulled back into prison with that anchor anyway after some period of time.

It is very unlikely that people didn't attempt to free primordials from their prisons before (look at the shifters and their usage of primordial essence) and you don't see any wandering primordials - they are all tucked into prisons.
