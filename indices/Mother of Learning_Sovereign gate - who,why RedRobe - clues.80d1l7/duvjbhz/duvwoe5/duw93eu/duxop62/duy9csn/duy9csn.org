The topic about primordials is... mostly speculation. The quote you've provided is relevant to the context explaining difference between demon summoning and primordial releasing. However the panic thought is produced by Zorian and he is definately not an expert on primordials at that point of time. Silverlake is interested in them a lot, but the focus of her studies it not clear - she's clearly interested in dimensional pockets.

Sudomir (the owner of soul well) seems like a knowledgeable person. When he confronts Sudomir about primordial release, he's taking a leap of faith that rampaging primordial issue should be solveable. He's might be a bit more informed or might as well not give a damn.

I hope that there are some safeguards within those prisons. Primordials are pretty impressive and forced sleep should expire at some point of time at least part of them. It was easier for Zorian to kill Suldomir instead of knocking him out. I'm pretty sure primordials have their hard resistances vs knock outs. But, of course, it's the gods we are talking about.

My hope here is that primordials are tied to their cages - if we are talking about real world - it's like japanese shows where person is tied up with rubber rope and tries to reach some point. There are various strategies - like involving helpers, but pretty much everyone is dragged back by the rope. I like to think that gods were pissed off enough at primordials that they jailed them in a fashion which can provide amusement for them by seeing them trying escape those jails and failing/being dragged back. (just like SG is very likely to be a punishment to some primordial).
