This has some good bits, but overall I can't agree with the methods of the post... at all. This is pure guesswork not based on any conclusive evidence, and (in)conveniently not explaining some critical issues. For example, why is Tetra deemed a smokescreen and Abnazia the culprit? There is no solid evidence for ruling out the former.

Similarly,

No, it's not. It could be a function of the marker, that RR had the know-how to use. Then, it could be another artifact, since we have 2 more unknown to us. But that's nitpicking.

The real issue is that this theory ignores a major factor: divinity. The gate and the 5 relics are divine artifacts made by the gods themselves, and later most likely entrusted to the angels. Evidence for that? Apart from being a mythical feat of magic on its own (recreating the world and running it for thousands months), we know now that the gate is feeding on the power of a primordial. Only the gods had the power to transform their foe's body (so to speak), into something really useful.

This brings us to the /purpose/ of the gate. It is not, as you may think, to train lucky individuals. The gods get a lot of shit in the story, portrayed as capricious and fickle, but if you look at their major accomplishments, they are clearly on the good side: created the habitable world out of initial chaos (whether the Dragon below is a mythical allegory or was an actual being is not really relevant), then proceeded to eliminate extinction threats until none was left (the primordials). Now, we know that these accomplishments can be undone. Primordials can be released back. So it is probable that gods also knew this and tried to devise mechanisms to prevent such major fuck-ups. Enter Sovereign Gate. Yeah, it can be activated only once in 400 years. Not a coincidence that the primordial jailbreak window /also/ happens once in 400 years.

Why the loop controller is a human? That's trivial! The spirit realm doesn't work in the gate, duh! Also if the gods foresaw their silence, double duh. In order to /prevent/ the jailbreak the gods have to choose a champion, put him in the gate and enjoy their champion getting buffed AF and never letting the catastrophe happen. Any benefits the champion has afterwards are, well, a proper reward for saving literally millions.

The divine factor is confirmed by the latest chapter. Zach has a divine blessing. Zach's family was in possession of the Gate. I can not agree that some rando shmuck activated the gate nilly-willy for his personal *destructive* goal. The gate was activated for Zach, by a (largely) benevolent divine force. Zorian and RR are unexpected noise in the system.
