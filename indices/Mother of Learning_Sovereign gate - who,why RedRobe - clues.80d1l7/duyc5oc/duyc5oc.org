I'll rehash/summarize my original statement to reflect some of the discussions were made.

The goal of continental re-unification is to stop wasting various resources (human and material) on wars. However the crux of problem is Eldemar - it is now the main problem standing in re-unification due to hard stance (all states must re-submit or smth like that). There are a lot of people who don't like this and Abnazia is the gathering state where another approach for re-unification is focused on. The plan is to unite the western (more bare) part of the continent and then integrate the problematic big three. Who is driving this - hard to tell, but a lot of people must acknowledge the problem. It is possible that even mysterious organizations like "immortal 11" is backing this up.

Unfortunately, it seems the things need to get worse before it gets better. Eldemar (and possibly Sudomir/Falknea) need to be destroyed so the unification effort will start - those states won't interfere with unification of the west.

Pro-unification members are very influential and are high ranking members of various organizations (cults, royal family, mages). They are aware of the plot Ibasa is trying to pull and providing their own support to impede Big 3 states.

As part of ransacking Nevada estate, member of this pro-unification, royal prince also known as RedRobe in the series, identified SG as artifact donated to royal treasury and made measures to start the loop 30 days before planar alignment to make sure invasion of Ibasa is successful. He spends great effort to guide invaders, also builds up his own skills during looping business. The full key is missing, the other option is person with divine blessing. Zach Nevada has such, so he's used as anchor person to start loop (there aren't many other people with divine blessings and most of them are high ranking priests). RR piggybacked on Zach to prepare for successful invasion so the re-unification of Continent can finally start from Abnazia.
