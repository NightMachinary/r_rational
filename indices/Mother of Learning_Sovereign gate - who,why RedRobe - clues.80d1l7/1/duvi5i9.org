I guess I'll post my own dumb theory again. I'll copy/paste, because I'm lazy, so my apologies in advance for that. *SPOILERS*, obviously:

  Well, I guess it's time for my pet theory. I don't think it's Veyers the fire-guy. He was, by all accounts, an underachieving twat and he had no obvious connection to the whole loop business. We also haven't met him at all, so if in the end it's him going "HA HA! IT'S ME, GUY YOU'VE NEVER MET" it's going to be fairly mediocre storytelling - and the author, so far, has been really good at this shit. Also, he's the guy who's been propped up as the most obvious suspect, so by unspoken rules of mystery writing, he's the red herring.

  No, I think it's Zach. Wait, no, sorry. Let me try again.

  He's a Zach simulacrum gone rogue.

  Evidence:

  We got a lot of foreshadowing about how simulacra can go rogue after a while if their originator isn't especially responsible and moral, and so far Zorian I believe has had his copies running for more or less the entirety of the loop with nothing worse than them pulling pranks on him. Zach is a nice dude but he also strikes me as someone with less resolve and self-control than Zorian and that foreshadowing, I feel, is more than just something to keep us on our toes. EDIT: Since I wrote this, Zach has actually learned to make them (again?) and they're already showing signs of this.

  Then, Zach mentions there is an odd discrepancy between his abilities and his mana supply. You know what does that? Having a simulacrum out there. Admittedly, he mentions he has MORE mana than his 'magnitude' would entail, which is definitely not how we've been told it works, but once we're in weird self-empowered simulacrum territory, who knows what fuckery has happened? The anomaly doesn't match anything we've been told, but it's still a very suspicious anomaly in that specific area.

  Zach doesn't know the simulacrum spell, sure. But he's also been thoroughly mind-scrubbed and, if my theory is true, that would be the number one thing to edit out. And, y'know, Zach might not be a huge-ass nerd like Zorian, but he's still someone who's spent his decades in Zero-Responsibility Groundhog Month Land grinding obscure powerful magic instead of just kicking back and pounding pussy for thirty years, including getting pretty good (if not as good as Zorian who kinda had to by necessity) at the boring ass Xvim-style shit just for the fuck of it, and him going "oh I guess I don't have a prereq to learn this incredibly powerful and useful spell, guess I'll just throw it away and never bother with it again" strikes me a bit off, if not entirely out of character.

  I also got a vibe that Red Robe's relationship with Zach went beyond "ah, the other loop guy."

  The main blow against this theory is the minor inconvenient fact that, according to what the characters been told so far, simulacra should disappear after the reset. (Although, have we actually seen Zorian keep one going up to the point of reset and then verify that?) Thing is, in stories like this, which hinge on an ever expanding ruleset for the magic, there is always room for a later reveal of an 'except' when it's time for all the pieces to finally fall into place:

  Simulacra don't persist after the reset... except if they're made by the guy with the original super-marker. Except if they manage to survive the reset by taking over/riding in/doing other soul magic fuckery on someone else's body. (Poor Veyers, perhaps?) Except if, in last ditch effort, they try waiting the reset out in the Guardian's room. Except if they bind themselves to a phylactery by doing what liches use the simulacrum spell for.

  The rules are open enough that, if I had to take over the story as a writer, I could come up with half a dozen ideas more. Have I figured it out? I dunno, man. Probably not. But until I'm proven wrong, I'm sticking to this theory, because it's fun.
