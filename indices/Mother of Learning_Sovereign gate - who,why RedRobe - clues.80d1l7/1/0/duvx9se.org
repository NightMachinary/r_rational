I had this theory for a while. As soon as we heard about simulacrum going rogue, and Zach being entirely uninterested in the idea of simulacrums, despite his reserves making them perfect for him, it seemed like a good fit. Especially as Zach could easily have developed into an entirely different, bitter, hateful person with his origin.

It has three HUGE flaws though.

1) Creating a simulacrum requires immense shaping and soul magic ability.

2) He'd have to have created the simulacrum fairly early in the loop.

3) Zach has spent years with Zorian and Alanic developing his shaping and soul control enough to create a simulacrum, and he can barely do it now.

Red Robe's mind magic is crude, and can barely work on Zach anyway. I don't even think Zorian could remove someone's shaping/soul control on a regular person (without killing them), so there's no way Red Robe could manage it on someone with Zach's protections.

Edit: Also, Red Robe created a simulacrum of his own during the fight against the Aranea.
