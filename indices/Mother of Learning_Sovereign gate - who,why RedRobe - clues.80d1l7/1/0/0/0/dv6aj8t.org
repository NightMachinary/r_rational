except that the gate can copy souls so magic that can give a simulcrum its own soul is not too far fetched and would solve the mystery of too much mana

i think a simulcrum villain would be the far better story than the never mentioned ex class mate. the class mate wouldn't care about the others coming out too (except if he wants to release the primordial), the simulcrum would want to be zach in reality and they would fight for it.
