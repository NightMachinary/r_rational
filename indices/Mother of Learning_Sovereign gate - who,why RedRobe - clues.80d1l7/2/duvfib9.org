It could be partway of the explanation of how Zorian ended up with a marker as well. Either RR modified the way the temporary marker works at the start, or modified Zachs such that soul merges produce jailbroken markers. Or RR spent most of his time trying to jailbreak his own marker, and that change is permanent, creating markers like Zorian's.
