This is about interpretation of the words, in some fashion a way to guess some of the authors designs. We are discussing this because we are enjoying the story.

For me, the story contains enough twists, surprises. However at the same time a lot (some) clues were provided prior, so author is very keen on foreshadowing.

Another interpretation of the authors words on the site, some of the plot information cannot be put into plot directly because Zorian does not touch it without great layer of indirection. My assumption here is that Zorian contains no link to Abnazia so there is no easy way to put this information into story. However if you describe Abnazia alone in the article, it will be too suspicious. Write about another a bit relevant state (has some weight) and here you are - a foreshadowing not obvious at the first glance, but in my eyes it is very sneaky foreshadow attempt. It made a lot less sense for me prior chapter 81.

Your plan about cleaning up a competition has some valid points, however your suggested plan is very close to "just slaughter everyone who is against you and you'll unite the rest". The necromancers took the hard stance and now they are nesting in small cold island with close to zero resources. There's a recent proof that such hard action does not work.

I'm not saying the prince is evil. If you want to unite the continent, there's a lot of blood to be shed. This man does have a plan (and it seems like a pretty good plan). He's got ambition, plan and he's making it happen. Does it make him evil? Well, a lot of innocent people will die. Does that make him evil? Yes. Is he aware? Of course. But there's a lot more innocent blood shed during splinter wars and it will continue unless someone makes sure continent is united and bloodshed will stop.

The statement "controller has this ability" could also be interpreted as "only person with soul marker can invoke ability (if he has relevant item)". The orb has memory storage function and I'm damn sure there's no such function in the soul marker (as the rest of the functions). Zorian detected some other functions (like how many loops are remaining until SG runs out of power). Author did not describe any other.

In my opinion Zorian just have to avoid switch which initiates restart and he's safe to play with any other button. And it seems for it he does that to understand the function of the button.

Zach divine blessing remains a mystery for now. Even QI did not elaborate how he got it exactly. It sounds like he got it from random god on some rare chance, but it was never specified. And this blessing is totally irrelevant to the point I'm trying to prove. The only relevance is that Zach was used as anchor to start SG, but how he got it holds no relevance to my conspiracy theory.

I'm not telling I've got answers to everything. I've got some ideas I wanted to share - chapters are too rare and I kinda hope this warranted a separate discussion.
