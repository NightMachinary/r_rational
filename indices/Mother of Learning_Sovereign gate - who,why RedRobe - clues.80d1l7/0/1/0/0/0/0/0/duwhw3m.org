  I cannot find exact quote, but he was asked about why he does not write the story from multiple points of view.

Like I said, various infodumps happened without breaking this rule. Zorian just found the right person and had a talk with them (Vani, his classmates, that businessman dude in Sudomir's town, etc etc etc). Sometimes the infodumps are just there, the most recent being about that flying ship. All Zorian has to do, is to find a person who rants at him about politics, and voila, it's woven into the story. Such person is not hard to find, as Zorian is surrounded by nobles, influential priests and mages.

Sorry, I'm not buying this wiki as last resort to clue us in. It would be trivial to infodump Abnazia if there was even the slightest need.
