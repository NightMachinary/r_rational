  He's got ambition, plan and he's making it happen. Does it make him evil?

Absolutely, yes. Unification achieves nothing except ego stroking. Example: the Splinter states. They /were/ unified once, look how well that worked out.

But that's all rather philosophical. I was calling the prince evil initially simply out of convenience.

  Another interpretation of the authors words on the site, some of the plot information cannot be put into plot directly because Zorian does not touch it without great layer of indirection.

This is bad storytelling though. While nobody103 is not a professional writer (as far as I know), but this is /basics/, he has to know this much. Don't put any crucial info in the addendum or worse, on an external resource.

There were significant infodumps woven into the story that became relevant later. The fact that Abnazia was not treated similarly is a strong indication that it won't be relevant.

I mean, one of the worldbuilding posts writes about yetis. Does this mean that this prince is secretly a yeti overlord? Look, a confirmation!

  There are also persistent rumors of hidden cities in the deep wilderness, populated by yetis that are far more technologically and magically advanced than their common brethren. These rumors remain just that for now, but they occur with sufficient regularity that most scholars think there may be something to them.

Guess who is pushing exploration of the northern wilderness? Eldemar!

They are threatening the secret yeti kingdom!

Oh, they are *SO GOING DOWN*.

Yeti conspiracy!

Yeti conspiracy!

Yeti conspiracy!

(Sorry, but not sorry, this was fun to make up on spot).
