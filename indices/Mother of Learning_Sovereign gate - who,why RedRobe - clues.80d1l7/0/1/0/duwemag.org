  Author stated that it is to provide some more background information which is relevant
#+end_quote

That's /not/ what it says on the site.

#+begin_quote
  I have put a lot of thought into the setting of the story, and not all of them can be fitted into the plot without hurting the overall flow of the narrative. Since I feel it is a shame to simply let these background information sit uselessly on my hard drive, and since many people have expressed a desire to read these worldbuilding notes, I have decided to start posting them here.

  I will also post other MoL related content here, such as fanart I have received.
#+end_quote

So here's the answer: the site was made by popular demand from the fans to tell them about /irrelevant/ but fancy worldbuilding. Yes, irrelevant. That's what it means, "can [not] be fitted into the plot without hurting the overall flow of the narrative". If Abnazia was relevant, it would be fitted in the story somehow. Otherwise it would be a bad story.

  Abnazia is not a culprit. Abnazia is the site where this ambitious prince wants to start unification from.
#+end_quote

So, a culprit. How does that work, anyway? An Eldemarian prince shows up in that competing state, takes over and conquers his former homelans? Why? Why does the local elite allow him to take over and not, well, kill him? Hell, why bother with this complexity. Wraith bomb every opponent and order the glorious Eldemarian army to take over the smoldering remains. Use the time loop to figure out how to assassinate any relative that gets in the way. Here, a much more straightforward and reliable plan for an evil prince made up in one minute.

  The suspected uses are: dagger - in soul kill episode and crown in temporary marker.
#+end_quote

Actually, no, I've just checked the relevant chapter (55). It says the controller has this ability, as in, the marker can do it with know-how.

#+begin_quote
  He pretty much discovered all the purposes of switches and so far he didn't find any.
#+end_quote

And this one is definitely not true. He has figured out just two functions: the emergency restart and the convo with the guardian. His marker is damaged and its very risky to research the marker by trial and error, because the first error means the end.

  Apparently pre-requisit to use the SG is to possess divine blessing.
#+end_quote

This is an ad hoc explanation. Tell me, why does Zach have the blessing in the first place?
