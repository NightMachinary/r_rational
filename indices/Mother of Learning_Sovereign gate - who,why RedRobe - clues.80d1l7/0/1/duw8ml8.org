Tetra is not united. It already has two factions which do not agree (merchants vs unificators). So it is much less likely to succeed. One has workout internal factors first to attempt global influence. Too much internal drag otherwise.

In the similar fashion I'd like to ask you - what is the purpose of the world building site? Author stated that it is to provide some more background information which is relevant, interesting, but there's a hard way to put into the story (it does not fit). The particular link I've quoted and QI tells in chapter 81 is about the same - another round of splinter wars is inevitable.

Abnazia is not a culprit. Abnazia is the site where this ambitious prince wants to start unification from. Read the article. The consensus was that to re-unificate continent one of the approaches is to unificate the most central part (valley there 3 big players are) and the rest would be easy. However they are all too strong and this is failing. So this prince is attempting another approach - unificate the rest of the continent first and then conquer the central part. It may even work. But the big three are preventing Abnazia from starting the process. Chaos, which would start after Ibasa invasion/summoning of primordial/wraith bombings/etc. would give the opportunity to start unification plan. And it seems that this had been in works for some time. This worldbuilding article and chapter 81 complement each other very much (in my opinion).

As for your other arguments, they can also be explained. We didn't see any other divine artifact in use yet besides orb. The suspected uses are: dagger - in soul kill episode and crown in temporary marker. There's also totally unproven theory about knowledge of using soul marker to achieve those purposes. The latter could be somewhat disproved by Zorians increasing soul awariness. He pretty much discovered all the purposes of switches and so far he didn't find any. All 5 switches related to those functions to be broken is very unlikely.

Now as for divine artifact usage, this prince is much better explanation. The gate was put into mana hole under guise - to investigate it. It needs to be there most likely due to mana requirements. This happened by initiative of Royal family, our prince fits well. He has access to the dagger and the QI brags that no one recognises the crown so he's pretty relaxed. Even Kayle was able to create soul banishing item, RR should be capable of doing that as well. He's interacting with QI, so he fits into using those artifacts well.

As for the purpose, I'm more partial to the notion QI and silverlake shared about gods being whimsical creatures, sovereign gate being a punishment to primordial. The guardian is not primary purpose artifact.

The divine blessing explains why RR used Zach as an archor, not himself. Apparently pre-requisit to use the SG is to possess divine blessing. RR is lacking one, so he used him as an archor and conveniently piggybacked via temporary marker and mindraped zach as to express his gratitude.
