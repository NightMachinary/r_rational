  If the kids (humanity or whatnot) feels like they want to take on primordial for some time, gods are not interfering with that - it will be pulled back into prison with that anchor anyway after some period of time.

The priests in Cyoria [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/26/Mother-of-Learning][told]] Zorian that primordials, when released, do not eventually get unsummoned, because they're native to the plane.

  "But wait," Zorian said. "If primordials are not spirits, but some kind of strange magical creature, how are the attackers planning to summon one?" asked Zorian.

  They don't," Batak said. "I didn't want to interrupt you while you were talking, but you almost certainly misunderstood something there. Primordials can't be summoned, since they're down here with us already. Bound, forced into sleep and locked away, but still with us. What they can be is set loose." Zorian felt a shiver run down his spine. *The primordial wouldn't disappear, he realized. The Ibasan invaders thought they were summoning a fancy demon to go romp over their enemies, but that thing was never going back to its home plane on its own.* It didn't have one.

If their prisons had an automatic teleport anchor to pull back the primordials (Such a spell has never been demonstrated in the story, BTW.), why wouldn't it activate immediately? I doubt such a thing would work anyway. They primordials are tiny universes. Once they're free, they're free.

  It is very unlikely that people didn't attempt to free primordials from their prisons before (look at the shifters and their usage of primordial essence) and you don't see any wandering primordials - they are all tucked into prisons.

The primordials were put in prisons by the gods because killing them was *too hard* for them. Each primordial just broke into smaller primordials around them, causing massive devastation. So they sealed them up in prisons at the far corners of the world, of which Cyoria was one until recently.

  The unholy cross between scorpion, dragonfly and a centipede was clearly Hynth, the Locust Lord, whose bronze carapace was impervious to just about everything but divinely-forged weaponry and whose four pincers could tear steel like paper. The ability to release clouds of biting, devouring insects from pores on his body that devastated the countryside for kilometers around the thing, all while the primordial tackled anyone strong enough to stop them completed the image of a living natural disaster. The cluster of wings hanging above Hynth was probably Ghatess, who was allegedly a ball made out of multicolored bird wings -- and only bird wings -- and created storms and tornadoes wherever it went, funneling matter into the center of its sphere where it seemed to just disappear without a trace. The boar/crocodile/porcupine thing was Ushkechko, a beast made out of indestructible black glass that poisoned anyone who so much as scratched themselves on one of its numerous bladed protrusions and could fire said protrusions like arrows at opponents.

Mages shaping abilities used to be far worse in the past--there were dozens spells for each color of light, for instance, whereas now there is only one. Many spells had to be long rituals. I find it unlikely that humans would have dealt well with primordials after the god's left. They would have at least caused an apocalyptic event like the desertification of the other continent, but there are zero mentions.

Shifters are likely from back when the gods were still around.
