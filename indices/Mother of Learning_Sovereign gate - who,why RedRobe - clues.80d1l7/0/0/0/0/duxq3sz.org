  Suppose the gate was activated 1 day before the aligment. Sure, Zach now has, let's say, 10,000 months inside the loop. But he has one day to fight the invasion in the real world, and that is all that matters. One day is simply not enough to persuade and mobilize anybody, to craft golems and steal whatever artifacts you want for the mission and so on. It is clearly sub-optimal to activate the gate that late.

Except the main expenditure of the gate is recreating the world. The thirty day limit is purely for moral reasons, not anything else.

  "Wait," frowned Zorian. "So the time loop spends power per iteration, not according to how much time passes?" "Yes," the Guardian confirmed.

The total amount of time in the loop is based on the *number of restarts.*

Having a one day loop would result in far less time available in the loop. A two day loop would be slightly better, a three day loop better than it, and so on.

So it doesn't make sense that the loop was activated "early" if it's intended to stop the primordial. "Early" is the only way you'll have time to do anything!

But the Guardian of the Threshold *said* it was activated early. The *intended* time was the planar convergence.

  "The time loop is normally supposed to be initiated at the peak of planetary alignment," the Guardian explained. "Unfortunately, something seems to have gone wrong and the time loop has been activated one month prior to it. This made everything more costly, causing the time loop to degrade far more rapidly than it is supposed to."

Given what we know of the gate's mechanics, that makes no sense if its function is to stop primordials being released.

Which means one of three things to me:

1) The gate isn't meant to stop Primordials.

2) The main function is just to "create an uber mage" to whoever activates the gate (likely with the full set of keys), and the automatic "stop primordials" feature is just backup. The guardian is too stupid (or designed not to give away info, as we've seen), so it doesn't mention this.

3) The gods used to be able to copy the state of the world 30 days before the time loop, then wait until near the convergence to activate the loop using the saved state. The angels can't do this, so they activated the loop early.

The problem with this idea is that it would leave almost no time to prepare once the looper left the loop--they'd leave near the time the primordial was being released.
