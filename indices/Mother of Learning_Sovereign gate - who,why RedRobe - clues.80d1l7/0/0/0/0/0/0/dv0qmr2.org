I would also focus on the why of the Gate's existence. Maybe the Gods created the Gate to periodically drain the energy of the Primordial who was turned into the parallel world. The fact that the Gate creates an ubermage could be a honeytrap to ensure the Primordial stays weak. An interesting feature is that all Primordial prisons are connected to the parallel world. Maybe this means that all the restarts are doing is draining all the Primordials of energy. I mean resetting an entire Universe several millions of times would take an enormous amount of energy.

This assumes that skipping a few Gate activations is fine as the last one must have been 4-5 missed ones before this. Although the last ubermage stayed inside 11 lifetimes which would turn a lot of people insane. Maybe the the last few branded individuals only stayed 1-2 lifetimes. As QI is 1000 years old (about 11 lifetimes at 85 years per lifetime) and still only a demigod means that there are some diminishing returns on molding exercises/spell research.

I agree that someone with access to the Sovereign Gate in the real world is needed so that Zach could have initially entered the Gate. But that could just be the entity that gave Zach the blessing sneaking him in.
