We weren't show a method how to measure mana pool. We first heard about it on combat training. And the leaflet Zorian picked up suggest that average mages can fire of 8-12 missiles before running out of mana. People at talking about magnitude, but I can't recall anyone capacity test just to measure capacity. And it seems your assumption is that because combat training starts at year 3 Zach never had an opportunity to measure his mana pool.

When zorian made some puzzles for Kirille, he taught her how to use her mana and she ran on some occasions out of mana IIRC. So I'm pretty sure there were some tests done on the first years which would drain one's mana and would measure capacity. It's just we didn't see any. But I'd laugh if anyone seriously told me that neither academy nor students themselves were not interested in one's capacity until the third year.

I'd say this is pretty good indication that Zach actually knew about his pool size and thus he knows what he's talking about.
