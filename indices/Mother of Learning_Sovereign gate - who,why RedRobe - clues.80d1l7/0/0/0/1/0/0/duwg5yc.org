chapter 62, exact quote: "Ha. Well, it's not just that," Zach said. "The fact I was able to keep up with the academy curriculum at all, even before the time loop, pretty much shuts down the theory I'm just lucky. I'm magnitude 50 in terms of mana reserves, but I can shape my mana as if I was magnitude 25 at most. That's too... convenient to be natural."

if the SG is started at correct time, most likely it would have 10000 restarts. This, of course would help mature. But it's like hoping that each and every child would mature in nice manner (especially within environment with no consequences).

And you are telling that (im)mature child has better chances to overthrow conspiracy than high respected priest according to divine intervention? I'm not much impressed by such conjecture. What the child lacks (which is very well illustrated why they use Xvim to get knowledge from other mages) is weight and he can never get it during one month.
