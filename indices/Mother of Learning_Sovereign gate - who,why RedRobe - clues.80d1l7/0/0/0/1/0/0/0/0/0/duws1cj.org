Sigh.

There are two components here. Mana shaping ability and mana reserves, that are the inverse of each other. Zach's mana shaping ability is always a constant, corresponding to his natural level, mag25. The question here when his mana reserves were discovered, and when it became obvious that there is a *discrepancy* between his shaping level and his mana actual reserves.

Consider these two scenarios: Zach is given the blessing at birth and Zach is given the blessing at the start of this school year. This quote fits perfectly both scenarios. In both he is shaping on par with mag25 and in both he discovers his real mana reserves while already in the loop.

Therefore you can not assert that Zach was given the blessing at birth and not when the gate was activated.
