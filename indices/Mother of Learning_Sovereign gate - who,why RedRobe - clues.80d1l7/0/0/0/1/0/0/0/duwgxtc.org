There is not a single word in this quote indicating that this was the state of affairs before the loop.

He was a magnitude 25 before the loop, so his shaping ability is consistent. His mana reserves were unknown at that time. Once discovered this presented a mystery how he was able to shape like magnitude 25 while being mag 50, but it was possible either way, with a blessing given before the loop and without one.
