Your argument is a wishful thinking/assumption as much as is mine. We know for sure, that 400 year alignment is the best time for both summoning and both activating the gate. You base your argument on assumption that primordials can escape dimension permanently? It hold less ground if primordials at best can escape jail temporary during the time then dimension walls/anchor/whatever is holding them least, but they are back in jail. If the gods bothered enough them to jail, they might have as well bothered to jail them permanently so they don't have to do the same stuff ever again.

Also, as very well pulled a lot of the relevant facts by SpeculativeFiction: gate can be activated by controller who either:

has full key (which is impossible) is either marked by maker (god) or its agents - angels. Marking here is the divine blessing. Yes, Zach has got that blessing, but he had it already when he started at academy - so it quite a long time ago. Saying that divine agents forecasted/divined this situation couple years ago and chose Zach as one of the agents is.... thin. The counter argument might be that they blessed couple people just in case in advance might hold some water, but is very thin as well. According to the QI, pretty much the only people with divine blessings are the high tier priests/etc. If there's divine intervention, why put some immature boy, why not put high profile priest with huge weight to remediate situation during the loop?

When gate is activated, controller gets soul marker and is put into loop.

It is my argument why Zach was used as an anchor because the conspirator prince was lacking the key, he was not sure he would be able to manipulate any other high priest after getting him into starting the gate - Zach was a very convenient solution for his problem.
