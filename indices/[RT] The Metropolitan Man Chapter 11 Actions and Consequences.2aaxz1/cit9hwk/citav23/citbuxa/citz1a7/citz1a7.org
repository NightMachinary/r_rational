1. A big confrontation between Lex and Superman. Just as a lot of the fun of HPMOR is Voldemort interacting with Harry, your story would be a lot more fun with those two interacting.

2. A tie up of several storylines- Lex murdering Superman's mom, Superman's change in morality, Lois' hate for Superman, the government's response to superman.

3. People not behaving stupidly. It's very obvious to us as readers that Lois Lane trying to kill Superman would be a very bad idea, and that Lex's actions have been far too aggressive towards superman- not taking care of the boss criminal, killing his mother, the bombings. The world getting notably worse because the supposedly intelligent people made no effort to avoid emotionally attacking the alien god would be bad.
