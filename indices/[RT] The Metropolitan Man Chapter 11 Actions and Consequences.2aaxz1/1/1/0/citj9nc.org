I agree with you and [[/u/Yxoque]], blaming Superman seems wrong, but her fear is reasonable. And her actions are consistent with her persona and the context.

But I'm more questioning her role, her existence as a character. She's clever, but not as much as Lex, nor powerful, resourceful enough to match either of the protagonists. She's manipulated by Lex, and the object of infatuation of Superman. As far as we can see now, there's no way she's gonna be anything by 'herself', she's trapped in a weak condition and was trapped from the very beginning.

I cant decide if that means her character is only a device, not actually a person, but a way to help make a story for rational!lex and human!superman, or her character is meant to give us a taste of what it would be like to be caught in the clash of two superpowers.
