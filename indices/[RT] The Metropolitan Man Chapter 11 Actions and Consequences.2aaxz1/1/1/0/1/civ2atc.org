I'm not entirely sure why she has to have a purpose as a character in the story. As a rational fanfic, I see a merit in being handed a cast and simply explaining a rational progression given a set of physical laws governing the hero's powers and a choice of psychological profile for each cast member.

In that perspective, Lois doesn't have any more "purpose" as a character in a story than I do. She is a person that exists and was singled out in the original work, so it makes sense to include her in the rational fic regardless of her literary role.
