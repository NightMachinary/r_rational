I think she is very reasonable. Reacting with fear to a being literally taking her life in his hands for a thrill ride seems a more natural response than becoming an infatuated little girl, at least for an intelligent woman. I don't really agree with how she blames him for not saving the world 24/7, because if superman started as an evil warlord than everybody would be pretty ok with that person deciding to be a normal guy for a while instead. But in the end it would be a lot stranger for me that a mentally healthy woman would expect to have a serious, balanced relationship with someone who is, for all intents and purposes, a god.
