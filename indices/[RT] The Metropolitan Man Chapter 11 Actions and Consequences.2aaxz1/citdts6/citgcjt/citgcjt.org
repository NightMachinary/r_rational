I can understand most of her actions and thoughts. Fear of Superman is, in my opinion, a pretty reasonable result. But blaming Superman for not saving the world non-stop is pretty wrong. It's not like she is constantly doing everything she can to make the world a better place. She still has social encounters and fun things in her life. Sure, Superman doesn't /strictly/ need food or sleep, but it makes him feel more comfortable. I can imagine that being Clark Kent is part of what keeps him sorta sane.

I don't think that actions like [[http://strongfemaleprotagonist.com/issue-3/page-40-2/][this]] (spoilers for the webcomic Strong Female Character) can be expected just because a character has superpowers. We tend to believe that humans (and by extension, sapients) deserve to feel comfortable.
