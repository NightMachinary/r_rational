Yay! I was sad for a moment when there was no chapter on Sunday, and then the chapter came out and now I'm happy. Good work.

I found Lois Lane's response to discovering that [[#s][spoiler]] pretty chilling, and her character all story has struck me as cynical but realistic. Having Lois on Lex's side will make things that much harder for Superman.

I'm excited for the finale, in particular because the dramatic tension makes any degree of resolution seem possible, ranging from Superman / Lex / Lois dying or getting exiled, to the complete destruction of humanity. I could even see Superman getting "redeemed", in however many ways that could play out.
