An interesting feature of the story has been how we have not been in Superman's head except for what he has shared with Lois. I think it might be interesting to see how he thinks . . . if that's even possible from the way this story is told.

Frankly, I could see the story going pretty much any way and still being satisfied with it. It's not the destination, it's been the journey. As others have expressed, the world has been very engrossing. I'm a little disappointed that it will finish so "soon", but that's just my normal reaction to reaching the end of any good book.
