Superman dies, victim of a clever plot from Lex where a still unaware Lois has a critical role. That's the expected part to say the least.

But the realisation of the plan makes Lois understand Lex is not the good guy in the story, nor is she. She gets to appreciate what a great gift for mankind could Superman have been if only mankind had been ready, if people like her and Lex had done more to help it mature than taking advantage of its flaws (sensalionist and crime lord are not exactly jobs improving the world).

Then mankind keeps on being stupid and starts world war 2.
