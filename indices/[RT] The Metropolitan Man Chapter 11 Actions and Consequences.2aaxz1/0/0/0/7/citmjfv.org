Um, my whole life I've just consumed literature uncritically so I'm not sure I'm qualified to tell you how it should end. For me, the joy is in seeing how someone else thinks it should end, someone who writes well.

Superman could be defeated, killed, imprisoned, put into stasis, brought down a few pegs, neutralised completely, replicated, converted, sent packing, caused to abandon us, used to defeat an unexpected existential crisis, joined by more kryptonians, any of those or other things that I haven't thought of and I'm sure I'd enjoy it if it was written well.

Is that weird? Am I literarily challenged if I would be satisfied by such a broad list of endings this late in the fic?
