My concern is that I don't see how the story can end without seeming either rushed or cheap.

I can only think of two endings that would really make sense: Lex kills Superman, or Superman gets sick of us and flies off into space.

Option 2 is unsatisfying and seems out of character. Superman is pretty well defined by his desire to be human and his (few) connections to humanity. I don't see him discarding those.

Option 1 is the more obvious one, but it feels either rushed or cheap. Superman has senses out the wazoo and moves so fast that light stands still. The Kryptonite would have to shut him down instantly (which it typically doesn't), or he could run out of range and then fry his attacker with a look. And if it were an instant-win button, then the entire story would boil down to "Superman is invincible! Oh no, oh no, oh no...oh wait. Ok, fixed it."

On the other hand, you've done a great job so far, so I'm sure you'll come up with something interesting.
