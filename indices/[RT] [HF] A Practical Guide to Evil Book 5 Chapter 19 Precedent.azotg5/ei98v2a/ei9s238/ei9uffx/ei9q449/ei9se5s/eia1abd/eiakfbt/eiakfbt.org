I didn't mean to imply that /this/ particular glass of wine was poisoned. I'm more concerned that Cat's narrative didn't consciously address it. She took the glass, thanked Akua for it, and drank without pausing to wonder if that action was okay.

Also, I'm sure a Praesi highborn like Akua is familiar with more varieties of poison than "you choke to death while the camera dramatically focuses on the falling glass of wine". In fact, with the tradition of all food and drink at Tower functions being poisoned with "embarassing" results, I think it's safe to say that mind-altering substances are definitely on the menu. Possibly very subtle, long-term mind-altering substances.
