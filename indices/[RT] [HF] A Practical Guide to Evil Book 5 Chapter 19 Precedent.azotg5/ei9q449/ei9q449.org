I am slightly concerned about Cat taking a glass of wine offered by Akua. If she's no longer Named, then she doesn't have the ability to burn out the poisons anymore. It's possible that Night can achieve the same effect, but it seems like a poor gamble to take, especially when everyone else had turned their backs to her so they could gaze out upon the sleeping drow.

Do not trust the Bad Faith Wraith!
