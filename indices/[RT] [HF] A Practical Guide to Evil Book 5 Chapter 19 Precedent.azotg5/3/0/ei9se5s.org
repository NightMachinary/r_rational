Akua is smart. She has no viable path to resurrection so far, and the only way to find one is to manifest physically for her to operate. Which means she needed the cloak in the hands of someone and both be useful and be trusted enough for the owner to go along with it.

If Cat dies and she gets blamed, its over for her.

More than that, I assume Cat is still doing those little "tell me everything then forget about this conversation" sessions.
