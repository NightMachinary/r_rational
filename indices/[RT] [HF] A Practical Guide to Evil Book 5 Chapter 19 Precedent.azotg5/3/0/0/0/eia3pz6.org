  I sometimes wonder if that's enough.
#+end_quote

I think it's virtually guaranteed that it is /not/ enough. Akua is cleverer than Catherine, and has doubtless noticed that her mind has been tampered with.

  “We have done this before,” Diabolist said.

  “We have,” I murmured. “Have you walled off any memories or knowledge, or considered doing so?”

  “I have not,” Akua replied.

  “Do you have any hole or holes in your memories?”

  “I do not,” she said, then cocked her head to the side. “I do not. Oh my, you have been thorough.”

There are no holes in her memories because Catherine is clever enough not to leave holes. Akua is assuredly cleverer.

The red flag Catherine is missing is that Akua /has no memory of even considering walling off memories./
