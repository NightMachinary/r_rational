I often keep an eye on CW on Spacebattles and their Index threads as well that keep track of (mostly good-ish) fanfics from elsewhere.

My favorite fic currently being published on the Creative Writing forum is [[http://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/overlady-attack-of-the-minions-thread-ii.264832/][Overlady]]. While not particularly rational in any meaningful way, it is really well written - better than either parts of it's source material. Interestingly, the Overlord games were written by Rhianna Pratchett, but the Overlady fic linked above reminds me of Pratchett's voice way more than any of the Overlord games ever did (though I only played the PC games, not the NDS/Wii stuff).

Terry Pratchett himself has a bunch of stuff that might be called rationalist, in some respects... I am currently rereading his oeuvre, and it is quite long and variable in quality at the beginning and end. I am probably going to put up a post here about his stuff once I am done.
