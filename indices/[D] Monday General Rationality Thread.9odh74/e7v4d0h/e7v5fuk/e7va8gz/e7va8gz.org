I am being /slightly/ facetious. My prediction record mostly takes the form of the number of days in a month that I find myself ranting about having to fix something so simple, so well documented, so I-saw-you-understand-this-last-week that I completely failed to imagine what could possibly have happened while my back was turned. I'm down from three to one! This is mostly about me deciding to stop predicting that certain things can't happen, and dramatically increasing the rate at which I expect to see errors that humans shouldn't make, to better match my observations.

Though I do make a few specific advance predictions. They mostly take the form of guessing which branch of the dialog tree the NPC is going to recite in response to something that happens. This should ideally have a /near-zero/ success rate for people with meaningful internal experiences who don't suffer from trauma or intrusive thoughts or something similar. The fact that I can remember guessing right five times isn't something I would have expected. I don't think I should be able to guess more than general themes - getting sentence-level predictions correct, ever, for more than just a few common jokes or particular phrases or simple concepts, is unsettling. My model of another complex person shouldn't be that good. And if someone has regular intrusive thoughts about "I once knew a guy who the computer didn't like, as demonstrated by this one particular incident that I will recite in full", then... well, that's kind of sad too.

So, basically, I'm complaining that I have to deal with idiots and talkative boring people. I'm also indirectly asking for advice on dealing with talkative boring people. My current strategy is "Give up," but that doesn't seem optimal.
