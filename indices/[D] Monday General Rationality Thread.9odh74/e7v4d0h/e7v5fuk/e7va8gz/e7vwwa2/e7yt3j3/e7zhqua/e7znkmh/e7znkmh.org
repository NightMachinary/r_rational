I remember a discussion on slatestarcodex about "what universal human experiences are you missing without realising". This.

I can automate the delivery of my message (word choice), but I can't steer a conversation without thinking. I didn't realise that people could actually do that until you told me just now.

That possibly explains why I like to talk about "deep" topics all the time but others don't; I am not optimised for small talk which others find easy
