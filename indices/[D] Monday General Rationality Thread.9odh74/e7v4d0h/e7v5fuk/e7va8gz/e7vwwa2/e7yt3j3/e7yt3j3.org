That's called small talk, people do it because they feel awkward if there's more than one person in a room and they aren't talking.

​

It's normal, it doesn't reflect low intelligence.

Sometimes it's just boredom. Most people are boring, the bar for what they find entertaining is low, just watch some television and you'll see how boring that is.

​

Another way of calling what they are doing is: Being Friendly.

​

The way you deal with them depends on what you want.

If you want to be liked you give them the silly replies you know they'll like i.e: Really?! No Way! He actually did that?! God has a plan. etc... Just agree with what they say in general and repeat what they said with different words.

If you just want to get them to stop talking and don't care about being liked, just give 1 word or less low enthusiasm replies i.e: hmm. smile without showing teeth*. nod*. cool. yep. sure. mhm. etc...

​

You should try to understand them instead of just being annoyed by them. It not only makes it bearable it is also helpful.

​

PS. It's your responsibility to let them know you already heard the story, you complain they don't have theory of mind, but at the same time act as if you didn't..

​

Edit* you don't need to be as blunt as some of the comments suggest, most people are socially aware enough to understand when somebody doesn't want to talk. Not only is being blunt very rude, it's also very uncalibrated, like threatening to hurt somebody for using your stapler, it turns you into the asshole instead of just not interested.
