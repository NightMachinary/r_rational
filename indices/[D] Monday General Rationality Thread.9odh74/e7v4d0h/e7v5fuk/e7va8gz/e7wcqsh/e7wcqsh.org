  My model of another complex person shouldn't be that good.
#+end_quote

Consider that maybe you're not interacting with the “full version” of the “complex person” in front of you, but rather one of their autopilot modes that's a construct made of habits and [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBVV8pch1dM][laziness.]] How much it differs from the “full version” is another question.

  I'm also indirectly asking for advice on dealing with talkative boring people. My current strategy is "Give up," but that doesn't seem optimal.

Depends on the power dynamics. +Try to politely ask them to have irrelevant conversations with you less often.+ This one doesn't work, AFAIK. Or ignore whatever they are saying. On an autopilot mode, there is a chance they won't even notice that you're not listening to them. If you can't make your brain keep them filtered out, try wearing headphones when in their presence (if it's allowed) with some instrumental or classical music playlist.
