  This should ideally have a /near-zero/ success rate for people with meaningful internal experiences who don't suffer from trauma or intrusive thoughts or something similar.

This is only true if the person to whom you are talking is actually putting meaningful mental CPU time into the conversation, as opposed to running the mouth on auto-pilot while letting the majority of the brain dwell on other things.

If you want to consistently get people out of auto-pilot conversation mode, you'd need to find some way to regularly get them off-script. (Note that some people may resent being forced off-script, because they /want/ to spend time thinking about their grocery shopping or that really good-looking <person of desired gender> from Finance...)
