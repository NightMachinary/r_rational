I typically do give low engagement, 1-or-fewer word replies and polite-but-unenthusiastic smiles. As a general policy, I try to avoid being actively rude, and being reasonably approachable actually is a part of my job. Despite my private and internal bitching, I can just deal with it.

Understanding people is unlikely to make this more bearable. The root of my frustration isn't actually any individual person; When I made these comments I was in a foul mood because I was peopled out and open-plan offices are very well optimized for turning introverts into misanthropes.

While I don't stand by everything said by 16-Oct!Anakiri, I will defend myself a little bit, since you did call me out. I agree that it is generally the listener's responsibility to keep track of what they have and haven't heard, and communicate that fact. But I don't think that holds when the time between retellings is literally fifteen seconds. That speaks to a level of inattentive autopilot babbling that actually was unthinkable to me until I observed it. Which probably is due to the typical mind fallacy, yes; I was aware that many (most?) people can automate smalltalk, but I dramatically underestimated how automated it could possibly be.
