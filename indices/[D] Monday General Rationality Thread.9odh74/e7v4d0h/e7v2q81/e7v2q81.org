Is it strictly right to classify purely theoretical physicists as scientists?

My understanding of science: The collection of observations and the creation and testing of models to learn about and predict our universe with our best confidence.

My understanding of theoretical physicists is that they are more like mathematicians, taking axioms (our observations) and looking for patterns and relationship to produce equations (models). They certainly /contribute/ heavily to science, but so do mathematicians and philosophers.

Is there a better definition of science that differentiates between mathematicians and theoretical physicists other than just saying that physicists /intend/ to produce maths for the sake of science, because I don't see that as a qualitative difference.

Am I wrong in saying that? Is there something else that I am missing?
