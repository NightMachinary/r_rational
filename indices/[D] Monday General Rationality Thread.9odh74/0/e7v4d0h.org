I am disturbed by how much more accurate my predictions have become since I started working from the hypothesis that a majority of the people I interact with are literally non-sapient.

Stupid, petty office dramas, previously baffling to me, suddenly make sense if the participants literally have no theory of mind and cannot imagine that other people have different knowledge and different experience. Operational failures that should never have happened now make sense if the responsible party was just an automated thing with zero reasoning ability that was knocked off its script. I've seen bizarrely repetitive, non-interactive story-trading behavior that is, for the first time, understandable when I recognize it as a memoryless markov chain with a large chunk size. My previous hypothesis ("stupid people are still people") failed to predict me being told a story for the fifth time, then immediately being told the story of that story being told to someone else, including a complete retelling of the first story. I've been surprised a lot less often now.

Or maybe I'm just grumpy because being locked in a room with random people for eight hours is a creative form of psychological torture.
