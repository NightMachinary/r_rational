In fairness, I suspect this was a small-talk master who, for whatever reason, was unusally inattentive at the time. I don't /think/ that most humans have social autopilot that good.

But then, I can barely automate word choice, so I wouldn't know any better than you.

I would say, though, that all of the other commenters were completely correct to scold me. Just because someone finds it easy and desirable to spew vapid nonsense, doesn't mean they can't enjoy talking about "deep" topics if they care to, or if they're prompted.
