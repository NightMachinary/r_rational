  So, basically, I'm complaining that I have to deal with idiots and talkative boring people. I'm also indirectly asking for advice on dealing with talkative boring people. My current strategy is "Give up," but that doesn't seem optimal.

My general strategy is "draw strong boundaries, but act as if nothing ever upsets you".

Basically, if someone is about to tell you a story you already know, tell them "Is this the story about how X did Y? Oh yeah, I heard it. Good one." Then change the subject if possible. The trick is to be fluid enough to push the conversation in one direction, without looking like you're impatient with your interlocutor.
