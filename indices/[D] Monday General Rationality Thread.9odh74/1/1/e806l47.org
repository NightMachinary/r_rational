'Science', the word, isn't just a verb people do, it's also a noun for a community people can be a part of. The really short proof that theoretical physicists are scientists is that they're part of the science community.

That is, if you look at who they talk to at work, who they cite and are cited by, which conferences they attend, which journals publish them, an experimental particle physicist is closer to a theoretical particle physicist than they are to a biophysicist.

Anyhow, theorists contribute to science (now using a third definition as the publicly replicable advancement of human knowledge about the world) a whole lot more than philosophers - if one made this quantitative, there's probably a pretty clean classification boundary.
