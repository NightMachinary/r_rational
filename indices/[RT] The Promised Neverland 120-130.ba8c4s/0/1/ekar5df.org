It was first posted on here a /while/ back, and had updates on the sub for each new chapter for quite a long time. The first arc of the manga, at least, is justifiable enough for the subreddit, though I can't remember why people stopped posting the new chapters, or the particular reasons it qualified in the first place.

You could probably find the pitch by searching the sub's archives, but be warned that this is a /very/ spoiler and plot twist heavy work.

You might be better off trying the anime, which just finished its first season and is still free to watch on Crunchyroll (At least watch until the end of the first episode to get the gist of the series).
