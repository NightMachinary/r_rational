Ah. Well, I can't really speak as to the current chapter reactions, as I'm afraid my manga-reading fell off a while back and I never bothered to catch up again for some reason. I may have to do that sometime.

Either way, you seem to be getting a decently good reception here as it stands. This post is still on the first page of the sub in spite of being almost a week old, and I don't see many with a better score.
