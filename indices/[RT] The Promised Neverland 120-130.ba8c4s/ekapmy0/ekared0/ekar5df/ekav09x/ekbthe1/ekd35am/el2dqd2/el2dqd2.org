I just watched the anime then read the manga. I didn't notice anything of significance left out of the anime. The most noticeable thing left out was that Norman knew how to pick locks.

All the dialogue seemed intact and the internal monologues are either still there or just switched to spoken largely.

If anything, the additions in the anime are weird. The whole thing with Krone being totally batshit insane in the anime was a weird addition. In the manga she seemed much more rational despite being slightly unhinged.
