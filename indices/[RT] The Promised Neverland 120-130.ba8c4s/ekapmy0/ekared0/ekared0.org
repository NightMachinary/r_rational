Giving you the elevator pitch (as well as linking 120 chapters in) ruins the effect, the first arc benefits heavily from going in blind. I would say, and I believe the consensus is, that the first arc (1-37) is pretty rational and lays out all the characters and antagonists motivations well, for its genre, after that point it decays a bit though the story is still fine. I'm not sure why 10 chapters in the middle were linked.
