Presented for your listening pleasure, the second (sort of) episode of the Rationally Writing podcast. After feedback from [[/u/AmeteurOpinions]] on the request for an episode detailing the history of the genre, [[/u/alexanderwales]] and I decided if we're ever going to do it, the sooner the better.

It's a bit on the shorter side than most episodes will be, and will probably be just repeating what most people here already know, but hopefully we were able to make it interesting anyway :) All feedback welcome!
