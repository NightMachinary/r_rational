Thanks for the link, this should work. My connection is just that slow. It barely manages to load reddit.

Yes, I was looking for an RSS feed for the podcast, if there is one. Since the page linked to in the original post didn't load fully, I opened it in view-source and searched for "feed". Found that link.
