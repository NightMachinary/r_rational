Hmm, you're saying the main link of the post isn't loading for you? That's odd, it's working on my phone. Try this:

[[https://soundcloud.com/rationally-writing/history]]

And yes, the feed is from soundcloud, not my website: that's from a plugin that I haven't made use of yet. Did you try to get there manually or was it linked from something? Are you looking for the RSS feed itself?
