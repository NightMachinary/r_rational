You're not kidding. My advice: take it down, put it in KU for 3 months or until the page counts drop, put it up on the Internet again. If you notify readers of the plan in advance they shouldn't object. The ones that do, just tell them that everyone needs to eat and you're happy to keep it free if they'll make up the difference. I guarantee none of them will take you up on it -- most will be of the "why should I pay for content?" school of thought.
