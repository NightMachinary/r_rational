I sighed. "Alright. Just - just go over it all again, could you?" I ask.

"Again, sir?" asks James.

"Yes. Both of you. And help me push that bookcase in front of the door, will you?"

"...alright, sir. You, um, you know the Defictionaliser?"

"I've only been in charge of the project for the last five years, James. Yes, I /know/ the Defictionaliser. And that's /still/ a stupid name."

Accurate, though. The entire purpose of the Defictionaliser is to turn fictional things real; it uses some horrendously complicated mix of neural networks and hard-light holograms and several other bits which I'd swear not even the scientists working on the project - James and Tom -even remotely understand. Oh, there's a whole host of caveats - it won't work on living people, the Defictionalised items evaporate within about half an hour after being Defictionalised (along with anything that those objects created) and there's some sort of complexity limit which means it can't bring forth any AI more advanced than the ones we're already using - oh, and it takes enough power to supply half the continent for two months every time we turn it on.

"Well, sir," says James, "it's like this. We thought we'd found a way around the no-living-creatures issue that we'd been having. I mean, just think, if we could bring back famous historical figures for half an hour each! Surely that would -"

"Fictional /versions/ of famous historical figures," I say firmly, "which can't tell us anything about the real person they were based on that we couldn't find out from reading their books."

"...well, /yes/," admits James. "I realise that /now/."

"So... what was your incredible way to get living people?" I ask, both knowing and dreading the answer.

"The Prose Portal!" says James enthusiastically. "From the Thursday Next series. It's a fictional device for visiting fictional worlds, and it /doesn't/ have a living-creatures limit!"

"No," I say, "but it also /uses/ living creatures, doesn't it? The bookworms?"

"Ah. You looked it up already?" he asks.

"/Months/ ago." I shake my head. "So how did you get around /that?/"

"Oh, that wasn't a problem. I just typed up a copy of the relevant chapters, changed every reference to the bookworms to specify that they were /robotic/ worms, and then I used /that/ version to Defictionalise from."

"Uh-huh. And you didn't think to try to make robots of the actual /people/ you were after in the first place because...?"

"That would fall foul of the complexity limit, sir. People are complex enough to be beyond modern AI. But worms, worms are /not/. So it all works, right?"

James' hopeful smile is kind of spoiled by the sound of a double shotgun blast. Sounds like he's getting closer.

"Right," I say. "Brilliant. I'll make sure that, when we have to explain why we lost several millions worth of massively expensive equipment, that everyone knows /exactly/ who to blame."

James sags.

"So. You got your robotic Prose Portal," I continue. "You know that anything you produce with it would fade at the end of the half hour when it did, right?"

"Right!" agrees James. "So it's not like we could use it to fetch the Queen of England or anything. She'd be devastated that she only had half an hour to go."

There's some distant yelling. It almost sounds like something about 'born groans'.

"Of course," I sigh. "You wanted to maintain a decent ethical stance, didn't you?"

"Yes!" says James. "So we went for someone who explicitly didn't /care/ about things like his own long-term survival or whether or not he was a real person; but who was not, at that particular point in his story, in any very immediate danger. Because, um, we'd need to go /into/ his book to get him, and -"

"So you got some angry old man who would smash his way through all our equipment, almost kill us, and ruin the Defictionaliser completely instead?"

"...um," says James, nervously.

"Who /did/ you pull into reality, anyway?" I ask.

James takes a deep breath. "His name is Old Man Henderson..."
