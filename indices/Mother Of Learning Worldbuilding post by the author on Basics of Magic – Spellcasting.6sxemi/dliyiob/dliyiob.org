No comments? This post doesn't have nearly as much new information as the other lore posts, so that makes sense. Most of it is just restating information the story already provides. The one significant thing I got out of it is the emphasis on how programming-like MoL's magic is. The soul learning unstructured magic is simple machine learning, brute forcing its way to solutions by narrowing down all of probability space until it bumbles into success. A spell is a set of restrictions on the AI's actions that bars it from improbably, though potentially, useful options.

I was a bit confused by this part, the blending of machine learning and standard programming makes me wonder why the soul can't learn from spells more than just memorizing how to do them. I guess they're just that unintelligent, only able to truly learn from trial and error, which is pretty much all real life AIs have done up to now unless I've missed something. I think reason this confused me is that Z&Z's minds are carried over with their souls between resets, so I thought shaping skills were mental, like any other skill, not the soul itself learning. It does fit with shaping skill being more like a muscle than an actual learned skill.
