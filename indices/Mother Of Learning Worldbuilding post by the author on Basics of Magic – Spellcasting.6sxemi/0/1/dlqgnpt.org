  This post doesn't have nearly as much new information as the other lore posts, so that makes sense. Most of it is just restating information the story already provides.

I'm not so sure...the whole "learn to use unstructured magic by visualising the result and repeatedly telling your soul to make it happen" was new to me, and the story didn't really clarify the lego-nature of structured spells.

It makes more sense now that mages have devised structured spells to do things that they haven't been able to do with unstructured magic, in the same way that no-one, to the best of my knowledge, has ever operated an MMORPG or e-commerce website written entirely in assembly language.

Anyway, I've added this thread, the blog post, and the Patreon announcement to my [[https://www.reddit.com/r/motheroflearning/comments/5v0zl0/links_to_discussion_threads/][link index]].
