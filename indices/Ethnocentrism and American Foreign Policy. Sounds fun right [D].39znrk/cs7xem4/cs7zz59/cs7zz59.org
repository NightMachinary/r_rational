I see your point. Feel free to do that. I just asked because this is the largest rationalist community that I'm an active part of. I'll accept the off-topic downvote.

EDIT: While American ethnocentrism is what started the discussion, it ventured more into ethnocentrism as a whole, and how it colors our views of right and wrong. That's a topic that seems to be of interest to rationalists. At least based on what I'v seen here.
