Should you read it now? Yes, you should, it's with Shadows of the Limelight and Mother of Learning one of the best serialized fiction on this sub. For the pitch, just read this prologue, it's not too long, and you'll get a good idea of the world building :-)

Only thing is that after the first book, I'm left a bit hungry and I'm eagerly awaiting that Farmerbob1 finishes editing his other novel and gets back to write the next book :-)
