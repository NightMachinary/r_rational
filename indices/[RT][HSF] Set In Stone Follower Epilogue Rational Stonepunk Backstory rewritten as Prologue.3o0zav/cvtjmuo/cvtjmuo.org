I had not even considered it as an Appendix, following the rest of the story. I was still stuck in the mindset of either having a prologue, or an odd info-dump like Eric Flint does in 1632.

I believe I prefer the option of an Appendix, with details. I can link to it in a forward section, and advise that the reader has a choice to make.

I really appreciate you folks taking the time to read and comment.
