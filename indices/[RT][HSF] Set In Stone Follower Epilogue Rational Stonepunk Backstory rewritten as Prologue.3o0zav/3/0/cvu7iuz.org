I like it too, but I don't like what it does to the beginning of the story. In commercial fiction, you have to grab the reader's attention quickly, and hold it. The book already has an intensity issue in the first half as it is currently written, which I am going to address in editing.

It will still be heavy on world-building, but it will be more intense. The prologue, as written, is not intense enough. I will try to incorporate bits of the prologue as flashbacks or fit in the world building I did there in different places. The backstory will stay much like it is now, and become an appendix along with the list of characters, and glossary of terms that I am building.
