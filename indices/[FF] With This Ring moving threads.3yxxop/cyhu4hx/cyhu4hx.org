I've visited SpaceBattles a few times recently because TVTropes recommendations pointed to some stories there, but the atmosphere felt really weird.

A moderator could show up to give a warning for a really stupid reason, for instance, write a wall of text with lots of spelling mistakes and plain out bad formatting, and everybody just rolled with it like they were used to it and that was supposed to be normal.

The discussion rules set in the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/RyuugisTheGamesWePlay][tGWP]] thread were outright stiffening; after the Star Wars hype /all/ the pages\threads acquired an advertising for the SW discussion thread; etc; etc.

I'm kinda biased in judging a classic bulletin-board forum because they've always felt too restrictive to me, but still.
