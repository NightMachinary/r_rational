I liked [[/u/eagleJarl]]'s [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/posts/20293854/][take]] on this. I've heard a lot of bad things about the mods, and although I don't post a lot of their rules seem... bad. Rules for the sake of authoritarianism or something.

Their rules on pirated content are particularly egregious. I'm definitely in favour of paying people for their work and all that, and although I'm not a big fan of the rule (being a dirty infohippie and all) I can respect it.

What I can't respect is that they claim it's purely of legal reasons and has nothing to do with their politics.

There are a lot of little things like that, that one in particular just irked me. I think [[/u/datapacrat]] also had some trouble over there.
