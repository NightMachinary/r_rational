I was unaware until I watched the movie that the Millennium Falcon is in the movie. If I hadn't seen the movie, you would have spoiled it for me (and I watched the movie yesterday for the first time). Banning people for this is entirely appropriate.

(And it is not, in fact, obvious from the poster that the Millennium Falcon is in the movie, just a similar looking ship.)

Also, Zoat seems not to understand the concept of a Schelling point. Banning a subset of movie references, and getting people to agree on exactly how that subset is defined, is a lot harder than banning all movie references.
