I recently [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3vf7x8/d_friday_offtopic_thread/cxniksw][spoke in defense]] of aggressive moderation for bulletin boards, so I should probably explain my seeming [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-thread-eleven.311139/page-2121#post-20295073][about-face]] in the WTR thread. Basically, I think that in this whole situation the tail is wagging the dog. The rules we make and the aggressive moderation we employ on a site like Teamliquid.net exist only in service of the community. This is why the first rule there is "[[http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/tl-community/17883-tlnet-ten-commandments][THIS IS OUR HOUSE]]" and all the rules are super vague. Double standards should exist and are intentional on TL. SB would do well to follow the same ideas rather than being enslaved by their own rules. Zoat should be allowed to slightly spoil Star Wars (and note, he didn't even really spoil it) and violate rules in his thread with lesser consequences, just a warning, because he's earned the privilege. That's how these things should work!
