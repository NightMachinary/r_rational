  I think [[/u/datapacrat]] also had some trouble over there.

I did. For certain content in SI, I was given infraction points, a temp-ban, and had the thread locked. In order to be allowed to keep posting the story there, I would have had to submit new chapters for moderator approval or risk perma-banning or other such penalties. I decided that it wasn't worth the additional effort required, and started back-posting the existing chapters to Questionable Questing instead.

I should note that while S.I. does contain content that can be considered adult in nature, I have consciously kept in mind a rule that any such content has to be written in a clinical, detached, and/or non-titillating fashion. "Body horror" would be a closer description than "erotica".
