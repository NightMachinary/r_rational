You may find manga "[[http://mangafox.me/manga/yuusha_gojo_kumiai_kouryuugata_keijiban/][Yuusha Gojo Kumiai Kouryuugata Keijiban]]" very interesting, btw. It takes common tropes like "summoned hero" or "hero vs demon lord" and the like and proceeds to explore, invert and deconstruct them in many fun and interesting ways in a series of short and loosely-connected stories.
