You're right. A committed human utilitarian would not see committed non-human deontologists as automatic allies or trustworthy moral guides.

But this story takes place in a middle-ages fantasy world where semi-divine entities go around being /nice/ and saying things that match human instincts and are /mostly/ right in a very authoritative tone of voice (while leveraging supernatural powers). It would be very hard for a native to notice the difference between utilitarianism and deontology in this environment, and impossible to do anything about it if you do.
