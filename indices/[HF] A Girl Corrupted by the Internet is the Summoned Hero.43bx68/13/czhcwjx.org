Oh, look at that. The Kindle Unlimited rules have changed; now you're allowed to be in it with a book priced at $0.99; used to be that you had to be between $2.99 and $9.99. On the flip side, it also used to be the case that you could make 30% of it available for free and that's now been reduced to 10%.

I need to make a point of reviewing the terms more often, but at least I checked before offering incorrect pricing commentary.
