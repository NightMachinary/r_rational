But that changes what's actually meant by the word "morality". To us, it has to do with what you /should/ do, and it doesn't make much sense for that to be associated with some arbitrary rules made up by angels. To them, morality is all about making angels approve of you, and improving society or optimizing outcomes is at best a pleasant side-effect. If "good" is defined by the approval of angels, then it's unclear why we should always endeavor to bother being good, and we would need different vocabulary to discuss actual morality.
