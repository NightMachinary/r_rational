This was delightful. I'm glad I subscribed to the email updates on hpmor.com. Given this character, I can't imagine the next few months of her life being anything other than trying to assemble a ramshackle version of the internet, because she's going to go into withdrawal soon. If you've ever watched Humanity Has Declined (an anime about life in the far-off future where humanity's population is dwindling and has to meet an equilibrium with fairies whose primary motivation is sweets), the episode where humanity rediscovers yaoi manga and starts up conventions around it would be a great reference.

I highly recommend [[http://turb0translation.blogspot.com.au/p/blog-page.html][Kumo Desu ga, Nani ka?!]]. It's about a girl who gets resurrected as a giant spider in the middle of a labyrinth, and promptly has to run away to avoid being eaten by her spider family. Given that none of the monsters around her can talk, almost the entire story is carried on the back of her internal ramblings as she slowly goes crazy.

The translation above has most chapters, but since that translator isn't a native speaker of English OR Japanese, it can get a bit wonky, so there's a retranslation project going on [[http://blastron01.tumblr.com/tagged/kumoko/chrono][here]] that has around fifty chapters done, and there's another translation project picking up where the original non-native translator left off [[http://raisingthedead.ninja/current-j-z/kumo-desu-ga-nani-ka/][here]], for 237 chapters of the main story and a lot of side story chapters. There's also a [[http://bato.to/comic/_/comics/kumo-desu-ga-nani-ka-r17709/][manga adaptation]] that just started.

Thanks for bringing us more content!
