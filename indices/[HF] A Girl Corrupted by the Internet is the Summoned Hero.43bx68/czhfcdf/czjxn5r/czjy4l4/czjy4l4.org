As a rationalist I do not value EY's work a priori, but on a case-by-case basis, as it should be. From reading the first 4 chapters I have evaluated that the product is not worth the price for me, and as such I have no interest in paying for it.

But, as said above, I am grateful to EY for what he did in the past, and I am willing to support HIM for that, but as far as this specific product is concerned I do not consider it worth paying for.
