While I greatly enjoyed your previous products and will be eternally grateful for starting this whole current of rational fiction, I don't think selling your stories like this is a good idea, as it puts them into the realm of products, rather than support for the creator.

Might I recommend setting up a Patreon profile and provide all your stories to the paid supporters?

I don't mind giving money to you, as a thanks for kicking off the genre that rekindled my love in reading, but I do not consider paying 0,99â‚¬ for such a short story to be worth the cost, as there are many other products that provide better value for the money.
