So, you want to signal that you value EY's work and fiction, but do not want to demonstrate that you value them more than you value, say, a cup of coffee, or a candy bar.

By purchasing a good, you demonstrate that you prefer that good to all other goods you could purchase with that money. By refusing to purchase this book, you demonstrate that you prefer some other good you can purchase at a similar price to the book.

By complaining here in the way you have done, you are attempting to signal a preference you are at the same time demonstrating you don't have.
