Wow, no idea these things are being translated actually.

Xianxia genre is mostly a bastardization of traditional Wuxian ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuxia]] eg. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jin_Yong]]), which probably better deserves rationalization (although to be fair, some selected few works already qualify as rational fictions).
