  How do you know those aren't accurate translations? Maybe the underlying work reads like bad fanfiction or extremely dry, academic work.

I'm not saying they're /innacurate,/ I'm saying that by rigidly sticking to the source material, fan translators sacrifice good writing on the altar of accuracy. It's like the subbed versus dubbed debate, but I'm on the end that's opposite from my regular stance. Japanese writing, for example, has a habit of telling, not showing, which isn't necessarily bad in any particular case (it's permissible in manga to stop stories from getting bogged down), but it doesn't exactly mesh with western sensibilities. And to clarify, it's not a Japanese thing so much as it is a foreign language thing-- each culture will have it's own trends and writing styles, and reading directly translated work therefore feels awkward.

  why are you wasting time reading the translations?

well, I can't exactly read the originals...
