Man, every translated novel I (try to) read either reads like (bad) fanfiction or extremely dry, academic work. I know I shouldn't expect too much from fan translators doing this in their free time, but I'd honestly prefer inaccurate, much more americanized transliterations that follow the plot, but not the exact sentence structure.
