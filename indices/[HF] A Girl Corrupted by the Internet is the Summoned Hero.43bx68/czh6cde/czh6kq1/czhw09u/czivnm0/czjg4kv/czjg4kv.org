I doubt it. Translations into English from my native language Bengali that don't put much effort into it tend to sound simple and dry. (The example I have in mind is: [[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17455]]) However, my bad translations of such a text back into Bengali would sound dry too. The color is irreversibly lost and would have to be reinvented by a talented writer in whichever language they're telling the story. (If you keep idioms intact, then those might transition smoothly back into the original language, but the problem is that good writers tend to break patterns.)
