Feeling inspired is beyond your control, but what do you mean there's no target audience? You're talking about a brand of Chinese martial fantasy. Chinese is the single most spoken language on earth and Chinese culture is very widely disseminated, even without counting the huge martial arts media fan base among non-Chinese people. That fan base is big enough to have enormous subcultures situated within it, like people devoted to individual actors such as Jet Li or franchises like Mortal Kombat. HPMOR has also been fully translated into Chinese, so there is interest in rationality among Chinese speakers themselves.

Consider that Journey to the West is very repetitive and it is very popular. So are things like Inuyasha, Ranma 1/2 and DBZ. Many if not most magical girl / summoned hero sagas, etc. are very repetitive. (FWIW, these genres are also considered worthless in terms of literary quality.) Obviously, just because your source material tends to be repetitive doesn't mean you have to emulate them in that respect.

The martial arts genre naturally lends itself to munchkinism (think of Worm), a rudimentary form of which is already present in I Shall Seal the Heavens, and it also presents elements of traditional culture such as clan loyalty that are just begging to be subverted in the name of humanism. (Not to mention the desire for immortality that Taoism shares with transhumanism. OTOH, if you think Chinese readers would be less likely to pay to read your work, then your analysis is spot on.)

Of course, I've only read 38 chapters of I Shall Seal the Heavens (after reading your book and Unsong, which were great BTW) and I have no idea how terrible the rest are. I Shall Seal the Heavens is heavily focused on martial arts combat (it really reminded me of the later parts of Uproar in Heaven: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWV_ulSNFn0]]), hence my comment about appealing to martial arts fans.
