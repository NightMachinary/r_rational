I'm working on it right now. There's a lot of stuff to go over though, and it's honestly taking me quite a bit of time!

Mostly I'm stuck on figuring out how to make it relevant to [[/r/rational][r/rational]]'s interests. Just describing a genre doesn't really make it relevant as a post; I also have to come up with some way to connect it to rational fiction in general, I think.

I'll figure something out though!
