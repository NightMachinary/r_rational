OH MAN ARE WE TALKING ABOUT XIANXIA? XIANXIA IS MY JAM.

I have been ingesting copious amounts of xianxia stories as of late (read: past 6 months or so) in hopes of actually coming up with something interesting to say about the genre. I love the aesthetic of the novels, but they really ARE mostly junk food, which makes me really really sad.

Translations of xianxia novels are definitely difficult to do, due to several factors. How would you even translate 金丹 or 元婴? All literal translations of this sound absolutely ASININE in english. Golden egg? Golden elixir? Spirit fetus? These phrases do not convey the impact of the phrases at all. All of Xianxia really suffers from this sort of problem, because it isn't enough to just translate the characters, you also have to pick translations that convey the appropriate depth of 'importance'.

(I've been working on an attempt at a personal translated lexicon of Xianxia stuff in my off-time. Highlights of it include translating both 炼化 and 修炼 as 'Refinement' with contextual information telling the reader whether we're talking about refinement of artifacts or refinement of the self, translating 吐纳 as 'Aspiration', and translating 修士 as 'Aspirant' or 'Pursuant' as an attempt to make the semantic network of translated terms more compact.)

The concept of the Xian is really, really suited to optimization and rationality, though. Xian basically fulfill the role of angels in chinese mythology, as relatively benevolent supernatural forces of unearthly beauty and power fighting against demonic forces, but whereas in judeochristianity angels are created by god, in chinese mythology the Xian are all uplifted humans. The fundamental premise of the Xian is a promise that if you work hard at your supernatural kung-fu and devote yourself to following a Way (not THE way; there are generally three thousand unique Ways in most Xianxia settings), you will eventually escape your mortal bonds and ascend to boundless youth and power. Transhumanism as invented by feudal chinese scholars, pretty much.

God I could talk for EONS about how cool Xianxia settings are. There's SO many cool concepts baked into Xianxia settings that I'd love to be allowed to export into you folks' brains.
