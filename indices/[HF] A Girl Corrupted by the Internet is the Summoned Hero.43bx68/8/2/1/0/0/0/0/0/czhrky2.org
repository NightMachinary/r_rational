This is the difference between translating between languages and translating between cultural traditions. You don't want to sacrifice the cultural integrity of the work, but for that, its popularity will fail. It's a tradeoff like any other. Telling someone to "widen their tastes" is condescending and doesn't solve anything. There is room for both cultural and literal translations.
