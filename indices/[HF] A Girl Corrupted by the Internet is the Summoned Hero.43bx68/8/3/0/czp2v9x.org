I've always wanted to write a rational fanfic parody of one of the most common tropes of bad Jin Yong fanfiction, specifically with regards to Legend of Condor Heroes.

You know how so many self-inserts just fucking BEELINE the Book of Nine Yang because, hey, it's RIGHT THERE in the Shaolin temple, all I have to do is go for a visit and sneak it out of that sutra and boom, suddenly superpowers?

I'd love to see a fanfic where multiple self-inserts manifest in the setting simultaneously, and they ALL decide to rush to steal the Book of Nine Yang to munchkin their way into martial arts, and instead of their plans working out they run into each other simultaneously and extreme awkwardness happens.

(That, and having multiple story-aware agents working to muck up the plot rails is always a fun way to go.)
