I'd be curious to see your take on chinese xianxia (pronounced "shin-shuh") webnovels, such as "[[http://www.wuxiaworld.com/issth-index/][I Shall Seal the Heavens]]," "[[http://www.wuxiaworld.com/mga-index/][Martial God Asura]]," "[[http://www.wuxiaworld.com/tdg-index/][Tales of Gods and Demons]]," "[[http://www.wuxiaworld.com/btth-index/][Battle Through the Heavens]]," "[[http://www.wuxiaworld.com/atg-index/][Against the Gods]]", "[[http://www.wuxiaworld.com/cdindex-html/][Coiling Dragon]]," and "[[http://www.wuxiaworld.com/st-index/][Stellar Transformations]]".

They all take place in worlds where martial cultivation allows you to become, for all intents, a superhero. Cultivation is ranked on a scale and requires meditation and time to increase through the rankings. The main character inevitably A) has some sort of power or artifact that allows him to progress at an extremely fast rate, and B) get into fights with people who look down upon him and are promptly trounced.

They're the literature equivalent of junk food: not high culture by any means, but still enjoyable to consume.

But if you don't enjoy xianxia stories, don't worry. It just means you had eyes but couldn't recognize Mt. Tai. ;)
