I mean, given Eliezer's previous work with HPMOR, it's quite clear that the low quality writing style is intentional.

I expect it due to either a stylistic, stream-of-consciousness kind of thing, or a calculated optimization wherein Eliezer reduced writing quality in favor of brevity and ease of writing. It might also be a common style in the Light Novel genre - Anderkent's comment seems to suggest this.

As far as the low quality editing and vocabulary/word choice is concerned, as with the title, I am over 90% confident that this is as a result of attempting to create an authentic Japanese Light Novel translation experience.

I agree that there are very noticeable flaws in the piece that prevent it from being a masterpiece, but I think it very cleverly optimizes for a rationalist audience:

1. Eliezer has many things on his plate - the faster and looser the writing style is, the easier and faster he can write it and release it to us.

2. By focusing heavily on the rationalist elements of the story, it provides, at a relatively low authorial cost, a hit of rationalist fiction that fulfils the basic requirements of the genre. Since that is the element so many of us struggle to find consistently, while other literary needs can be met elsewhere, at a small cost to general utils, this story neatly optimizes for low-cost distribution of very specific utils.

I did feel it was quite short, but then, I've been reading Worm and associated fanfiction for the last few months, so anything under 100k words feels unbearably short.

If you are the kind of person who hungers for rational(ist) fiction, I think this LN is perfectly appropriate, unless you find a lack of quality to be an undeniable blocker to your enjoyment.
