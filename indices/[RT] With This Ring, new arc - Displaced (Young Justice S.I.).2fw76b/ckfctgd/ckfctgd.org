I've got to say, that despite how much I've been loving this it's reaching the point where my suspension of disbelief will start breaking because no one questions OL's sources.

He's given so many different one off excuses and justifications as well as small mentions to 'fictional awareness' due to his home dimension that someone should be connecting the dots. At the very least the way he can get just-the-right allies and know so many specific information from their lives should be raising some warning flags.

Perhaps not in this arc, but around the next one I expect Batman to press him relative to this.
