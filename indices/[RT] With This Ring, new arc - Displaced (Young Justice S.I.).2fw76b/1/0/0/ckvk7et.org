How about all of Constantine's stories, or practically unknown persons he has mentioned across his expositionary dictations? The first were not really noted down anywhere, specially not on digital format, and in case of the latter he has given quite a few descriptions of character which 'did such and such and who has family member a/b/c' based on his knowledge of the common DC Universe(not the one of the Young Justice series) that eventually Batman will catch one which does not correspond to their own reality.

Like I said, it's more of a straining of disbelief than anything else, his knowledge seems to be so encompassing of everything that eventually someone will notice that something is afoot. I expect rationality from all the various sides and factions after all, and we are talking of a universe with far stranger things than just this.
