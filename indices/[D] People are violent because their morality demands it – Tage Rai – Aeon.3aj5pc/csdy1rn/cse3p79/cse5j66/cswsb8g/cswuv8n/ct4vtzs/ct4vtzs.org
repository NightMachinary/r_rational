But... it isn't. We aren't living in an abstract universe where every character acts and behaves like a secondary character in a dime novel. We're humans, and the centers of our own universes. There are no villains, and everyone's a protagonist. We don't act just on base urges, because every time we act there's that small voice, that voice of humanity, in the back of our heads trying to fit our behavior into a greater narrative. It asks, "Is this really me?" or "Why am I doing this?" while simultaneously justifying our behavior because we can't tell the extent of other people's narratives. I don't think we as humans can really take a purposeful aggressive action without believing that we're justified on some level, because justification is so deeply ingrained in our world view.

I understand where you're coming from. You're saying that there's some idealized imagined situation where you think you could initiate force without needing moral justification. But I don't think you have, and I don't think you could.
