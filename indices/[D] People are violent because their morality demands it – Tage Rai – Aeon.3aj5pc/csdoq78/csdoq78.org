I cannot give enought upvotes.

I always frown when people say that human beings are inherently evil. It's just counterfactual : We are a social species , we evolved to be empathic with our close social group . Hate and violence come from a defense mechanism when we see ourselves or our social circle threatened in any way. It might be a misinterpretation or a delusion...

It has also been shown that racist are such because they have low ammount of empathy in regards of other races , and also that when they start to empathize with them their ideas usually change.
