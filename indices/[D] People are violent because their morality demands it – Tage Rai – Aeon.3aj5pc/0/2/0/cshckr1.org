I'm not an expert and it's been a while (not a lot of job opportunities in this field), so take this with a grain of salt.

It really depends on the crime and why people commit it. Speeding (and most other traffic-related stuff) is heavily impacted by the penalties and the chance of getting caught. People do make cost-benefit analyses (even if they don't do it consciously).

But this doesn't hold for most crimes. For the most part, harsher sentencing doesn't really impact anything. People committing murder either they can get away with it or do it in a surge of emotion. People dealing drugs do so because it's the easiest (or most lucrative) job around.

  For that matter, what are the biggest public misconceptions on what is effective at reducing crime (that are embodied in some sort of law that you could theoretically change to more optimally reduce crime)?

Here in Belgium someone recently data-mined court documents to check recidivism. Turns out that recidivism is really high (okay, that was predictable) and that most people who are convicted have priors. Impacting this could easily bring down crime significantly and the best way to do this is to keep monitoring and helping people after their sentence. Keeping a thief in prison isn't going to prevent them stealing when they get out if stealing is their only marketable skill. Them having more skills and jobs available could help a lot.

Another thing I'd do is to use prison as little as possible. We know it doesn't really help and in a lot of cases it makes things worse. Alternative sentencing and things like re-integrative shaming could be used a lot more and they give both the victim and the offender more agency in the whole procedure which seems to help a lot.
