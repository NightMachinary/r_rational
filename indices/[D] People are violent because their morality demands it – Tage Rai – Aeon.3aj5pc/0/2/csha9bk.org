  My years studying Criminology

On a not-really-related topic, from your studying of criminology, would you agree, or disagree, with the statement "increasing the punishment for a crime (longer jail time, bigger fine, etc) has little direct effect in deterring people from committing crimes"?

For that matter, what are the biggest public misconceptions on what is effective at reducing crime (that are embodied in some sort of law that you could theoretically change to more optimally reduce crime)?
