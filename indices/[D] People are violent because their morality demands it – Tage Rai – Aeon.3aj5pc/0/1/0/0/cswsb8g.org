That... that isn't an immoral action, unless you're talking about murdering another person for food. Even then, I wouldn't say that that's necessarily immoral as long as you can justify your own worth over the other person, which shouldn't be hard because humans are great at self-deception. What it is is a violation of typical societal ethical injunctions, which is totally separate from legitimate morality.
