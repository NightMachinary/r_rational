I have experienced a situation where I struck out blindly. Thirty-something years ago, I was sucker punched in the kidney on a bus. I turned around and punched the guy standing behind me. I did not think. I did it. There was no internal justification before I hit him. I did not try to figure out if the person had somehow done it by accident.

If you push the right buttons, humans will react with no consideration of morals in any way, shape, or form. We're still wired for survival, even if that wiring is a bit rusty.

The concept that humanity is fully in control of our inner primates is complete bunk. It's attractive bunk if you don't like to imagine that inner primate having any control over you, but in reality that inner primate /is/ in there and in the right circumstances, it will come out.
