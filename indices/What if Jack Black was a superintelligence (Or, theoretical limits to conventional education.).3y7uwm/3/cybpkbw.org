Y'all need to stop underestimating, Jack 'best song in the world' Black!

He's got the function mapping goals to their most actionable paths, and the best you think he can come up with, is to provide feedback... *FEEDBACK!!!*

I don't think so!

Maybe some other pansy-ass PtV user *cough* Contessa *cough* would be so banal, but this is Jack 'patron saint of rock' Black, and *he* has deemed these children worthy of *his* blessing.

Jack 'Kung Fu Panda' Black will not be limited by something as menial, as a child's learning rate. He's going to sing a song, which exploits the zero-days in their heads, and results in them being perfect acolytes of rock.

*And not only that.*

This song will be /the greatest song in the world/, not just a tribute.
