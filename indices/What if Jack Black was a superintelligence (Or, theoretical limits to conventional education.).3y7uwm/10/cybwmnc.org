I think you're underestimating a superintelligence by equating it with Path to Victory. Even with "conventional/non-invasive" methods, the superintelligence solution to this problem probably looks more like "Spend an appropriate amount of time (maybe an hour at most) revising all of modern physics, economics, psychology, etc. so that it simply and compactly contains all the accurate, "true" models for the universe, spend maybe another five minutes coming up with a curriculum that assesses the current state of mind and knowledge of each individual student determines the exact, minimum set of logical steps they'd have to make to come to grips with each of these truths, and present them in order."

Meanwhile, it will have naturally managed to assemble an appropriate enough fraction of the world's resources to ensure all the needs and learning-conducive wants of the children are met - enough money and construction crews to build an entirely new learning space by the end of the first week at the latest, and Secret Service-esque security forces to prevent any attempt to interfere with the education, full time medical staff to monitor the children's physiological condition, multiple individual counselors to assist in any psychological issues, and even if hiring actors or directly paying them would be awkward, I'm sure it would be able to assemble an emotional support network for each of them that would range from professional athletes, scientists, for inspiration, and encouraging, attractive peers for motivation, and rivals in competition for immediacy pressure.

I don't know nearly enough about learning rates to weigh to heavily the accuracy of this guess, but I estimate we'd be looking at at least the equivalent of ~2-4+ years of conventional education in the space of three weeks. The high end of that is based mostly on not knowing how much information would be condensed into the superintelligence's new knowledgebase after rewriting all of conventional knowledge - it might turn out that the grand unification theory of physics is actually really simple and easy to understand and apply, for instance. and in that case we're talking 7-10+ years of physics education crammed into an afternoon. If we're talking simply how much to I think of the current typical curriculum we could get them to pass a test on at the end of the three weeks, we're probably much closer to the two years.
