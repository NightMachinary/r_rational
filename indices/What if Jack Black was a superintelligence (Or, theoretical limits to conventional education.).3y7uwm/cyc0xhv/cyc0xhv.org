- Medevac helicopter ride to university electron microscope lab: twenty minutes.
- Cannibalise keyboard to get transistors to manufacture ad-hoc brain-computer interface: fifteen minutes.
- Expose JTAG header on electron microscope's beam guidance microcontroller: ten minutes.
- Jam BCI into spinal column at base of neck, fix resulting medical problems: sixty seconds.
- Blast new firmware for electron microscope out through new BCI: half an hour?
- Insert raw materials into electron microscope, get it running, calibrate it: half an hour
- Manufacture seed nanofactory: ten minutes.
- Iterate: twenty hours.
- Upload students: couple more hours. Mission accomplished.

Though I guess the title says "conventional education". Would it count if I would really like conventional education to include an upload? Alternatively, replace the upload step with something like "cover students' eyes with nanobots, Clockwork Orange mathematics into their brains".
