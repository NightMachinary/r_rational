Ow. The nanobots idea could have issues that include permanent brain damage, or it'll end up with weird-looking nerve structures depending on the method used to create structures optimized for processing of data, which is what you want to do when teaching.

It's got a few kinks that may need to be ironed out. Also, you vastly underestimate the time needed for creating that many without exploiting self-replication. The real cheat would be for the nanobots to act as a brain machine interface, with the rock patterns already programmed into it.
