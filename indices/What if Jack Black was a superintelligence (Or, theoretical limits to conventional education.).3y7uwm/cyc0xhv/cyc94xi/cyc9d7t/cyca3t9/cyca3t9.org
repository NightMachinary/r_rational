The nice thing about the interface is that you can program any skillset that you want into it, simply by changing the repository that the nanobots have access to. There's going to be a small calibration period where the output/input of the interface is adjusted to fit the individual, but after that you can upload anything from languages to monocycle riding. Ofc, that is still problematic because you didn't teach their brain anything other than following the instructions of their implant(we installed an extension of it), but with a learning by doing approach where they get everything right on the first try, I imagine things like muscle memory etc. are going to develop really fast.
