There's that often-quoted figure about how it takes 10 thousand hours of practice to master any given skill, but one element often left out of the quote is that the practice /needs/ to involve some element of effective feedback, the more of it and the faster the better, so that you can iterate on each building block of the skill in as tight a loop as possible. Otherwise you're just messing about by yourself with limited ability to direct yourself towards getting /better/.

A teacher with PtV would be able to intervene at exactly the right moment with exactly the right combination of criticism, encouragement and advice, to keep you learning smoothly and keep your motivation up.

I don't know quite what that perfectly smooth rate of skill acquisition looks like, but this is what I'd expect to be the 'value-add' of boosting Jack Black into a superintelligence.
