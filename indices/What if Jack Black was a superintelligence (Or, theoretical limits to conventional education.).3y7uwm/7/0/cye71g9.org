How do you feel about the basic flipped-classroom model as a way to achieve this? It seems a lot easier to me to get everyone on the same page with a lecture-video watched at home that can be paused and replayed as needed, and maybe "folded out" to get extra optional examples at each step.

Going further and throwing in the simplest possible game elements, it's easy enough to have the lecture-video ask the kids questions during it and check the responses, which means every kid gets individually engaged with, something nobody has time for in a classroom setting.

A lecture-video app/site would also /theoretically/ let you track engagement/attention with eye-tracking et al, so the video could actually pause itself upon noticing a lack of engagement, telling the child to go do whatever has them so distracted and then come back. Or you could just split the lesson into pomodoros, and have a warm-up ("mental stretches") before each one involving some IQ calibration task (e.g. dual N-back) that can tell the app whether the student is at their mental best at the moment.
