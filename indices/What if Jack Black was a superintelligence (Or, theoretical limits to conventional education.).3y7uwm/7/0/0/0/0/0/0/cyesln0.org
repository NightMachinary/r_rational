AH I see what you mean, thank you for the clarification.

I apologize for the harsher interpretation, a combination of a lot of exposure to amateur game designers dictating questionable choices and an exposure to teachers and parents has put my pessimism a bit high. Apologies for that.

I think that your correct that cartoons of intent would be immensely valuable as a language for teachers to be able to pass to game developers over all.

And I see the example you mean now with the movie industry, again thanks for the clarification.

I think a creation of a method of game/lesson/material cartoons to record intent would be extremely valuable. I'm not sure if I'm aware of a particularly strong existing 'language' to do that in yet.

But If you know of one I'd love to hear it.

I'd still say that a cartoon is still an example of one individual having some selection of skills that is not necessarily uniform in the population. Not all people organize their thoughts or wants visually, I'd not be surprised if there is a similar thing with interactive system design and play. This is not a problem if we want game designers, it can be a serious problem when we need expert knowledge or skills that don't communicate ideas well as interactive media.
