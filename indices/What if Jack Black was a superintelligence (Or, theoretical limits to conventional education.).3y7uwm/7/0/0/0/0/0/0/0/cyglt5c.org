  I'm not sure if I'm aware of a particularly strong existing 'language' to do that in yet.

My thought is that we don't need any particular language, but rather can hew toward "whatever the educator feels comfortable doing." That is, we don't need an abstract /protocol/ that both the educator and programmer have to learn from scratch; we rather can just allow the designer to instantiate their idea as whatever kind of cartoon they /do/ have the skill to create, and then the developer can work from that. You don't need a "standardized language interface" to communicate a spec to the developer---they've got a human mind, they're flexible, they can take whatever you give them as long as it fully expresses the idea.

Now, you're right, in that not everyone can even cartoon, in any form. This is one of those things that suggests to me we need to give a bit of a look-over to what we're doing in the education system. Cartooning---whether in visual media, audible media, textual media, or interactive media---seems to be a "fundamental skill" that every adult should come out of the public school system with: something less on the level of "doing calculus" and more on the level of "being able to write a letter in a form acceptable for professional communication."

Personally, I've felt frustrated to no end that, for any expressive medium I didn't actively pursue in school (for me, music and the visual arts), I've effectively been cut off from being able to communicate my own imagination when it happens to arrive in those forms. Since I /did/ pursue the written word, I try to use that to /describe/ visual or audial art I'd like to see exist---but that is in no way similar to being able to cartoon them, because the result does not exist on the page enough to /test/ it, to /evaluate/ it, to /tinker/ with it.

If you'll forgive the analogy, it's a bit like magic in /Dungeons and Dragons/. While there are "schools of magic" that can be actively pursued, there are also /cantrips/: fully-developed introductory skills from /all/ schools, that will be learned even by specialists from "schools" opposing the particular skill. Cartooning skills are, to me, like cantrips: a set of proto-skills that everyone should be taught, a broad-but-shallow survey in /self-expression/ rather than merely appreciation or theory. Only then, once a student can actively communicate any idea they might have---whether it be a story, a melody, a landscape, an object†, or a game---should they be allowed to indulge in specific /paths/ of self-expression, through skills like "learning to play piano" or "learning to paint."

† One of the only ways I /can/ communicate visually is by leaving off any hope of expressionism and instead adopting the exacting rules of draftsmanship. I took one drafting class, in grade 11, and I would say it was one of the only true examples of a "cartooning course" I took: from start to finish, it was about enabling me to get the thing I'm imagining onto the page, or into a CAD program, in a way that doesn't actually miscommunicate my intent. Sure, the course I took could /also/ be seen as an intro-level course for professional draftsmen---but intro-level courses far more often leave you with [[https://fastmonkeys.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/how-to-build-a-minimum-viable-product.jpg?w=500&h=421][just the wheels or the engine of the art, rather than the ability to practice it fully on a small and simple scale]].
