Hmm. In my experience there is a degree of prompting needed to get people to actually communicate a thing.

That said as you say that very prompting is probably the first step.

"Tell me what you want"

Or "tell me what is great about this subject"

Or "tell me what skill is most important"

That stuff is pretty basic stuff and completely doable. But starts falling into what I'd expect of any collaboration.
