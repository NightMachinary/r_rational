  most studios already are using all of that and it has not caused the dissolving of the script as a tool

But I'm not talking about what movie studios do or don't do internally. I'm talking about what is (or can be) done /outside/ of the studios, before the studio gets their hands on the work, by an independent freelance creative working on their own and shopping around their work.

You don't need a studio to produce machinima; plenty of people do it as a hobby, putting the results on Youtube each week. If you're a freelance writer, there are only advantages in being able to more clearly communicate your vision.

To put it another way: machinima /commoditizes/ Hollywood directors. You don't need a director if the writer already did all the directing before the screenplay even hit the studio. And given that, you can spend a lot less pre-production time with a bunch of expensive actors and crew sitting around having arguments about vision, and spend more time just producing the movie. The result should then require a far lower budget, because the development pipeline has been frontloaded.

  For game dev [... talking about things like Scratch, Game Maker, etc.]

That is an /extremely/ uncharitable interpretation of what I was talking about, to the point that I have a feeling you didn't actually try to imagine what I was talking about but rather just pattern-matched on "what people usually talk about when they talk about making game development easier."

Look, I've done game development. I know that game development (as a kind of software development) cannot fundamentally be made any easier, for the simple reason that the craft of software is about making lots of hard explicit choices, and people (who aren't programmers) are generally averse and untrained in doing that.

I wasn't talking about game /development/, though. I was talking about game /design/. Game designs are medium-irrelevant. A game like, say, Puzzle Strike exists as both an action-puzzle computer game, and a turn-based card game. The mechanics, on an abstract level, have nothing to do with whether they exist in software or at a table, whether they happen in realtime or require deliberation, etc. Mechanics are about forced choices under information-sparsity, and when you're /doing/ game design, you can think purely at that level without worrying about /what form/ the resulting game is going to take.

You can educate a teacher in the art of game /design/---which, after all, is remarkably similar to the art of education itself---without having to teach them anything about game /development/. Just like a comic book author doesn't need to know anything about movies to write a comic book that can be adapted /into/ a movie, a game designer doesn't need to know anything about software to write a game that can be adapted /into/ software. It could be composed as a pen-and-paper RPG game, or a dice game, or even the kind of child-friendly "party game" that [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Up_(game)][Seven Up]] exemplifies.

You /can/ involve technology in a teacher's game prototyping---but there's no need to develop custom tooling. You can prototype games using Powerpoint slides if you actually have an idea strong enough to stand up. It's not about creating something that is pleasing to play (just like machinima isn't fundamentally about creating something that's pleasing to watch); the point is rather that the result expresses enough of the /intent/ of the author that succeeds as /communication/, and can therefore be used as a spec by an actual {movie studio, software developer, etc.}.

Here's a third example of what I'm talking about. "Cartooning" has a specific meaning, separately from "drawing" or "sketching"; a "cartoon" is a drawing done in order to record the /intent/ one has for another piece of visual art, sometimes as a note to oneself, sometimes to others. When paintings were commissioned in the 1600s, the best thing one could hope to receive from one's patron was a /cartoon/ of the requested work; it would save hours or days of painting and showing and arguing and re-painting. And by far the most /efficient/ way to get your own visual imagination out into the world, was to learn to cartoon, and then hire a painter who you could pass cartoons, and in turn receive skilled paintings.
