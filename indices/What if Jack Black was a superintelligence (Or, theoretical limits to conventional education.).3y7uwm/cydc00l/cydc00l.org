Since it sounds like you're a huge fan of the movie... do you know about the [[http://www.broadway.com/shows/school-rock-musical/][Broadway Musical]] and the [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlyqiKfW2PtgeDSAoHRIGMZNOhWFV-GJ5][School of Rock 10 Year Reunion (Concert) on YouTube?]]

Here's my quick take on the subject after watching a few youtube videos to re-acquaint myself with the movie.

--------------

Professor Jack Black had lost all respect for the current generation of students. Their music was bland and boring. How could he inculcate them with a glam Rock Star's emotional stance -- the pluck to take risks in their lives, to start a band, perhaps even several after the first efforts had failed? He had studied the biographies of several notable peers and found a few common threads between them.

He couldn't prevent the creme de la creme from enrolling in the very school for which he had lost all respect. But why not give a new class of students a gift that would supply the ingredient missing in school?

[If this sounds familiar, it's because I just adapted it from Neal Stephanson's Diamond Age.]

Professor Black tore his eyes away from the Mirror of Noitlov and developed his strategem. He scried on his students and selected a special class. He accessed their educational/psychological reports like the [[http://learningfromexperience.com/tools/kolb-learning-style-inventory-lsi/][Kolb Learning Inventory]] and the [[http://vark-learn.com/the-vark-questionnaire/][VARK Inventory]] and developed the perfect learning plan suited to each individual students' needs.

He was almost ready. He had a list of different improv rock songs he could riff off of. He planned out the character development moments he would have with each student that would push them to the next step in achieving their potential for rock and roll.

He needed to get into the right character. Ah yes.

He would pretend to be a lazy and goofy substitute teacher. This would ally him with their interests and they would relax with him. Many of them lacked confidence and were cut down by their parents, by the school system, or by their peers. From the Mirror, he knew what was going on in their home and school lives, but it was important to build a genuine connection with students in order to get them to care.

Most importantly, he would be passionate about his subject matter. His exuberance would inspire the students. They would see him as a wild subversive element in the school, contrasted with the traditional, authoritarian figures of prep school. Through cognitive psychology, he would trick them into caring about the subject of rock and roll, tapping into their individual talents and unite them into a solid rock band.

He envisioned a loser who was kicked out of his own rock band. A character struggling to pay the rent that was way past due.

He was ready.

Professor Black raised his wand and cast his last magic spell, knowing that Rock and Roll was all the magic he needed. *CONFUNDUS.*
