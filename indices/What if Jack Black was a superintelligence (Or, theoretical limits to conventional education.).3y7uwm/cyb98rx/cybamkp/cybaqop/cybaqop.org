Yeah, would depend on whether more /unconventional/ teaching methods can be applied without leaving the students damaged or altered in a way that strays outside the boundaries set by "while keeping them well adjusted, healthy and fairly intelligent"

For example, /maybe/ a setup inspired by /A Clockwork Orange/ would be an effective way to teach, if you had PtV omnipotence to control the experience perfectly towards stimulating the brain in just the right way, but they would probably also be traumatised by the experience...
