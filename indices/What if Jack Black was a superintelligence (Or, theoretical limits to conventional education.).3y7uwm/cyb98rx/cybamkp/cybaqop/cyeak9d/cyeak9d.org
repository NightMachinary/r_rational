The other side is just how flexible/useful is a clockwork orange style education going to be? what is the GOAL of education?

if the goal is to cram them with parroting facts then ya I could see that working. If the goal is to have brains that can accomplish tasks as good general intelligences (or as good as humans can get) then the results will look a lot more like what is DESCRIBED in Dune. In particular the first lesson you must teach a child is how to most effectively learn.
