As one who teaches children (6 to 15 year olds. Mostly ten year olds) a seemingly advanced skill (computer programming) and also works with some one who found a clever teaching hack for getting math across.

I'm pretty sure at least 60% of the time spent in conventional lessons is making sure everyone is on the same page.

As a game designer one of the things I think about a lot is how to give the right learning curve and feedback loop.

So you might already see the way I'm going here but a super intelligence would know exactly what each child could be motivated by. How to hold all of their interest, how to inspire attention and exactly when to make breaks or changes of subject to keep attention and intake at maximum without overload. How to make learning not just fun but addictive and probably exactly how addictive is healthy.

The resulting kids probably would not necessarily know many facts and figures (they might) but I suspect they would by the end be some of the best self educators humanly possible to create.

They might also never quite relate the same way to normal educated humans again. But they probably won't mind helping their peers catch up.
