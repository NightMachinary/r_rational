Sounds like a good idea in theory. We used a really shallow follow along video similar to this during summer camps and it's great as a way to make up for a lack of one on one instructor time.

However I think lecture systems in themselves are not necessarily the best way to educate in the first place, the degree to which children will 'master' game mechanics already suggests to me that you can probably construct excellent lessons if you can package them into a system that gives tight feedback loops as the most engaging and effective learning curve games do.

However I would say that to construct an 'ideal' lesson/teaching system in this way would require that the system itself (not just the content but the overarching game mechanic structure of rules) is created by the teachers/experts of those subjects. Or that a teacher and software developer work VERY CLOSELY with maximizing the really short reinforcement loop and longer term reinforcement loop on all of the topics involved.

Sadly I've not seen many cross disciplinary individuals like this or partnerships between software engineers and teachers that is sufficiently meshed to yield viable teaching tools that are also engaging games.

At present I do what I can as an instructor but at this point in my career I don't have the time or connections to work on educational systems like this that actually work.
