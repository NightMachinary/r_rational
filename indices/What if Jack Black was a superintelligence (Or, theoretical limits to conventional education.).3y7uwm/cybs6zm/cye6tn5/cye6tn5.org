  What the hell was the school doing that Jack Black could impersonate another teacher? Everyone would be fired.

Having coincidentally watched the movie last week, my impression was Robin Hanson-esque (is there a name for that yet?): the school was very prestigious, and so they hired very prestigious teachers, and so it would be /disrespectful to those teachers' prestige/ to ask them to bring their teaching certificates to the interview or any such thing.

I think this generalizes to the real world: the minimum-wage jobs I applied for fresh out of school cared /far/ more about seeing proof of any credentials I claimed than the skilled professional jobs I applied for later on. There comes a point when you're working for "classy"-enough employers/clients when you get hired entirely through dinner and a handshake.

This keeps the door open for cronyism and confidence men, but at the same time, it mostly works: clients/employers are effectively pre-screening potential contractors/employees using the "pickiness" of the social networks that referred them. The harder it is to even get heard about by someone (think, for example, Venture Capitalists who only take "warm intros" sponsored by other VCs), the less they have to worry that you've faked your way into their view. This also works out to mean that the /more you pay/, the fewer people there are who've built up a reputation working at that high a level, and so the easier it is to trust any of them sight-unseen.

And let me make the opposite cases explicit: the less picky your "funnel", and the less you pay, the more scrutiny you have to give candidates. (My impression is that a large part of the problem Millenials are having getting jobs is that they are stuck in the highest-scrutiny part of the funnel.)

Also, trades jobs are an exception to this rule, probably because the incentives are in closer to the right places: the employer is forced by the trade union to get proof that you're a union member; and the trade union acts a lot like a guild, worrying about the skill-training and certification of its members, so that it can use its members uniform high qualifications as leverage in negotiations with companies. When "union = qualified; scab = unqualified" is a meme, trade unions win, but oddly enough, customers also win.
