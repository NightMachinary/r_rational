One of the biggest problems in teaching, especially of younger children, is maintaining attention and concentration. Children below a certain age are pretty much physically incapable of long stretches of concentration and of redirecting their focus.

So give them lots of drugs. Superjackblack should give each kid the highest doses of ritalin/adderall/modafinil possible without causing permanent damage, so they get as much as possible from the lessons and minimise the time needed to repeat and go over things. The limiting factor would be whether the parent/other teachers would notice.

/on the film in general/ Having worked in education I can't help thinking about how much of a child protection and liability clusterfuck would result. What the hell was the school doing that Jack Black could impersonate another teacher? Everyone would be fired.
