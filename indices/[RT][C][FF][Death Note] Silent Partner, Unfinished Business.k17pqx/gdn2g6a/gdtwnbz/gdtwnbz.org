This is great. Solid writing that captures the feel of the original, while situating the characters a few steps closer to "normal if hyperintelligent humans" and away from "perfect deterministic prediction machines." This quote got me good and reminded me of how I felt reading some of the more complex exchanges the first time through:

  Ryuzaki and Light Yagami were working on an entirely different level than anyone else, building up these huge chains of 'if Kira knows this, than he'd want us to think this, and if he knew that he would have chosen his victims in this manner, which this smudge on a photograph indicates he was left-handed, so the surgeon is a woman' that I don't think anyone else in the room could follow, and they all ended up back at 'so we don't really know anything' anyway.

I remember liking Naomi a lot in the original, and that absolutely comes through here. I also have a soft spot for disabled protagonists who are actually limited by their disability, rather than the more common "WITHOUT MY LEGS, MY ARMS HAVE BECOME FOUR TIMES AS POWERFUL" shenanigans. The author has clearly researched aphasia.
