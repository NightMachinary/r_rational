I've only read 30 percent of the story at time of writing, but thus far I've really enjoyed it. The characters do a good job of thinking well, and the story does a really good job of showing how different people with different levels of intelligence go about thinking as best they can. The geniuses read like actual geniuses, and the smart-but-not-genius characters read as just that. Beyond that, the characters all have really unique voices in a way that makes it a joy to read. Light's a monster, but his perspective is still really enjoyable.
