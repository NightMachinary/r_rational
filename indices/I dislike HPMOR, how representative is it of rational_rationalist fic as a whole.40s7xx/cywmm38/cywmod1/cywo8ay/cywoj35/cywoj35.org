  To be honest, I don't think it takes a rational genius to understand the reasons for the statute of secrecy. Someone with sufficient training in relevant fields who had the training to learn about and understand other cultures and how and why they function the way they do could have understood why the statute of secrecy existed, and why getting rid of it without a viable alternative would be catastrophic

Are you saying that that someone would have thought of the antimatter bomb (and been able to take the idea seriously enough to override short-term humanitarian instincts), or are you saying there is another catastrophic problem with dismantling the status of secrecy?

HPMOR, despite appearances, is not a story about a rational hero. It is the /origin story/ of a rational hero. It ends when that hero is /finally/ starting to get his shit together.
