You know, it's often pretty funny how the real world works. You can grow up completely arrogant and convinced you know everything, and of course reality will slap you on the face for that. But you can also grow up convinced that the real world is run by Adults, who Know What They're Doing and Have Their Shit Together, and the reality will /also/ slap you on the face for /that/.
