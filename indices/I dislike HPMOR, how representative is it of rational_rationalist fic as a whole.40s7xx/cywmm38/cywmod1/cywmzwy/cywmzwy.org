Maybe my definition of rational-fic is too broad. I call a fiction rational when the characters act in a believable way (the opposite of Hollywood movie). In Worm, some characters act rationally and are very intelligent, some are less intelligent but still act the way you would expect them to act in real life considering their background. In that regards, I find HPMOR's characters less realistic even though Harry is more rational.
