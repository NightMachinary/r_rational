I think rational-fic is where rational thought is explicitly rewarded, and where a non-insignificant number of cast members try accordingly.

I tend to forget some of worm's rationalism, that was clearly there on re-reading. Taylor is happy to try her hardest to muchkin for that, after all.

It's also surprising how effective the POV swaps are.
