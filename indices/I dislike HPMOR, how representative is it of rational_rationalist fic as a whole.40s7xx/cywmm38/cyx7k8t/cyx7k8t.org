It is reasonably likely that the author of The Waves Arisen is Yudkowsky. Some readers noted a similarity in writing styles, the author has never revealed his identity, Yudkowsky had earlier suggested writing under a pseudonym without revealing his identity, no other works have gone unclaimed, and Yuskowsky showed up to 'neither confirm or deny the allegation'.
