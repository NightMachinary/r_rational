While I agree with your point that there is a chance that Yudkowsky was the author, I would also state that it's even more likely that another individual wrote it when you take into account just how many people out there write (even rational or rationalist) fictions. I would disagree that an unclaimed work and Yudkowsky nither confirming nor denying being the author / musing about writing under a pseudonum implies a high chance that Yudkowsky was the author. (it does imply a higher chance than if he hadn't said those things, but not a high enough chance to be considered reasonably likely or even probable)

There are just too many authors out there, including those who had never posted anything at all, to pin this firmly on a single one. (as for my personal opinion, I would disagree that the writing style of The Waves Arisen is any more similar to his works than any other fiction with a rational character)
