If i understandit correctly, HPMOR is a representative of the genre, but in the same way that i think you can like rock even if you hate metalica, i think there are good rational-fic that do what HPMOR did better.

HPMOR is exceptionally preachy, for rationalfic, for instance. I'd say that rationalfic usually strives to copy HPMOR's good side while avoiding all the flaws in it. On the other hand, i'm bad at noticing preachyness unless it's something i've already heard and disagreed with.
