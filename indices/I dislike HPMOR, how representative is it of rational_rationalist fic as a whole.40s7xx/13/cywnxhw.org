For some reason a lot of rational fiction puts just as heavy an emphasis on the author's personal wishes and preferences as it does on rationality ([[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorTract][author tract]]). I dislike this as well, and wish it weren't representative of rational fic as a whole - there certainly are some who avoid it.
