Someone once described the levels of rationality in fiction:

1. Characters are not rational. They act as the story would require, rather than how people would act.
2. Characters are thinking. They act in a coherent, thought-out manner to achieve their goals (unless they're supposed to be dumb). The story results from the interactions of these attempts, with a garnish of Plot.
3. Characters are "rational". They are aware of the science and study of human psychology and apply that knowledge.
4. Story attempts to teach rationality. An Aesop's Fable, but for the science and study of human psychology.

Most pop fiction is Level 1. Harry Potter, Twilight, most superhero movies. Some popular fiction is between 1 and 2 - there's stuff that is definitely there just because story, but after and around that, the characters react with thought - Star Trek, latest Star Wars, most of the new Marvel superhero movies, Daemon.

Some extremely popular fiction is Level 2. Game of Thrones, Name of the Wind, The Lies of Lock Lamora, Nexus, The Martian, most classic science fiction (Herbert, Asimov, Niven, Heinlein). The "humanist" classic sci fi is between 2 and 1, because there's more Plot Conceit in order to put the characters in the desired situation within which they react, but they still react like people - Phillip K Dick, Sturgeon, Vonnegut.

Most of the web fiction (fan or otherwise) recommended by this sub is Level 2 - Worm, Pact, (Twig is edging into 3 because Sylvester, but edges back towards 1 because Frankenscience), Shadows of the Limelight.

Very little fiction is Level 3, all of it recommended by this sub. I think I've heard of one published novel that's Level 3 - it got recommended in the last couple weeks. Metropolitan Man, Lighting up the Dark, Luminosity, etc. Some of this fiction edges towards 4; Origin of the Species, HPMOR.

The only stuff that I'm aware of that's "truly" Level 4 - given that you now have to sacrifice the range of story that you can tell so that it's a fable - is the Bayesian Conspiracy shorts that Yudkowsky has written.

(PS - Feel totally free to challenge me on any of the level assignments. Either I didn't think it through enough, or I welcome the discussion)
