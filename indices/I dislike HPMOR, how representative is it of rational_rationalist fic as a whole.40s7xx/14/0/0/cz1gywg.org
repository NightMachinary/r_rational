I agree with your point, but what I think lehyde was getting at would be how exactly do we know which aspects of HMPOR you dislike and how can we compare whether it is a typical example or not without knowing /what/ exactly we are comparing? (or at least, that's what I understood when I stripped away the snark)

However, my own comment would be that you familiarize yourself with the differences between the genre of a rational fiction, a rationalist fiction and the particular qualities you like/dislike when reading a work of fiction. I can't really recommend anything without knowing the specifics as many rational or rationalist fictions are different from one another in many different ways.
