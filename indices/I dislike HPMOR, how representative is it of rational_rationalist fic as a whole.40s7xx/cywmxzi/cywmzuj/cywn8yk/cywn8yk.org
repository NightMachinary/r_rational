It's not pervasive but it's not uncommon either. All the stuff by [[/u/alexanderwales]] is not preachy at all, for example; other fics vary in how much the protagonist 'solves all problems by power of RATIONAL THINKING', which can get quite preachy.

But generally HPMOR is definitely above average in that dimension; you just need to try some things and see if you like them

(BTW, other fiction by Yudkowsky does not have that issue; have you read 'The Sword of Good' and 'Three Worlds Collide'? They're both very good - and much shorter)
