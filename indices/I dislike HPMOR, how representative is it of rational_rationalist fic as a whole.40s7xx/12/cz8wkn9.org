I love HPMOR, but I understand disliking the style. After finishing Lighting Up The Dark, whose writing style was heavily inspired by HPMOR but was a poor imitation, the flaws were made clear to me. It allowed me to see what people disliked about the style, while still being able to enjoy it in its original form.

I haven't read much rational fic, but the entire time I was going through Lighting Up The Dark, I was thinking of Time Braid and how good it was. I highly recommend Time Braid. Not exactly "rational fic" by definition of the subreddit, but I feel that the definition set out by the subreddit is contoured to HPMOR, and restricts the genre.

Time Braid has none of the problems you'd have with HPMOR, even the underlying writing structure is different. Characters are still highly intelligent, but they aren't /trying/ to be. They just are. Characters use logic and rationality to solve problems and experiment with their powers bringing them to their logical conclusions, without speaking like textbooks and using modern day terminology which would feel out of place in such a setting.

I don't know if this genre has been weened off of HPMOR yet, but it is still in it's infancy and is experiencing its growing pains. It will grow out of it eventually, i'm sure.
