I think it depends a lot on the source material, in the case of fanfic.

HPMOR deviates hard from the canon flavor, and yes, becomes â€˜preachy.' TBH I read it mostly for the audacity of the gambits.

/Lighting Up the Dark/ (Naruto) is a very fine example of rational fic that doesn't end up being preachy --- mostly because it is about the process of /becoming/ a rational thinker. In it, it is /commonplace/ that the main characters get schooled by their betters. It has the amazing gambits of HPMOR, without the annoying protagonist.

My own work /The World is Your Oyster, The Universe is Your Namesake/ stays very true to the source material of /Steven Universe/ --- to date there isn't a character characterizable as rational/ist/ in it. (Will come at a later date--- whoops, spoilers!) Mostly it is some people with a lot of emotional baggage who talk it out like reasonable folks, and try to save the world as best as they can.
