If you were drawn into trying HPMOR by some variant of the extremely common pitch 'a genius goes to Hogwarts and tries to study things intelligently', I strongly recommend the fic '[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8484470/1/Potter-Who-and-the-Wossname-s-Thingummy][Potter Who and the Wossname's Thingummy]]' - while, it's a Doctor Who cross, it needs no Doctor Who or Harry Potter knowledge to 'work' fully. It's tone, style, content, and characters, are as different to HPMOR as could be imagined, but it fulfills the pitch above and a lot of people I've rec'd it to seem to like it. It's not really 'rational' fic, for whatever that's worth.
