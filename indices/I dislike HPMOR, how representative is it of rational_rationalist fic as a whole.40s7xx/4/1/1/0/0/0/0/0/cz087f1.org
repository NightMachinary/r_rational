If the number of universes is an integer greater than or equal to 2, then the metaphysical force that allowed for universes to exist applied itself a number of times and then ceased. I don't think a metaphysical force can simply "cease" unless a decision was made for it to cease, and decisions require agency, and agency requires intelligence, and an intelligence who can affect a metaphysical force is god. The fire comparison isn't apt unless the metaphysical force is a physical force, like a computer that is simulating those universes, but that just draws back to my point anyway.

For that matter, the same applies even if there is only 1 universe, but I'm not intuitively apprehensive of "The metaphysical force allowed 1 universe to come into being and then ceased to exist," while I am intuitively apprehensive of "The metaphysical force allowed (integers > 1) universes to come into existence and then ceased to exist."
