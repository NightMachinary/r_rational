Keeping in mind this is untestable metaphysics...

Assuming as well that time isn't a flat circle, if there's a metaphysical "factory" that produced the universe, then the two reasonable assumptions about it are either it worked once or it's still going. If it stopped at some arbitrary integer, which is any (including 1 IMO) that implies it was stopped, it implies there was a choice or inbuilt possibility of stoppage, and those qualities and characteristics imply some type of god, even if god in this case is a computer scientist deciding there will be 2^{24} universes in the simulation.

I believe I posed the issue with knowing about triggers in the IRC and the answer, and I'm pretty sure this was word of god in some form, was that people didn't understand trigger events and that was at least in part because Dragon was deleting such information off the net.

This has reminded me of another issue regarding power types. Wildbow says, and this may even be in-story, that powers are so categorically combat-focused because the entities want to promote conflict. This is why healing is described as appearing incidentally, almost always as a side-effect of a different power.

Well, healing existing as a power at all means the entities recognize its utility, but in maybe the biggest instance of fallacious reasoning/historical ignorance, Wildbow says utility shards don't promote conflict.

Dude, the more bombs, bullets, and guns you can make, the more likely you are to go to war. The better your soldiers, the easier they are to train, equip, and heal from injury, the more likely you are to go to war. Parahumans do what? Build better weapons and armor, heal your soldiers back from crippling and life-threatening injuries and they're your best, most powerful soldiers.

Imagine the USA has the first superman package trigger. He's an air force captain in a dogfight, his plane gets critically damaged, he can't eject and he knows he's about to die, but worse he knows his team might die as well. The plane explodes, he triggers. He has the flight to save himself from hitting the ground, he has the durability to withstand the heat, shrapnel, and pressure wave, and he has the strength to tear himself from the wreckage as it's still falling, and now he realizes he can save his team. He goes enemy plane to enemy plane, breaking off wings or ripping pilots out of their seats. He's faster than planes, can withstand missiles, and has the strength to literally rip planes in half. How belligerent does the US become knowing that for the time being, they have absolutely perfect air superiority? What about when they realize they can use him to apprehend anyone they want?

Same goes for tinkers and healers, anyone or anything that helps the war effort. The more belligerent a country can be almost always becomes how belligerent a company /will/ be.
