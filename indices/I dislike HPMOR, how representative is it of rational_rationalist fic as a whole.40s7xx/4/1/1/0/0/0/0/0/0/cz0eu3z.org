I note you haven't responded to my suggestion that the argument is circular.

  The fire comparison isn't apt unless the metaphysical force is a physical force,
#+end_quote

Why? You're asserting this but I see no clear evidence for why I should believe it. Also, could you provide an example of a nonphysical force? Or a clarification about where the factory / god came from before there was a multiverse? Or what it was inhabiting if not part of a multiverse?

But, sure, I'll roll with your "fire isn't apt" for a moment, for the sake of discussion. How about "Antimatter annihilates with matter, but only once."
