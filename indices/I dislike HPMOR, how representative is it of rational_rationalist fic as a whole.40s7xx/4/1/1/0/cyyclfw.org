It's unfair to specifically criticize it as "fridge logic rational" because I don't think Wildbow ever claimed that was his goal, but the worldbuilding is covered in holes, absolutely. It's been about a year at this point since I finished Worm, I read it through in a month so these criticisms are going to be what I can remember rather than having a list somewhere to reference.

I could bring up more criticisms if I read it again or looked through anything I've written on it in the past, so these listed above can be thought of as the issues that bothered me enough that I still remember them. For anyone interested in previous [[/r/rational]] discussions on the matter, there's this thread: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2r2jy8/worm_has_a_few_problems/]["Worm... Has A Few Problems"]] and a comment in that thread ends with I think the best description re: Worm as Rational Fiction:

"Worm isn't a rational work, it's a deconstruction of the superhero genre that operates with a set of laws and with a set of characters which are inherently irrational in order to create a superhero universe. Having said that it's a great fictional work and a lot of fun, with tons of clever thinking, acting, and rationality in it, it just doesn't fit the bar for "rationalist literature" and that's okay."
