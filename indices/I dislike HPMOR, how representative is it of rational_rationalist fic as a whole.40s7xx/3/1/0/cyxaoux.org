I thought this as well for a while, but the timing doesn't work out on it being him (it would have been started before he'd finished HPMoR, during his last sprint of writing it). Also, the character of the references are not his style, and there are a couple minor things treated approvingly that he viscerally hates in a way that is reflected in his writing. (IIRC, one of those was bees; EY cannot write about bees approvingly and would not feature Killa Bee as a larger character than necessary.)
