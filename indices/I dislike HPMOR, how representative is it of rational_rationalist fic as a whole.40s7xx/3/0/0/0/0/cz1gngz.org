I'm pretty sure a fiction where rational thought is explicitly rewarded is more a rationalist fiction than a rational one. At least, going by what I can gather from the sidebar. Rational fictions are where things in the story make rational sense, but doesn't necessarily mean the characters themselves always act perfectly rational. (and in the case of Worm, the literally can't [[#s][due]] )
