I would probably say the same thing for HPMOR. The whole premise of Scientist!Harry was basically lost after the first twenty-something chapters, and there was less and less science after that point. And by the end of the story the takeaway message was clearly that knowledge can be very destructive and dangerous and therefore we should not "open doors that should not be opened" curiosity killed the cat sort of stuff. Not a very rational message. While the author has gone on record saying that this was not what he intended to say and definitely not intended as a main takeaway message, the story reinforced it with the events of the ending as well as a lot of stuff building up to it. For instance, how Harry ended up [[#s][spoiler]].

To be honest, I don't think it takes a rational genius to understand the reasons for the statute of secrecy. Someone with sufficient training in relevant fields who had the training to learn about and understand other cultures and how and why they function the way they do could have understood why the statute of secrecy existed, and why getting rid of it without a viable alternative would be catastrophic, even if they didn't have any training in rationality.

And while the average person, put in Harry's shoes might not accomplish much, they also wouldn't do so badly that they nearly destroy the world either. When a "rational" protagonist is so irrational that even though they are super smart they still miss obvious things like Quirrel being evil (which Hermione got right away despite her not having rationality training like Harry had), when the "rational" supergenius protagonist's /stupidity/ nearly gets the world destroyed, when the story is preachy (the preachiness in the story discourages questioning it or figuring out what's going on, and the severe lack of science doesn't help), you have to wonder whether it really qualifies as a rational fic. I would say HPMOR has hints of rationality, but does't really qualify as a rational story. It has a lot of potential to become more rational with a decent amount of editing and rewriting, but from what I recall the author published it while it was basically a first draft. A lot of the views that HPMOR presents are views that a lot of rational/rationalist people have, but merely agreeing with rational/rationalist views isn't enough for the story itself to qualify as rational fiction.

That being said, it does technically meet all the criteria on the sidebar, somehow, despite all the issues described above.
