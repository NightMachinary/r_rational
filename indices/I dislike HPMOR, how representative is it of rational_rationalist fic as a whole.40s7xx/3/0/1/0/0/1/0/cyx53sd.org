I understand that that's a part of his personality and I think it's a perfectly reasonable character trait to have.

I just don't think the author did a good enough job of showing him overcome this issue.

Edit: Not that I didn't enjoy the story as a whole. This is just a minor issue that I think could be improved on, especially since part of the stated goal of the story is to help teach rationalist methods.
