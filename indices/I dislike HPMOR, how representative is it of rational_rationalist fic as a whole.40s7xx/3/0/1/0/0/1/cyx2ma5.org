A feature both of the young and of early bloomer geniuses.

I think a lot of what you're saying (and I've seen it before) is that you forget that even though he talks like a professor, and has a more... mature soul, he's still 12.

He doesn't have the life experience, and one of the major plot points in the story is how goddamn bad he is at being /wrong/ (unable to lose).
