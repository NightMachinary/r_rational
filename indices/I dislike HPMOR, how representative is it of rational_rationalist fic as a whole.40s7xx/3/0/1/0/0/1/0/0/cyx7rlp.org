Oh absolutely. To be honest, my favorite part of the story was the early stages and the War Arc, where Harry basically takes up the role of magical Ender Wiggin and hacks magical combat for all its worth.

The (actually quite funny) comedic angle combined with the intrigue and ingenuity was wonderful.
