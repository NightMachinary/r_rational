  HPMOR, despite appearances, is not a story about a rational hero. It is the origin story of a rational hero. It ends when that hero is finally starting to get his shit together.

That's a fair assessment, though I think it's easy to lose that point in the way that Harry often seems to think he has everything figured out. He's so sure of himself almost all the time, and the plot usually rewards his actions and beliefs. So it's often difficult to determine what the author's intentions are in showing us these often flawed points of views.

In many cases a later event will come and show that Harry actually wasn't right about something, and you'll realize the author intended that. But often times the immediate pay off of Harry's self-righteousness is more weighty than his reflections on being wrong.

And it seems even at the end that he never really evolves beyond wanting to tackle all the world's problems on his own. And he still seems to trust his own judgement beyond that of those with many years of experience over him even after seeing how flawed his own judgement has been in the past.

I think that is really my main problem with the story and it seems to be a theme with lots of rationalist fiction. It's the story of one flawed man trying to be rational all on his own, instead of realizing that big problems are often better solved through collaboration.

Note: there are some scenes in HPMOR that highlight that Harry's unwillingness to rely on others is a weakness, not a strength, but it seems as if he never puts the lesson into practice.
