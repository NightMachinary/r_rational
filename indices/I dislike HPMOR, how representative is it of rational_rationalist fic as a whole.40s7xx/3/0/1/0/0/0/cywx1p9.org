I think the payoff for most of the story's lessons comes in chapter 119 (the meeting with all the important adults) and in the first half of chapter 122 (the final chapter; Harry's quiet reflections on "the magnitude of his own folly"). Ch.119 is the one where Harry is finally learning to cooperate and delegate.

But I do fully agree with you that this is /very late indeed/. A lot of Harry's mistakes are called cleverness, or at least not explicitly called stupidity, for most of the story.
