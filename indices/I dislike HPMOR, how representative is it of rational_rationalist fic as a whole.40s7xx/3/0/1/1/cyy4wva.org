  To be honest, I don't think it takes a rational genius to understand the reasons for the statute of secrecy.

They explained it just fine in the original HP books: without the Statute, the Muggles would basically enslave wizard-kind to provide magical solutions to their problems. Secrecy, for wizards, is a matter of human rights.

  When a "rational" protagonist is so irrational that even though they are super smart they still miss obvious things like Quirrel being evil (which Hermione got right away despite her not having rationality training like Harry had), when the "rational" supergenius protagonist's stupidity nearly gets the world destroyed

Actually, I think this /was/ part of the intended message: "the simple, obvious, boring hypothesis is most often the correct one; so while Dark (Slytherin) Is Not Evil /sounds/ like an interesting trope subversion /in a story/, if you actually meet someone obviously Dark (Slytherin), they /are/, most probably, Evil (Dark Wizard), and you should stop rationalizing away evidence that they're not just because you fanboy over their awesomecoolness."

I mean, the guy /is/ prone to writing lengthy essays on how in the real-world, the truth is usually simple and we call things boring because they're actually highly probable.

The problem was that in stories, ie: fanfics, awesomecoolness overrides almost everything else, so the /readers/ were fanboying over Quirrell /more/ than the characters were, which made the message fall flat.

I remember [[/r/hpmor]] collectively palming its face and going, "Oh OF COURSE Quirrell was evil! He was Lord fucking Voldemort, after all! How did we /ever/ get fooled into thinking he was /merely/ a 'Light-side Slytherin'!?" And there was much joy among the Sunshine Regiment that day, for we had been right all along.
