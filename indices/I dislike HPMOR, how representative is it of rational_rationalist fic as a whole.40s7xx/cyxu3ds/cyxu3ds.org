HPMOR is intentionally designed memetic crack meant to get unsuspecting readers hooked to rationality. That character slowly fades out over the course of the story, but that's probably what you're picking up on.

Ballpark odds of between 9^{-1} to 13^{-1} on an unknown rational fic /written by a user of this sub/ reading at least partially like it. Rational fiction not advertised on this sub is /far/ less likely to share the flaws.
