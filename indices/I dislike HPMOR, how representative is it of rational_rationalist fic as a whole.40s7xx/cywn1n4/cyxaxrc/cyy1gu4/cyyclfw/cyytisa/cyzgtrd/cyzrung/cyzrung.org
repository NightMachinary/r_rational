  Assuming as well that time isn't a flat circle, if there's a metaphysical "factory" that produced the universe,

Hang on, though. I asked you "why does anything less than infinite universes imply a creator" and you responded with "assume there's a factory that creates universes...." That factory would be a creator, right? Aren't you making a circular argument here?

  then the two reasonable assumptions about it are either it worked once or it's still going. If it stopped at some arbitrary integer, which is any (including 1 IMOesn't require intelligence to be applied. it implies there was a choice or inbuilt possibility of stoppage, and those qualities and characteristics imply some type of god, even if god in this case is a computer scientist deciding there will be 224 universes in the simulation.

Just to make sure we're on the same page here: my definition of "a god" requires self-awareness as a necessary but not sufficient element. I'm not sure "something stopped working" requires that a self-aware being be involved -- as an example, fires burn out from lack of fuel regardless of human involvement.

  How belligerent does the US become knowing that for the time being, they have absolutely perfect air superiority?

I agree with your general thesis -- countries with more supers would likely become more aggressive. I would nitpick, however, that one cape with FISS powers does not provide perfect air superiority, simply because she can only be in one place at a time.
