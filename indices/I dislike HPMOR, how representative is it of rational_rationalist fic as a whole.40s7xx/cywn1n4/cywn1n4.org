HPMOR is a tract for "rationalism".

Different people have different ideas about what constitutes "rational" fiction. Some consider "rationalist" and "rational" to be part of the same spectrum, synonyms, or separate genres. Some require the characters to have rationality or rationalism as core goals, others just want the world to have "hard SF" levels of internal consistency. That last is where I find myself. I consider /Worm/ rational, for example, because the irrationality of the characters is driven by a rationally derived plot point that's a core part of the universe, and characters are realistic and as rational as they can be within the bounds of that constraint. Rationality, in /Worm/, is a useful tool that is likely to lead to a successful outcome.
