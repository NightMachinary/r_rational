I don't think flying would work, or making solid air. You could trip people by making the air around their legs cold enough that they get flash-frozen and fall over with frostbite, but I can't see any way that you could create steps.

With a large body of water you could create some incredible ice sculptures, though, or freeze a bridge across a river.
