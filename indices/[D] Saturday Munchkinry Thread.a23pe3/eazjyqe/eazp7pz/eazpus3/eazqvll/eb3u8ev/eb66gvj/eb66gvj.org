I suppose I'll have to concede the point to superior science - and it's cool that you did the research! I do admit that I mainly just typed the first ideas to come into my head, although if the limit of the power is 'can't fly by flash-freezing air' then that's still pretty damn strong. The other points alone would be fine for me personally, I think :)
