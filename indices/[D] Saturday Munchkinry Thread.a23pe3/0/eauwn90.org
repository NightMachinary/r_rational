*Mistborn Munchkinry Mini-Series Part 2: Steel*

/Spoiler note/: I will avoid things that I consider excessive spoilers, but the exact workings of the magic system are moderate spoilers themselves, so if you intend to read the books and are sensitive to spoilers you should probably skip this one.

Ok, week two of the mistborn munchkinry miniseries. For part one and a general overview of the magic system, see [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9zz4sa/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ead595h/][here]]. If you weren't here last week and aren't familiar with the mistborn setting I'd recommend reading the intro to that comment first.

Up this week is steel. Just like last week, I'm interested in what a steel twinborn compounder can do, both here on earth (where they are the only one with this powerset) and in Era 2 Scadrial.

*Allomancy*

Allomantic steel is a direct counterpart to allomantic iron, it allows an allomancer to push on pieces of metal. As soon as you start burning steel you will see thin, translucent, blue lines spring up between your chest and every source of metal in the surrounding area. You can then mentally push on one of these lines to push the piece of metal further away from you. Pushing always happens directly away from your center of mass.

Like ironpulling, steelpushing conserves momentum so pushing on something that is much lighter than you will fling it away form you while pushing on something much heavier than you results in you being flung away from it. A typical use for this is to drop a coin on the ground and push on it to launch yourself in the air. Doing this, allomancer can jump onto buildings and over city walls with ease. You cannot push on metal that is at least partially inside a person and you cannot push on aluminium or anything covered in aluminium.

The smallest thing we've seen people push on is a grain of powdered metal and the strongest steelpush we've seen was able to tear a building appart.

*Feruchemy*

Feruchemic steel allows you to store physical speed. While charging a steel metalmind (jargon note: a metalmind is piece of metal with a feruchemic charge) the feruchemists feels sluggish and "like they are moving through molasses". Then when tapping that metalmind they can move many times faster than normal. Steel is noted to be one of the hardest attributes to store, with normal feruchemists only able to store a few percent of their speed at a time (though this is less relevant to us, given that we can compound).

As with almost all instance of super speed across fiction, feruchemic steel is not terribly well defined. It allows a feruchemists speed to be [[https://wob.coppermind.net/events/361/#e11357][higher than it should be when considering their kinetic energy or the force they impart upon impact]], so my guess is you can't use it to punch things harder. The power protects you from the g-forces generated by your own motion, but not from wind resistance/friction (which incidently also puts a soft cap on how fast you can move). We know you can move down a flight of stairs at super speed so somehow gravity is pulling at you normally from your perspective.

Like with all feruchemy you only affect your own body, not your clothes and not anything you are carrying (your clothes obviously move with you when you move at super speed, but your phone won't, for example, gain extra processing speed from it). Your perception and reaction speed are accelerated as well when you are tapping speed, though not to the same extend as the rest of your body.

The author never commented on exactly how fast a steel feruchemist can become, but it's somewhere between several times and many times faster, not hundreds of times faster.

*In universe uses*

A few ways in which these powers are used by the characters in the story (mild spoilers, obviously):

- Have the safety of a gun be inside the handle, so only you or someone with the same powers as you can fire the gun.
- Attach small metal rings to the ends of (stone) arrow heads and push them towards an enemy allomancer. When they try to push them away, they only push on the rings and the arrowheads keep going.
- Put railway spikes into the road at regular intervals so you push on them to move around more quickly.
