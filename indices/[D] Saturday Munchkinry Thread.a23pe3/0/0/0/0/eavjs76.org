I suppose that depends on whether they can detect individual homogeneous pieces of metal, or if close by, loose bits will meld together. In the former case, it may be possible to detect which bits of metal are not so healthy for everyone involved by detecting location (so that you don't pull on any pace makers) and then lightly tugging the remaining bits to determine mass. Of course, the question is then if this is any more convenient than normal metal detectors, but I imagine that it would be a mite more accurate assuming the allomancer is doing his or her job.
