A niche use for steelpushing might be detecting flaws in large amounts of metal. Depending on where the blue line from your chest leads to, it might show them up much more quickly than modern techniques, thus allowing more granular searches to be done less often. I presume that the line goes to the centre of mass of the metal, so if you can feel that the line is a few centimetres to the left (or alternatively, standing far enough away from the metal to see it go off at an angle) of where it should be, then you know that metal needs checking.

Actually, detecting steel could be useful in other area. For airport or border security, any device which contains any amount of steel can be detected by the same method, so if done in conjunction with other allomancers with different metals, the process could be sped up a lot (although on earth this isn't feasible due to being the only one, and I imagine Scadriel doesn't have quite that level of luxury).

If the Feruchemy power protects from /all/ g-forces caused by your own motion, then you can become a very effective astronaut or jet fighter in niche scenarios, as if I recall correctly, that is one of the main barriers to faster manned flights.

I love this series that you've made, and I'm definitely looking forward to the other metals!
