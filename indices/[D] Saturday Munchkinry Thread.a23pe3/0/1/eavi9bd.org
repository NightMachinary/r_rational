Canonically, steelpushers are referred to as Coinshots by just about everyone, because every steelpusher can turn an arbitrary number of coins into bullets very easily. They generally don't have aim or distance sufficient to become snipers, though, the effective range is about that of a musket. Notably, coinshots in 2nd era Scadrial will still carry guns, both for longer-distance accuracy and because they can make their bullets even faster by pushing on them.

Compounding steel basically gives you unlimited speed. Beyond fast travel benefits, a 10x cognitive acceleration factor would make for an excellent battlefield commander. Having so much more time to think than the opposition would make you absurdly difficult to beat. Furthermore, bullet-time isn't quite doable, but you might be able to see and dodge a bullet coming at you at a relative speed of 80mph.

Assuming steelpushing is also accelerated by speed, you can effectively output 10x more force through that power. In combination with enhanced perceptions, you may actually be able to stop a bullet in its tracks using this method.

I can't really think of a world-breaking use for this combination. "Tearing apart buildings" actually requires another power from the magic system to increase your physical toughness, otherwise you will just crush yourself with your own steelpushes. You get to be a fast, highly-mobile ersatz modern infantryman in 2nd era Scadrial, and in the real world being fast is pretty great, but it doesn't let you shape the future. You can't even do prospecting for most metals, as the coinshot power only lets you see actual metals, rather than minerals which contain them, and though the maximum range is poorly defined, it isn't so enormous that you could find deep gold veins from the surface. Modern techniques are just better.

I guess you could be really good at panning for gold, and you might even be able to extract flecks straight from seawater. Money shouldn't be a problem, but it might just be more profitable to be a superpowered mercenary or assassin.
