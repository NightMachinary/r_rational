The best munchkinry comes from exploiting corner-cases, and steel feruchemy is so fuzzily defined that it's hard to find the corners.

What do the forces look like on carried objects? We know that running around at super speed doesn't crack the flooring beneath you, but a brick you're carrying still has to accelerate to keep up with you. If you let it go, does it fly off like a cannonball? Or does it slow down?

But as for the allomancy stuff, now that we've covered both iron and steel, I'd like to bring up a neat trick that is underused in the series.

If you have access to both iron and steel allomancy (let's say your iron misting grandpa donated part of his soul to you in the form of a hemalurgic spike)then you can push on one part of an object while pulling on another part and create a net force in any direction.

The only time we see this in the books is When Kelsier deflects arrows by making things spin in midair during his final battle.
