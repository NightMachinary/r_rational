Lurchers and Coinshots (Ironpullers can "lurch" around by pulling on metal for decent mobility, steelpushers use coins as bullets like, constantly, in the books) can both see and affect every metal except aluminum, so only a single allomancer would be needed as a metal detector. That said, many small pieces of metal all over you would make such detection methods impractical, as they'd just see a cloud of lines. That sounds like it should be suspicious on its own, but when you consider belt buckles, shoe grommits, buttons, tags, gold thread in fancy clothes, or even just steel shavings from a metal lathe, you could concievably hide this way.
