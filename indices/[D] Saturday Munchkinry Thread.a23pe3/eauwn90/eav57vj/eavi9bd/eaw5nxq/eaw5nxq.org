  a 10x cognitive acceleration factor would make for an excellent battlefield commander. Having so much more time to think than the opposition would make you absurdly difficult to beat.

This one probably doesn't work out. There's another metal - zinc - that explicitly stores mental speed. It's shown in the books that steel improves reflexes and lets you react more quickly. But [[https://old.reddit.com/r/brandonsanderson/comments/9r44v1/brandon_will_be_continuing_his_weekly_ama_here/e8eg8aa/][here]], Brando Sando says this is just a protective side effect akin to the strength boost from iron increasing density.

Unfortunately, the viewpoint characters have used barely any feruchemical steel or zinc, so it's not quite clear which mental functions are mapped to zinc and which are mapped to steel.
