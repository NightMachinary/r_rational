The example I remember reading was about poisonous berries.

If you are in the woods looking for food, and know that some berries are poisonous, but don't know which ones, that's a known unknown. You can avoid berries, or maybe eat only one berry and see if it makes you feel ill before eating more the next day, etc.

But if you don't even know that plants /can/ be poisonous, then the poisonous berries are an unknown unknown. There's nothing you can do to avoid the risk.
