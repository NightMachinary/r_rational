I'm not sure these would be called unknown unknowns, but the category your examples try to outline seems to include the reason for a [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Chesterton%27s_fence][Chesterton's fence]] and the reason that the market puts a different price from you on some instrument.

Also relevant are non-constructive proofs like the [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robertson%E2%80%93Seymour_theorem][Robertson-Seymour theorem]], using which there is an efficient algorithm that decides whether a graph can be drawn without crossing edges on, say, a torus, but we don't know the algorithm.
