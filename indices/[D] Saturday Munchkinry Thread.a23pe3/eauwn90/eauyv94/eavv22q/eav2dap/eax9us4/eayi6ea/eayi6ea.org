All memetic hazards would fall into this category. A hard hazard would be some sort of sequence of images or souns that hacks your brain and causes some sort of change such as unconsciousness or memory loss/edits. Nobody knows if such a thing exists in principle, and so we don't know what to look for.

A soft hazard would be any sort of thought or idea that causes preoccupation and stress and possible insanity just by knowing about it, Lovecraftian horrors are one example. Maybe there's some fundemental truth of the universe like we're all trapped in a simulation for a 3rd graders science report and everything we do is pointless, or maybe there are 3^^^3 sentient beings being tortured constantly somewhere and nobody can save them, or something other fact we've never thought of, the knowledge of which would only cause grief and despair and accomplish no positive purpose.

Or maybe there are no such things, and knowledge is always good. We don't know.
