Ooh initially I thought the idea was pretty good but on second thought... I need to do some calculations but I think you can't reasonably flash-freeze the air. You'll get a really low-density state that will rapidly equilibrate with nearby air, so I guess you would then want to continue cooling the area, which is constantly drawing in more air from nearby because it's a vacuum, while you form actual solid/liquid; due to the extremely fast cooling you'll presumably get an amorphous solid (if it's solid at all) with presumably lousy mechanical properties (instability, probably riddled with holes or something, ......)

I think I just ruined Frozone for myself and I don't even know if he shows up in /Incredibles 2/ D:
