Well...

- You can create absolute zero temperatures in laboratory conditions, which scientists will be head over heels for.

- You can have custom built locks for you that don't need a key, only requiring a certain, very cold temperature threshold.

- No limit on organics was mentioned, so you can have a pretty deadly hostage situation where killing them at the speed of thought is viable.

- You can specifically cool air in the shape of a bar your opponents run into to trip them. You can do the same with a number of shapes to create temporary structures for any use.

- This, in turn, lets you fly, as you can freeze air you stand on dumping the excess heat in a chosen pocket or spread out, depending on what's more convenient. Then, freeze more steps, and so on.

- Disable any vehicle, electrical device, or analogue machine pretty much instantly.

- Make fiery explosions by compressing as much heat in an area as you can into one spot.

- Detect biological presences by the shifting heat map you presumably have in your head.

- Avoid a number of chemical and energy based projectiles or weaponry by doing the same.

- Give sudden bursts of movement to yourself or anyone else by carrying around a massive bag which you can lightly yet rapidly heat to make it expand, thus pushing you.
