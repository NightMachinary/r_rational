I have a problem that's a little unusual for this thread.

It's not about munchkinning a power or situation, but I feel like this draws on similar skills. But if the mods think it doesn't fit, then I'll take down this comment.

The problem is simply put, come up with a real life example of unknown unknowns.

Here's two examples I've been able to come up with:

- There exists an argument for you, as the Gatekeeper, to let the AI out of the box within two hours of talking to the AI.
- There must exist a hobby that you enjoy more than your current most favorite life-long hobby to the point that you would give up your current hobby. For me it is reading, and I can't imagine anything better. But I used to really enjoy playing with legoes when very young. However, when I discovered books, I gave up legoes to the point where if I could, I would have sold them all for a measly book. I dimly suspect there exists something that could do the same thing for reading as reading did for legoes. Virtual reality or something like that?
