I was thinking that if you were to remove all the heat from an area, even a gaseous one, that it would flash freeze. Normally this would be untenable, but the whole speed of thought thing made me think it might be possible to do it quickly enough. After all, air is mostly nitrogen and oxygen -210 and -219 degrees centigrade respectively, which is a decent amount over absolute zero. Though my reasoning may be flawed in someway.

The cooling aspect seems to be the more reliable and useful aspect of the power, if only because it can be done no matter the environment, and instantly.
