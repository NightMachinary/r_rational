Please Don't Tell My Parents I'm a Supervillain.

Here, we also have the classic superhero society, however, it wasn't always that way. Following sudden boom of superpowered population, a particulary bad decade (70s, I believe) happened - you can imagine what would do to any society if superpowers suddenly become dozens times more common. After that, a number of particulary strong superheroes and powerful villains emerged, and decided that enough is enough, nobody wants war. So they formed an agreement of sorts, with terms similar to the "game" Tattletale describes in Worm, but a lot more formal.

Also unlike in Worm, the system actually works as intended. Mainly becauseall the most powerful supers are in support of it, and there are no S-class threats like Endbringers and S9, that tend to tear downs societies which become too successful.

I very much advise to read the books (4 of them for now). Despite somewhat goofy and sometimes anvillicious theme, they offer amazing perspective on how a healthy superpowered society should work, after all the prisoner dilemmas are solved.
