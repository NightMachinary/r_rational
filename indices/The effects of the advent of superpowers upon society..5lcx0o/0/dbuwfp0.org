I think the most interesting answer is /diversity/. Most likely there won't be a single solution or culture. There would be several ways societies could configure themselves to accommodate superpowers, without any clear "right answer" that would win out over the others.

In fact, a correction to your post: the world of Worm has exactly this diversity! The "heroes and villains" dynamic isn't actually enforced by Contessa - at least, not in the way you're thinking. Cauldron did help support that dynamic in North America by supporting Alexandria's babies, the Protectorate+PRT. But that wasn't the /only/ dynamic they let occur. In fact, Word of God is that parahuman culture settled into that mode in North America but is very different in different parts of the world. The "hot and cold" capes dynamic in India, folk-hero 'criminals' vs corrupt government organizations in Central America, warlord-driven conflicts in much of Africa, the top-down authoritarian rule in China (as you pointed out), [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/posts/14300958/][other types of factions in Russia]], etc.

All of them were viable to various degrees, though they all leaned on Cauldron support. Well, I can see where you're coming from, though. We notice Cauldron's role more in the North American dynamic because of sampling bias: that's where most of the story is set, so it's the culture that's fleshed out the most by far in canon!

In a non-Worm setting you could get even more diversity. Powers won't be targeted to people who are focal points for conflict, so it'd be easier to make complex organizations - they won't be under as much pressure of deterioration from random, unpredictable local conflicts. On the other hand, you could also have more uniformity. With less local and global conflict, the world might be ruled by a single central world power that got first mover advantage and grabbed the best powers. A centralized power would also get a bonus if powers aren't distributed to random/unpredictable individuals. For instance, if powers require expensive resources to awaken and use, a central authority could accumulate the resources quickly or even monopolize them.
