The narrative of superheroes and supervillians has significant pull as a model to follow. The /English name/ for a person who can fly, bounce bullets, has superstrength, etc etc is "superhero". (Or "supervillain", if they embrace self-centred behaviour.) Like "satellite", and many other invented concepts, the name for the thing existed before the thing itself existed.

Similarly, if the dead were to rise from their graves and develop an appetite for brains, we'd be calling them "zombies", whatever the actual explanation for the phenomenon turned out to be.

People would warp their behaviour to conform to the model. I suspect that, just as we have far more law-abiding citizens than criminals, we would also have far more superheroes than supervillains. (Worm's in-universe explanation for this is that you only get superpowers under /extreme/ duress, ie capes are all PTSD sufferers, /and/ the power itself drives the host towards conflict-seeking that the host believes is his/her own idea.)
