Super Powereds by Drew Hayes has an interesting premise. There are normal humans, powereds (who have no or little control) and supers (full control). Powereds are pitied and looked down on, as well as rightly feared, treated as blend of severe disability and racism. Supers are very high status and mostly act like aristocrats and are mostly envied and hated. Power levels are massively variable and all powers are unique, although many are similar.

Through a bit of a fuzzy history there is a societal structure in place, a new class called "heroes", a tiny subset of supers who are loyalty tested, psychologically tested by psychics and highly trained. The PR is that they are trained to be the classic superhero trope of selfless and helpful, with a secret identity, the reality is that it is run by a large bureaucracy to use them and keep them and other non-humans under control while keeping the normals from rioting from fear/anger.

Heroes mostly put down supers and powereds who cause a disturbance, mostly non-lethally if possible but a lot of class time spent on the utilitarian calculus around when to just kill them quickly for the greater good.

If you don't toe the line or are simply too powerful then you are declared a "villain", and are captured or killed by whichever highly competent hero team is most suited. And the system trained you from early adulthood or childhood and know all your weaknesses and already has multiple redundant plans. This training intentionally included a large number of exercises where students were encouraged to betray each other and they fought to the near death constantly (there is a class of supers known as healers to patch you up after you methodically break your friends arms and legs until they tap out in order to win the match so you can go for beers after). This is revealed to be carefully thought out, so there is less resistance when they have to kill a friend who doesn't follow orders.

it's a really interesting series, although it's definitely in the pulp / summer reading category, a decent job of justifying a lot of superhero tropes with some of the necessary very dark behind the scenes manipulations. A lot of fun is had with unique powers and the unique combinations for teams, the entire "why don't the bad guys ever kidnap a hero's family" is answered with a black bag team of a locator, a teleporter, superintelligent strategist/lie-detector/torturer and a time stopper, as far as the public knows it never happens although sometimes people who talk about it just disappear forever.

I guess I do recommend it if you like some light reading, the main series is about a team of outcasts going through the university, this team is the focus and the world/laws/structure is dribbled out /very/ slowly. I will warn you that they are all gratingly idiotic for plot reasons nearly all the damn time. This is /not/ rational fiction. However the world is quite decent and the rational and clever applications of powers is excellent.
