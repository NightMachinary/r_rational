I don't really feel like going too in-depth here ATM but some examples that come to mind of movies that sort of examine this are the incredibles and hancock.

Suicide squad kind of tries to approach this a bit and then gets distracted by explosions.

A Certain Scientific Railgun also sort of kind of winks in that direction but is more about the supers themselves. Same for Naruto.

Also, there's [[http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=2305][this comic]].

Life is strange is an examination of the effect of a girl's time travel on the people around her but eventually it goes "rocks fall, everyone dies" for no reason that I could discern.

Edit: The gods are bastards also winks in this direction. There is an arc where a paladin rampages through a town in search of a demon that isn't actually there and the local citizenry gets pissed, for example.
