  Even Worm's approach to this topic seems dissatisfying to me - a single person (Contessa) is used to shape the entire world's setting into something approaching 'classic' superhero stories rather than allowing actual change to come about.

There were a few other factors, but they were even less satisfying for me:

- People had powers because they had alien worms in their heads
- The worms only chose psychologically damaged people
- The worms essentially mind-controlled them and forced them to fight instead of doing anything productive with their abilities
- The Endbringers regularly destroyed centers of population and industry
- The Simurgh explicitly targeted anyone who tried to do anything useful with powers

The Endbringer thing would have been a relatively elegant way to solve the issue, except then you need to answer "where did the Endbringers come from?" If I understood correctly, Eidolon unconsciously created them because he wanted to have something that only he could fight that would let him look cool.

Of course, there's still no reason why people were wearing costumes instead of tac gear.

So, yes, Worm is a giant pile of authorial fiat in which everyone literally has a Conflict Ball shoved into their head. It's aggravating.
