The first, "Boxoctosis," seems to already be out...

Edit to add: Okay, I'm thinking this is some kind of satire. I can't find any other relevant reference to MWx, or any at all to "Headless Froggy Press," or the "Frozen Seas" or "Take Over" collections (not even the review this guy did for one of them that he quotes from).
