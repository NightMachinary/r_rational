The thread which is clearly about someone's personal enjoyment based on their criteria filled with positive comments?

People asking how a work evolves in respect to things they like/dislike on a forum made for this shouldn't get you mad.

It wasn't even a bad review, but a question, and allowing people to only speak when they like something just makes comments/reviews near worthless.
