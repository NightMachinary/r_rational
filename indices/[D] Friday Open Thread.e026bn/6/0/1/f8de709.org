"Does Worth the Candle get any better?" also implicitly establishes the assumption that WtC is not good. It is not an "in my opinion" statement or a neutral statement but is, in my opinion, phrased exactly like an asshole said it. It is rude to the author and to everybody else who might want to engage in the conversation.
