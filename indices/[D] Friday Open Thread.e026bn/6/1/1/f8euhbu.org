  no amount of “deconstructing harems” makes it not a harem

[[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/4FcxgdvdQP45D6Skg/disguised-queries][But is it a blegg or a rube?]]

It's a harem, in the sense that it has a character of one gender in a group with other characters of (more or less) the other gender and romance is not non-existent.

It's not a harem, in the sense that the stereotypical scenes and tones that you would expect from a story tagged "harem" are largely absent or turned on their heads.

Toss it in one bin if you care about colour, or the other if you care about vanadium content.
