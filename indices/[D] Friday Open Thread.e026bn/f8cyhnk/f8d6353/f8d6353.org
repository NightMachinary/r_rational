Matter is made of particles. Nonperfect collisions degenerate orderly movement of large objects into chaotic movement of the particles (aka heat), but this cannot degenerate further. Some materials such as metals are made of particle clumps held together by forces too strong for chemistry to overcome. Enough heat will overcome any forces keeping matter in its form and allow recombination. Find some way to keep such extreme heat from dispersing to the surroundings and you can control this process.
