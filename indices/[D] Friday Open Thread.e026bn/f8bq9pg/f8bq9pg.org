[[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRWvNQVqAeWK_LFdLCOF5zT351eUyYozM][Taskmaster is uploading their episodes to Youtube]], which means that if you're American you now have a free, legal, and convenient way to watch it. Panel members (almost always comedians) are given absurd tasks, which are then shown in edited form and discussed on the stage. It's probably one of my favorite shows on television right now, and /definitely/ my favorite unscripted show. (So far it's series 1 and the start of Series 2, but they are apparently uploading more at a set rate.)
