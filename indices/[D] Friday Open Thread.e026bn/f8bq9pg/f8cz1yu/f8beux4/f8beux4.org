General rationality: what should I do to last the longest against the [[https://www.nickbostrom.com/fable/dragon.html][dragon-tyrant]] on the US battlefield?

​

One priority I think should be a profession that is likely to stick around and that I'm at least mildly interested in. I'm an electrical engineer so I think I'm good with this.

​

Another priority may be learning the legal and medical systems - but how much should I learn? I don't think I need other degrees in both of these professions since I think the degrees get into the minutea of things I am unlikely to encounter because I think degrees are meant to teach people enough to help as many other people as possible, which seems like overkill for my battle. So what are the resources or targets I should aim for that would maximize my survivability?

​

Other priorities are diet and exercise but those seem more of a daily routine thing than something I can plan long-term. Does anybody have any suggestions for other things I should be doing?
