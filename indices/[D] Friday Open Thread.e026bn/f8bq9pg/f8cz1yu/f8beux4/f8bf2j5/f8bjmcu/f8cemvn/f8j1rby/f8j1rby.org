Here's the tip of estimating project time frame: If you expect your project would get done in one month, accept it as a fact it won't get done in two, so just write four before you propose it to your superior. Read: if author said new installment will come out next month, prepare to wait for another two or three months. Authors rarely experienced project manager.
