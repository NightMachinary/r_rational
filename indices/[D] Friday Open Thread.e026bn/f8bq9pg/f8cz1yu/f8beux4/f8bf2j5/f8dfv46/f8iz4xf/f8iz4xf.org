I would love to read solid manga on such topic (VRMMO/Isekai). Japanese manga, so far, were shit on that genre. Some premise are interesting, but as story develop, they fail to add something new. At this point, I accept any form of bullshitting. Because what they add are always generic stuff, picked from past work of other mangaka/writer or the game Dragon Quest. They don't impose world-building rule that characters must abide. They lack impact.

If you're interested, the only isekai manga I still read is Ride on King. I forgot the exact title, but it's about President Putin got transported over "there." I impressed with their subject on health potion. It only appear in one chapter, but the potency of such potion as well as strict dose you can imbibe at a time give rise to potion junkie. As in people buying potion just to get the buzz. It was hilarious.
