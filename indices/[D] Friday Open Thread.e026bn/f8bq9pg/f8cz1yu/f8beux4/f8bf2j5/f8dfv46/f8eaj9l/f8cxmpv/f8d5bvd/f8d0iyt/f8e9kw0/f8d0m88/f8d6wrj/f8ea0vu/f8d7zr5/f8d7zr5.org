You see this pattern a lot, but, like, super especially on a forum/sub like this where fiction gets few comments/upvotes and meta drama gets 10x engagement.

It goes:

1. Somebody (party A) starts pattern matching everything to nazis
2. Someone else (party B) in a position of authority pulls them up short
3. Party B is accused of somthing (issue C) unconnected to the original dispute, by another party.

In this case Party A was the bot link poster, party B was AW, 'your work is a harem!' is issue C.

Like, you are maybe overcomplicating, when you say it 'leads nowhere and serves no purpose other than to be inflammatory'. The purpose is to be inflammatory. It doesn't need to go anywhere else.

I think its good practice to ignore attacks on authors for a few weeks after they correct someone on culture war stuff. Odds are really good it is just blowback.
