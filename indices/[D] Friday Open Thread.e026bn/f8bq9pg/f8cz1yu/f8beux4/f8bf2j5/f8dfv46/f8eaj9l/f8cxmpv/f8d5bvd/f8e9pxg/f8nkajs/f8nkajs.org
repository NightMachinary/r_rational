This is /absolutely not/ the place to make top level posts about works you don't like. Following Sturgeon's Law, 90% of everything is garbage, and in the internet era, that ratio is much higher in the direction of garbage. If this sub just opened the floodgates for people to complain about things they didn't like, then that would completely drown out people recommending or commenting on stuff that they /did/ like, because there are so many more things that people don't like (or are indifferent to) than things that they do. In terms of top level posts, if you're thinking "people need to hear about how much I disliked this thing I read", just don't.

/As a reply to someone making a recommendation/, or in one of the weekly threads, it has a place, but should be done with some level of tact and charity.
