  Following Sturgeon's Law, 90% of everything is garbage, and in the internet era, that ratio is much higher in the direction of garbage. If this sub just opened the floodgates for people to complain about things...

You are talking as if people are coming out of nowhere to thrash works that have never been discussed and spamming the sub. This has never happened (or you've modded it away well). The *actual* issue(s) we are talking about are closer to people discussing what they disliked in works that people here are familiar with and recommending. 'Opening the floodgates' is not what's happening and you framing it that way is somewhat disingenuous. Would people be upvoting all those supposed negative posts to visibility, at all if they are so low effort?

Commenting or analyzing a work that's dropping in quality, or asking for recommendations and giving examples of what you dislike are forbidden? What if an author suddenly becomes very religious and turns a work in a weird direction - you can't make a comment on it? Or if I am analyzing tropes or directions in rational fiction - I should only list the ones I like, and not mention any I might be less keen on? What if a new chapter of a beloved work has many continuity errors for the first time, and in my confusion, I want to discuss it with others who read it - I can't?

We have voting here, if people hate it others are unlikely to see it. If the post is literallly 'X is shit', yes mod it away. But that's not what we are talking about and this blanket policy you are describing is at best only good for some of the authors that frequent the sub and bad for readers and everyone else. If your argument is 'yes but those authors are more important' that might have some merit but please say that so we can discuss it directly.

And, I get that the post was about you, and maybe you are still offended in some way. That sucks, but 1. The discussion was valuable for many. 2. The discussion was filled with positive comments and explanations why people like the things the op disliked, or how they misunderstood.

I don't have anything against you as a mod, I also love your work, and I see how negative comments can be stressful - but your comment here makes me think that maybe the community has just been unfair to you to have you as mod. You are one of the more prolific authors here, if negative statements about your work hurt you but you have to read everything - then that's not a great situation for you, I admit. Maybe instead we should add a warning for authors to read comments only at their own discretion?
