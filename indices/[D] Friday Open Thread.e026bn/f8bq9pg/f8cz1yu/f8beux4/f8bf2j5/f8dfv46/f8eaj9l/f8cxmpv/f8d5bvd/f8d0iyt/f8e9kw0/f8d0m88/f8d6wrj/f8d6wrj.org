  I feel like the discussion and criticism in that thread leads nowhere and serves no purpose other than to be inflammatory for the sake of it.

The deconstructing vs. subverting vs. playing strait genre discussion was interesting to me, and I'd say people made some good points on either side. It's nice to see civil and intelligent disagreements play out well.

I also found the discussion of the character dynamics in the fic interesting. That part of the thread was very helpful to me when determining whether I'd fit into the story's target audience.
