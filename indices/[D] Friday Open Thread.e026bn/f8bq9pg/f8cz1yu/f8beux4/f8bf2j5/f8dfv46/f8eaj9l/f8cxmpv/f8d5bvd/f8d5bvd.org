I agree, and I also can't help but find this particular bit of a criticism a bit in bad faith. Titling the thread "Does Worth the Candle get any better?" as if they're seriously trying to consider whether to carry on after not enjoying it for /70 chapters/? If someone gets that far in and doesn't like something, they should just give it up. Framing the post that way just seems like, I don't know, some thinly veiled excuse to dump all their complaints (while also covering their ass in case their complaints are invalidated by later chapters they haven't read).
