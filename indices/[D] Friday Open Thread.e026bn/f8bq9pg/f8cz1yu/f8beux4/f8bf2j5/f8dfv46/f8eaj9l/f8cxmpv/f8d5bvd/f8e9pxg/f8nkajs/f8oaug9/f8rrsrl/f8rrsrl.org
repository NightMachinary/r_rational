  Would people be upvoting all those supposed negative posts to visibility, at all if they are so low effort?

Historically, people will upvote utter dogshit posts if the discussion below them is good. This doesn't mean that utter dogshit posts are in and of themselves good, just that sometimes good discussion can come from them. In the past, this wasn't criticism of any kind, rather, someone posting 'rational X?' with no thought or elaboration, and someone else taking a dozen paragraphs to flesh out the idea, give it some potential narrative structure, and add interesting ideas. I know this, because I was one of those people who would put in the actual effort on low effort posts.

(We did away with those posts for the most part, both by creating the Writing/Worldbuilding threads, which those posts get directed to, and by modding them away. (It's my belief that aside from power users, most people just pick up the culture by seeing what other people have been posting and then doing that, which means that if you have a lot of visible low quality posts, people will be encouraged by example.))

I think the discussion /was/ valuable for many, but the initial post, taken by itself, /probably/ wasn't, especially because "should I keep reading" posts are generally very low value for anyone but the person asking, and a lot of the stuff in that post was low-effort (and factually incorrect in places). Good discussion beneath a poor main post doesn't magically make that main post worthwhile. The post is currently at 61% upvoted, which is really low, but there might be any number of reasons for that, and I won't take that as being (necessarily) indicative of its quality.

  Commenting or analyzing a work that's dropping in quality, or asking for recommendations and giving examples of what you dislike are forbidden? What if an author suddenly becomes very religious and turns a work in a weird direction - you can't make a comment on it? Or if I am analyzing tropes or directions in rational fiction - I should only list the ones I like, and not mention any I might be less keen on? What if a new chapter of a beloved work has many continuity errors for the first time, and in my confusion, I want to discuss it with others who read it - I can't?

If you want to talk about edge cases, then we could talk about edge cases, but what I said above was that this isn't the place to make top level posts about works you don't like. To rephrase, it's not the place to vent about stuff that bothers you in whatever work you read, it's a place that /primarily/ exists to recommend and discuss the best works of rational and rational-adjacent fiction. That's my view of what this subreddit is best at, and I'll mod with that in mind. I think that it could very easily become a place where people just endlessly bitch about flaws in works, but that strikes me as being really low value, and something that you could do in a dozen other places on the web. I think there's some value in de-recommending works, but the place for that is pretty small, and in my ideal scheme, that place would be almost exclusively as comments on posts rather than as posts themselves. If you can't find a place to make that comment because no one is talking about the work, then your comment probably doesn't direly needed to be posted (and we have both the recommendation threads and the open threads, if it really must be said to someone). Yes, this gives the subreddit a positivity bias, but it's not a big one. And you're perfectly well allowed to say what you didn't like, so long as that's not the /point/ of your post. (FWIW, I think the post in question should definitely have gone into the recommendation thread.)

  But that's not what we are talking about and this blanket policy you are describing is at best only good for some of the authors that frequent the sub and bad for readers and everyone else. If your argument is 'yes but those authors are more important' that might have some merit but please say that so we can discuss it directly.

I mostly don't think about the authors that much, except for the noobies that are posting their first work (who should be gently nurtured in most cases, rather than shat on for their inevitable missteps, and who are much more responsive to feedback of any kind than, for example, me). I much more think about the community and what repels or attracts different people from or to it, so far as I can actually tell such things. It's my belief that we can have a better community by trying our best to focus on the positives rather than the negatives, and when dealing with negatives, to be careful about phrasing and tone, /especially/ if you're talking about a work that's popular around here. I think that's a form of conduct that creates the least strife, makes for the most cohesive community, and universalizes well. Partly this is because the subreddit serves many roles, one of which is for fans of certain works to discuss them; having someone come in and shit in the punch bowl is to be avoided as much as possible, because it infringes on the sub's ability to serve as that (via mild flame wars, soaking up time on arguments of taste, bad feelings, and evaporative cooling).

For me, the comments made by the parent poster in that thread weren't the worst I'd ever read, just annoying in how they cast the work, the general lack of citations, the things it got wrong, the lack of charity, etc. I pretty regularly have people leave reviews or comments telling me that I'm a failure as a storyteller, that the world is worse for the work that I've put into it, and a few times, that I should kill myself. I gets me down, and I junk quite a few messages without reading because it feels like a coin flip between, 'this work meant a lot to me and captured my feelings in a way that helped me know myself better' and 'you stole forty hours of my life you fuck'. There are a lot of people who feel like if they read a million words that you wrote, they know you, for better or worse, and especially when the work is on the more personal side, those people will feel that they need to say something directly to you. If you're going to read comments, that's the price of doing business (also the price of reading private messages on your personal reddit account sometimes).

I've spent too much time on this, and it's a conversation that seems like it's been going on for a week anyway, so I'm going to stop here and disable replies from going to my inbox. If you have specific feedback on specific moderator action, use modmail, but nothing I've said here has been said with mod voice, and I haven't done any actual moderation, though I can understand your concerns. I also think at least part of the disagreement, if you can call it that, is whether or to what extent communities with upvote and downvote systems will regulate themselves, which sadly doesn't fit within the margins of this comment.
