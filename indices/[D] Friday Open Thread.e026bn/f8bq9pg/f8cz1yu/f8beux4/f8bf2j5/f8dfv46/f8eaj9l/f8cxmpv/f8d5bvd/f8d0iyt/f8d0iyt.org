A few points:

1. I think the word “unfinished” matters a lot less for webfiction like Worth the Candle or Worm. If you could read five or six finished books in the time it takes to catch up with WtC, you should be allowed to judge the story on the merits of whatever it's done in that word count. WtC has accomplished quite a lot with its words, but it's still a formidable amount of reading if you weren't keeping up from the start, and you try to start now it's rational to compare to works which are in fact finished.

2. Ignoring stupid criticism is a life skill every single human should learn, and it is a thousand times more important for artists of all kinds.

3. Comments critical of anything in WtC are regularly downvoted to oblivion. Downvotes are supposed to protect from spam or trolls, and should not be crude “I disagree” and definitely not “hide the stains from the poor helpless author”. I'm not surprised it suddenly came out all at once.

4. Not all of the “criticisms” are invalid, even if most are kinda dumb. Fans of any fiction often excuse present problems or shortcomings by thinking of future potential, but this does nothing for non-fans or semi-fans. I'm current on WtC, I've stayed for each chapter, but much like HPMOR it's a story punctuated by very high peaks between very, very long plateaus.

5. It's a harem. It's obviously a harem. It is hilariously obviously a harem, and no amount of “deconstructing harems” (which doesn't even start for hundreds of thousands of words) makes it not a harem. All the arguments against it being a harem were just “harems are bad but WtC is good, therefore WtC is not a harem”, which were just creating a new category of harem^{+} which doesn't contain WtC.
