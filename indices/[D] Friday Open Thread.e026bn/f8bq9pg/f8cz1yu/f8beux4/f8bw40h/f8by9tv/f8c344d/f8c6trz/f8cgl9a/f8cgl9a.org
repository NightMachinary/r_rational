  It found that people who reduced their saturated fat intake were just as likely to die (or have heart attacks...

This is not what they found. They stated "...but effects on all-cause mortality (RR 0.97; 95% CI 0.90 to 1.05; 12 trials, 55,858 participants) ... were less clear (both GRADE moderate quality of evidence)." (Pages 1-2), as well as, "There was some evidence that reducing saturated fats reduced the risk of myocardial infarction (fatal and non-fatal, RR 0.90; 95% CI 0.80 to 1.01; 11 trials, 53,167 participants)"

They did find reduced incidence of fatal heart attacks, and potentially reduced incidence of all-cause mortality. As the authors state on page 2 regarding their findings, this is "suggestive of a small but potentially important reduction in cardiovascular risk on reduction of saturated fat intake."

  ...or strokes...
#+end_quote

Agreed, no evidence of difference there.

#+begin_quote
  That could very well be less to do with the reduction in saturated fats per se than with that reduction making room for an increase in unsaturated fats.
#+end_quote

Sure, that's a definite possibility. Of course, if the recommendation to consume less saturated fat is reducing fatal heart attacks through that mechanism, that would still mean that it's a good idea to tell people to eat less saturated fat.

#+begin_quote
  Exactly. So maybe it's not the best idea to make blanket statements like "try to eliminate saturated fats from your diet" when most recent evidence points towards trans fats and sugar being the worst things you can consume.
#+end_quote

First, this does not follow. Reducing intake of saturated fats and reducing intake of sugar are not mutually exclusive, it's entirely possible to recommend avoiding both. In fact, I did also mention limiting intake of sugar in my post, so I'm not sure why you're even addressing this to me.

Second, the authors specifically state "Lifestyle advice to all those at risk of cardiovascular disease and to lower risk population groups should continue to include permanent reduction of dietary saturated fat and partial replacement by unsaturated fats. The ideal type of unsaturated fat is unclear." I didn't get into details with unsaturated fats since the post was long enough already, but minimizing intake of saturated fats as I discussed is to be recommended according to this systematic review of the available evidence.

Third, I would like to see the systematic review which "points towards trans fats and sugar being the worst things you can consume." I don't need to a see a review on trans fats, I think everyone is on fully board with getting rid of them, but if you've got strong evidence in a systematic review regarding the impact of sugar, I would be thrilled to see it. (Not saying I think otherwise; I agree that sugar is likely harmful, but I would like to read that study if you've got it.)

  It could easily turn out that cardiovascular exercise has the greatest effect on cardiovascular health.
#+end_quote

I recommended that too.

#+begin_quote
  That meta analysis specifically excluded studies with a multifactorial intervention, meaning exercise wasn't considered at all. "Having high cholesterol" isn't inherently bad, you have "high cholesterol" when your veins/arteries/whatever harden and start to crack because your body is using cholesterol to try to patch up the cracks in your veins. Maybe it's going to turn out that it's far less important to reduce saturated fats / lower your cholesterol than it is to prevent your arteries from hardening in the first place.
#+end_quote

Maybe, yeah, but let's get some decent evidence first and then make the recommendations.
