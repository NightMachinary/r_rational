That is indeed probably the best study on the subject at the moment. It found that people who reduced their saturated fat intake were just as likely to die (or have heart attacks or strokes) as people who ate more saturated fat, but that replacing /some/ saturated fats with unsaturated fats /might/ reduce the risk of cardiovascular /events/ (but /not/ death, heart attacks, or strokes). That could very well be less to do with the reduction in saturated fats per se than with that reduction making room for an increase in unsaturated fats.

  Overall, dietary recommendations are tricky because it's impossible to run double-blinded randomized-controlled trials comparing different diets, and even high-quality cohort studies are challenging when it comes to diets. As such, the evidence for many diet recommendations is somewhat weak, and there tends to be many conflicting results.

Exactly. So maybe it's not the best idea to make blanket statements like "try to eliminate saturated fats from your diet" when most recent evidence points towards trans fats and sugar being the worst things you can consume. It could easily turn out that cardiovascular exercise has the greatest effect on cardiovascular health. That meta analysis specifically excluded studies with a multifactorial intervention, meaning exercise wasn't considered at all. "Having high cholesterol" isn't inherently bad, you have "high cholesterol" when your veins/arteries/whatever harden and start to crack because your body is using cholesterol to try to patch up the cracks in your veins. Maybe it's going to turn out that it's far less important to reduce saturated fats / lower your cholesterol than it is to prevent your arteries from hardening in the first place.
