  One priority I think should be a profession that is likely to stick around and that I'm at least mildly interested in. I'm an electrical engineer so I think I'm good with this.

Yep, and low risk of death as an occupational hazard. However, it won't give you much exercise, so you'd need to make sure you're engaging in regular moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. The 'minimum' amount as a basic standard of self-care is 15 minutes per day, while the optimal range is 45-75 minutes per day. This appears to be something that can be done intensively during the weekend or spread out as an actual daily average, but there may be less risk of musculoskeletal injuries if it's done every day.[[https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/78910513.pdf][1]] Stationary bikes or elliptical machines are very gentle on your joints, so they'd be a good choice to help reduce risk of osteoarthritis.

  Another priority may be learning the legal and medical systems - but how much should I learn? I don't think I need other degrees in both of these professions since I think the degrees get into the minutea of things I am unlikely to encounter because I think degrees are meant to teach people enough to help as many other people as possible, which seems like overkill for my battle. So what are the resources or targets I should aim for that would maximize my survivability?

Having a firm understanding of human anatomy, physiology, health and medicine are probably a good thing if you're trying to stay alive as long as possible. Of course, a lot of what you might see in a medical degree will not be applicable to you. For example, you almost certainly will never need to know about congenital illnesses, like ventricular septal defects. On the other hand, while you might not need to know about uncommon diseases like mesothelioma, understanding the risk factors for them could help you to avoid them. Meanwhile, diet, nutrition, exercise, hygiene, and dental care are all basic self-care activities where any persistent failures will lead to some of the most common diseases with the highest national death tolls. You should have an extremely firm understanding of these and should be extremely diligent to handle them appropriately.

The basic summary is to regularly exercise, minimize or eliminate saturated fat in your diet (butter and the animal-based fats found in meat and dairy), make sure you're getting plenty of fiber (which helps to lower your cholesterol, and you should be getting your cholesterol checked annually), and diet as needed to maintain an appropriate body weight. You should know the appropriate [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index#/media/File:BMI_chart.svg][weight range for your height]] and stay within it. There are no PID controllers for dietary intake, but essentially you can either adjust your daily caloric limit up or down based on your weight, or you can engage in intermittent fasting as needed, whichever works best for you. Make sure to get a good full-body workout when dieting because otherwise you will lose some muscle mass along with fat.

  Other priorities are diet and exercise but those seem more of a daily routine thing than something I can plan long-term. Does anybody have any suggestions for other things I should be doing?

- Make sure you're getting an annual physical exam and discussing any health concerns with your doctor.

- Minimize unnecessary driving, so try to live quite close to your workplace or anywhere else that you regularly need to travel.

- Mentally discard the food pyramid. Fruits and vegetables are great, try to make them the bulk of your diet. Grains, breads, and starches appear are okay, but don't make them the bulk of your diet. Meat and dairy are okay in small portions, but definitely try to minimize the fat (e.g. low fat milk, and cooking off or cutting out fats on servings of meat). Avoid sugary beverages and try to keep sugar intake to less than about 5% of your total caloric intake.

- Keep periodically looking up the latest guidelines on diet, exercise, and dental hygiene recommendations because research is ongoing and best practices are practically guaranteed to evolve throughout your lifespan.

- Avoid meats preserved with nitrites like jerky and hot dogs (check the packaging). These increase your risk of colon cancer. Similarly, avoid burned meats.

- Don't smoke or quit smoking and avoid secondhand smoke.

- Wear sunscreen if you're going to spend any significant amount of time in the sun.

- Always wash your hands before touching your food or placing your hands into mucous membranes like those around your mouth, eyes, and nose. If you get a cold, you probably fucked up on your hand hygiene and accidentally put a small amount of someone else's mucus in your mouth. Don't assume things are clean. Pay close attention because poor hand hygiene can potentially get you other diseases like norovirus or a potentially fatal strain of flu. Infections can also lead to secondary diseases, like type 1 diabetes which, in the uncommon case of adult-onset, appears to develop from an autoimmune response following an infection.

- Make sure your smoke and carbon monoxide detectors are currently working and put their expiration dates on your calendar.

- Don't leave your stovetop unattended when cooking.

- Do not throw accelerants on a fire, and minimize usage of accelerants if you need to start a fire.

Some of these may seem more like they prevent discomfort or disease rather than death, but keep in mind the cascading effects of health problems. Small problems can easily escalate if they aren't prevented or properly addressed. Type 1 diabetes won't kill you outright, for example, but it will almost certainly shorten your lifespan significantly because your odds of being able to keep up with the treatment regimen flawlessly for your entire life are slim-to-none. Getting osteoarthritis from being rough with your joints may not kill you, but it will make it less likely that you can continue to tolerate doing the daily moderate-to-vigorous physical activity that you need to minimize risk of cardiovascular disease, which would also shorten your lifespan. There's tons of other points to consider, but this is a good list to start with.
