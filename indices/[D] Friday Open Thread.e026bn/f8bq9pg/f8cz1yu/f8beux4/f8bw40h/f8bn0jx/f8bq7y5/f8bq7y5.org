  So what are the resources or targets I should aim for that would maximize my survivability?

  Other priorities are diet and exercise but those seem more of a daily routine thing than something I can plan long-term.

Those are not "other" priorities, those are /top/ priorities.

If you smoke, cease and desist. Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death.

Decrease your consumption of red meat, because colon cancer / colorectal cancer is the second most common cause of cancer death.

If ye be female, breast cancer is in the top five causes of cancer death, so get that shit checked out.

[[https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cancer][Around one third of deaths from cancer are due to the 5 leading behavioral and dietary risks: high body mass index, low fruit and vegetable intake, lack of physical activity, tobacco use, and alcohol use.]]

So [[https://scoobysworkshop.com/accurate-calorie-calculator/][figure out how many calories you should be eating per day]] and [[https://www.myfitnesspal.com/][start tracking that shit]], try to add some frozen broccoli or frozen mixed vegetables into your diet at least twice a week and a banana (or maybe like an apple or something, though I see no reason why anyone would ever choose to consume any fruit that was not a banana) maybe like three times a week, walk at a moderate pace for thirty minutes two or three times a week, lift weights three times a week, and avoid tobacco and alcohol.

You could start taking [[https://examine.com/topics/colorectal-cancer-risk/][a daily vitamin D supplement and a daily panax ginseng supplement]].

Heart disease is the leading cause of death (in the US). Preventative measures are diet and exercise.

Cancer is the second. Diet and exercise are important preventative measures, as well as not exposing yourself to carcinogens.

Accidents are next. Accidents are hard to avoid. Wear a seat belt. Don't drive while intoxicated or sleep deprived. In theory, diet and exercise (with their effect of improving neurological health) can probably improve your ability to focus and to react. [[https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/careers/2018/01/09/workplace-fatalities-25-most-dangerous-jobs-america/1002500001/][You can choose not to become employed in dangerous professions.]] According to the Electrical Safety Foundation International, contact with / exposure to electric current is the sixth most common cause of workplace fatality. So as an electrical engineer idk wtf you actually do but perhaps be a stickler about workplace safety.

The next is chronic lower respiratory diseases. Yet another reason to not smoke.

Stroke. Diet and exercise.

Dementia. If nothing else kills you and you "die of old age," statistically you've probably died of dementia. Exercise helps preserve the white matter that deteriorates/shrinks as a result of dementia.

Diabetes. Type I is unavoidable. Type II can be prevented through diet and exercise.

The flu and pneumonia. Don't have a weak immune system (diet and exercise) and go to the flipping hospital if you have pneumonia, don't just trust your body to fix it.

(EDIT: Never consume any sugarwaters like tea or soda or juice. If you simply /must/ consume coffee and/or energy drinks, then /don't consume energy drinks/ and take your coffee without sugar. Your body gets all the sugars it needs from the carbs you eat.)

Stress is an important factor in a lot of things (cancer, heart attack and stroke, probably other things). Focus on [[https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/17-tips-to-sleep-better][improving the quality of your sleep]] and consistently getting between 7-and-a-half and 9 hours of sleep every night. (EDIT: If you're consistently getting an appropriate amount of uninterrupted sleep and still feel like shit in the mornings, consider that maybe that isn't normal and something might be wrong - maybe you have sleep apnea, or maybe you're using a high loft pillow or a low loft pillow when you should be using the other, or maybe you lay on your back/side when you should be laying on your side/back.) Cut negative people out of your life, ruthlessly. End any friendships you might have with people who have (or seem to have) Cluster B personality disorders. If you have a toxic work environment with a bunch of busybodies who socialize like they're in middle school and a boss whose identity is bound up with his absolute dominance of his employees then - if you can't abandon that job for a better job - learn how to detach and not take things personally and don't think about work at home. Supplementing with Ashwagandha root has been shown to reduce cortisol levels by almost 20%. (EDIT: [[https://adaa.org/understanding-anxiety/related-illnesses/other-related-conditions/stress/physical-activity-reduces-st][Exercise is relevant here as well.]])

In your personal struggle to live as long as possible (because, let's be real here, there's a high probability that you (and that goes for every person reading this, not just [[/u/Standard-Interest]]) aren't going to contribute in any meaningful way to the cause of ending death (and you can "spread awareness" as much as you want, but most people in this country are Christians and will dismiss your silly transhumanism out of hand (and might react to your problematic transhumanist beliefs by trying to "spread awareness" at you about the importance of The Jesus), and most of the people who you /could/ reach are being reached more effectively by [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZYNADOHhVY][people who already have a platform]] (that video has over 5 million views))), diet and exercise are going to account for more than 85% of your efforts towards maximizing your survivability. You could dig a bunker under your house and stockpile canned goods and water and whatever in case of nuclear war. Idk how the hell "learning the legal and medical systems" is supposed to contribute to extending your life. You could learn how to set a broken bone in case civilization collapses and you no longer have access to medical care. But so what? If civilization collapses, life extension immediately becomes "no longer a real thing," the defeat of the dragon is 100% contingent on civilization not collapsing.

TL;DR: Just lift some weights, bruh.
