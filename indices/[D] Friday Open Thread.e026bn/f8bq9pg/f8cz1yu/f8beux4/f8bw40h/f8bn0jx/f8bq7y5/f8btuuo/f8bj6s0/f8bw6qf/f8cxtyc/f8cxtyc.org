There's basically two things to think about in terms of cryonics / neural cryobiology research that might take place (but won't necessarily) in the near future.

One is that we could achieve marginally better cryonics than at present. Since it's an uncertain bet, this translates to better odds. Therefore, as a community, cryonics-interested people have incentive to coordinate towards this.

The other thing to think about is that we might uncover a way to achieve reversible cryopreservation for humans. This is actually a radically different idea from cryonics, since cryonics invokes the prospect of new technology in the future that repairs the patient and makes it possible to wake them. Reversible cryopreservation would involve preventing the damage to begin with, which makes it much less inherently speculative and more analogous to normal medical procedures.

I think people who are highly skeptical of old-school cryonics (who don't foresee a post-singularity or 300-year-from-now intelligence ever being able to reverse the damage) ought to agitate for funding of research to achieve reversible cryopreservation, i.e. how to prevent cryopreservation damage in the human brain. The main (near term) competition to this track is antiaging research, so it should come down to which of these is likely to advance the most quickly.

The issue with antiaging that anticryodamage doesn't have is the validation time. You can validate an approach in mice, which have short lifespans, but their biology is likely to diverge significantly from human biology precisely where things affecting their lifespan is concerned. Whereas mice and humans die when frozen(vitrified)/thawed(in the non-advanced-future-tech context) for the same basic reasons. An approach that prevents fundamental issues like cryoprotectant toxicity and cell shrinkage ("dehydration") in mice, rabbits, pigs, etc. should translate to humans, provided it can be scaled to our brain size.

Furthermore, when you get it to the stage of testing in humans (i.e. validated to be able to thaw large mammals like pigs), you know whether the human test subjects were benefited by a given change in the treatment much more quickly (did it kill the patient, and if so, how bad does the damage look under an electron microscope). This is much more in line with how we test drugs and surgical treatments in medicine today -- with only a few terminally ill people taking the bulk of the risk, and it being relatively safe by the time it is used on a large population. With antiaging, you have a very slow validation mechanism. Pretty much anyone over a certain age is doomed to end up either a test subject with very little certainty of success, or a control who dies of aging in the typical manner.

Of course, damage-free cryopreservation wouldn't be very valuable if you didn't cure aging eventually. But the main point of uncertainty isn't whether it can be cured (it's pretty much inevitable, assuming research continues long enough), but whether it will happen in any of our lifetimes. This is in stark contrast to the prospect of the reversal of the damage in (current-day/high-damage) cryonics, which not only depends on extremely advanced capabilities, but on unresolved questions of physical possibility (i.e. that the data in the brain is not "securely erased", but can be recovered).
