One thing that I haven't seen mentioned, in the fight against the dragon-tyrant's personal effects rather than its wider reach, is social networking. In the physical, old-fashioned sense, rather than the digital one.

Make friends. Have a lot of people around you who you enjoy spending time with and conversing with. Tell them your secrets. Make physical contact.

For one thing, we're social creatures, and it's unhealthy to try to exist in complete isolation. For another, trusted friends can hold you accountable to your priorities: even knowing that someone /knows/ that you're trying to get to the gym each week is a good motivator to keep doing it.

Loneliness leads to depression, and depression is one of the dragon-tyrant's loyal servants. Don't let it get ahold of you.
