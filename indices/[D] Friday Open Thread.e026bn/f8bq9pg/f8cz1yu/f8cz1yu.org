I have been a lurker on this subreddit for many years now and love alot of the stories here. I have been inspired to write something myself and would like to share it with the community. However, I am not in any capacity a writer and english is not my first language. What if my writing is not "rational" enough or what if it is full of spelling errors. These are are things that make me worried about even posting anything here. I never even comment on this subreddit because of these worries.
