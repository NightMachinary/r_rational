  Cryonics is a pseudo science because its claims are fundamentally rooted in assumptions that are not known to be true, or anywhere close to true.
#+end_quote

The assumptions are known to be reasonable in terms of known science. You would have to learn new science to demonstrate they are unreasonable.

#+begin_quote
  The reasoning behind cryonics as a venture to capture a brainstate through freezing with enough fidelity that consciousness can be preserved and later revived is baseless.
#+end_quote

You use the word 'freezing' multiple times without clarification. Could it be that you haven't researched this enough to know that cryonics attempts to vitrify things instead of freezing them? I'm aware that sometimes freezing is employed as a colloquialism for cryopreservation in general, but you ought to at least try to signal awareness of this important physical distinction if you want to be taken seriously.

#+begin_quote
  First, through the fundamental assumption that identity/consciousness can be retained through freezing.
#+end_quote

No, the assumption that identity can in principle be preserved by freezing (if by that you mean cryopreservation in general) is not fundamentally baseless. It's the most reasonable way of looking at things in the light of known science, and no more controversial than humans being able in principle to travel to other planets. Surprising new science would be needed to discover that it can't be done, and it would have to be consistent with measured results (such as C elegans learned behavior surviving vitrification).

  Even setting aside the issue whether the collective state of neurons can be inferred from a static model of them, current cryonics procedures are likely to cause irrecoverable damage to cells.
#+end_quote

Long term memories are encoded in durable structures. Nobody who knows anything about neuroscience has serious doubts about that. It also fits with common sense -- the body is a chaotic environment, and it wouldn't make sense for memories to be stored in an overly volatile medium, as this would increase the amount of energy expended to keep making copies, and would reduce the organism's ability to reliably make decisions on the basis of memories. Short term memories and ongoing consciousness are a different story, and you can lose those pretty easily due to shock, anesthesia, etc. even without cryonics.

As to irrecoverable damage, how are you applying that label? In chemistry we talk about irreversible reactions, but that does not preclude all possible mechanisms to reverse the reaction, it just describes thermodynamics in a solution. Brain cells are likely to be dehydrated in current cryonics, which means if you add water they quickly undergo apoptosis and necrosis, making them unrecoverable by normal biological means, but if you have advanced simulations and scanning capabilities this could well be a very recoverable state by that standard.

  Second, the entire second half of cryonics is a hail mary gamble, where one essentially prays that A) technology is developed to allow for reconstructive brain scanss, B) that technology becomes viable enough for commercial use,
#+end_quote

It's a gamble, but those aren't independent variables and don't have low individual likelihood. Tech progress does specialize, but there tend to be overlapping threads. For example, a world where aging is cured will more likely have cancer cured, because both of these rely on unraveling many of the same basic mysteries. But it is also because the kind of work to be done requires a lot of heavy computational modeling. Computational modeling is such a general purpose advantage across many fields that it is hard to imagine a world where advances occur in e.g. particle physics but not medicine, or vice versa.

Also, computational modeling has a history of becoming dramatically cheaper and more effective to use. So the same thing that boosts the chance of the basic tech ability developing boosts the chance of it being "commercially viable" (i.e. the funding available being adequate to do the thing). You don't have to be that optimistic about the Singularity to see this happening. Even if we are approaching the limits of Moore's Law, there are advances in more optimal deployment (custom chips that handle workloads better, more efficient algorithms, etc), and even when we hit those there is the advent of space based mining/manufacturing/computing to consider. We may never truly hit post-scarcity, but what the heck else do you want to /do/ with 10^{26} watts when you build your first Dyson swarm? Bear in mind that this takes <100 years if you have an annually self doubling system.

  AND C) whatever cryonics company they put their lot in won't go belly up before A and B happen.
#+end_quote

I don't think this is particularly likely. Part of it is the high likelihood that extreme advances will come quickly enough that they don't have to account for very many generations. And life extension may contribute to organizational stability. Another thing to consider is that cryonics organizations are basically ideologically driven, which gives them a better chance of surviving than profit driven companies. They are a little more like religions in that respect. One thing to consider is that they may hand patients off to another organization to take care of in the event of failure, and there may even eventually be legal protections forcing them to do so (certainly there are already community norms and ethics encouraging such to happen, as my understanding is that it has happened a few times already). Another factor is that they have the advantage of being on the "right side of history", meaning that when deathism falls out of fashion and e.g. cryopreservation becomes a routine medical procedure, cryonics will have broader societal support (and cryopatients will likely be viewed as priceless pieces of history, an irreplacable opportunity to extend living memory back to the 20th century). This increases the chance that such organizations will be able to successfully raise funds, or find suitable successors in the event of failure.

  The sheer level of implausibility should mean that any "rational" calculation of expected increase to lifespan versus resources spent should be approaching the level of purchasing an indulgence from your local bishop.
#+end_quote

The surface plausibility of cryonics on scientific grounds is many orders of magnitude higher than anything overtly mystical or religious. And while I enjoy reading fantasy, I don't think the chance of us living in a secretly supernatural universe (let alone one where the bishop coincidentally has the power to sell effective indulgences) is high enough for this comparison to be at all reasonable.

#+begin_quote
  Of course, these things may change even within our current lifetimes, but you would be flushing your money down the toilet to invest in a personal cryonics plan at this juncture.
#+end_quote

Maybe recommending someone wait for better quality services would be defensible on the grounds of sending a sane and sensible market signal, but that is not at all how "cryonics is a pseudoscience" comes across. Instead, you are making a broad attack that is more likely to thwart than spur the additional research that could save your life one day. I would recommend rethinking your approach in terms of how to talk about this.
