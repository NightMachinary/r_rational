I think it's “baseless” because its underlying claims make assumptions of science and technology that have no basis in current reality, and ascribe low probabilities of those assumptions becoming true. When foundations like Alcor make claims that medical technology is moving towards the ability to resuscitate frozen brains, I just see the 21st century equivalent of magazines claiming Maglev trains and underwater habitats would be commonplace by the year 2000.
