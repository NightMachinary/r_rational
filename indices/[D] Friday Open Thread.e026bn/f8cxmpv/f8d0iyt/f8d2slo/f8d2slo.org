  Ignoring stupid criticism is a life skill every single human should learn, and it is a thousand times more important for artists of all kinds.

I completely agree, but every artist is different and some absolutely cannot ignore even the most stupid criticisms and even worse those criticisms carry vastly more weight with them than praise. This usually does not affect the work, because almost always these criticisms are heard after it's completion, not during it's creation. This is just a rare alignment of the internet and serial fiction, but if da Vinci had heard like a thousand people saying "It's looking great!" when he was mid painting and one person said "Too much brown" then guaranteed when he went to bed that night he would probably be thinking "Am I using too much brown?"
