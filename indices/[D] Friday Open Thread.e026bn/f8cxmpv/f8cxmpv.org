I'm mad about the Worth the Candle criticism thread. The author reads every post here and I know from past comments he takes criticism more seriously than (in my opinion) he should.

I'm not saying people should not be critical of any work, in any medium. God knows I've talked a lot of shit about countless works and been absolutely vicious about it, but never directly to the author and most importantly never /in the middle of the project/ while he or she was still working on it.

What I'm saying is like... Dickens for example was one of the first people to do episodic fiction and would do a chapter a month and then reprint it all in book form when it was finished. And I'm sure he took a lot of criticism mid work, because not everything is to everyone's taste, and that's fine. I'm sure he got some mean letters about how Oliver's character was clich√© and the orphan-who-actually-has-rich-parents trope is overused, and he just crumpled them up and threw them in the hearth or lit his cigar with them. But Dickens didn't have a local pub where he went to where the room was magically big enough that /every person/ who was reading his current work was in there, and that enchanted pub didn't have a spell effect that caused every conversation /at any time/ in which people were critical of aspects of his writing and current work to be brought to his attention and listened to regardless of if it took place while he was asleep or not in the pub so that he could listen to every criticism that had ever been uttered there at his leisure. If it did have those things I would hope that Dickens, to preserve his goddamn sanity, would never set foot in that accursed pup while he was in the middle of a project. And some authors can operate like that, but others have to hear every negative word, in fact for some people the negative stuff is something they can't help but seek out.

Again, I'm not against criticism. I am intensely critical of much, in fact honestly most, of modern works of fiction in virtually every medium. I run my mouth all the time. But I love WtC and I don't want him to change anything. And I think internet criticism of /currently developing/ works is unhealthy. If in the history of art for example, authors/artists had had access to all negative comments/arguments about the work they were currently /in the middle/ of creating then the landscape of art would have ended up looking significantly different, and probably a lot worse.
