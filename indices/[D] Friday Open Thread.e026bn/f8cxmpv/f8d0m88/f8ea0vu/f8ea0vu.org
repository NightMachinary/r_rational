Resd the top comment on that post where Daystar(? pokemon author) clearly explains how when subverting it can take a long time of just establishing (season or more in tv for one of the examples). So you kind of have to stick with it in some cases for more than 3 chapters even when unsure..

Not to mention that webfiction is notorious for starting of lower quality "until they find their voice".
