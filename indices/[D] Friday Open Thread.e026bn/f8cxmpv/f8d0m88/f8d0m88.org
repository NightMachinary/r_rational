I'm reading the thread and the one thing that confuses me the most is how can someone stick with something they aren't even enjoying. Mind you, I understand that sometimes it takes a while for a work to get going (hence stuff like the 3-episodes rule for anime and series) but reading 70 chapters of something that you aren't enjoying, isn't going in a direction you like, and constantly features literary devices you dislike?

Rather than clumsily attempting to shape an existing work into something that panders to you, wouldn't it be more reasonable to accept it's not for you, drop it, and move on to something more appealing to your preferences or tastes? Or is there something I'm missing here?

I feel like the discussion and criticism in that thread leads nowhere and serves no purpose other than to be inflammatory for the sake of it. And calling out/attacking the author seems imo quite tasteless and not constructive at all.
