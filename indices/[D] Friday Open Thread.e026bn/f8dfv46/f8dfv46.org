I came across some manga that looks promising, translated as "This Village SIM NPC could only be human". Main character is an unemployed shut in who enters contests to pass his time. He wins a game and it seems extremely realistic, in this game he is the 'god of fate' and the camera follows villagers who worship him. He can only interact with them by sending them one prophecy a day which appears written in their holy book.

Just 2 chapters out now, too early to know if it will be good, but feels like an interesting premise.
