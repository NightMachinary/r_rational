I am currently in night classes to get a secondary bachelor's in chemical engineering. It's been over a year since I took physics 2 lecture (circuits) and am struggling with the actual design of making the circuits for lab. The practicum midterm destroyed my A average and I am in need of assistance. For some reason I am perfectly fine designing circuits in theory but I will always get something mixed up in the building of then.

Does anyone have any good books or youtube videos to cover the actual lab sections? I have plenty of resources for theory and lecture but nothing that shows the actual making of the circuits in comparison to the diagram.
