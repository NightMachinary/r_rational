Hmmm. I can offer a few suggestions to try, in the hope that some of them may help.

- Draw a circuit diagram for what you're trying to do before building the circuit.
- Refer to said diagram often during the circuit building process
- Before connecting the power (I assume you're building circuits on breadboard), run through the entire circuit against the diagram. Follow /every/ path from the power source's positive terminal through to ground, and check /every/ component along that path.
- After doing so, check that your circuit works as required before submitting it for marking.

--------------

This won't prevent you from making mistakes. But it should pick them up and allow you to correct them before you get marked down for them.
