All matter (including liquid and gas!) is made of "atoms", which are clumps of "protons". Protons are impossible to create or destroy.

The properties of an atom are all derived from its number of protons. A 26-protons clump is Iron. A 29-protons clump is Copper.

That's for pure elements, which are relatively rare. Atoms of different proton count can bind to each other into groups called "molecules" which have their own properties. Water is two 1-proton "Hydrogen" atoms combined with one 8-protons "Oxygen" atom.

Most of the matter in the world is made of (lots and lots of identical) molecules, often combining dozens of atoms. It's relatively easy to get atoms to bind with each other or split up, though only some combinations work. [Here are some low-tech experiments you can do to combine or isolate atoms.]

 

Now, let's talk about gold. Gold is a pure element, a clump of 79 protons. If you've followed me so far, you'll know that this means there are two ways to make gold:

- Take molecules which contain some atoms of gold, and extract those atoms. If you find stone that looks like [[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/Calaverite-214667.jpg][this]] for example there's a recipe I could teach you that could extract the gold atoms.

- Take an atom of non-gold, and add or remove protons to it until it has exactly 79. Mercury is a pure element made of 80 protons, you'd just have to remove one.

 

Unfortunately, I have bad news for both of these approaches.

- Gold is an element that doesn't bind well with others, so it's very rare for a molecule to contain gold. (That's the same reason gold is so durable! Iron binds with some atoms in the air or water to form molecules of various kinds of /rust/, from which pure iron could be extracted again; but gold does not.) That stone I showed you is even rarer than pure gold, there's none anywhere near your country.

- Adding or removing protons to an atom is /really hard/. You need more heat than a volcano. Even with detailed instructions it will take generations of work before anyone can build a machine that can do it. And that machine will consume so much fuel that it'll cost more to operate than the gold is worth.

 

If you want to get rich with alchemy, pretty much every other metal is easier to extract. Or don't bother with pure elements and just figure out how to make useful molecules or mixtures of molecules; [I'd have to look it up but I'm sure there's lots of low-hanging fruits I could point you towards].

Oh, some of the things I said above are lies, oversimplifications to save space. What can I say, the time machine charges by the letter. Nothing immediately relevant to your question though.
