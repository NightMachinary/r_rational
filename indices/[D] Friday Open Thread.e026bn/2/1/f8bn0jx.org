Spread awareness that the Dragon-tyrant can be killed. We still live in the pre-debate era, when people just quietly assume that Dragon-tyrants are unstoppable laws of nature rather than killable beasts. It is this submissiveness to the Dragon-tyrant which gives it power these days, rather than any fact about itself.

Not enough people have hope. They still assume linear human advancement timelines despite all the obvious evidence of exponential growth. They don't remember how very different things were even ten years ago, and they don't realize that massive difference is going to propagate forward even more rapidly.

You won't survive, none of us will, unless we can get enough people on board with killing the Dragon-tyrant. They won't fund the research, won't vote for politicians who will fund the research, if they don't believe it has a chance of working. Just yesterday, the top post in [[/r/showerthoughts]] was an assumption that dementia will still exist in 50 years, and I was the only person in the whole thread who tried to point out this may not be the case. The OP even pushed back, saying the human brain was obviously way too complicated for us to have a fix for dementia in only 50 years! That is not the attitude of a society which believes it can kill Dragon-tyrants.

Nothing you or anyone else can do is more important than spreading the word. Nobody wants to die, and the only counterexamples exist due either to treatable illness (physical or mental) or because death has already claimed too much of what they loved. Almost nobody, except this community, realizes this means the problem is death, rather than lack of acceptance for death. The only way to fix that is to put it in people's heads that there really, actually might be hope, if only they reach out for it.
