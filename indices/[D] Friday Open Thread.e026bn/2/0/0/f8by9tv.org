For example, tons of recent studies have shown that there's no correlation between consumption of saturated fats and heart disease. Fats are fine. Fats have always been fine, as has the dietary cholesterol found in things like eggs. The problem is sugar, and has always been sugar.

EDIT:

Fiber has no nutritional content. You /must/ include fiber and roughage for digestive health. But for all intents and purposes, when looking at nutrition there is only protein, fat, and carbohydrates. Telling people to minimize meat and fat while making fruits and vegetables the majority of their diet would mean telling people to make carbohydrates their main source of calories. Most of the calories in fruit come from sugar. Vegetarians and vegans eat a lot of beans, not just fruits and vegetables. Carbs should be a maximum of 50% of your daily calories. 33% protein, 33% fat, 33% carbs would be perfectly valid. Telling people to minimize or eliminate fat from their diet is /atrociously/ terrible advice.
