"Tons of studies" sounds good, but it really isn't good evidence. You can cherry pick almost any conclusion with "tons of studies." What you should rely on is a systematic review of all of the published evidence available.

Here's my [[https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/44338362/Reduction_in_saturated_fat_intake_for_ca20160402-19341-16a4svk.pdf?response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DReduction_in_saturated_fat_intake_for_ca.pdf&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A%2F20191122%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20191122T184711Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=2dc8bfc890211a5df06bac30a437a78db3cbd9136eb37a029d7a6c509e6c77b2][reference]]. Note that this is a systematic review of published research. To quote the authors' conclusion:

#+begin_quote
  The findings of this updated review are suggestive of a small but potentially important reduction in cardiovascular risk on reduction of saturated fat intake. Replacing the energy from saturated fat with polyunsaturated fat appears to be a useful strategy, and replacement with carbohydrate appears less useful, but effects of replacement with monounsaturated fat were unclear due to inclusion of only one small trial. This effect did not appear to alter by study duration, sex or baseline level of cardiovascular risk. Lifestyle advice to all those at risk of cardiovascular disease and to lower risk population groups should continue to include permanent reduction of dietary saturated fat and partial replacement by unsaturated fats. The ideal type of unsaturated fat is unclear.

For [[https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/105/6/1462/4569801?papetoc][another systematic review]] (which addresses food groups like fruits, vegetables, in contrast to red meat, and sugar-sweetened beverages, but not sugar specifically):

#+begin_quote
  Optimal consumption of risk-decreasing foods results in a 56% reduction of all-cause mortality, whereas consumption of risk-increasing foods is associated with a 2-fold increased risk of all-cause mortality.
#+end_quote

As for guidelines regarding sugar itself (as opposed to sugary beverages), a [[https://annals.org/aim/fullarticle/2593601/scientific-basis-guideline-recommendations-sugar-intake-systematic-review][systematic review]] finds:

#+begin_quote
  Guidelines on dietary sugar do not meet criteria for trustworthy recommendations and are based on low-quality evidence. Public health officials (when promulgating these recommendations) and their public audience (when considering dietary behavior) should be aware of these limitations.
#+end_quote

So, basically, current recommendations do advise against substantial sugar intake, and the evidence taken as a whole appears to likely lean that direction as opposed to unrestricted sugar intake, but it's still weak evidence and further research is needed to determine if the data really supports the extent of the current recommendations. However, sugary beverages have been well-established as harmful by systematic reviews, like the one I mentioned above, so recommendations against sugar in general will hopefully help to reduce their consumption while we sort out the evidence.

Overall, dietary recommendations are tricky because it's impossible to run double-blinded randomized-controlled trials comparing different diets, and even high-quality cohort studies are challenging when it comes to diets. As such, the evidence for many diet recommendations is somewhat weak, and there tends to be many conflicting results. With that in mind, the best approach with dietary guidelines is to follow recommendations made by systematic reviews, particularly when they find at least moderate evidence of significant differences in all-cause mortality.
