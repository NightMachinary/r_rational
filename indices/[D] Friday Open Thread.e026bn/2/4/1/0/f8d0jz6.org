  a bet on some shady pseudoscience industry

Cryonics is a bet, to be sure, but it is not pseudoscience (as the term is usually defined).

And while I suppose anything can be described as an industry, it's a bit strange to see a loose coalition of nonprofits and enthusiasts described this way without context.

Ideally, by the time the OP needs cryonics he'll see it integrated into the standard medical pipeline, although even then it'll probably be considered a niche product for hardcore immortalists.
