Cryonics is a pseudo science because its claims are fundamentally rooted in assumptions that are not known to be true, or anywhere close to true. The reasoning behind cryonics as a venture to capture a brainstate through freezing with enough fidelity that consciousness can be preserved and later revived is baseless.

First, through the fundamental assumption that identity/consciousness can be retained through freezing. Even setting aside the issue whether the collective state of neurons can be inferred from a static model of them, current cryonics procedures are likely to cause irrecoverable damage to cells.

Second, the entire second half of cryonics is a hail mary gamble, where one essentially prays that A) technology is developed to allow for reconstructive brain scanss, B) that technology becomes viable enough for commercial use, AND C) whatever cryonics company they put their lot in won't go belly up before A and B happen. The sheer level of implausibility should mean that any "rational" calculation of expected increase to lifespan versus resources spent should be approaching the level of purchasing an indulgence from your local bishop.

Of course, these things may change even within our current lifetimes, but you would be flushing your money down the toilet to invest in a personal cryonics plan at this juncture.
