I think in settings where Superman's powers are incomprehensible and static and there regularly appear existential threats (in the form of Darkseid, Doomsday, General Zod, etc.) whose primary mechanism of defeat is "getting punched really hard" it makes sense for Superman to focus on honing his punching abilities, keeping keen his sense of justice and heroic responsibility, etc. If he stops to focus on mundane utilities and his punching skills falter the world is quickly forfeit.

In other settings, [[https://nikvetr.wordpress.com/2016/07/20/superman-effective-power-application/][I personally disagree]] that transporting grain, plowing farmland, or cranking a generator are anywhere near the best applications of Superman's powers.
