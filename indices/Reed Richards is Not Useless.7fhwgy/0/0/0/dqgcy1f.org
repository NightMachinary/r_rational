I really don't like the message that comic is trying to convey. Superman is not obligated to dedicate the entirety of his time and energy to be maximally efficient at benefiting humanity. First of all because nobody is obliged to do that (good people are still allowed to have a life) and second of all because people need downtime to remain sane and maintaining the mental well-being of the most power being on the planet is kind of a high priority.

Also, there is absolutely no way the best use for supermans powers is to spin a dynamo all day long, even if you agree that unlimited energy is the best goal to strive for. Worst case scenario: just have him build and run a park of nuclear power plants and dump the waste products in the sun. He can keep the damage contained if a meltdown threatens to occur and if we run out of fissionables he can just pop over to an asteroid with a high uranium content and get us some more.
