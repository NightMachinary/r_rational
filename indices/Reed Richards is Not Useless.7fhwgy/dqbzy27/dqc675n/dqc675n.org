I mean, Schlock Mercenary is pretty good about this. Near the beginning, a scientist/engineer develops effective FTL teleportation. This sets off massive upheaval as the monopolies on the clunkier FTL is overturned, teleportation blockers and teleportation blocker blockers are developped, obseleted superweapons become viable now they can be easily teleported around, etc.
