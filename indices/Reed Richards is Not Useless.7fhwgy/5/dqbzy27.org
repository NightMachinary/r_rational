I think most sci-fi would qualify, though oftentimes there the supergeniuses are unnamed entities in the past, or more “well-coordinated teams of engineers” and “international conglomerates of scientists” than singular individuals. I guess in those cases the progress itself is not shown unless the work is a space opera spanning centuries or something.
