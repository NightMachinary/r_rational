Girl Genius comes to mind. Though that's less that mad scientists' inventions catch on and more that there's just so many mad scientists that their inventions are everywhere. Still, the entire city of Paris was controlled by one guy, who seemed to make it a pretty impressive city.

Fallout Equestria had a lot of social change from the inventions they had during the war. But the megaspells ended up making it all moot. I imagine the original Fallout series was similar, but I've never actually played.
