Are we talking about the same grandfather-paradox-manipulation series? Where we follow around the female protagonist on the n-th leg/cycle of a doomed world, and she needs to find out exactly what she needs to change. But only the reader really understands this, and she thinks she can still fix it? It was kind of underlined in the very beginning of the series.
