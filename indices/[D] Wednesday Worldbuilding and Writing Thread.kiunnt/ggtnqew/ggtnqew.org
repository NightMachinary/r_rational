A person keeps getting Isekai'd.

It's happened to him 15 times before. Each time, he finds a way back to Earth; back to his family, back to his life. There's a time compression effect, so every month he spends in the other world is a day on Earth.

He gets a boon every time, a boon which is at full power in another world but still gives a little bit of a boost on Earth.

His first boons were all language-related; a boon each to hear, speak, read, write, and think in other languages. (The reading and writing one also happen to give him sign language fluency.) That's five boons.

What other boons should he take? They should all be... basic. Tutorial-level boons, if you will. I'm thinking poison resistance, disease resistance, mana-sight, and being able to eat basically anything, that's four. Maybe an Analyze/Identify active ability?

The idea of the broader story is that on his sixteenth trip, his family gets pulled in with him into basically-Carcosa, and the tutorial is over.
