Some sort of boon to ease first contact situations would be useful. Something like the wear-a-lab-coat-and-hold-a-clipboard combination, but in magical boon form, so that people don't immediately do a double take when they see you and your clothes.

Along those same lines, some enhanced empathy could be useful. Knowing what other people are saying is great and all, but knowing roughly what they're intending and what they think of you with greater precision is quite useful for survival, even if it only comes in the form a gut feeling.

Looking at it from the hierarchy of needs perspective, some sort of way to get crappy shelter in a box would be nice. Some sort of extremely localised air conditioning, perhaps? A few degrees towards the optimal at all times.

Some way to keep inventory without a backpack would be nice. Perhaps existing pockets are expanded slightly when on the characters person, until checked by another person.

Alongside the air conditioning, some sort of air purifying or psuedo gas mask would be useful to mitigate horrendous atmospheric conditions or being trapped underwater/underground.

After a few isekais I'm imagining our character would enjoy something to point him to his destination. An internal compass of any sort would be nice, really, since having a map on him at all times can't be guaranteed. Perhaps as an homage it could be an internal map that fills itself out as he travels to places? Difficult to abuse as eidetic memory but still nice quality of life, and somewhat useful.

Danger sense, even if it's something along the lines of 'this is bad' when there is something bad in plain sight, would be very nice. Also leads to some pleasant moments where you look into the sky, think "oh, it's about to rain", and then feel the danger sense go off and panic.

Something that allows for easier learning or memory would be an early pick for me personally, at least, given that the effects could potentially get better over time. Easier ability to retain and change physique for a similar reason.

Finally, probably general intelligence/charisma/durability enhancements for better problem solving and not-dying-ness.

Not sure how many of these are what you're looking for, given that I'm spitballing a little, but I hope it helps!
