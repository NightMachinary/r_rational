I've started watching Pixar's /Onwards/ - it's not rational (at times, frustratingly so), but it got me thinking. The core idea is your default fantasy D&D world evolving to use technology and abandon magic, becoming a lot like our own. The fact this happens is pretty nonsense (since apparently magic allows them to /summon the dead/, for example), but the general concept is sound: magic needs a user, and using magic is hard; meanwhile, technology can be easy to use once it's built. What would you spin out of this concept? I am thinking in particular socio-economic dynamics e.g. how this would connect to broader shifts from feudalism to capitalism, what would end up being the role of magic in the resulting society, etc. Also, do you know of any existing works with a good take on this?
