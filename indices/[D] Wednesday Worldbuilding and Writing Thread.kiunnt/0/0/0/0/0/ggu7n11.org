The idea would be that all mental aspects grow so beliefs would as well. If a person has a belief in x for 1000 years and that reinforcement is constant then the stress induced by it being disproven would fuck you up big time. The magical equivalent of a stress induced heart attack.

Of course the actual effect of this is that everyone is trained in a specific set/system of beliefs that has little to no inconsistency. Something either passed down or worked on and verified constantly.

The next level would be that individual experience breeds very individual beliefs so without careful consideration you can fall into specific thought patterns that can trip you up if an opponent is perceptive enough. All of this would be the looooong long game tho. More politics than fighting.

This. Magic would harden or alter beliefs such that they grow. Plenty of people can believe directly contradictory things for their entire lives. Just because they don't think about them at all. In this magical world if you have an incorrect belief then with time and at a certain point it will become a part of your way of thinking. If two beliefs contradict then two parts of your mind can self destruct. As you think about the opposing views they grow stronger creating a loop of stress as each beliefs reinforces itself. A big part of the world would be pruning and teaching ways to avoid/defuse situations like that.

It's all so cool to me.
