Eh, that's fair. I was only using a caricature of an old culture to have a familiar setting to hang my points on, anyhow.

But the basic idea is valid for all cultures. A Wizard from culture A will probably have certain culture-specific biases in his thoughts and ideas - ideas which are safe in /his/ culture. But the people from Culture B, in that other valley over there... well, they probably know /exactly/ which ideas would be most harmful to the Culture A wizards, and how to compress them down into a sentence or two. (Similarly, Culture A knows how to take down Culture B's wizards).

Depending on the relations between the cultures, this can lead to interesting practices. For example, let's say that Culture A and Culture B are trying to set up peace talks (they both agree that the war's gone on way too long). Of course, at some point they must meet in person. Being sensible folks, they agree to meet without wizards (it's amazing what a hostile wizard can do when he has all the enemy rulers in front of him...). And to enforce this, they start the meeting by yelling wizard-killing insights at each other before they even get close...

Of course, there's one type of wizard that these insights /don't/ work on, and that's the Rebel Wizard. Rebel Wizards make at least one choice in their basic setup that runs /contrary/ to their cultural norms. Now, that doesn't imply that they're /antagonistic/ towards their culture - often quite the contrary. And if they've flipped on the /correct/ choice, then they're immune to the Wizard-killing phrase from the other culture over there. (But they might not be immune to Culture C's phrase, because they might not have flipped on that part of their culture). Unfortunately, the Rebel Wizard might very well be vulnerable to their own side's wizard-killing insight...
