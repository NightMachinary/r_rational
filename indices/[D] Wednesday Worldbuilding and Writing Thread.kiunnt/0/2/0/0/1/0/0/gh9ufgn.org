I love the idea of people being engaged in a fight and the villain saying STOP! and the heroes are polite enough to stop and listen to him explain the context of his painting haha :) I was more thinking when it comes to the art and stuff being used as a weapon you could inform them about its context through its use e.g, if there was a murderer who killed someone and leaves a symbol of an animal e.g. a goat, a crab, etc. Then you can inform people of the context/meaning with how you use it, you could kill one person during a certain zodiac period and leave your calling card as the animal associated with that season. Or perhaps it's based off of a famous legend from their homeland and by painting an abstract version of that legend it remains a mystery until someone learns of the legend in which case the meaning of the painting becomes obvious, perhaps it's one of the famous exploits of the character who painted it, whilst this example isn't about a painting I think the tridam ultimatium used by renfi on Geralt is a good example from the Witcher books, I think it was in “The Last Wish”.
