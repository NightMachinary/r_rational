Weird idea inspired from that topic in the context of xianxia, but a cultivation path in a xianxia story based on parthenogenesis, where all the cultivation you do is stored until you give birth to an improved clone of yourself, would be bizarre and interesting. It'd focus on a character who wants to see a vessel for their values grow, rather than their own individual strength grow, which is kind of the core perspective typical xianxia takes. So you could switch the protagonist after every (re)birth to the new one after a short period of parenthood of the clone that leaves the protagonist consistently vulnerable. The massive subversion of xianxia tropes, when the story is about "cultivating your offspring" rather than "yourself," as well as the typical "protag has a harem strung out across centuries" deal being bizarrely applied and ignored with asexual reproduction.

I'd have to read the supplementary links on identity the bloke who's doing "There Is Nothing To Fear" bought up the other day in his discussion thread on this subreddit, since the main character of that sees his identity in such a manner anyway.
