Recently a magic system has been rolling around my head and the ideas for it have kinda dried up.

The general idea is that as you train whatever part of yourself it grows. I think I have a good idea of how the body grows in the magic system but I wanted to apply that to the mind.

So far I have a couple rankings as this would be a xianxia. The general theme is acceptance/denial of certain traits as they grow. Managing yourself so you don't grow crazy.

Fearless/fearful-whether or not you can accept your fear as it grows. Basically because all things in your mind grow you have to either remove all fear from yourself, accept all your fears, or cultivate specific fears that you can handle. This would be the cultural first step but you can do them in any order.

Emotional/emotionless-pretty much a rewrite of fear. As emotions grow you either need control, removal, or acceptance. Also pretty excited to write characters with built in flaws because either way is pretty messed up.

Truthless/truthful-acceptance or denial of your personality traits. Attempting to mold yourself into an ideal or just be. Probably the weakest of the three I have so far. Not very well defined in how or what to do to achieve either. I think it's probably okay to be very undefined just because it's so wishy-washy in real life as well.

Faithless/faithful-a self consistent belief system or pure nihilism. It's pretty extreme just because if you have two conflicting beliefs that grow powerful then it will inevitably lead to a mental break. Probably the one I'm most comfortable with. Very excited about writing it. So many diverse ways of thinking that are explicitly a part of every single character.

That's all I got and I think I want 5 total ranks. Also any world building thoughts related to this stuff would be really cool.

Thanks in advance!!
