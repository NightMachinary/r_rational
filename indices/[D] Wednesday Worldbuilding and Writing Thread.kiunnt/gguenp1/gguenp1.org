Questions for magical researchers in a high-magic society.

1. You're part of a team that has built a high powered energy containment pentagram where the five corners rest on each of the five accessible planes, and you're pumping it full of energy. What sort of hypothesis are you testing? What's a neat experimental result?

2. What sort of experimental result would convince you to join a conspiracy to shut off magic for 1000 years?

3. What sort of device does a conspiracy of magic researchers build to shut off magic?

I have ideas for 1&2, but I'm not super satisfied with my answers so I'm leaving them out. I'd rather like if the experimental result from 1 was not the one that prompts 2. I only have half an idea what 3 looks like at all.
