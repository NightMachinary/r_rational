There would probably be people who carefully try to cap their level to stay in a particular world, trying to be a big fish in a small pond. These people could be tricked into accidentally levelling up at inopportune moments. Friends and family would have to coordinate levelling up to jump worlds at the same time, and willingness to level up would be a major factor in social relationships.

In higher-level worlds, there would likely be factions that want to limit the number of newcomers or even get rid of them entirely; they would have security forces devoted to hunting down people who reached their world by levelling up, and shibboleths to identify people who were born there. People who actively try to level up would likely be people who are highly motivated and without considerable social or economic attachments; such types might be stereotyped as unscrupulous, dangerous, amoral in their pursuit of power, etc. In other words, they would be the kind of people who are willing to uproot themselves in search of better opportunities, like immigrants, and they would be treated poorly as immigrants often are.
