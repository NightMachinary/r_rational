I have doubts they'd be more post-scarcity than us; they have easier access to basics, but also far more danger. For example, one of the other setting features is that the banding effects don't apply to dragons; dragons go wherever they like. So even in the 16-20 band, you see wandering dragons of CR 30 (maybe higher), which takes a hell of a task force to put down. And it's still pretty hard to get from level 16 to 20, about as hard as from 1 to 5 in the lowest band. (So, 1 per 10,000 or less, IIRC).
