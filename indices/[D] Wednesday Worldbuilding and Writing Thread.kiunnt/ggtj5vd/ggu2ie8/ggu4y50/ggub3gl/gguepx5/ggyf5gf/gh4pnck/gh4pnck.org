This is for 3.5. Or, something around as similar to 3.5 as Pathfinder is. There's going to be a lot of house rules, trying to solve various problems (and probably replace them with other problems but at least they'll be novel). The house ruleset is called 3.Q, mostly because I think it's funny.

It's probably still true that the action economy means a village has a leg up on a dragon, but CR 30 dragons...well, actually there isn't any RAW CR 30 dragon, reds go up to 26 and gold to 27. But extrapolating, they'd have a low-epic caster level. So they could pull "Quickened Greater Invisibility, Extended Time Stop" and go from the edge of town to the mayor's bedroom before anyone knew they were attacking. And then Time Stop again on their way out. 9th-level spells are terrifying.
