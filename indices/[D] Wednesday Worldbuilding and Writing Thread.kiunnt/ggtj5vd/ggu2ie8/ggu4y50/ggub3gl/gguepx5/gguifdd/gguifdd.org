Sure, but the same goes for the standard four-man party of 16th level, and while the dragon has centuries of prep time, there are minimum a half-dozen late-teens/early-twenties standard four-man parties of 16th level adventurers in every village. And every one of those parties grew up having pretend-fights where their big brothers played the dragon while they ran around going "NUH-UH, you're a FIRE dragon and I cast FIRE IMMUNITY" while pretending their sticks were Infinity-Plus-One Swords.

I'm way sillier than you are, I think is my take here.
