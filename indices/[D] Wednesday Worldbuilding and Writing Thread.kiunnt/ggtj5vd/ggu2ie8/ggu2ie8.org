Here's a wholesome hot take for you: the highest level bands are all post-scarcity utopias. Everyone's basic necessities are trivial to supply, you barely even notice the spell slots! People showing up from the lower bands are carefully integrated into society with lots of therapy (Psionics!) and assistance in finding either prosocial civilian uses for their abilities and habits or in joining the task forces that contain the various monster/antisocial polities/outbreaks.
