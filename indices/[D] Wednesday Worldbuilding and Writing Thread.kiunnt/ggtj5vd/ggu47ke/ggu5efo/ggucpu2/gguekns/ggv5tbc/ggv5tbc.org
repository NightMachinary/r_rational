  If we had a reliable forecast that we'd be exchanging nukes with China in 2050, and acted on that, that would falsify the forecast; it would no longer be true that we'd be exchanging nukes with China in 2050.

Sure. In other words, information from the future can change the present. Of course, that also means that information from the future of the future can change the future, so information from the future of the future of the future can ... you get where this is going.

So, we know that both sides can get information from the future, and that new information may change the future, and that subsequent attempts to get information about the future may reveal a different future which may change the plans for the present. However, each time this process is repeated, we learn more about the future and the subsequent changes from our expectations become smaller and smaller. Eventually, we end up in a stable timeline where updated knowledge of the future does not change the future any further. And that whole process will have already happened /in the future/. So, by the time we learn that the US and China have a nuclear exchange in the future, it means both countries already evaluated all possible options to resolve the issue and still felt there was no better alternative. If we see that happening the future, it means there's very good odds that whichever country has the relative advantage in the present will have to seize the opportunity as quickly as possible.
