convergent: diviners see their own future

divergent: diviners see one of infinite futures

metastable: diviners see one future of a finite group of timelines, and each divination moves the current timeline through the group to the next, eventually looping back around by the time of the viewed future to make it accurate. Kind of like an unevenly stepped repeating pattern, with y as timeline no. and x as time; each x value has one y value, but each y value has multiple x values. Each instantaneous change in y is a divination. The last divination before a previous divination resolves brings the world into a timeline where that previously predicted future occurs. Therefore, when the time of the future from the divination comes around, the timeline is one where a divination has not been made before the resolution of that timelines previous divination.
