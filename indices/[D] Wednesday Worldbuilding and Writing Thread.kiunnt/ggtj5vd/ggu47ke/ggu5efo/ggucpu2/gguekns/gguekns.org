If we had a reliable forecast that we'd be exchanging nukes with China in 2050, and acted on that, that would falsify the forecast; it would no longer be true that we'd be exchanging nukes with China in 2050. So there's not much reason to privilege the timeline in which we /were/ going to exchanges nukes in 2050, vs. one where there was a sneak attack in response, or a binding treaty for bilateral nuclear arsenal inspection, or one where in response to a prediction of sneak attack they set up a Dead Hand system or one where the response was to covertly administer slow-acting highly-detectable poison to all entrants to the country - which they wouldn't have to follow through on since we'd get a forecast of that, too, as long as they were /in principle/ willing to follow through. And that's just going two and a half layers deep, when the plot and counterplot should extend to at least five or six layers.
