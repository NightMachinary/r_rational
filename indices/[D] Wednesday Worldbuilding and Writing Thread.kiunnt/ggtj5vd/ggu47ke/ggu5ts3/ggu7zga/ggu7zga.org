There's a variety of options, but I agree, I wouldn't have magic shops in the setting. They generally do not make sense in D&D under the rules as written, even though they're practically a staple of most D&D settings.

Magic items by commission is a possibility, but then you still have the issue of the payment itself. An evil wizard could commission a magic item, pay for it, get the item, then steal their money back, or just rob banks and use the money to buy magic items. The real problem here is the issue of items with immense value for their weight which can be easily stolen. Platinum is still worth 500 gp/lb., so not too much worse than the 16,000 gp/lb. that you'd get with something like boots of teleportation.

Keeping the items at a secret location and arranging for same-day delivery of the item after an auction is also possible, but has the same problems as items by commission and is even more dangerous. This just turns it into a simple matter of abducting the auctioneer and using a combination of torture and detect thoughts to discern the location of the items and how to access them.

In general, at this level of the game, magic items put a target on your back and aren't worth it unless you're an evil wizard or someone who wants to get ambushed by evil wizards and their minions, all bristling with powerful magic items. The key to survival here is deterrence - you need to make it not worth it to attack you, and magic items are generally an incentive rather than a deterrent.
