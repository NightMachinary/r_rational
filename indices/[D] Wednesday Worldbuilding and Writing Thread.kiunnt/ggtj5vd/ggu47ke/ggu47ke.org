Higher band worlds become pretty insane and terrifying, especially the 20+ world.

Empires clash with scry-and-die tactics. Evil wizards and liches rampage across the world raiding magic shops and ambushing anyone carrying useful magic items. Powerful people are turned into pawns of even more powerful wizards with dominate person and cursed items.

Divination allows countries to see that a war will happen soon, and the stronger country goes to war immediately to prevent the weaker one from building up. Most wars end up happening for unknown reasons, armies are just suddenly teleported into city centers to butcher the population because diviners divined diveners in the future divining the war happening in the future.

If killed in combat, few people go to the afterlife anymore, and just as few get resurrected. Standard combat tactics now involve destroying or imprisoning the enemy's soul to prevent them from coming back. A defensive countermeasure is to kill oneself and liberate your own soul from your body before the enemy can take it. As a result, battles rarely take longer than about six seconds for one side to launch the surprise attack and the survivors of the other side to escape into the afterlife or teleport away if able.
