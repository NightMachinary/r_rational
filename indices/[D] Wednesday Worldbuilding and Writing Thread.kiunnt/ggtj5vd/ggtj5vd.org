Take a D&D setting, roughly working on RAI core rules but with house rules that unfetter fighters, rogues and similar characters from having to seem plausibly non-magical even at 20th level. (For fighters this looks like the Tome of Battle and/or fighters who have acquired 30 fighter bonus feats by 10th level. For skill-focused characters it's a more complex system of making skill DCs scale more shallowly so that superhuman feats like "hide from someone you are currently grappling" is possible for a stealth specialist around level 15.) Stipulate that while 'level' is a heavily-simplified abstraction, XP is real, not as discrete points but in the sense that /experience/ is a metaphysical fluid gained by roughly the things that D&D grants XP for, and gaining more of it makes you more powerful in a curve resembling the level progression.

Then, apply an extra constraint: [[https://plain-dealing-villain.tumblr.com/post/178204587282/the-divine-shells][the universe is split into level bands]]. Anyone who reaches 6th level disappears from the level 1-5 world and appears in the 6-10 world. The same with someone who reaches 11th, 16th, and epic. Conversely, if you are born in the level 6-10 world you will be a 6th level character by the time you reach adulthood.

Given that preamble: what does life look like in the higher-band worlds? Trying to crowdsource this to get more perspectives and nudge the DM into making the setting more complete.
