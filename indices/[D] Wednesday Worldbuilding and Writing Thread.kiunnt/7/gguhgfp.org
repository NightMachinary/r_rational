Human Spaceflight is complicated. I /think/ my ragtag band of superpowered people can make an air-tight vehicle with something resembling the desired delta v, and can probably avoid radiation-related dangers. I might even be able to magic up viable navigation options. But if there isn't something that would make actually attempting to fly this homemade spaceship rather miserable and unhealthy almost immediately after launch, which I have almost certainly overlooked, I would be pleasantly surprised.

Then there's all the stuff I haven't overlooked, but have been mostly ignoring: food, exercise, toilet(s), climate control...

The available powers more or less allow them to ignore the tyrany of the rocket equation, so using acceleration to simulate gravity is an option. However, the engines are human-operated, and dude's gotta do something besides sitting there powering a rocket the whole time, so in practice, the schedule I've been working with assumes maybe 200min/day at 1G, with some time spent at greater acceleration if possible, spaced out so as to not overwhelm the crew. So having everyone take care of everything during the 1G burns is probably terribly impractical.

Research suggests that rowing machines and stationary bikes should work well in 0G, and I can imagine they could come up with those even if rushing the preparations. Aiui, something weight-lifty is a good idea, and I don't know how they'd go about obtaining 0G lifting equipment, but I could maybe see a couple of the powers working as a substitute?

Eating during an engine cycle is probably a bad idea, just because of how short it is. Someone would almost certainly puke when the acceleration changes. The most experienced people on this trip have dealt with 0G eating before, and I expect that experience probably transfers (how teachable the essentials are is another matter). But that they /can/ no what needs done doesn't mean /I/ know what realistic options they have. Unless someone sells novelty space food by the barrel, but I would expect that's unlikely. ... Isn't it?

I am totally lost on waste management, though. Could they modify a vacuum toilet with mere ferrokinesis and spare material? I kinda doubt. Space toilets that are used these days seem oriented around short trips with ready access to Earth, rather than month-or-more-long interplanetary voyages. The Apollo solution is ... suboptimal, as I'm sure any Apollo astronaut will confirm. And even if just giving up and going with diapers seemed like a good idea, could one reasonably expect to get a big enough supply delivered on relatively short notice?

And my solutions for climate control seem to amount to "bring a spare atmosphere" and "rotate the metal parts for more efficient radiating" and "some of those powers can help, right? Even though they should probably /all/ generate waste heat?". As you might guess, those aren't especially satisfying.

These seem like they'd go better as separate questions at one or more stackexchange, but organizing this appropriately is ... proving challenging, and it's Wednesday. Suggestions welcome (...requested?).
