How about resistance bands? They're cheap, lightweight, and extremely versatile. As long as the ship inhabitants can brace themselves against a surface, they can push or pull in 0g against the resistance of the resistance band. Attaching the other end of the band to a wall should be trivial with ferrokinesis. As long as the inhabitants bring a variety of bands with different resistances, I think that should solve all fitness issues.
