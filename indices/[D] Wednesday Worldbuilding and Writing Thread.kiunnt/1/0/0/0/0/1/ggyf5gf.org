This is sorta an area where mechanics run afoul of world building. 5e is dominated by the action economy. I'm sure a CR 30 dragon could stomp a standard party of 16th level adventurers (Klauth nearly killed my party of 5 and we were all level 15), but in a world where everyone is a 16th level adventurer, the idea of a four-person party is obsolete.

Any time the dragon attempts anything overtly dragon-y (barring the occasional exception), every character present will have viable combat options on their initiative count. If the dragon were to attack a village, they'll get swarmed.

That said, there are also evil characters or characters who will willingly align themselves to the dragon and rounding out combat in interesting ways is part of the DMs job. Whether these villainous high-level characters are also common enough to disrupt society or not is another conversation, but I think by and large, post-scarcity societies are within the realm of possibility.

Edit: I just sorta cleaned up my phrasing and sentence structure a little bit.
