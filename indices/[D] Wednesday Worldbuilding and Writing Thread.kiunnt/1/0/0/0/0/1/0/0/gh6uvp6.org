Ah yes, my days of having +20 to hit are long gone, I'm afraid. My friends prefer 5e for the tighter math and no amount of, "But seriously, look at all the customization," has won them over to another system yet. I'm hoping to pull them into a Pathfinder 2e campaign when our current game is finished, but we'll see.

I will say, going 3.~ is really interesting in terms of casters. With all the various books, there's bound to be some crazy combos and how those effect society is a fun/horrifying thought. I don't think a caster can metamagic a 9th level spell (I think meta-d spells use a higher spell slot in 3.5). This probably helps somewhat, but you're not wrong about a properly prepared caster with 9th level spells being a force of nature, especially if they happen to be an ancient dragon besides.

What's access to antimagic look like amongst the general populace? Contingency? I imagine these have to be much more common in these 16+ bands than the lower bands, but at the same time I can't help but think that the laws surrounding the general populace's magic use are much more robust.
