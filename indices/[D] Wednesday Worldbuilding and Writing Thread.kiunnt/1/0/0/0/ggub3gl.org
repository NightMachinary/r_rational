A single CR30 dragon against a level 16 adventuring party is a fun fight, not a hell of a challenge. Level 8 spells are a helluva drug. And /the median adult/ is level 16!

You don't have /guards/ at that point so much as you have paragons of the expression of power casually playing at being guards because the only thing more fun than taking the Band back out to go prune the Nidhogg-spawn is going one on one with a Dire Troll while your kids heckle your form.

(It's possibly I'm extremely silly.)
