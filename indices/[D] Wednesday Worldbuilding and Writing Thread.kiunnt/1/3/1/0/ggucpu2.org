Suppose pretty much all countries have at least a few hundred diviners who can use [[https://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/contactOtherPlane.htm][contact other plane]] at least daily. The entities answering these questions have limited foresight, out to about [[https://www.d20srd.org/srd/divine/divineRanksAndPowers.htm#portfolioSense][20 weeks at best]]. The diviners might ask questions like "Will we end up in a war with any other country within the next 20 weeks?". If yes, you can be assured the other country is going to know that as well. The questions are asked of various entities by various diviners to help ensure reliability.

So, now we'd ask obvious followup questions. Does the other country surrender? Does the other country get stronger, relative to us, between now and when the war starts? Do we win? The other side knows all of this as well.

One problem is that this takes surrender off the table pretty quickly. Any country which would surrender in a war has no reason to even fight you - they know they'll lose, they know they'll surrender, they might as well do that now before lots of people die and lots of important buildings and infrastructure are blown up. Those countries get gobbled up quickly and effectively get united/subjugated under the banner of some more aggressive and powerful country.

The countries that remain will be those which would never surrender, such as countries which make a precommitment to bleed their attacker dry as much as possible, to engage in a scorched earth strategy, and to unleash weapons of mass destruction if necessary.

Among these remaining countries and empires, one is likely to be the most powerful (or at least to perceive itself that way). This country may make a precommitment to attack any other country which would go to war with it in the future, or at least exercise a strategy of preemptive war whenever conditions for war in the present would be better than conditions for the war in the future. Of course, if its diviners 20 weeks in the future divine that the county will go to war, then it will go to war at that time, and then the diviners in the present will divine that and the country might go to war nearly a full year before the other country is able to build up. This may not necessarily even be limited to 40 weeks notice, and could possibly stretch endlessly into the indefinite future. If conditions in the present ever change such that this most powerful country would ever end up at war with any other country in the future, there's a good chance that that war will be declared and fought immediately.

Imagine if, in the real world, we had diviners who could tell us the future, and they said that we'd be in a nuclear war with China in 2050, and that they'd expand their nuclear arsenal 10-fold by then, with significant advances in guidance and delivery mechanisms along the way. Suppose China knows the same, and obviously begins working even faster to prepare for the war, and they have the ability to outpace our growth. As long as we're still the stronger side, we'd want to fight that war today, even if our cities get nuked, because waiting would just make things worse.
