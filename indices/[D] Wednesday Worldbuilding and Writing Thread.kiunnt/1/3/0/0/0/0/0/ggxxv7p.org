That is not an attainable scenario. If it's impossible to engage in routine commerce in magic items, /those items won't get created/. The evil overlord will have to make do with whatever they can personally create or get from slave labor. Theoretically they could get some from foolhardy artificers who think they can beat the overlord, but that doesn't make any more sense than it did for post-Skynet humans in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9658524/1/Branches-on-the-Tree-of-Time][Branches on the Tree of Time]], and that requires that the /knowledge/ of artificing is still passed on, which without a functional market for the skills it has no reason to be except by, again, the overlord themself. And if they're the teacher, they somehow need to tempt their students into approaching their level of power, so that they can make relevantly-powerful items, but not so much that they can successfully take down their mentor. It's just not stable.

(Mind control needs active attention and so can at best be a small constant multiplier for the overlord's personal output while they're making lower-quality goods. And a risky one, because they might make their save and need to be dangerous in order to be useful.)
