I am unfamiliar with xianxia, so I think I've made a bunch of incorrect assumptions about your magic system, I would love to learn more about it and correct my misunderstandings since this sounds really interesting. Is growth of the mind abstract growth (e.g. you become increasingly better at learning, your learning is like a skill in a video game levelling up?) and is that growth measurable? (E.g. IQ is used to measure intelligence, stat points in a video game or tabletop role-playing game measure strength, intelligence, etc. Is there some form of statistical measurement that is used to compare the level of acceptance of fear currently to level needed to become Fearless/fearful?) or is growth physical (e.g. your brain increases in size and in order to stop it outgrowing your skull and making your head pop you must prune things you find less useful or undesirable e.g. a fear(s) and as you continue to grow you continue adding useful skills to your brain capacity whilst decreasing space allocated to useless/detrimental things which increases the efficiency of used skull capacity and brain material, 100% being enlightenment or something along those lines?) also, is growth linear or is there the possibility of demotion? (E.g. what happens if someone fearless develops a fear? Do they move down a ranking?) does progress happen forwards (e.g. body and mind growth) but not backwards? (e.g. you neglect training and so growth of body atrophies or mind atrophies? Is it like a video game where once you learn a skill or level up you don't need to maintain it, it is a permanent upgrade?). Are beliefs used like a weapon? (E.g. you convince/gaslight someone about a strong belief they hold so that they mentally break and combat takes the form of debates? (If so is it like a combat scenario and they talk during it and the strength of their argument against their opponents argument determines the strength of their abilities or is consistency of beliefs only relevant to current internal belief system and can't be overturned/go against that system? Or is combat really abstract like Ace Attorney (or death parade (anime)) but the lawyers are supernatural and truth is decided by the majority therefore convincing someone of your belief makes it true e.g. claiming your client is innocent makes it true if the jury believes it and the crime is undone or history rewrites itself so that whoever you pin the blame on actually committed the crime and all their memories are rewritten by this belief of the majority so they believe they did too?) or are they used more abstractly like a sword made of your belief? And is that thing a singular belief(e.g. a sword of gravity, which you can mentally control the weight of and direction the gravity pulls by changing your belief about how gravity behaves or it's relationship with the sword?), belief about multiple things(a projectile magic which combines belief in air resistance and combustion to create a ball of fire which can have it's air resistance change which impacts the other belief e.g. greater air resistance = more air = more fuel for combustion so it grows? Or are the beliefs uncoupled e.g. just because air resistance increased/decreased the speed of projectile changes but not the scale of combustion? Or does that vary?) general belief (e.g. you believe the world is a certain way and your belief about the world manipulates it? If you like that kind of magic system I recommend a manhua called Amentia which has delusioners who bend/distort reality to fit their delusional view of the world or realise/materialise their imagination and awakeners who remove these distortions to set the world back to how it was originally, they both work to make the world “how it should be” and have conflicting opinions about what that is) or possibly a combination of the above?) Sorry about all the questions, I just really want to understand your magic system and the genre of novel it is within! :)
