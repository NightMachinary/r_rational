Giving a couple core ideas to cut through the questions. Soft magic no hard numbers. Growth is based off of semi traditional training. Spending time learning will incrementally increase the ability to learn with diminishing returns. No linear growth. You can both intentionally and unintentionally train the mind. Things that you use constantly would consequently grow with time. Coordination, intelligence, speaking ability, and others. These are slight increases over years of training/use. It is virtually impossible to become a super genius within even a century (immortality is common tho). Fearless/fearful and all the other ranks are signs of personal introspection and choice. They are a lifelong journey and commitment to achieve a state of being. Someone fearless is someone working to completely stop any growth of his fears. He can develop new fears and fight against them. Things can definitely atrophy with disuse. That's probably the primary way to defeat a fear. You list off a lot of ways to use beliefs and the first one was correct "you convince/gaslight someone about a strong belief they hold so that they mentally break" combat would still be pretty physical but attacking the ideology of your opponent would be another way to attack. Strictly mental effects and attacks no mind controlling reality.

I want to have the ultra high end of some abilities be somewhat external and cool but still directly related to the mind. Telepathy for the high end of social skills, mind scapes for imagination, precognition for intelligence (open to more suggestions for this), complete awareness within 100s of ft of surroundings for proprioception, and completely perfect recall for memory.

I'd love more suggestions for ranks and high end abilities. I don't intend this to be dbz or go style magic. This is more accompanying the two others. Trying to bombard the reader with cool shit.
