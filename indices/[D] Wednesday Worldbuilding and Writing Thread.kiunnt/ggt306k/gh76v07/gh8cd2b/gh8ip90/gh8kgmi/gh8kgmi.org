For precognition it would be speculation based on absurd amounts of knowledge and intelligence. No actual precognition lol. Accurate because of the intelligence of the predictor only. Processing enough data to determine the outcome of something. Predicting a coin flip because you can grasp every way it interacts with the air and it's trajectory type stuff. But on a larger scale. Varies with skill level.

The mind scapes would be personal mental abilities. If they were also a telepath then they could project the stimulus but the core of the ability is just that. Recreating the stimulus of the real world within your mind wholesale. The size, detail, and coherence of the mind scape would depend on the skill level. The use would probably be a ability to experience something without it happening to you. Training only in your mind type stuff.

If I do release it it would be published but I don't see that happening for a while (years) yet as I'm going to be working full time. Writing is just a hobby and it very possible that I'll get bored and abandon this. I have 4 half finished books the longest is 287 pages and the shortest is 15. I periodically come back to each of those main four and write new stuff all the time that I scrap.
