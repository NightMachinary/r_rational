I have a setting with a similar magic system.

It has certain similarities to xianxia. Many spiritual approaches to magic share concepts with Daoism and Buddhism. There's also focus on internal and other types of martial arts. However, there are plenty of practitioners whose perspective and practices more closely resembles the athleticism/martialism of the ancient Greeks, Persians, Vikings, Meso-Americans, etc.

The general idea is that the abilities of organisms, particularly humans, are limited more by time, effort, attitude, and creativity rather than more built-in biological factors. Magic permeates the entirety of existence, but most of its potential remains untapped. This has factored into how life has evolved from the start, creating many unique environmental resources and dangers.

Humans by far are the best species at consciously working with magic. In theory, magic can be used to enhance any physiological trait. In practice, it's not easy to do so. There are individuals who can toss around and rip grown men apart like they're made of straw, but that takes years of careful, rigorous study and excruciating, dangerous practice. The drawbacks you listed are similar.

Superhuman practitioners like that always suffer from symptoms of post-traumatic stress. Their religion is usually their main source of psychological reinforcement in the best of cases. In others, they may basically be living the life of an intelligent, anhedonic shrew, living for their own survival and the fleeting experience of consumption, often of drugs or darker fixations. Most practitioners engage with magic in moderation for these reasons.

Users will be confronted with their own physical and mental shortcomings constantly and they can choose to react in a variety of ways like what you laid out.
