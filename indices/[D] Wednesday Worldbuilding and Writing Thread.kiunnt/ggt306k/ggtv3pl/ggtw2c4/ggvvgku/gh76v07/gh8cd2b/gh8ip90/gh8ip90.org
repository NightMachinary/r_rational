Thanks, I think I understand a lot better now! :) For the intelligence precognition is it that the person sees the future or is it that they see the possible paths the future can take and they can steer it to which ever one they want so long as they have the capabilities to steer it in that way? An example of the former I think would perhaps be a crystal ball or the predictions like the world ending in 2012 (if that was the future that actually occurred. Actually, can the future deviate or is this a deterministic world in which even if you try to change the future it ends up the same?) whereas the latter might be the yokai called the Kudan (or atleast it's interpretation in a show called In;Spectre) where you see the future as paths and so long as you have the power to realise that future you can choose to guide reality down that path so long as someone with the same power doesn't try to intervene? Is the mindscape imagination ability, the ability to create an imaginary landscape or does it have other application? Is it a place that can be entered at will like the painting world from dark souls or is it something you can force people to enter like the reality marbles from fatestaynight or is it an dimension you can retreat into like the dream in trinity 7 or is it a purely mental feat that enables you to create a world to practise your other skills e.g. creating a memory palace like the one from Sherlock (atleast in the TV series version I think the library was a purely fictional location) or are mindscapes recreations or distortions/blends of real world locations e.g. the memory palaces created in memory competitions can often be multiple places/walked paths slapped together if you run out of space to store things, I think that's mentioned in a book called “moonwalking with Einstein” which is an interesting read if you're curious about impressive mental feats and feats of memory, or are the mindscapes much smaller scale e.g. instead of a sprawling memory palace it's more like a roman room (another memory technique)? I presume that the mindscape isn't for memory since you have perfect recall for memory, the examples about Visio-spatial memorisation is mostly to explain the differences between my guesses with examples :) is the mindscape something that is used like a death room that people can wander into or get invited into but can't get out of like in the Dungeons and Dragons curse of stradh campaign? By the way, are you planning on releasing this work or keeping it private? If you release/post it please let me know, I'd love to read it! :) Sorry about the barrage of questions and guesses again
