Setting up the talks in the first place would be terrifying. Imagine receiving a letter from an enemy nation, it could contain a request for peace or it could be an assassination plot where the contents of the letter highlight contradictions in the reader's beliefs. This turns letters into bombs which must be carefully disarmed, perhaps by preparing counter arguments to defuse predicted contradictions (which can only be discovered by trying to contradict your beliefs which is akin to suicide) and you might have “poison testers” which instead of eating food to see if it's poisoned before their employer tries it, read their letters to see if it's an attack or not, courtiers become powerful military units and a dangerous job to do. Also, considering this is about ideas as opposed to specifically words you could use paintings, poems, songs, etc. To equally as lethal effect, it also would have an affect on the opinions surrounding censorship and the way information is consumed. Certain pieces of artwork could be used like Trojan horses, you create something which seems normal or conformative and then you wait for it to spread amongst the populace and then “activate” it by revealing its true meaning and weaponising the idea which has been reinforced since they first saw it, like a virus it hijacks their belief system and makes it no longer self-consistent e.g. imagine if someone's entire belief was based around love and they believed the love preached by the song “you're beautiful” by James blunt to be something that reinforced their belief/was the same as their belief and so it becomes part of what grows that belief, then the artist reveals it is a song about stalking and is not true love, that would poison that belief, like a disease which causes the immune system of the body to attack itself, the belief would attack itself?
