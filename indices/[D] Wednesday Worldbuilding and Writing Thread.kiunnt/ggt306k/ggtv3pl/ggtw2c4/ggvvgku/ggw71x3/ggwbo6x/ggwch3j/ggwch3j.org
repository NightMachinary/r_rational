I don't envision the logic bomb/killing phrase working like this at all. Makes more sense that this would be a highly individual thing. In the sense that any culture would have to find a belief system without a logic bomb. A particular way of thinking without obvious flaws. Or they wouldn't exist.

Seems more likely that it would be a mind game played long term between wizards. I.e. make wizard A believe x through extremely precise gaslighting. Then wait for that idea to have power/taken root in his head. Then disprove it for a stunning blow in combat. 99% of these things wouldn't be lethal simply because every wizard knows how to deal with these exact logic bombs. It would be big character defining defects that get shoved in his face that would kill him.

The cultural aspect is necessarily somewhat stable and not self destructive imo. At least in the long term.
