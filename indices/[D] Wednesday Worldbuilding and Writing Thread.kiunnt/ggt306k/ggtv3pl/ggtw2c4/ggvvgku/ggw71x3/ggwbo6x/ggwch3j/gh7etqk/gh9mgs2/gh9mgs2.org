I thought it was only the Wizards which were vulnerable to Idea-based assassination. So, as long as the King is not a Wizard, he can safely read any letter he likes. (Well. Once the letter has been checked for contact poisons. ...you know, maybe having some clerk read the letter to the King would be safer. When there are no Wizards within earshot).

  Certain pieces of artwork could be used like Trojan horses, you create something which seems normal or conformative and then you wait for it to spread amongst the populace and then “activate” it by revealing its true meaning and weaponising the idea which has been reinforced since they first saw it

This reminds me of the /Spine of the Cosmos/ from Starslip Crisis. An artwork that causes anyone who sees it to become the slave of the owner...

.../but/ only if the viewer properly understands the context of the artwork. So the villain who owns it then also has to spend several minutes explaining the context...
