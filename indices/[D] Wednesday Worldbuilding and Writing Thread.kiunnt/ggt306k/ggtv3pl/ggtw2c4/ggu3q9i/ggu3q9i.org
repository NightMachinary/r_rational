I honestly didn't even consider how genetics would interact with magical body improvement. Bloodline abilities and the rabbit hole of world building that entails. Don't even know if I want to go down that road honestly. The main theme of the book would be the common pitfalls in the path of every human and contrasting the different paths that arise. Faith vs nihilism. How all humans deal with the same problems and the different people that come out of the crucible.

It would fuck up the theme if they were all different from the start.
