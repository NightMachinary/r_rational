The ability to logic-bomb humans is an interesting one. Of course, even computer programs stall at worst when forced into logical inconsistencies or loops. The mental equivalent of stalling would be a deep trance state which would likely leave someone vulnerable to a follow-up lethal method. Human minds are good at not being stalled by their own irrationality.

Many modern computer programs are also good at figuring out a roundabout way to continue functioning in the face of unique situations, cognitive dissonance can cause stress, but they keep ticking. However, in both cases, while they remain active, that doesn't mean their thoughts and actions aren't perverse and indirectly destructive when compared with what they're actually supposed to do.
