  This has factored into how life has evolved from the start, creating many unique environmental resources and dangers

I wanted to do something like that but it doesn't work out with the setting I want (if the body/mind grows with use and this effects genes then the effect on evolution gets into speculative sci-fi and I want to write fantasy lol) so I relied on the many worlds/tiered worlds trope. That way I can insert a particular earth culture to contrast with the result of the cultural effect that the magic has on the setting.

Personally I'm super interested in mental abnormalities that grow with time. Stuttering that gets ever worse leading to an inability to speak. One emotion being dwelled upon so often that it consumes them. Pointing out logical inconsistency being a LETHAL weapon. Seems ripe with so many cool af ideas.
