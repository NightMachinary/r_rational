You probably need to list out what the actual powers are.

iirc special space food is just needed because it's lightweight, dense, and stores well. If you have plenty of mass budget you can just bring normal preserved foods as long as it's not liquidy or crumbly. Water you just drink from a bag.

Likewise if the mass budget and delta-v are less of an issue, you can generate some constant gravity just by rotating the craft using the RCS.

For waste management, just do it in bags and then push the bags away using powers. In a real interplanetary spacecraft it'd be unacceptably wasteful, and on the space station it'd pollute the orbit. The complicated vacum designs are mostly needed to keep things hygienic, and a ragtag bunch of superpowered adventurers might settle on simply living in disgusting conditions for the trip and taking the hit to PR and infection risk that an organization wouldn't.

For climate control, it's probably done manually with powers. Heating is simple, and cooling can be done by compressing and expanding gases to concentrate heat, and then using ferrokinesis to unfold, move around, and fold large radiators.
