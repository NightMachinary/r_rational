1-As containment fails, which plane does the energy start to bleed into? Interesting if it depends on the planar background of the persons who pump in the initial energy, or if there's a pattern like "demonic energy seeks the terran plane, but heavenly energy goes equally to all five planes."

2-There's a giant comet-monster that eats magical planets and it's coming into our neighborhood. We should shut off magic until its orbit has taken it safely out of range.

Unfortunately, the comet-monster grants wishes to magic-wielding individuals, as bait. So letting everyone know /why/ magic is outlawed is terribly dangerous - every desperate person will try to trigger a wish, and help the comet-monster home in.

3-Create a race of slimes that eat magic and anyone who uses it, but dependent on the radiations of a scarce substance (mithril, orichalcum) in order to convert their stored magic and reproduce. Above-ground supplies of the reagent are limited. The conspiracy can mine and bring up more Slime Reproductive Reagent as needed to keep the slimes going, until telescopes show the Comet Doom Monster is gone.
