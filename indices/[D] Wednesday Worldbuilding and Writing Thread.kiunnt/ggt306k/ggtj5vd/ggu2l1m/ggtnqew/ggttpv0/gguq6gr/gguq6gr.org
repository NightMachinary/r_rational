You know you'll be exploring a new world. So, take exploration boons.

Analyze/identify/appraisal, since you'll see so many new things. Eidetic memory, since you'll be learning so many things for the first time.

If wilderness is possible, then toxin resistance, endurance, tracking, hunting.

If civilization seems likely, then rapid language learning, "good first impression", etiquette bonus, negotiation bonus.

Almanac: stare at something and you start hearing the voice of a bored expert, describing the object/place/person encyclopedia-style to a class of young kids. It appears to be somehow an actual recording of an alien classroom. Not advised to stare at yourself in the mirror once you have this boon.

You Are Here: whenever you say or think "I'm lost," a map appears in your head. The map is filled in wherever you've been, and anywhere that's "common knowledge" for your current social group. This has weird effects when you get promoted, or adopted...

Cooking for Dummies: stare at potential food while holding a cooking tool, and a recipe pops up. If you're holding a skewer while looking at a live crocodile, you get a recipe for crocodile meat on a stick. With helpful advice on skinning the crocodile, but no advice on how to kill it...

Just Needed Tuning Up: any object you use behaves as if it's been recently cleaned and serviced, as long as the maintenance is something ordinary rather than supernatural or exotic. Doesn't fix a broken knife, but you can cut with a rusty knife like it's sharp, open a stuck door like it's been oiled, or read an ancient book like it's been cleaned of mold and dirt.
