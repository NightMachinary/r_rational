Learning to communicate takes a ton of time! He's not optimizing for what's useful after he gets back home, he's optimizing for /getting back home sooner/, and that means not spending 3 months learning to speak/understand the language fluently and then another 3 months learning how to read it well enough to start putting together a get-home plan.

And he's pretty obsessive about communication.

But it's an interesting point that he definitely did specialize pretty hard for his first five boons, and anyone he discusses the matter with might point that out, so it's worth having this discussion.
