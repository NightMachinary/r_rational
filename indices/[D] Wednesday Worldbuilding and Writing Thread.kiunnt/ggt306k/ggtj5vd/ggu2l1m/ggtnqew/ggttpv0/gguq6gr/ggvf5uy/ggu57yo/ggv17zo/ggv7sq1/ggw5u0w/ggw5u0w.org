If he's optimizing for getting home sooner, and for things that will help him in this as he gets repeatedly isekai'd, I think things like reducing or removing the need for sleep would be useful. Buying yourself more productive time is a nice discount on any kind of return-home project.

Maybe also a reverse truth-sense: people are supernaturally more likely to believe he's telling the truth when he's telling the truth? Makes it easier to get help, and get over initial incredulity if isekai isn't super normal in most worlds.
