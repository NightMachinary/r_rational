Carcosa-like: the environ is an enormous decaying library. There's a village of humans that grow mushrooms and funguses and hunt animals that dwell in the stacks, and in every direction the (as far as the villagers know) infinite ever-changing library rolls on, by turns pristine and decrepit, inhabited by creatures that grow more arcane or horrifying or both as you travel away from the village. The books are mostly book-shaped, but some take other forms; they are, as far as anyone can tell, not ordered, but a random amalgamation of every book ever written in any possible universe. By volume, 80% terribly-written smut.
