Oneshot crack idea in a similar vein to 17776 (which I need to actually read, I started it briefly the other week on mobile and stopped once I got to a video because I didn't have headphones on me) of car racing with unrestrained use of technology. Since an augmented DeLorean would "make it to the finish line" faster than any other traditional form of locomotion, a race where timetravel becomes the core tool utilized to end up on the finish line immediately after the race "starts" could be a unique story.

The fact it'd devolve into an absurd "Wacky Races but make it sci-fi" scenario is probably a selling point. And the idea that any way to tell the story in-universe would have to be by someone observing the actions "sequentially" rather than "chronologically", and temporarily handing godlike powers/comprehension to a pair of race commentators who do the storytelling aspect fits the race theme, and I also find "unimaginable power turned to minor entertainment" (like a less horrific version of "entity grants someone a monkey's paw wish") to be a fun trope.

No idea how it'd be rational, it'd probably read like a series of ass-pulls or require half the writing dedicated to set-up before the race starts. But time-travel and racing munchkinry as the focus of the story is rational-adjacent at least.
