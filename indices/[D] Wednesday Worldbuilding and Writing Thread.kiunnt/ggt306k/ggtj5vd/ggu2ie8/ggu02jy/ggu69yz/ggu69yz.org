Is it possible to decline an ascension? Is there contact between the different realms?

If one can't decline to ascend, and there is no contact between the realms, then the whole thing is kind of doomed, and very few people will be motivated to ascend. When you boil it down, what people will work and fight for is a *comparative advantage* over their *peers*, not for an arbitrary measure of rank. If being level 5 or 10 makes you a lord of your world, but being level 6 and 11 makes you a peon again, why the hell would the average person want that?

So that leaves you with only the people who are unusually ambitious, aggressive and/or otherwise emotionally/motivationally privileged to ascend to the next world. Now, imagine a world where this subset of people continuously remove themselves from society. Whether they possess a quality that is socially cultivated or genetic, it seems inevitable that the supply in the first would will decrease. This is especially true if reaching level 6 is relatively trivial for motivated individuals, and thus they don't really have time to procreate by the time they leave.

If your worldbuilding reflects that it would be interesting. An idea is that the first world experiences an accelerating decline due to "brain drain". Another is that people are socially incentivized to have children with level 5 people.

Maybe I missed it, but what happens if you have a child in bands â‰¥2? Is it born at level 0, and stay in whatever band it's in, or is it born at the minimum of whatever band it's in? If it's the former, the child will be at a severe disadvantage, like a noob starting in a high level zone, and the latter, then I can see a wide appeal to ascending, as you now can have demigod children and actually build a sustainable society in higher worlds.
