It is stable. Think of the board game Monopoly. The guy with the most resources tends to get stronger and stronger. The stable equilibrium is "evil lich overlord hordes all the most powerful magic items and artifacts in the world and uses them to rule with an iron fist." If you think capitalism isn't great, just imagine what it would be like when people can make items that let you read minds, control minds, see the future, scry on people, fly, teleport, plane shift, shoot fireballs, become immune to fire, acid, cold, lightning, death effects, divination, etc.
