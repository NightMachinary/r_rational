Interesting. Why would you expect that, rather than cold war situations? I'd expect heavily-precogged wars to look more like the ones in Doc Future - they describe Golden Valkyrie's war with the Wanderer as having almost no battles, lots of stalking horses and plot/counterplot since a battle wouldn't happen unless both sides thought it was going to end well for them.
