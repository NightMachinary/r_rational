  Evil wizards and liches rampage across the world raiding magic shops and ambushing anyone carrying useful magic items.

Separately, this doesn't seem plausible to me. If that was likely, there wouldn't /be/ magic shops. All magic items would be commissioned, or possibly fashioned in secret (under magical and nonmagical concealment) and sold at auction without the item being physically present until the winning bid was verified.
