  Is it possible to decline an ascension? Is there contact between the different realms?

You can try. This will in most cases be highly hazardous to the health and sanity of everyone around you, however, so they will probably insist. At swordpoint. And in the cases where you /can/ refuse indefinitely without risk to your surroundings, you can only do it by not /using/ your power. (This is easiest for a wizard, who just has to stop casting their highest couple levels of spells; this creates the 'absent-minded ancient wizard' archetype for free, since they'll be /capable/ of casting powerful magic but mostly forget the details due to lack of practice. Contrast with a legendary soldier, who can't really stop being preternaturally buff and skilled and so doesn't get a choice. IIRC they have a tradition of sending knights off to fight dragons, which will generally either get them killed or send/ascend them on their way.)

Contact is limited but I'm not sure how much; previous iterations said that no matter could travel backwards except dragons and fey, but that got walked back and I'm not sure where the boundaries are as it stands.
