  I'm hoping to pull them into a Pathfinder 2e campaign when our current game is finished, but we'll see.

Don't. Pathfinder 2E has no redeeming qualities. Seriously, it's all the worst parts of Pathfinder (complexity) and 4th Ed. (inflexibility). It looks simpler than PF 1E at first glance but this is untrue; just tracking the bookkeeping of the status effects is exhausting. 5th Ed. is better in every respect. Seriously.
