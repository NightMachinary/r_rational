Ha. Why would the heroes stop and listen? No, the villain had to go out of his way to create technology that allowed him to project his voice directly into the hero's spaceships even after the heroes have turned off their radios (it was a sci-fi story)... there was a hilarious back-and-forth between the villain trying to use the Spine of the Cosmos on the heroes while the heroes desperately try to prevent him from using the Spine on them.
