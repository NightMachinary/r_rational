  People need emotions to feel human

But what is humanity tho?

I've haven't put a lot of thought into an old culture just because it would mostly be for the purpose of having a familiar setting. The aesthetic would be earth like but the bones of any culture in the world would be constructed by the magics effect on the people.

Bigger stratification between levels of power. More isolated because exposure to different ideas can be legit harmful. Disdaining of any outward emotional display because it's evidence of a lack of control. Some lack of fear so a wildly eclectic society without fear of social ostracizing.

The biggest one would be the incredibly sectarian (arising from the need to form a self consistent ideology and how that essentially works like a cult if you spread it) and internally hierarchical nation states. 1000s instead of 100s of countries. Leading to constant power struggles.
