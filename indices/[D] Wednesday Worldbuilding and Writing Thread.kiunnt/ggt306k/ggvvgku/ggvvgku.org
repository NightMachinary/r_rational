Hmmm... your /culture/ would have a big influence on your choices there. For example; consider the stereotypical British minor nobility. Come what may, he keeps a stiff upper lip, and refrains from falling into emotion. So, people from that culture would - more often than not - fall on the 'emotionless' side of things. (One who fell into the "accept-my-emotions" side would be a bit of a rebel).

But that implies that there may be some known psychological weaknesses of entire /cultures/. And cultures can be recognised in all sorts of ways. So, it may (for example) be very well-known to the people of Valley X that, if you spot a wizard in a top hat and a monocle, you can kill him by quickly yelling "People need emotions to feel human!" (or something).
