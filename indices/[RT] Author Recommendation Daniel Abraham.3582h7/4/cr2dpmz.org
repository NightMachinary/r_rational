I'll add that to my list. Thank you.

  1 : This was something I found a bit off about HPMoR. All the "plotting" and such is fun and all, but realistically, if an opponent knows what's going on and you don't, you're going to lose every time. This made Harry's actual victory kind of BS, even though it was technically foreshadowed. In any real contest, usually both sides know exactly what is going on. If you're depending on "predicting which level an opponent is playing at," you're doing it wrong.

Well, in my experience often a key part of a contest is managing to mislead the other side just a tiny bit about some key detail. Knowing just that one thing, and more importantly knowing that your opponent does not, tends to be a deciding factor more often than not.
