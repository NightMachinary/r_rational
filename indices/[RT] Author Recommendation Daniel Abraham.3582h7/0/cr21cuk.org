  Something interesting that I found with the Long Price Quartet was that frequently I would have absolutely no idea what was going to happen, and then in retrospect, it felt like what happened was the only possible outcome.

This. This was one of the most satisfying and engaging parts of reading his stories. Another good thing that he does is the exact opposite: I can see a very obvious conflict coming that will end badly for everyone involved...and it does. The characters don't have as much knowledge as the reader, and their failure to act on things that they can't possibly know is like a train wreck in slow motion.
