That's a pretty high recommendation! It should go on my queue... after the cognition book I'm reading, and /Excession/, and my textbooks...

  All the "plotting" and such is fun and all, but realistically, if an opponent knows what's going on and you don't, you're going to lose every time. This made Harry's actual victory kind of BS, even though it was technically foreshadowed. In any real contest, usually both sides know exactly what is going on. If you're depending on "predicting which level an opponent is playing at," you're doing it wrong.
