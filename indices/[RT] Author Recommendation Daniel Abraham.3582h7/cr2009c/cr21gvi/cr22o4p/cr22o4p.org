I found what I've read of the /Culture/ series pretty average. Specifically /Consider Phlebas/, /The Player of Games/, /Use of Weapons/. All I can remember of them is that they were decent for light entertainment but otherwise unremarkable. In my opinion pretty much any of Abraham's work is much better.
