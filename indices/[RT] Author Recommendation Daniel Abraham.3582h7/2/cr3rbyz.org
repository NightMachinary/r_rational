I'd second The Dagger and the Coin and The Long Prince Quartet. For The Expanse, YMMV; in large part depending on if you can stomach the main characters rather naive approach to politics and large scale recklessness, and the universe conspiring so that nothing really bad happens when he takes stupid chances.

Or at least that's what I remember from a couple years ago when I read the first two books.
