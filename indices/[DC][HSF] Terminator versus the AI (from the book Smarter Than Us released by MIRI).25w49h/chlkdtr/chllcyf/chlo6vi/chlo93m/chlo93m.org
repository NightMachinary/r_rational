  Ultimately, Skynet has to preserve human life. (meaning; enough of a population, with a great enough concentration, with enough natural resources and so on for long-term stability)

  Skynet can heavily reduce the human population, and try to subjugate it as much as possible, but can't outright wipe it out. Presumably, it also can't do a Matrix type lotus eater thing, or chemically lobotomize/enslave them, or whatever.

This seems like a bizarrely well-designed UFAI.
