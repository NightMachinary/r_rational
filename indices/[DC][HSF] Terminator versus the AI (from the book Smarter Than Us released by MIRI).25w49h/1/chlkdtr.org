Of course, this makes no sense within the established Terminator rules for time travel, since if the AI is already super-intelligent when the Terminator goes after it then it should have already won, thus never spawning a timeline where the Terminator gets sent back. In the movies and most of the existing canon, the Terminators get sent back as a last-ditch effort while Skynet is in the middle of losing the war.
