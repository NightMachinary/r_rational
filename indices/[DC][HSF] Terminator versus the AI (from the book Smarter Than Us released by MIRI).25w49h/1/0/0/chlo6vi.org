I think the usual fan-wonk explanation I hear about that is that Skynet has to work around restrictions of its utility function. Ultimately, Skynet has to preserve human life. (meaning; enough of a population, with a great enough concentration, with enough natural resources and so on for long-term stability)

Skynet can /heavily reduce/ the human population, and try to subjugate it as much as possible, but can't outright wipe it out. Presumably, it also can't do a Matrix type lotus eater thing, or chemically lobotomize/enslave them, or whatever.

So essentially, the machines have a huge handicap in that they can never completely win, and the humans have a helluva lot of ways they can subtly drain the machine's resources and fight back over time.
