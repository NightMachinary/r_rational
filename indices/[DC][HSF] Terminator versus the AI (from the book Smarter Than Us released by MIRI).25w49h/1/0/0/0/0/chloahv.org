I see it more as the asshole-type genie.

"Ohhh, you want me to preserve the human race, eh? Well, you only need about 5000 people for /that./ Everyone else will just eat up the natural resources all that much faster, anyway."

Plus I think it actually /is/ canon in the actual Terminator verse that Skynet's prime directive is self-preservation. So if preserving humanity is only a secondary or tertiary objective, Skynet would prioritize making that threat as small as possible, without actually eliminating it.
