You can buy the whole book, which is otherwise non-fiction, here:

[[http://intelligence.org/smarter-than-us/]]

If you buy it as a PayPal package, it's “pay-what-you-want” with a suggested price of $5.00 and a minimum price is $0.25. If you're interested in a concise case (about 50 pages) for Friendly AI research and MIRI's approach towards AGI, you should probably buy this book.

Okay, if anyone's wondering, I asked the author permission to share this story and he gave me that permission (and I promised to encourage people to buy this book... so go buy this book!).
