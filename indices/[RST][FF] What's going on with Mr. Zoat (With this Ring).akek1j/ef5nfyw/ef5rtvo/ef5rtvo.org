I'm having a little trouble following this, but it seems like you're saying it's unfair to demand that everyone get everyone else's pronouns right on the first try. However, I don't think anyone is actually demanding that. All you have to do is /not/ deliberately misgender people once you know how they prefer to be addressed.

Though it /would/ be convenient if there was some standardized thing everyone could wear to indicate their pronouns. I read a book once where everyone wore colored sashes that indicated how they wanted to be addressed. Seemed like a good system.
