What is so offensive about the "attack helicopter" meme?

The way I interpret it, it's like this. Look, if I could be in a different body, I'd choose to have the cloned body of an 18 year old female beauty pageant winner. Because I know I would receive the best treatment possible by society, and also I know I'd enjoy just looking at my own reflection.

​

But reality is not that way. I can't have that, the laws of nature don't allow this without vastly more advanced technology than our civilization currently has.

​

Similarly, I can see the appeal of having a fully armed and armored attack helicopter as a body.

​

So I can't reasonably demand that society treat me, both in gender pronouns and what they put on my driver's license and what they say behind my back, as the 18 year old beauty queen. Or treat me as if I'm actually an attack helicopter.

​

Since we can't actually turn men into women or vice versa with anything like a reasonable or reliable success, that's kind of how it is today. Most transgender people are sort of asking for special favors to be treated as something they are not.
