You would, I think, be in for a very unpleasant surprise.

But that's really quite beside the point. Trans people aren't asking to be treated as something they're not. Quite the opposite, really. They're asking to be treated as what they are.

As for the attack helicopter meme, it's deliberately intended to poke fun at somebody's identity. That's pretty much always offensive.
