  It's also the only SW so-called-spoiler I believe he was ever punished for posting.

From what I've heard, there was also a mention of the Millennium Falcon being in Episode VII. Neither of which I would really categorize as a "spoiler."

So, yes, I agree: I sympathize with him regarding the SB ban.

Not so much with this one, though. Had he come back, apologized, and diplomatically said he was leaving as he disagreed with the moderation policies, I could see myself maybe following him to QQ to continue reading along.

Getting himself deliberately perma-banned, by repeating a meme that he has already had explained to him exactly how and why it's offensive to trans people, solely to live up to being a "dedicated rage-quitter," though... Yeah. That's the kind of tantrum that only gets worse if you indulge it. Good riddance.
