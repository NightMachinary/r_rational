Yeah, now that you mention it, I remember that this kind of automatically-generated HTML/CSS is usually... sub-optimal, to put it charitably. Upon reflection, I agree that you'd probably get a better result from taking the BBCode and running it through a parser designed to do a lightweight conversion.

There are a couple of open-source BBCode editors that might make a good starting point for a parser, though.
