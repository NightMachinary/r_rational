There's a section of Sufficient Velocity rules (Rule 2) which prohibits misgendering. [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/the-rules-and-procedures-of-sufficient-velocity.40100/#post-8912695][Here:]]

#+begin_quote
  We expect, for example, that you will gender everyone appropriately. We expect that you will not refer to anyone by what might reasonably be considered a slur: don't use “retard”, “japs”, or “traps”, for example.

Zoat fell afoul of that (and claims that he didn't know it existed). As part of /With this Ring/, a character was turned from a man into a woman by some kind of magic, and was misgendered in the narration ... which might have been fine, but Zoat then said (non-story) that he defined people by what genitals and secondary sex characteristics they had. He also used the "sexually identify as an attack helicopter" meme. [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/11965536/][You can read the staff response here.]] Especially:

  So how does this relate to 'attack helicopters' or 'trap'?

  Put at its most bald, they're both deeply insulting ways to refer to transgender people.

  The attack helicopter phrasing casts something very real and important as both trivial and absurd; the best case is that it is a mindless 'joke', a repetition of malicious mockery by someone who didn't realize that was what it is.

  But even in that best case, it serves to drive out people who have done nothing wrong and who should expect and deserve to be treated with respect and dignity. And we don't want people being driven out, so it's covered by Rule 2.

Zoat wasn't banned for this, he was suspended for a day. When he came back, he proceeded to do the exact same thing that got him suspended in the first place, which got him indefinitely suspended and the thread locked.

*I would appreciate if people don't attempt to relitigate this here.*
