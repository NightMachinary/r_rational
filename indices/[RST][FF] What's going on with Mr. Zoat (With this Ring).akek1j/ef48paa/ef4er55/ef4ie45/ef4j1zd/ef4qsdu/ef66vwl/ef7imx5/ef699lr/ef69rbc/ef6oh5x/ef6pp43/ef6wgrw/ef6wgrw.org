I think you substantially underestimate my level of activity. I also think you are wrong about how easy it is to NOT get banned from a site, especially SV. The SV mods rule with a pretty light hand, all things considered. You have to be be a jerk order to get points at all, and you need to be flagrant in order to get even a temporary ban.
