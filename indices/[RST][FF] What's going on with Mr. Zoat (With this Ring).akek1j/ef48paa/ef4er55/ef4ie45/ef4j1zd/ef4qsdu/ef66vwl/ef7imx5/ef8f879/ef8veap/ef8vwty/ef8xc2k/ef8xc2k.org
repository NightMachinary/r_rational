Zoat's high activity level means nothing beyond the obvious and inane point that somebody who never posts will never make an infraction. You might as well say that people who live longer have more days in which to get sick, while humans who die in infancy get sick only a handful of times, or even once. It doesn't matter when we're discussing whether the dude who got two heart attacks in the past year is going to get a third.

  Eaglejarl was never banned. Zoat was banned twice. I think the difference in online activity level alone is sufficient to explain that.

Eaglejarl can be civil, follow the rules, and take his lumps when he and the mods don't agree on whether he made a violation. Zoat...acts like a child when he get an infraction.

Eaglejarl could be ten times as active as Zoat, and I'd still bet that Zoat gets suspended again before Eaglejarl does.
