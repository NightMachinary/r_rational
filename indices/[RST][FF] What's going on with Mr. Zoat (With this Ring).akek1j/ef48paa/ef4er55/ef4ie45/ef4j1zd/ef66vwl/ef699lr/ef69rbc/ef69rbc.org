I don't think my, or your, online presence is comparable to Zoat's "1000-words chapter every day" style of activity.

And the more active you are, the more likely your activity to attract attention, including negative attention.

As a general rule, lurkers hardly ever get banned.

I also think your perception of SV rules is too optimistic. Or, at least, the way the rules are enforced in practice.

SV has a long history of questionable, to put it mildly, decisions by their moderators. In particular, SV's rule enforcement is not even-handed or consistent in the slightest.
