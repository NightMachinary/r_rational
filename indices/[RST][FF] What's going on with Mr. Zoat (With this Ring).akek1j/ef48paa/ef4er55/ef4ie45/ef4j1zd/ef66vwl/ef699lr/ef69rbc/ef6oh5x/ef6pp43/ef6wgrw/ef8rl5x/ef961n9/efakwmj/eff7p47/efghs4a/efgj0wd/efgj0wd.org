I don't actually make the infractions or the rules, and I haven't looked at all of them, but none of them were appealed, so I wouldn't have seen any of those. I did read the thread occasionally, and I saw the religion argument. People were told to stop many times and didn't.

My job on staff is literally too be a person people appeal allegedly bad decisions to. I've overturned incorrect mod actions many times. I'm not saying they are perfect, but they are rarely malicious or way outside the well established rules.

If you link me to something you think is too far, I'd be happy to take a look and try to explain it to you.
