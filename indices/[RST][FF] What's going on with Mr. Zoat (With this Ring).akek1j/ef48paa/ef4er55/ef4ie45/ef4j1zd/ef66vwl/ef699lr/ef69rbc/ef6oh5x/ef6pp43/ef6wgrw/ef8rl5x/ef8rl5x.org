Not even slightly true. Things that have gotten temp bans /just in WTR's thread/:

- asserting that, given sufficiently contrived circumstances, atrocities can be morally required

- asserting that it may have been a mistake to concede the "obvious common sense" exceptions to free speech like exhortations to violence

- refusing to agree to disagree about religion being evil

None of these involved being a jerk, let alone a flagrant jerk.
