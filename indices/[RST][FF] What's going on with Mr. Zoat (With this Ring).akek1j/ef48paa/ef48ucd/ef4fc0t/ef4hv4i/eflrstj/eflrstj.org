Turns out it wasn't anything to do with that. I'm not sure why they banned me, I'm unbanned now, but I do know that they used a rule in the ToS where they get to decide what is considered "abuse of the service" to do it. While they admit this code wasn't abusive, they're unwilling to discuss what would be considered abusive, or let me run any archiving scripts at all.
