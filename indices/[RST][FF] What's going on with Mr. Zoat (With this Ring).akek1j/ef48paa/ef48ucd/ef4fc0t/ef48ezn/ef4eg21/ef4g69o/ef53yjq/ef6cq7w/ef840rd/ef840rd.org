  From what I've heard, there was also a mention of the Millennium Falcon being in Episode VII. Neither of which I would really categorize as a "spoiler."

I'm pretty sure that was another poster who got suspended for the Millennium Falcon "spoiler".

I think I got a warning a week or two before that on a different thread when I posted a "spoiler" link to [[https://amultiverse.com/tag/sarlacc/][a comic strip]].
