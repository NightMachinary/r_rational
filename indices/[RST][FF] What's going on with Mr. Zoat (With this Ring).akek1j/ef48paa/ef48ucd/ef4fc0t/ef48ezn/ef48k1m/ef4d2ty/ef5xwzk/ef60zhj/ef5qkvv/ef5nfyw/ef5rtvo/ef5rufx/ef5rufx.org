  The gendering thing will never really work unless people wear some sort of identification,

Unless you have the memory of a goldfish, yes, it can. Nobody expects you to instantly know someone's pronouns just from looking at them, and nobody will get mad if you get them wrong before they've told you their actual pronouns, but after they tell you what their pronouns are, THEN you have to make an effort to use them. To do otherwise is transphobic.
