He did explain it, later. The issue is, he doesn't believe they are that NOW. He doesn't believe trans women are women/trans men are men/etc., and won't believe they are until a future technology capable of completely transforming them into being biologically female comes along. He doesn't believe gender is seperate from sex, hence him calling that man who was transformed into a woman against his will a woman and refusing to call him a man despite his requests.

And to be clear, if you don't think trans women are women, and that gender is seperate from sex, you are transphobic.
