For certain definitions of "nobody" which exclude people portrayed in unverified anecdotes. Although this feels like that time I said "not 0, but epsilon", somehow.

Unverified anecdotally, people have gotten my gender wrong several times, and it didn't bother me, fwiw. But I don't have a strong gender identity, either.
