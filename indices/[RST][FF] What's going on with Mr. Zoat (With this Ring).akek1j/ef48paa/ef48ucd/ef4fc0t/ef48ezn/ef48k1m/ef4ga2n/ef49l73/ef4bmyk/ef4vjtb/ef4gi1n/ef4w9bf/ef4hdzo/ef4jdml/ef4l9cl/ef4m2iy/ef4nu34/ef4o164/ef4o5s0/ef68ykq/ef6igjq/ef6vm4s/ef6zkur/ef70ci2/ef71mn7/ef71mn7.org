I'm aware that there's no one way people dress. There are, however, a lot of external signals people can use to imply how they prefer to be addressed, and when in doubt you can always just ask.

And since we're on [[/r/rational][r/rational]], I feel compelled to point out that you don't actually /know/ you can always tell someone's karyotype. If you wrongly clocked an XX person as XY you wouldn't know unless you specifically asked "are you XY", and if you met a passing trans person you would just assume they were cis.

  And I'm saying that when they're claiming they're a man or woman, in common parlance they're saying they have different biology. That's what the word means to most people, so whatever they intend that's the message they're sending.

I think it would require a tremendous degree of willful ignorance to interact with a trans person for any period of time and still think that's what they're saying. Trans people are very clear on the topic of what being trans is. There are also extensive, easy-to-access resources online that explain it in straightforward terms. Anyone who actually has this misconception could clear it up with a 3-sentence conversation with a trans person or 10 seconds of Googling.

  Because male is literally a social concept which, at this point, means "has a penis"

If that were really how humans interacted then we /would/ pull each other's pants down for a junk check whenever we met. In practice, most people have zero interaction with most other people's genitals. The social concept of "a man" is many-faceted and nearly all of those facets are unrelated to penises. Meanwhile, the gender identity of "a man" is /usually/ accompanied by a penis, but there's nothing that biologically /requires/ it to be accompanied by a penis.

I maintain that it's hugely presumptuous to "um, actually" another person's subjective experience of their gender identity, and that it's transphobic to openly and insistently misgender trans people.
