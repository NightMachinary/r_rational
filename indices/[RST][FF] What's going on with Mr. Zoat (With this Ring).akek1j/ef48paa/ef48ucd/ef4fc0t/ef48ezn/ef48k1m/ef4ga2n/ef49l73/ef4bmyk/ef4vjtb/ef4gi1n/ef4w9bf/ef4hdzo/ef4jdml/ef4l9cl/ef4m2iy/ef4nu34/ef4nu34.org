I agree that some people (maybe even the majority of people for all I know) who use language like that do engage in discriminatory practices.

But you can't conclude that any single person doing this is also practicing discrimination.

As I've said, I agree this type of language isn't helping anyone. It's ultimately a bad thing. But it's not discrimination in and of itself.

As for this being verbal abuse here's wikipedia's definition:

#+begin_quote
  Verbal abuse (verbal attack or verbal assault) is when a person forcefully criticizes, insults, or denounces someone else.[1] Characterized by underlying anger and hostility, it is a destructive form of communication intended to harm the self-concept of the other person and produce negative emotions.
#+end_quote

I think you can at best make a weak case for it being verbal abuse based on the fact that it can harm a person's self-concept. But the fact that it's not necessarily intended to do so makes me think it doesn't fit the definition.

I imagine many people who call a person only by the gender which matches their sex feel as if they're simply stating a fact. "They have a penis, so they're a man". They're not saying it to hurt the person. They're just saying it because to them it's the truth, and they refuse to lie in order to spare someone's feeling.

I've honestly thought this way myself in the past (though I was never bad enough to say this to a trans person's face). There was no ill intent with these thoughts, just the idea that a person can't change the truth of what they physically are.

I've since come to realize that it really is just an argument of semantics. And since the semantics mean absolutely nothing to me, but are very important to some people, there is no harm in changing the definition of man to be "A person who identifies as a male" for non-medical purposes.

My point being simply that, it's completely possible to think the way Mr. Zoat thinks without any ill intent towards anyone. And the harm caused by calling someone a gender they don't identify with can be entirely unintended and non-malicious.

That doesn't erase the harm itself. But that also doesn't mean the person who is causing the harm is doing so because they're transphobic or have any intent to hurt anyone.

#+begin_quote
  And I think that reducing the harm it does to "hurt feelings" trivializes gender dysphoria, but that's territory I'll leave to trans folks to speak on.
#+end_quote

It wasn't my intention to say that being treated this way can't be deeply hurtful to a transperson. But you can't control other people's word choices and actions so long as they are not illegal. People say hurtful things to each other all time, whether intentionally or not. Sometimes people are affected by them much more deeply than others. I don't think this situation is particularly different, other than the fact that it deals with a sensitive topic.
