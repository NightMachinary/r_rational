They're rare, but people with such intersex conditions do exist. Not that it matters to me: if someone wants me to use a singular "they" or another non-gendered pronoun to refer to them, then I'd be more than happy to oblige. And I wish them all the best in finding a body that suits them.

If someone tells me they're a machine, or robot, or android/gynoid, I wouldn't really have a problem with that. That doesn't make equating the power fantasy that is the desire to become an attack helicopter, with the profound and traumatic discomfort of finding yourself /in the wrong body/, any less insulting.
