  A., it's not my or anyone else's place to assert an opinion on what another person's internal experience of their gender is;

True, but it's a cultural matter of whether biology or self-concept is what determines whether you're called a man or woman. Currently the predominant deciding factor is biology, and while that may change in the future I doubt it due to the sheer inconvenience associated with it.

  B., regardless of your opinion on trans as a concept, it's indisputable that misgendering people is hurtful, and hurting people on purpose just because you disagree with them is inexcusable.

Yes, but fundamentalist christians consider teaching evolution a personal attack on their faith, yet we don't kowtow to them.

I'm not saying I won't call someone their preferred pronouns out of courtesy, but A. I have enough trouble with names as it is and B. it's not so universally accepted that it should be considered rude not to do so.

  I'll add that I have direct experience with people being presumptuous enough to correct me on my internal experiences. You would be amazed at how many people apparently know better than I do whether I'm asexual. So I'm pretty cognizant of how absurd it is to claim to be an authority on a stranger's brain.

Neat. You're asexual. There's a 100% that you don't find people sexually attractive. If I remember that then I won't flirt with you. You're not claiming you have different biology than you provably do and currently, that's the deciding he/she/they factor.
