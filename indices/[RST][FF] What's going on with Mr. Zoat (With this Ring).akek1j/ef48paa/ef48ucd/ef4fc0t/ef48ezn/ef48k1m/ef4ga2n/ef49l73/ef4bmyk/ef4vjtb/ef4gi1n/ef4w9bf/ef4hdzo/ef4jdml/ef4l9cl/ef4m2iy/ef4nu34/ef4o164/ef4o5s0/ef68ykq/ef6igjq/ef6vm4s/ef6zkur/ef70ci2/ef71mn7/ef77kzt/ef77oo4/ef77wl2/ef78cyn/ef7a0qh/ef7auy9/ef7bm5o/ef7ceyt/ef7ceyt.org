I guess, looking back over this conversation, your position really does boil down to "why bother." There's more to your argument, sure, but that's what it keeps coming back to, and I can't really do anything with that. To me it's self-evident that making the effort to treat people decently is worth it. If you don't feel that way, well...there's no point in trying to change your mind. I can't appeal to your compassion if you aren't coming from a place of compassion.

Also my various typing-related repetitive strain injuries are starting to act up, so for that and the above reason I'm gonna withdraw from both threads of this discussion now. Have a good rest of your day.
