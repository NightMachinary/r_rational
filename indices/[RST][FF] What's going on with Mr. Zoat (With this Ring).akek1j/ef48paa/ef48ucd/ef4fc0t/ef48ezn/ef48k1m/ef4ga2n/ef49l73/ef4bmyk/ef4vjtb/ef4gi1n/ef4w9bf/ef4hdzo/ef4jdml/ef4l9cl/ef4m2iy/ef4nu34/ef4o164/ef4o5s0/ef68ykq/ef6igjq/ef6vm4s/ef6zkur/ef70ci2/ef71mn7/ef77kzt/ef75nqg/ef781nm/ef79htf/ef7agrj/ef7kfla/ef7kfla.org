  No, I really don't think the penis is a part of the thought process for most people. "Masculine body type," sure. But there are cis woman with more masculine-looking bodies and cis men with more feminine-looking bodies, and people typically understand that and go by how you introduce yourself...unless they're mad about trans people, at which point suddenly they must know your genital configuration.

I said earlier that if I thought someone had a penis, I'd treat them that way. If someone looks like a woman and says to call her a man, that's when the arguments start.

  If they're going to shoot their mouths off on the topic of trans people ("they think they have different genitals than they actually do!") then I damn well expect them to have done the most basic level of research first. If they're going to interact directly with any human being then I damn well expect them to respect how that person asks to be addressed.

...Have you met people? People shoot their mouths off about things they don't understand /all the time/! It's the foundation of half the politics in this country!

  Using a pronoun is not the massive hardship you're making it out to be.

Redefining sexuality is.

  Are you really going to try to tell me there isn't systemic discrimination against trans people? I could point to stuff like housing and employment discrimination and disproportionately high murder rates and the "trans panic" defense. But I mean, American state governments and the fed are explicitly trying to legally control what bathrooms they can use and restrict them from serving in the military, so I can just point to that.

No, I am saying that misgendering isn't discrimination.

  Point is: people always bitch and moan when a minority, black or gay or trans or whatever, wants to change the "deep-rooted part of a culture" that regards them as less than human. It still needs to be done.
#+end_quote

I didn't know treating them the same way we treat everyone else makes them less than human.
