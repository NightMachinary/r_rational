I think this is easily resolved by recognizing that gender identity /is/ a subjective experience. It's not a separate characteristic whose only evidence is subjective experience; it is, itself, the experience. It's not a claim we need to critically evaluate on an individual basis, any more than we need to critically evaluate whether everyone we meet has qualia.
