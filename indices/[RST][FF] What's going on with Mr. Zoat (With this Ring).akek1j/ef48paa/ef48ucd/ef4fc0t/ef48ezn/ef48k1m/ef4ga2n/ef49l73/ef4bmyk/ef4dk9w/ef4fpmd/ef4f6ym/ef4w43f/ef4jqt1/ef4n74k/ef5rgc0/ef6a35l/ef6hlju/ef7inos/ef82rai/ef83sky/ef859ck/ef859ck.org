Why shouldn't I believe people who say they have a machine fetish? That's a thing. And it's a thing that's not super-surprising when I learn that other people have tastes unlike mine.

Next, how are you not misgendering me?

Coming into this conversation, my view is that gender is a socially-created cluster that's often -- but not always -- correlated with brute facts. We can experience brute facts. We can experience treatment that depends on social categorization. But we can't directly experience social category, as that's a mental process outside our heads.

This definition means that I identify as male, even though I don't feel any experience that's intrinsically "male." People can be wrong about my gender just like they're mistaken if they say I'm French.

You're proposing a definition where people's gender is defined based on an inner experience. People who feel X are male, people who feel Y are female, and people who feel neither are agender.

While you're entitled to that definition, the obvious consequence (even if you're kind enough to not rub my nose in it) is that I'm "really" agender, even though I identify as male.

That's not necessarily wrong; I've heard stories of gay people who thought they were straight. But it's certainly a surprising thing to be informed.

And the follow up question is: What mental traits, specifically, are core to the experience of masculinity that I seem to be lacking? What are core feminine mental traits?

If gender is intrinsic (and not dependent on social categorization) then these can't depend on the society around us. And if it's body independent then they're not physical sensations, or dismorphia.

I can think of some traits that are correlated with gender, but I can't fathom how someone would populate a list of Definitively Male inner experiences without sounding like a sexist.
