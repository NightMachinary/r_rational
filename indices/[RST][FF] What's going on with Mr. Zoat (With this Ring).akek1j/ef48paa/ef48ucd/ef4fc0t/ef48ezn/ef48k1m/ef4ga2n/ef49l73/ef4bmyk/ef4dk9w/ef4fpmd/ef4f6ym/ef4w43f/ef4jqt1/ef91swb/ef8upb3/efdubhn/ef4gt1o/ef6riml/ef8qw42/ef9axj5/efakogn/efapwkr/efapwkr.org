  People exist who are low-key outraged that they aren't robots, because it's aggressively unpleasant to have bodily functions. This is not different in kind from gender dysphoria.

And, as I said, I am cool with granting those people the recognition they seek. If they want a genderless pronoun, or, like Asimov's robots, to be addressed as "R." instead of "Mr." or "Mrs." (etc.), sure, I'll accommodate them. There's a difference, however, between "I don't belong in this decaying bag of water and carbon," and "I require the ability to fire multiple different kinds of lethal munitions built into my body."

The former is some form of dysphoria. The latter is a power fantasy. And, frankly, a disturbingly violent and militaristic power fantasy at that.
