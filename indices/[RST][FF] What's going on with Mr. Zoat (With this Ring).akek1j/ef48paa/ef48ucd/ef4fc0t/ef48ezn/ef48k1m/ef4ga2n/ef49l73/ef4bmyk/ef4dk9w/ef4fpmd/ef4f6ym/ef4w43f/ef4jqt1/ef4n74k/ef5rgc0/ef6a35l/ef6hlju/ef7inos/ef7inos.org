[citation needed]. I'm not trying to be snarky here. While there are clearly many people, both cis and trans that have intense feelings that they /are/ their gender, and that it's an inherent part of who they are, and being otherwise or treated otherwise would feel like a huge violation.

But I really have seen many people (cis, of course) that live with the gender role society assigned them without it actually mattering in a significant way, and feel like they would be completely ambivalent to a magical sex change (if not disrupting current relationships, or adding other hardships).
