(disclaimer: the downvote wasn't from me)

I don't think it's really that inconvenient to call people by their preferred pronouns based on how they introduce themselves and (less importantly) other external signals of their gender, like style of dress, hair, etc, as opposed to based on biological characteristics. I mean...I might see where you were coming from if it were standard practice to figure out people's pronouns by pulling their pants down to check out their junk. In that case, there'd have to be a whole societal shift away from that method of identification. But in practice, it's the norm to address people according to how they present themselves, and transphobes add this weird invasive extra step of wanting to know what kind of chromosomes or genitalia you have.

It's true that calling trans people by their pronouns isn't universally accepted yet. Respecting interracial or gay partnerships also wasn't always universally accepted, yet we now recognize that it was shitty to denigrate those relationships even when that was the norm. It's the same for respecting trans identities. Hurting and dehumanizing people is wrong, always. Humans just happen to be really good at rationalizing why it's totally okay /this/ time.

As for the fundamentalist christian comparison, it's not the same thing. Teaching evolution is in a way an attack on their faith, but it's not an attack on their /identities./ I would teach evolution in a classroom, but I would not teach that fundamentalist christians are lying or deluded about their subjective experience of faith. I wouldn't say "you're not really a believer." In the same vein, if I met a Christian who had converted to Judaism, I would not insist on continuing to call them a Christian.

I see this misconception a lot. Trans people in no way claim to have different biology than they have. They are /agonizingly/ aware of the particulars of their biology. What trans people are saying is that their gender identity doesn't align with their physical sex characteristics. This mismatch causes psychological distress which can be alleviated by social, and sometimes medical, transition.

I'll add that there's nothing implausible about that misalignment. We already know that there are intersex people with "mismatching" sex characteristics, because the process of sex differentiation involves a lot of complex branching mechanisms that can individually go awry. If someone can have XY chromosomes and a vulva, why can't someone else have a vulva and a male brain?
