You too!

And kind of? You're trying to make it super taboo to say something like this when it's really hard to get masses of people to change, especially something this fundamental and, frankly, there are way worse atrocities that that effort could be spent on. Millions die in China in labor camps? Who cares. But don't you dare misgender someone.

I guess I was taking out my general irritation with that sentiment on this specific case.
