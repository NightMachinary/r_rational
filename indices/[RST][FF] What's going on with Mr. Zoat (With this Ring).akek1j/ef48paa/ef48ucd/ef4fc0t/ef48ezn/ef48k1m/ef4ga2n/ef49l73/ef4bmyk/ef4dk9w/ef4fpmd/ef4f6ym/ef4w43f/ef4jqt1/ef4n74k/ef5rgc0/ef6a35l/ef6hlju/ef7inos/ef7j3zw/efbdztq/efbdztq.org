I think you could call /some/ of these as just having a weak gender identity and possibly cis-privilege of not needing to think about it.

But at some point a weak enough gender identity is effectively the same thing as none. Some of these really do seem to go that far. And this isn't actually the same thing as agender (which AIUI usually means "identifies as no gender, and would reject any assignment of gender"; if you don't care, the only reason to identify as agender would be solidarity with others). Instead it really is gender not mattering to their identity. These people go "eh, whatever" for any gender assignment. They know the gender role that society assigns them, obviously, and might be bemused if someone uses another, but it's not important to them, and wouldn't feels like an attack (or maybe feels like an irrelevant, failed attack).

I'm sure this seems terribly bizarre to those who do have a strong gender identity, but these people really do exist, and these two ends of the spectrum are going to be talking past each other a great deal.
