  He was a bit confrontational, but things had gotten nowhere near flame war, or hateful attacks, etc. But apparently this was enough for the SV mods to drop the banhammer, in what struck me as rather overreacting.

I think that SV's rules on transphobic speech clearly prioritize sticking to a given ideology over free speech (you're essentially not allowed to say that you have conservative opinions on identity issues), which, y'know, is fair, not every place needs to be SlateStarCodex.

But Mr Zoat was clearly in the wrong here. The "I identify as a attack helicopter" meme is /not okay/. It's not innocent, it's an-injoke that clearly sends a message of contempt and mockery. It's a way to code "I don't care about transgender issues and I think their beliefs are ridiculous and childish" in a short sentence. Using it in the middle of a discussion about gender identity is equivalent to posting Barack Obama's face photoshopped on a monkey in the middle of an US politics discussion.
