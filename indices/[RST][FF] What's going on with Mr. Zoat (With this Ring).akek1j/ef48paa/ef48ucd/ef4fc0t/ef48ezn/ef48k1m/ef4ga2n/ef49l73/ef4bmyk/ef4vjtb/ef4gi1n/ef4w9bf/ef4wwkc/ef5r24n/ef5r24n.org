No, because religious people really are wrong by any logical standard. All evidence we have as to the way the universe works requires most or all religions to be wrong. No such evidence exists for gender identity and in fact evidence exists that gender IS seperate from sex. Furthermore, religions make claims about the outward world. Being trans is a claim about your internal experience, which nobody else has access to.

I don't believe attacking someone's beliefs is inherently right or wrong, it depends on the beliefs themselves.
