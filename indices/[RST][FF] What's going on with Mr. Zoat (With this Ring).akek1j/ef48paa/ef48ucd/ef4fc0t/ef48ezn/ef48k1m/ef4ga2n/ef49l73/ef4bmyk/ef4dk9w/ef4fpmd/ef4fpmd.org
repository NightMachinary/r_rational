The attitude of "I won't accept/acknowledge your gender until you've medically transitioned" is directly harmful to:

1. Trans people who aren't in a position to medically transition because of their age, finances, location, or unrelated health issues;

2. Trans people who, for personal reasons, only wish to transition socially and not medically.

It also perpetuates a societal preoccupation with genitals over personhood that's broadly harmful to trans people regardless of their state of medical transition.

I'm not trans, so it's not my place to reject the "support" of folks who claim to be okay with trans people as long as they jump through the right set of hoops. But my perception is that said "support" is just harm with a veil of plausible deniability draped over it. A good ally would listen to the people they're theoretically supporting and acknowledge their descriptions of their internal experiences, instead of trying to force their own preconceptions on them.

I don't think the cat thing is a reasonable comparison. Gender identity is a mental characteristic, and a human brain can be a man's brain or a woman's brain, but there's no such thing as a human brain that's a cat's brain. (That said, I would still refer to the guy as a cat if he asked me to because that's just polite.)
