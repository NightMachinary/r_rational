I have a problem with this "some jerks used it to troll trans people, therefore it is always transphobic" thing, because, as you pointed out, a sentient helicopter would still be as deserving of respect as anyone else. (I mean, how many cartoons are there about sentient vehicles? If there isn't someone out there who desperately wants to become a Steam Engine because of an obsession with Thomas the Train, that would be impressive.)

No, really, I have a problem with this, because a bunch of jerks used /my/ identity to troll trans people, resulting in a bunch of activists declaring that I do not exist. That coming from allies is painful.

(Paul outright said he hates <mygroup> early on. Outside of a couple comments, it hasn't really come up, and in practice, he hasn't actually acted like this is as true as being his inner monologue would suggest. Also I'm kinda use to people who express such hate (their wordchoice) being easier to get along with. Among those who seem more accepting is where the drama lies (weirdly gendered drama, now that I think of it). So, in practice, I tolerate Zoat in spite of this, and the pronoun thing (which bothers me more just because it's not a blink-and-you'll-miss-it comment). Somehow, it seems like what side one claims is not very well correlated with what side one most helps/harms. Humans are weird.)

* "My identity" is neither vehicle nor non-human animal, just, ah, in case there was confusion about that.
