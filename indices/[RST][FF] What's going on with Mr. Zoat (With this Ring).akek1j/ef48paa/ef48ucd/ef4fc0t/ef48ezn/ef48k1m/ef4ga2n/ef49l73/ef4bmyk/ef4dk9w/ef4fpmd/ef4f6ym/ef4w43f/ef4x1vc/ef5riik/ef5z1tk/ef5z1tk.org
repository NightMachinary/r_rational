Non-binary people may be, though they more rarely become non-binary due to a struggle with gender dismorphia. But I must admit that sexual/gender identities that go beyond non-binary/pansexual do often seem silly to me. Especially people who take being an otherkin seriously and feel discriminated against when not taken just as seriously by others.
