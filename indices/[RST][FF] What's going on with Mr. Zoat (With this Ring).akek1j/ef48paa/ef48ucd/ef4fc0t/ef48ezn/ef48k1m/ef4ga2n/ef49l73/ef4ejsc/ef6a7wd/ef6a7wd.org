The ban had nothing to do with what was in the story. SV is very clear about understanding that the attitude of characters does not necessarily reflect that of the author. Yes, there are content types that will get you banned, but this wasn't it.

Zoat got banned for things he said in the thread, where he went out of his way to engage with the discussion in offensive, thoughtless, demeaning ways. [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/11961586/][This]] and [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/11963172/][this]] being particular examples. tl;dr, the essence of what he said was "Transsexuals are just being ridiculous. Your genitals determine your gender and trying to call yourself by other pronouns is a delusion that I am not going to bother caring about."

SV has an explicit [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/8912695/][policy against misgendering]]. ("We expect, for example, that you will gender everyone appropriately.") This was an absolutely clear violation of it, so he was given 50 infraction points, which is the minimum that you can get for actually clearly violating a rule.[1] That comes with a 24-hour tempban. Mr. Zoat then flipped out about how unfair it was to be held to the clearly-stated standard that he'd never bothered to read and how he wasn't going to tolerate anything that would make him break his streak of posting every day -- which a 24 hour ban would not do -- so he took his ball and went home...after posting one last [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-thread-thirteen.49418/page-520]["f* you" to the moderators]], which earned him a permanent ban.

[1] You can get 25 for a borderline case, but otherwise 50 is the minimum.
