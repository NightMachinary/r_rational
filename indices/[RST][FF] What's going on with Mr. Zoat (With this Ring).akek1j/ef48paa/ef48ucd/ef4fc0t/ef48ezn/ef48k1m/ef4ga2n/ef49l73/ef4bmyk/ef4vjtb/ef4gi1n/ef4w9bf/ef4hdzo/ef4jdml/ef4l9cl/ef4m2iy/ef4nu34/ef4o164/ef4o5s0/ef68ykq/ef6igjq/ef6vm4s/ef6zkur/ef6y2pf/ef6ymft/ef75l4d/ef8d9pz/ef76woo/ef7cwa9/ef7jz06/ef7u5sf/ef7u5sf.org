  The english speaking world.

That's nearly 20% of the world's population, and you posit that they share one single united culture? And that you can claim to speak for them, to say how they'd react to being asked to respect a gender preference?

You know what? Given that your argument, as put in the other thread, boils down to "Why bother?" (even though you've "bothered" to put in far more effort defending your position than it would ever take to just change what you call the few people who would ever ask for it), I agree with the other poster that it's just not worth trying to convince you. Personally, I don't find "taking the minimal effort needed not to knowingly hurt people" to be a bother, but if you don't get that, I don't think you ever will.
