While I'm of the opinion that you should call someone whatever they want to be called, I still feel like this issue can be more of a semantics argument rather than a bigoted one. For example, someone might be of the opinion that a man who identifies as a woman is perfectly right in wanting to be a woman and that's fine, but the technical term for them is still a man as that is what they physically are.

This might be hurtful to that person (which is why I think you might as well call them whatever they want) but to say it's transphobic just because you're of a different opinion of what the word "gender" means is a bit much. I've always felt uncomfortable about the idea that sharing an opinion with bigots but for a completely non bigoted reason automatically makes you a bigot.
