Don't act like no one even tried to explain it to you. I am one of like five people in this thread alone who wrote extensively on why correctly gendering people is important. I wrote probably thousands of words. There are also millions of words a mere Google search away with more information if you are really burning to know the answer to "why should we use the words 'man' and 'woman' to refer to gender identity/role instead of genitalia." There are explanations available from experts and laypeople alike and from every conceivable angle--personal experience, psychology, sociology, biology. There are trans subs on Reddit full of trans people talking about how and why being gendered correctly is important to them. You apparently know people in real life you could have asked during one of those hanging-out-and-joking sessions. If you wanted an answer to your question you would have had it already.
