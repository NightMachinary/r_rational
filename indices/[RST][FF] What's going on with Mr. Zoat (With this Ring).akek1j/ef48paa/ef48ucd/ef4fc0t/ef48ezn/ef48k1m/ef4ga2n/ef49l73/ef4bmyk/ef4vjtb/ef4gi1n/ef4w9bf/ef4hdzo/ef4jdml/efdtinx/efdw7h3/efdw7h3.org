I believe in this case and most cases like it you are correct.

I think a lot of the hesitation to do so comes from slippery-slope type arguments.

There's a general fear that if they allow other people to dictate their language it will quickly become something unwieldy and less-useful. But realistically I think it makes more sense to evaluate these things on a case by case basis. And in this case it's not like transgender people are asking for a radical change in language usage, even if being unsure of what pronouns to use can be a very minor inconvenience at times.

edit: And it's not like there are a lot of different groups asking to be identified differently, in practice.
