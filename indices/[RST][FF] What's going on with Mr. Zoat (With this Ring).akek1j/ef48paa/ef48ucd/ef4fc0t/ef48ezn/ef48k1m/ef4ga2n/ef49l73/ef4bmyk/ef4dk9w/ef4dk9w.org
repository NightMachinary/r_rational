There's no indication that Zoat fears or hates trans people. Insisting on using referents based on physical characteristics rather than self-identification is /kinda dickish/, but I suspect the vehement backlash that stance generates is precisely /because/ that stance has no good answer to the "attack helicopter" meme. Let's discuss it with a subject that isn't so heated.

There's a guy I saw on some television show like 60 Minutes, years and years ago, who considered himself to be a cat. This man had gotten a bunch of plastic surgery done, cat-like facial tattoos, whiskers installed in his cheeks. The end result looked absolutely freakish, but that's besides the point. Obviously pointing and laughing and calling him mean names would be atrocious behavior, but would you consider referring to him as "human" to be hateful bigotry? I called him a "man" instead of a "tom", would you accept that I should be subject to negative consequences? Do you think that person was mentally ill? Do you think /any discussion/ of his mental health is beyond the pale?

Zoat's stance seemed to be that the tom was a human male with some plastic surgery and facial tattoos. Zoat would fully support his efforts to magically or technologically turn into a cat, but would not consent to considering him a cat while he was still physically a bipedal ape. Would this instance be sufficient for you to consider Zoat a transphobe? Would that be "saying his existence is invalid"?

I /don't/ think Zoat's stance is beyond the pale of acceptable behavior. Frankly, getting that angry at people who are supportive of the desire to transition, but won't change their terminology until a change is actually made, seems like throwing away support. I suspect that the extremely strong negative reactions that stance generates are largely because some people who feel strongly about trans rights know, on some level, that their epistemological grounds are rather shaky.

For the record, I consider all of this /sad/, and would make reasonable efforts to be accommodating in the event I ever encounter a trans person in my actual life. But the mod behavior there seems to be on the same tier as a rule against saying a fetus isn't a person. "Or, y'know, you can just not support murder" would be a kind of an ill-tempered response, if that were the topic of discussion, no?
