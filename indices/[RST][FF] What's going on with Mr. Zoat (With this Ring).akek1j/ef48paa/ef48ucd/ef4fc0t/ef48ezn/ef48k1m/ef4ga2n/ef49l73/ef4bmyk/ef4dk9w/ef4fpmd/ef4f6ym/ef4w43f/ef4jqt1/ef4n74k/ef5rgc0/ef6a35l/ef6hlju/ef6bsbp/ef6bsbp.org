  But I think trans is strange and fake-able
#+end_quote

Why would anyone fake being trans? It's a difficult process that carries a lot of social approbation. Faking being white, sure. Faking being rich, absolutely. What possible reason is there for someone to /fake/ being trans?

Saying that it's possible someone is just faking it implies that you think they might be dishonest. May I ask why you think that?
