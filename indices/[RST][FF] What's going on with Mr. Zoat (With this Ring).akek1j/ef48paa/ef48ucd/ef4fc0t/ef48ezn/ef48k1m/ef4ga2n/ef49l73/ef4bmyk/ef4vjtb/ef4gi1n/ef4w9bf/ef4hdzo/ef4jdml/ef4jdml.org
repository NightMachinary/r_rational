  the words themselves do not have intrinsic value.

They have value in context, to the people hearing them, which is what matters. "Semantics" is a terrible reason to hurt people.

I also have to say, I've never encountered someone who insisted on misgendering people who /wasn't/ doing so as a denial of those people's gender identities. I don't know where you get the idea that "I won't call you a man because I don't think you meet my preferred definition of the word 'man'" is distinct from "I won't call you a man because I don't think you're a man."

Aside from that, I think it's key to remember that bigotry takes forms other than "hate and fear." It's entirely possible to have awful, wrong, hurtful opinions about a group of people without hating or fearing them. "Lesser" forms of bigotry still need to be called out, because they're still harmful and they provide a foundation of support for more extreme bigots.
