I really didn't have to change anything. When I meet a new person, I do my best to infer how they wish to be addressed. If I'm wrong, they (or more likely a third party familiar with them since that's who I'd be using pronouns with) correct me and I apologize and address them correctly thereafter. Easy peasy.

My concept of "what constitutes a woman" is not so core to my identity that extending it to include trans women would shake my world, and it had evolved past "vulva = lady" after my first college-level biology course anyway.

As for sexuality, my ace ass can't speak on this with much authority but I would think you could just see who you're attracted to on an individual basis. You don't have to like, decide in advance what category of people you can be attracted to.

I'm not seeing anything here that is so difficult to deal with that it justifies piling additional shit onto an already marginalized group just to avoid the inconvenience.
