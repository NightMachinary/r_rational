Honestly, for me it seems like character inconsistently for both Paul and Zoat. His story is full of gendered characters that either can shapeshift freely or don't have genitals at all. It has beings that reproduce primarily through cloning and still have a gender identity. Why would someone experiencing all that (in case of Paul the character) or someone who seems to empathize enough with all kinds of strange mindsets to be able to write them suddenly regress into putting needless emphasis on something as mundane as a pair of dimorphic body parts?
