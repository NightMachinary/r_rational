I wasn't the one who pointed out that a sentient helicopter would deserve respect, but I do agree with that. That's fair. So I don't think that otherkin identities are inherently transphobic, and I'm sorry that allies rejected your identity. That must have been a painful betrayal.

I /do/ think that the specific phrasing of "attack helicopter" signals transphobia pretty much 100% of the time. Like, that's a very specific meme whose purpose is to denigrate non-cis identities. Though I wouldn't be shitty to someone who told me "no, really, it's not the meme, I honestly feel that way."
