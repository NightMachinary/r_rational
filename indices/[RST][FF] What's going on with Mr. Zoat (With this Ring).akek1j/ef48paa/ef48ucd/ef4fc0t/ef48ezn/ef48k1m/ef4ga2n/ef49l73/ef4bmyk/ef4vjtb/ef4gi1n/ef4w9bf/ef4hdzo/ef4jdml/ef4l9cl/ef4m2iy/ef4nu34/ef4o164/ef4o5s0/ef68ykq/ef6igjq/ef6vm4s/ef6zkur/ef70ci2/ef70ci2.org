  I don't think it's really that inconvenient to call people by their preferred pronouns based on how they introduce themselves and other external signals of their gender, like style of dress, hair, etc, as opposed to based on biological characteristics. I mean...I might see where you were coming from if it were standard practice to figure out people's pronouns by pulling their pants down to check out their junk. In that case, there'd have to be a whole societal shift away from that method of identification. But in practice, it's the norm to address people according to how they present themselves, and transphobes add this weird invasive extra step of wanting to know what kind of chromosomes or genitalia you have.

There is no /one way/ trangender people dress. Even if you go with the most obvious dresses on men thing, crossdressers are a thing. I don't know about you, but it's extremely obvious to me if someone has an XX or XY chromosome in my daily life. There are exceptions, but those are usually transitioning people and I'd call them their pronouns anyway.

  As for the fundamentalist christian comparison, it's not the same thing. Teaching evolution is in a way an attack on their faith, but it's not an attack on their identities. I would teach evolution in a classroom, but I would not teach that fundamentalist christians are lying or deluded about their subjective experience of faith. In the same vein, if I met a Christian who had converted to Judaism, I would not insist on continuing to call them a Christian.

I don't think you understand fundamentalist Christian mindset. They really do consider it a personal attack on their identities, their faith can often be the largest part of what they consider themselves, and it is being undermined. Just look at the "war on christmas" bullshit! They really are that sensitive and consider it disrespectful, to the point of pulling their kids out of school so they won't be corrupted. It is the same thing. Fun fact, many extremists will consider you dead if you convert, rather than your new religion.

  I see this misconception a lot. Trans people in no way claim to have different biology than they have. They are agonizingly aware of the particulars of their biology. What trans people are saying is that their gender identity doesn't align with their physical sex characteristics. This mismatch causes psychological distress which can be alleviated by social, and sometimes medical, transition.

And I'm saying that when they're claiming they're a man or woman, in common parlance they're saying they have different biology. That's what the word /means/ to most people, so whatever they intend that's the message they're sending.

  I'll add that there's nothing implausible about that misalignment. We already know that there are intersex people with "mismatching" sex characteristics, because the process of sex differentiation involves a lot of complex branching mechanisms that can individually go awry. If someone can have XY chromosomes and a vulva, why can't someone else have a vulva and a male brain?

Because male is literally a social concept which, at this point, means "has a penis". Okay? You may have a different definition than that, but that doesn't mean you can disregard everyone else's opinion as transphobic.
