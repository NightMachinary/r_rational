Not an attack helicopter specifically, but being one would be more ego-syntonic than being a flesh sac is; they feel out of place in /any/ skin, which is no different than transgender people who feel out of place in /their/ (specific) skin. There does not currently exist a model of human that is medically safe and has no primary or secondary sexual characteristics of either men or women; by your logic this makes nonbinary trans people have lesser status than others.
