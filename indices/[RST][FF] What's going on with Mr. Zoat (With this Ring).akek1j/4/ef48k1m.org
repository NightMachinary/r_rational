Yeah. After the first time ever there wasn't a new chapter waiting for me in the morning, I looked into it. Basically, the current plot threat involved a MacGuffin of gender-bending. Paul and Zoat are apparently gender essentialists, or something, it's strange. The character was a man changed into a woman, and Paul uses female pronouns while calling the character "Mr. LastName". There was discussion in the thread about it, and Zoat basically said "If you're full of woman parts, you are currently a woman, even if you'd like to be a man, even if you used to be a man, even if you'd like to be an attack helicopter". He was a bit confrontational, but things had gotten nowhere near flame war, or hateful attacks, etc. But apparently this was enough for the SV mods to drop the banhammer, in what struck me as rather overreacting.

So now the story has moved to QQ.

tl;dr: Avoid trans issues on Sufficient Velocity like they are radioactive.
