Yes, it bloody was. This is the essence of the debate in question:

Trans person: Hey, my identity is really important to me, okay? I know that my genitals don't match my presentation, but I would appreciate it if you would use the pronouns that I choose.

Mr Zoat: Your issues either don't exist or don't matter. Your genitals define your gender and anything you have to say about the matter is irrelevant. It is exactly no effort for me to use your chosen pronouns so by making the deliberate choice to not do so I am explicitly stating that I think you're deluded or dishonest.
