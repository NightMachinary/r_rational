  I suspect that many people who refuse to use pronouns see "trans is a mental illness" as "actually true". Trans is fundamentally a mismatch between body and mind. The current politically correct stance is "the problem is with the body", but I don't see it as obvious that "the problem is with the mind" is wrong. The former aligns better with my views of mental versus bodily identity, but mental illness is always going to strain that. Would it be morally wrong to cure a schizophrenic? You'd be forcibly changing their mental state, functionally killing the person who was there before. "Would it be better for trans people to take a magic potion that removed the dysphoria, but left the body intact" strikes me as the same general category of moral/philosophical question. Is it customary to address schizophrenics as "Your Imperial Majesty"?

Gender dysphoria is a mental illness in the sense that people suffer depression and distress because of it. That doesn't mean you should go out of your way to make life harder for them.

You are describing a false dichotomy. If I print out a picture at a particular size and buy a picture frame but the picture frame but the picture doesn't fit in the picture frame then the problem is that they are mismatched. The issue isn't that the frame is wrong and the picture is fine. The issue isn't that the picture is fine but the frame is correct. The problem is that they don't match. I could change either the frame or picture to match the other and it wouldn't matter unless there was a specific preference for a particular size.

In the case of transgender individuals changing their body and/or social role can be done but we don't have a magic pill for making them happy with their natural body. The question isn't whether you accept their presentation or change their minds. The question is whether you accept their presentation or push them towards depression and eventual suicide.

​

You shouldn't compare transgender people to schizophrenics. Being transgender does not mean being delusional. Transgender individuals do not believe they have genitalia they do not. Also because psychotic individuals are not qualified to make their own medical decisions.

​

Your mental state is forcibly changed all the time by experiences. The person "you" were 5 years ago is gone. The person that is reading this right now will also be gone in time.

If there was a magic mind altering pill for transgender individuals then I would expect some would take it for practical reasons and others would abstain for personal or ideological reasons. If there was a magic mind pill that made people straight then I would also expect similar results for gay and lesbian people. Note: Practical reasons can also include to avoid getting lynched.
