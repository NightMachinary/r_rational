Hello! Trans person you are meeting in real life. Here's the thing about the "attack helicopter" meme, no one says it and actually believes it. It's equating a person saying they are trans with a person play acting that they are something absurd. It feels one step removed from a slippery slope argument, if we allow people to claim that they are a different gender than I expect then next they will want to be spaceships!

And honestly, if someone actually really did come up to and claim that they identified as a helicopter or hell, even your example of the man who thinks is his a cat then I'll do my best. I'll try to accommodate him in that way when and if I meet him, and if that means to refer to him as a cat because that is how he wants to be known I can do that for him.

And yes we can have a discussion of his mental health, that discussion is "How can we help him feel comfortable in his own skin?" Going through life feeling trapped that way must be terrible, and I think a big part of transhumanism, a topic we write and share a lot of fiction about here, is about ways we can help people like him down the road. Sure we don't have that technology now but there are other simple things we can do, like /acknowledging that this person is different/ and treating them with respect anyway. Because if a sentient attack helicopter actually existed I think it would be deserving of respect.
