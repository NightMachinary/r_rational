The thing about the attack helicopter meme is that it explicitly /is/ a slippery slope argument. I think a less snarky version of it would be something like "If a person says their gender is different than what they appear to be, there is no real way to verify that beyond their own report of their subjective experience. If we're going to take that seriously, then how do we justify drawing a line there, and not /also/ taking seriously every /other/ report of a subjective internal experience that doesn't match anything verifiable?"

We can draw all sorts of lines about which claims we take how seriously, but if we're going to be honest, we have to admit that any line is going to be at least somewhat arbitrary. So how do you condemn someone whose line is a /little bit more restrictive/ than your own? How is a claim of attack helicopter-kin meaningfully different from the most marginal, lowest effort claim of being transgender? I mean, you brought up technological options; it's entirely possible that it will be possible to upload your brain into a computer, and have that computer control an attack helicopter before it's technically possible to transfer your brain into a vat-grown, natural body of your preferred sex.
