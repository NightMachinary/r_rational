  Why would anyone fake being trans?

Depends on the circumstances. In most of the world, you're completely correct, but if most of you life is on tumblr, or you live in SV, claiming to be trans could be a solid tactical maneuver. Even outside those circumstances, it could be a function of Munchausen-like mentality. There's a reason "transtrender" is a term.

I personally don't have any reason to think anyone in particular is faking anything. I'm explaining why I don't think it's necessarily evil for someone to be skeptical about a claim that often boils down to "take my word for it, no proof is even really possible".
