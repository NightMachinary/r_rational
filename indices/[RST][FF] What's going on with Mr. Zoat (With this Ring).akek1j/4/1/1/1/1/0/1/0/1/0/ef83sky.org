A gender identity doesn't have to be strongly felt, and an identity of "agender" is also valid. My intention isn't to exclude people who don't intrinsically identify with a gender. I can't say that I identify particularly strongly with mine. But an intrinsic sense of gender is certainly common enough, and mundane enough, not to be comparable with "an intrinsic sense of being a druid" or whatever other deliberately outlandish comparison someone wants to make in order to discredit trans identities.

Maybe "practically universal" wasn't the right phrasing, but I hope you understand what I'm saying. Gender identity is a thing, even if it's not universal. Like, I'm asexual, but sexual orientation is still a thing, and I wouldn't try to discredit gay people by saying "but if we have to take seriously this dude wanting to +bang+ *marry* another dude, does that mean we have to take seriously a dude who wants to +bang+ *marry* a helicopter?"
