Not the person you're responding to, but it would apply to telling a religious person that they aren't faithful. Faith or the lack thereof, like gender identity, is both a subjective experience and an essential facet of a person's existence. (Misgendering trans people is an extra layer of fucked up, though, since they're already a marginalized group and it's reprehensible to kick someone when they're down.)
