Briefly coming back to this after giving my hand time to recover, to point out one quick thing: Misgendering trans people is /not/ treating them the same way as everyone else. We don't misgender everyone else. We show everyone else the basic, minimal respect of addressing them by the names and pronouns with which they identify.

I get that your argument here is "if we call everyone by pronouns corresponding to their genitals, then we're treating everyone the same." When I was an awful child trying to impress my conservative parents, I used the same argument in opposition to gay marriage: "We're not denying gay people any rights, because they have the same right that straight people do: to marry someone of the opposite sex!" Which obviously completely misses the point, in exactly the same way that your argument does. That's all.
