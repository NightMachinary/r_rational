  The problem with reducing people to a simple dichotomy like that is that those things don't always line up. Not only does the brain not match the genitalia or the chromosomes, but sometimes the genitalia and the chromosomes don't match each other, or don't even fall into one of those two categories!

  A proper society should not be okay with mistreating the few because they are outnumbered by the many.
#+end_quote

No, but everyone isn't going to put aside a part of their sexuality and language because of said few. It works 99% of the time and most people aren't terrible for not changing to please a 1% they're likely never going to meet! If there was a third gender that you could easily recognize, I think most people wouldn't care and would call them whatever they wanted, but if you look like what is normally thought of to be a woman (XX chromosomes) then people are going to do what they do for everyone else.

  Especially not when the solution is as simple as addressing someone according to their brain's biology rather than something you generally can't even see if they're wearing clothes.
#+end_quote

I feel like this part is willful ignorance on your part. Most people can tell the sexes apart at a glance. You can't tell someone's brain's biology by the same token.

If you're going to put words into my mouth then this isn't going to be a real discussion. I did not say that, and I'd like you to agree that I did not.

  And then you stated that the criteria for calling someone "he" or "she" was dependent on culture.
#+end_quote

It is. Currently, in the US, the majority view of the subject is that penis means male. Not everyone in the US does that, but it does mean you can't redefine it to suit your needs and expect everyone to immediately agree.

#+begin_quote
  I was just taking that argument to the logical conclusion that since, again, the culture of SV is to not base those criteria on chromosomes or genitalia, a cultural exemption shouldn't apply in this instance, and thus it should indeed be considered inexcusable.
#+end_quote

And putting more words into my mouth. Thanks. I never said a word on SV but please, continue to tell me how I think. That's definitely useful to the discussion and certainly not going against the ideals and mores of [[/r/rational]].

  I'm a utilitarian. Which, in my own mind, means that I don't see a distinction between doing something knowing it will cause harm and doing something to deliberately cause harm. If someone is suspended from a height and I untie the rope holding them, it's just as evil whether I do it for the purpose of killing them, or because I think the knot is aesthetically displeasing and I'm just okay with them dying as a consequence for untying it.
#+end_quote

... I had a whole utilitarian argument planned out about whether a minority being offended about a word /not/ being redefined in their interest is worth the majority going through the effort of changing it, but you're not interested in actual discussion so I'm just going to stop.
