People who intentionally misgender trans people are wrong and causing unnecessary harm. I don't care how many of them there are. A large group of people can be wrong just as easily as a small group.

I'm aware that sexuality is a big part of people's lives, I'm just not seeing how accepting trans women as women then requires you to sit down and litigate your sexuality with yourself. If you meet a trans woman and you're attracted to her, that answers the question, right?

You say "appease," I say "treat with basic decency."
