  It works 99% of the time and most people aren't terrible for not changing to please a 1% they're likely never going to meet!

You must be from a /very/ different place than I am if you don't think that most people are going to meet over 100 people in their lives.

    [It's inexcusable for someone to continue harming you in an easily-avoidable way after you've been made aware of it o]nly if you work under the assumption that they instantly think you're right. You explaining something doesn't mean they'll think your right, and it's not inexcusable to have a different opinion.

  If you're going to put words into my mouth then this isn't going to be a real discussion. I did not say that, and I'd like you to agree that I did not.

That was from the comment you were replying to.

A different formatting, with the same connotations:

    I think you misunderstood what I was saying. I'm not saying that every person who misgenders trans people is also personally telling them there are no vacant apartments left, or voting for politicians who want bathroom bills, or whatever. I'm saying that they're normalizing harmful attitudes toward trans people that breed those forms of discrimination.

    As for the question of intent to harm, I'll go back to what I said earlier: bigotry doesn't have to be malicious to be harmful. And I think once someone has been made aware that they're harming people in such an easily avoidable way, it's inexcusable for them to continue.

Would you like to elucidate what's true "only if" etc., if not what I put in square brackets? Especially given your own use of "inexcusable," it seems the most likely interpretation.

  I never said a word on SV but please, continue to tell me how I think.

What do you think this whole discussion is about? And when you mention "culture," to what culture am I supposed to infer you're referring, if not the culture in which the behavior that sparked discussion happened?
