  That research is still in it's infancy, and yes but they're not the predominant usage of determining calling someone him/her and man/woman, that's still XY/XX chromosomes/penis and vagina.
#+end_quote

That's the predominant usage because, for the overwhelming majority of people, all three things line up: male brain/penis/XY chromosome, or female brain/vagina/XX chromosome.

The problem with reducing people to a simple dichotomy like that is that those things /don't/ always line up. Not only does the brain not match the genitalia or the chromosomes, but sometimes the genitalia and the chromosomes don't match each other, or don't even fall into one of those two categories!

A proper society should not be okay with mistreating the few because they are outnumbered by the many. Especially not when the solution is as simple as addressing someone according to their brain's biology rather than something you generally can't even see if they're wearing clothes.

  I didn't even say that. My comment had nothing to do with Zoat but the definition of bigotry used here
#+end_quote

No, what you /said/ was:

#+begin_quote
  [It's inexcusable for someone to continue harming you in an easily-avoidable way after you've been made aware of it o]nly if you work under the assumption that they instantly think you're right. You explaining something doesn't mean they'll think your right, and it's not inexcusable to have a different opinion.
#+end_quote

And then you stated that the criteria for calling someone "he" or "she" was dependent on culture.

I was just taking that argument to the logical conclusion that since, again, the culture of SV is to /not/ base those criteria on chromosomes or genitalia, a cultural exemption shouldn't apply in this instance, and thus it should indeed be considered inexcusable.

  redefining the word is a long term process that you can't just assume people will accept and accuse of bigotry when they don't.
#+end_quote

I'm a utilitarian. Which, in my own mind, means that I don't see a distinction between doing something /knowing/ it will cause harm and doing something to /deliberately/ cause harm. If someone is suspended from a height and I untie the rope holding them, it's just as evil whether I do it for the purpose of killing them, or because I think the knot is aesthetically displeasing and I'm just okay with them dying as a consequence for untying it.

Trans people have made it clear that misgendering /hurts/ them. While there's certainly a difference between slipping up by using the wrong gender and deliberately doing so, I don't see a moral distinction between whether you deliberately continue to do it because you hate and/or fear them, or because you just don't care enough to put in the effort to not hurt them.

#+begin_quote
  expecting people to change such a deep-rooted usage of a word so quickly is impractical.
#+end_quote

On a reflexive level? Of course it's impractical to expect immediate change. On a conscious level, though, we make adjustments to our cultures constantly to be less harmful. And unless they attach some stigma to those who willfully continue to do harm, how is anyone /ever/ supposed to accomplish this kind of culture shift?
