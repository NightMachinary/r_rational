  My point is that when you're trying to ascertain how to address someone in real life, genitals don't actually enter into that process. You have to go out of your way to bring them into it for the purpose of deliberately misgendering people.

Really? You can't possibly imagine that when people see someone new they don't think "yep, that's the body type of someone with a penis". That right now, the majority of people decide how to address someone based on that thought and feel they have no real reason to change?

  There is really nothing unclear about the basic concept of "a trans person is someone whose gender doesn't match their physical sex." You have to go out of your way to both assume that this somehow means "trans people with penises think they have vaginas" and to then blame trans people for that misconception.

For you and me? Obviously. For a random person on the street who doesn't follow the news about trans drama, who doesn't care one way or another if a tiny minority are offended? Why would they know? Why would they care? It's unfair to expect them to ignore Chinese child sweatshop labor every time they shop at walmart, and yet expect them to care what is in any kind of perspective unimaginably less important. You clearly care about this topic, but you shouldn't expect people to properly address the yugioh regional champion as such even if it offends said champion.

  Gender identity almost certainly has a neurological basis.

*The science is new, don't assume neurology turns out the way you want it to just because you want it to, especially when you're not a neurologist.* I have no opinion on whether the brain stuff is true or false, because I am not a neurosurgeon and it's honestly not that relevant to the discussion of whether people are bad for not caring what your self-identity is.

  "Address people the way they ask you to" is not a new rule. If someone introduces themselves as Stacy I'm not going to dig up their birth certificate and go "AHA, you were assigned the name Suzie at birth so that's what I will now call you." That shit is rude, disrespectful, and hurtful.

Address people as they want you to until it becomes inconvenient, at which point we give them nicknames. I can't ask people to call me mr. big dick and expect them to actually respect that. Especially when 99% of the population goes by the one thing and there's no clear difference (fashions change and I can't see your brain) between what I call everyone else and you.

  I'm sure MLK and Barbara Gittings heard the same thing.

I didn't know transgender people couldn't vote and were lynched for drinking from cis-people's drinking fountains. But hey, what I do know, it could secretly be happening and literally no one is talking about it. It's obviously equivalent.
