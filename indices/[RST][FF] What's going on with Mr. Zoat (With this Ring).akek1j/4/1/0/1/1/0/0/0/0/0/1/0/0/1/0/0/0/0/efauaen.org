Basically because I have to do the emotional equivalent of change religions to do so, and I don't see why you're offended if you feel like you're a man but by most of the world's definition, are not. Why can't you just say that you should be treated like one of the guys rather than actually claiming that you are a man. Why do you feel like because you feel closer to a *stereotypical* male identity that the stereotype should literally become the new male?
