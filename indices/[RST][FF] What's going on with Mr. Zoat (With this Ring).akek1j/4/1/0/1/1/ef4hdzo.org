Fair enough. That does make more sense. Though I still disagree that that's necessarily transphobic.

That's just a difference in definition. It's not denying the person's personal experience, it's just denying that that personal experience should inform the definition of that person's gender.

It's really an argument of semantics, not an argument about anything intrisinc to the person's character. The definition of the person themselves stays the same regardless of what you call them.

I'm not saying that definitions are unimportant, but the words themselves do not have intrinsic value.

So if I called you an "Snoopite" but I defined the word snoopite as "anyone who uses reddit", I don't think you can say that I'm misrepresenting you, nor can you necessarily claim that I hate or fear all people from reddit.

You can say that I'm a jerk for calling you something you don't want to be called. And you could make arguments that my definition of "snoopite" is not the most optimal or socially inclusive definition.
