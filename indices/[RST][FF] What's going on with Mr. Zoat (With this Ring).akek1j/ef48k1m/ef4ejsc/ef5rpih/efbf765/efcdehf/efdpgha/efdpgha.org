Of course I'm only looking at the SV chapters, because that's what's relevant for the subject: what precipitated Zoat's move from SV to QQ.

Now, if you want to answer a different question, like "Is Zoat evil?", or "has the departure changed his observed behavior?", or "were the mods detecting something that is only now revealed?", this might be useful evidence. But expanding the subject without notice it is confusing at best.
