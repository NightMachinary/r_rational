In story, Paul used them in his head. I can't find any examples of him using them out loud (look for stuff inside the orange quotation marks). The only other character I can find misgendering out loud is Beryl, who called him a woman. Zoat, the author, used them "out loud", both by writing the story, and in subsequent comments, but is not the character Paul, despite Paul being an SI based on him.
