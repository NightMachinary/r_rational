Congratulations, you're more open than most people. That doesn't make most people bad.

  As for sexuality, my ace ass can't speak on this with much authority but I would think you could just see who you're attracted to on an individual basis. You don't have to like, decide in advance what category of people you can be attracted to.

Okay, I don't want to lay this on your asexuality but otherwise this seems disingenuous. Sexuality is a fucking massive part of our social life, you're judged differently by who and what you're attracted to, and is a deeply personal and intense part of most people.

  I'm not seeing anything here that is so difficult to deal with that it justifies piling additional shit onto an already marginalized group just to avoid the inconvenience.

I'm not seeing why most people have to change to appease a minority that decided to redefine a word.
