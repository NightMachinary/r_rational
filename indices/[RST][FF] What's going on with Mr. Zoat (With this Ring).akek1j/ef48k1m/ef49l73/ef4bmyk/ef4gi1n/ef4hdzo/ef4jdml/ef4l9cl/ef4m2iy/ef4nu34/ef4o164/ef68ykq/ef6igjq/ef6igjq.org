A., it's not my or anyone else's place to assert an opinion on what another person's internal experience of their gender is;

B., regardless of your opinion on trans as a concept, it's indisputable that misgendering people is /hurtful,/ and hurting people on purpose just because you disagree with them is inexcusable.

I'll add that I have direct experience with people being presumptuous enough to correct me on my internal experiences. You would be amazed at how many people apparently know better than I do whether I'm asexual. So I'm pretty cognizant of how absurd it is to claim to be an authority on a stranger's brain.
