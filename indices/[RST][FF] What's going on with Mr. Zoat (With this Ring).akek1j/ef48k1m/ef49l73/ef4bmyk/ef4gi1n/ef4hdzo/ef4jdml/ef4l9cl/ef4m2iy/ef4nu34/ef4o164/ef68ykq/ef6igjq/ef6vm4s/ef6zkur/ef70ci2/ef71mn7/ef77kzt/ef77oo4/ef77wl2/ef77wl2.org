You have to change your view about constitutes a woman, your opinion on your own sexuality (am I attracted to women or just people with the XX chromosome) and how you act whenever you meet someone new. Note that the last part can have negative social ramifications if the person you're talking to turns out to be conservative.

It's not impossible, but why would you?
