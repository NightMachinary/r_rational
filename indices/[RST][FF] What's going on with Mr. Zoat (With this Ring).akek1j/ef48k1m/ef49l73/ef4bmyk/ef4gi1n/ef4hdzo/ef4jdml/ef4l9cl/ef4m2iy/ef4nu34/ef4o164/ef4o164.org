I think you misunderstood what I was saying. I'm not saying that every person who misgenders trans people is also personally telling them there are no vacant apartments left, or voting for politicians who want bathroom bills, or whatever. I'm saying that they're normalizing harmful attitudes toward trans people that breed those forms of discrimination.

As for the question of intent to harm, I'll go back to what I said earlier: bigotry doesn't have to be malicious to be harmful. And I think once someone has been made aware that they're harming people in such an easily avoidable way, it's inexcusable for them to continue.
