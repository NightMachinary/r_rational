  I'm aware that there's no one way people dress. There are, however, a lot of external signals people can use to imply how they prefer to be addressed, and when in doubt you can always just ask.
#+end_quote

A. Most people aren't experts in trans fashions and so can identify them by perfume like Sherlock Holmes and B. Why would you ask? Doesn't that defeat the point of communication, that you can just tell someone apart by a description? Arrest warrants don't tell you the suspect's hobbies, they're used to describe someone's physical appearance and most people aren't going to want to go against that when there doesn't seem to be a pressing reason to. Inb4 trans people find it offensive, A. they're a tiny minority and most people don't even care that 70 million falun gong practitioner were imprisoned or killed in China and B. why do they associate their version of gender with he/she pronouns? Why, if your mannerisms conform to one of the sexes, does that require you to have people address you by that sex when for others it simply seems to be enforcing gender stereotypes? You feel like a stereotypical man, great, but most people don't care.

  And since we're on [[/r/rational][r/rational]], I feel compelled to point out that you don't actually know you can always tell someone's karyotype. If you wrongly clocked an XX person as XY you wouldn't know unless you specifically asked "are you XY", and if you met a passing trans person you would just assume they were cis.
#+end_quote

You're kind of making me point for me? If you look at someone and assume they meet the qualification for something, (in this case XY vs. XX chromosomes) and they don't, then of course you're going to identify them incorrectly. If you think they have a penis then you're going to treat them like they have a penis. It's when people get confused that (in their opinion) variable x /=/ x that all these arguments start up.

  I think it would require a tremendous degree of willful ignorance to interact with a trans person for any period of time and still think that's what they're saying. Trans people are very clear on the topic of what being trans is. There are also extensive, easy-to-access resources online that explain it in straightforward terms. Anyone who actually has this misconception could clear it up with a 3-sentence conversation with a trans person or 10 seconds of Googling.
#+end_quote

There isn't a statistic for the topic of conversation for most trans people, but as someone living on campus with a very high proportion of them, they don't tend to spout off their backstories like NPCs in a bioware game. And for those who /don't/ interact with trans people normally, which the majority of people don't because they're less than 1% of the entire population, then why would they google it instead of assuming they're speaking the same language as everyone else? Why questions your assumptions for what should be an open and shut case? It's not up to the random bystander to translate for you if you're giving unclear messages.

  If that were really how humans interacted then we would pull each other's pants down for a junk check whenever we met. In practice, most people have zero interaction with most other people's genitals.
#+end_quote

.....Please tell me you aren't a person who thinks that women don't have less muscle growth than men and that it's only sexism that keeps men and women's sports apart? If you have a penis, there are certain characteristics that go along with it, and generally speaking you can identify those at a glance. That, and nudity taboos, are why we don't check genitals.

#+begin_quote
  The social concept of "a man" is many-faceted and nearly all of those facets are unrelated to penises.
#+end_quote

Yes, but most facets, when separated from "having a penis" don't make you a man by common definition.

#+begin_quote
  but there's nothing that biologically requires it to be accompanied by a penis.
#+end_quote

There's nothing that biologically /requires/ anything because we are solely in the made up realm of social standards! I could start calling cats dogs but if I started calling them that on the street people aren't bigoted for looking at me weird.

#+begin_quote
  I maintain that it's hugely presumptuous to "um, actually" another person's subjective experience of their gender identity, and that it's transphobic to openly and insistently misgender trans people.
#+end_quote

It's presumptuous for a minority to try and change an extremely deep-rooted part of a culture, IE the interactions of the sexes, and assume everyone who doesn't immediately get on board is a bigot. You are the boss of your own body, but you do not get to make up a rule and proclaim that everyone who doesn't follow it is a bigot.
