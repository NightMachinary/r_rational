I think you've completely misunderstood everything I was saying about why it's not inconvenient to use people's correct pronouns. You're off on some weird tangent about trans fashions? My point is that when you're trying to ascertain how to address someone in real life, genitals don't actually enter into that process. You have to go out of your way to bring them into it for the purpose of deliberately misgendering people.

There is really nothing unclear about the basic concept of "a trans person is someone whose gender doesn't match their physical sex." You have to go out of your way to both assume that this somehow means "trans people with penises think they have vaginas" and to then blame trans people for that misconception. Like I genuinely don't know what the hell else they can say at this point, so many trans people have explained it until they were blue in the face and people still refuse to get it.

  There's nothing that biologically requires anything because we are solely in the made up realm of social standards!

Gender identity almost certainly has a neurological basis. It's a mental characteristic, so there has to be some circuitry in there somewhere that represents whether you feel like a man or a woman. /That circuitry,/ whatever it is, is not biologically required to be accompanied by a penis, even though there are biological mechanisms in place that typically yield a male gender identity to go along with a penis. I don't think you actually give a damn based on everything else you've said, but I've spoken to some people who came around on trans identities once they could plausibly picture an underlying biological mechanism, so what the hey.

  but you do not get to make up a rule and proclaim that everyone who doesn't follow it is a bigot.

"Address people the way they ask you to" is not a new rule. If someone introduces themselves as Stacy I'm not going to dig up their birth certificate and go "AHA, you were assigned the name Suzie at birth so that's what I will now call you." That shit is rude, disrespectful, and hurtful.

  It's presumptuous for a minority to try and change an extremely deep-rooted part of a culture

I'm sure MLK and Barbara Gittings heard the same thing.
