  You can't possibly imagine that when people see someone new they don't think "yep, that's the body type of someone with a penis"
#+end_quote

No, I really don't think the penis is a part of the thought process for most people. "Masculine body type," sure. But there are cis woman with more masculine-looking bodies and cis men with more feminine-looking bodies, and people typically understand that and go by how you introduce yourself...unless they're mad about trans people, at which point suddenly they /must/ know your genital configuration.

  For a random person on the street who doesn't follow the news about trans drama, who doesn't care one way or another if a tiny minority are offended?
#+end_quote

If they're going to shoot their mouths off on the topic of trans people ("they think they have different genitals than they actually do!") then I damn well expect them to have done the most basic level of research first. If they're going to interact directly with /any/ human being then I damn well expect them to respect how that person asks to be addressed.

  Address people as they want you to until it becomes inconvenient

Using a pronoun is not the massive hardship you're making it out to be.

  I didn't know transgender people couldn't vote and were lynched for drinking from cis-people's drinking fountains.

Are you really going to try to tell me there isn't systemic discrimination against trans people? I could point to stuff like housing and employment discrimination and disproportionately high murder rates and the "trans panic" defense. But I mean, American state governments and the fed are explicitly trying to legally control what bathrooms they can use and restrict them from serving in the military, so I can just point to that.

Point is: people always bitch and moan when a minority, black or gay or trans or whatever, wants to change the "deep-rooted part of a culture" that regards them as less than human. It still needs to be done.
