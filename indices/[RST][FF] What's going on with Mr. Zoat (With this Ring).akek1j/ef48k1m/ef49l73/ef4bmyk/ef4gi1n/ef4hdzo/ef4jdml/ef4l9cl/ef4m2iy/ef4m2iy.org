  no one is being oppressed by this. No one is having rights taken away from them. No one is being assaulted or (IMO) even verbally abused.

I disagree. When Zoat expressed those opinions, he wasn't expressing them in a vacuum. Trans people are actively discriminated against in employment, housing, etc; they're disproportionately likely to be homeless because of the above-mentioned discrimination in combination with parental rejection; and their rights are constantly under threat (e.g. the bathroom debacle, the military thing). People who intentionally misgender trans folks because they "disagree" normalize the idea that they're deluded/lying, and in so doing, help to foster a climate where more serious forms of discrimination are viewed as acceptable. Little things add up.

I would also argue that intentionally misgendering someone /is/ verbal abuse; it's hurtful speech, that's what verbal abuse is. And I think that reducing the direct harm it does to "hurt feelings" trivializes gender dysphoria, but that's territory I'll leave to trans folks to speak on.
