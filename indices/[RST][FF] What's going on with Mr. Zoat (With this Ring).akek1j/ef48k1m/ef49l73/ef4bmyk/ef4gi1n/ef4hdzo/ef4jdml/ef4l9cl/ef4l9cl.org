  I don't know where you get the idea that "I won't call you a man because I don't think you meet my preferred definition of the word 'man'" is distinct from "I won't call you a man because I don't think you're a man."

I don't think these two statements are much different from each other. That wasn't my point. My point was simply that "not thinking you're a man" doesn't mean that they're necessarily discriminating against that person or group of people, which is generally what a phrase such as "transphobic" describes.

Disagreeing about definitions is not the same as thinking trans people are bad people, or thinking that you don't ever want to be around a trans person.

  Aside from that, I think it's key to remember that bigotry takes forms other than "hate and fear." It's entirely possible to have awful, wrong, hurtful opinions about a group of people without hating or fearing them. "Lesser" forms of bigotry still need to be called out, because they're still harmful and they provide a foundation of support for more extreme bigots.

Bigotry is probably a better word than transphobic for this interaction. Bigotry implies an unwillingness to change your views. Transphobia implies discomfort or outright hostility to trans people which is not what we're seeing. But honestly, even bigotry has some extra connotations that don't really fit what's happening here.

As I said before, I do think you're right that these views are ultimately not good. And they definitely can be harmful to people's mental image of themselves.

But if you look at this objectively, no one is being oppressed by this. No one is having rights taken away from them. No one is being assaulted or (IMO) even verbally abused.

It's harmful because using language like this has the potential to hurt someone's feelings. But not having your feelings hurt isn't an inalienable right. It's just inconsiderate and unnecessary to call someone a gender other than what they would like to be called.

I agree there's nothing wrong with pointing this behavior out and calling people out for it. I just disagree that you can conclude that anyone who does this is transphobic without further context.
