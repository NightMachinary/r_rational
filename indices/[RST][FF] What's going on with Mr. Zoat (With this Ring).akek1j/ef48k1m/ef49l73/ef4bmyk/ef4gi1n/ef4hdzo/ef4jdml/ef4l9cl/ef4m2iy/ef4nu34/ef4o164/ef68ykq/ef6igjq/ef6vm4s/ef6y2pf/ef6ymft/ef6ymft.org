  First, there are documented biological differences between cis men and pre-conversion trans women. They may be neurological, rather than the visible sexually dimorphic traits (i.e. genitalia) you seem to be referring to, but the fact that the traits are less immediately visible doesn't mean that they're less rooted in biology.

That research is still in it's infancy, and yes but they're not the predominant usage of determining calling someone him/her and man/woman, that's still XY/XX chromosomes/penis and vagina.

  Second, even if I accept the narrow definition of "biology" that you're presenting (spoiler: I don't), the culture of the place in which Mr Zoat was posting is explicitly one where gender is not determined by genitalia, so even by your own rationale, his behaviour was unacceptable.

+I don't think I said his behavior was acceptable on that forum, just that it seems an overreaction to kick someone out when they agree with you 95% but disagree on the last part.+

edit: I didn't even say that. My comment had nothing to do with Zoat but the definition of bigotry used [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/akek1j/rstff_whats_going_on_with_mr_zoat_with_this_ring/ef4o164/][here]]

  Again, neither are trans people; they're just not reducing "biology" to solely mean "genitalia."
#+end_quote

No, but that's the commonly accepted usage of it and redefining the word is a long term process that you can't just assume people will accept and accuse of bigotry when they don't. Until now it's never been an issue in "western society", though I can't speak for the history of the whole world, and expecting people to change such a deep-rooted usage of a word so quickly is impractical.
