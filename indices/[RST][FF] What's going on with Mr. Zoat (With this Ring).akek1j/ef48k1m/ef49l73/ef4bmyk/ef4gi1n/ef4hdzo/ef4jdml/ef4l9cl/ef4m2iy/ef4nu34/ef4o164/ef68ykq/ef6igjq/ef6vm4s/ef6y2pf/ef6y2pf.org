  True, but it's a cultural matter of whether biology or self-concept is what determines whether you're called a man or woman. Currently the predominant deciding factor is biology, and while that may change in the future I doubt it due to the sheer inconvenience associated with it.

First, there are [[https://www.the-scientist.com/features/are-the-brains-of-transgender-people-different-from-those-of-cisgender-people-30027][documented biological differences]] between cis men and pre-conversion trans women. They may be neurological, rather than the visible sexually dimorphic traits (i.e. genitalia) you seem to be referring to, but the fact that the traits are less immediately visible doesn't mean that they're less rooted in biology.

Second, even if I accept the narrow definition of "biology" that you're presenting (spoiler: I don't), the culture of the place in which Mr Zoat was posting is /explicitly/ one where gender is not determined by genitalia, so even by your own rationale, his behaviour was unacceptable.

  You're not claiming you have different biology than you provably do

Again, neither are trans people; they're just not reducing "biology" to solely mean "genitalia."
