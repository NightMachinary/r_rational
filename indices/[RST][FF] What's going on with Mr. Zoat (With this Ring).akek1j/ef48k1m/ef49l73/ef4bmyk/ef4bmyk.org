I think it's a more nuanced topic than you're making it out to be. Refusing to use the pronouns they request you to use is not the same as saying their existence is invalid.

Personally I think it's a dumb and petty thing not to call a transgendered person what they want to be called, so long as it's not something so ridiculous that it's clear they're just messing with you (ex: if someone actually did request for you to call them attack helicopter... yeah that'd be ridiculous).

But there's a huge difference between telling a woman "You're a man" than telling them "You don't deserve to exist".

The whole concept of gender being different than sex is a relatively new thing (in the public consciousness) and I at least understand the desire to keep things simple and define gender by physical attributes rather than a person's self-image. It's a natural thing to want everything to be easily categorized.

And honestly if it wasn't for the fact that people feel so strongly about it, I too would like to categorize people simply based on their physical features. It would just be easier and make dealing with people less confusing overall.

But I think realistically, the downside of having more complexity in dealing with pronouns with people you don't know yet are outweighed by the upside of the people who self-identify as a gender different than their sex feeling comfortable. If it's a choice between simplicity and someone's self-esteem, I think the right choice is generally to help that person's self-esteem. Especially when we're merely talking about semantics.

Also... I think I kinda got off topic. The main thing I was trying to explain is that it's possible to hold the views that Mr. Zoat seems to hold without necessarily being transphobic or even disliking trans people. You just have to have values that prefer linguistic simplicity over a group of individuals' comfort... which I think, all things considered, is dumb and petty as I said before. But not necessarily sinister.
