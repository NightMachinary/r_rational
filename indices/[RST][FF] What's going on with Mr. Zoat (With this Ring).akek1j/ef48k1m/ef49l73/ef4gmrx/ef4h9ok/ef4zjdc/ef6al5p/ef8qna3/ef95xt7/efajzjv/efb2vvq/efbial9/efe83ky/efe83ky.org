Interesting. I had to think about it for a minute to figure out exactly what to call you out on here...I think I'm going to go with ad hominem (implying that I'm being dishonest), argument by assertion (asserting that I'm wrong without demonstrating why), and a smidge of argument from (implicitly self-claimed) authority.

Regardless, I think I understand where you're coming from: You appear to believe that Zoat was being (at least generally) reasonable, that the mods were (at least somewhat) unreasonable, and that misgendering someone does not imply dismissing their issues as irrelevant. I disagree with you on all of those points but I can't argue it any better than I already have, so if you aren't convinced them I'm not going to be able to convince you. As such, I'll let it go. You can have the last word, if you want.

All the best.
