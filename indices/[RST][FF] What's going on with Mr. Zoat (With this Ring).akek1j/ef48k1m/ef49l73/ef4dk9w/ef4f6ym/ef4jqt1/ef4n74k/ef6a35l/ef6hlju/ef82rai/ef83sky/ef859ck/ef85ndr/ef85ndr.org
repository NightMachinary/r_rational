If you identify as male then you're male. Nobody gets to second-guess that. You're the authority on you.

It's fine that you feel that that stems from external stuff for you. Your experience and identity are valid. The experiences and identities of people who strongly feel an intrinsic gender identity are also valid, and that includes trans people.

To clarify, gender identity and (social) gender role are different, though related, concepts.
