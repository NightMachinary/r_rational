And if we slip a little further down the slope, aren't all experiences subjective? What does it even mean to "feel human", etc, etc. I'm not saying you're wrong, I'm not saying your position is absurd. But I think trans is strange and fake-able enough that some degree of skepticism about the whole concept doesn't strike me as obviously insane and evil. I'm sure that having that questioned hurts. But I've also known people who felt personally attacked when someone pointed out that they weren't actually a Druid with Mystical Powers.
