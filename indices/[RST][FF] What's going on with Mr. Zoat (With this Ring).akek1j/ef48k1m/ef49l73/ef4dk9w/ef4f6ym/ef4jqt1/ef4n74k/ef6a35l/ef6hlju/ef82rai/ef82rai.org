I don't "feel like a gender".

My experience of gender is that it's a socially constructed fact, similar to citizenship, or eye-color-bucket

The social construction might typically draw boundaries based on brute facts (eg. biology, gps coordinates of my birth place, wavelengths reflected by by eyes), but the social category isn't the brute fact.

We notice the distinction between social-category and brute fact because we could trivially redraw the boundaries of these social clusters by agreement. If everyone agrees, it's perfectly possible to say stuff like, "men are people who self-describe as men, plus anyone who hasn't stated a preference and has with XYZ biological traits," or "American citizens are people who are born in the continental US, except Steve, because fuck Steve."

I can talk about the consequences of being categorized as male. Just like I can talk about the consequences of having a US passport, or the treatment I get based on eye color.

I can imagine having a preference for US vs Canadian citizenship, or liking the social role of a woman more of less than the social role of a man.

But it's not clear what it would mean to have an intrinsically "American" or "male" feeling outside of this social categorization. Even if I felt something distinguishable from "being me" how would I know that Donald Trump feels identically, but that Theresa May does not? I don't have access to their minds.

Other people could have other ways of knowing that I'm not privy to. And that's fine. But there's something alienating about being informed that an experience is universal.
