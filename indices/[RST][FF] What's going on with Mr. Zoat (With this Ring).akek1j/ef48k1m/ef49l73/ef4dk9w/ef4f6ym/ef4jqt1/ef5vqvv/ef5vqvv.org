The thing about the attack helicopter meme is that it is an unrealistic parody/mockery and not a proper argument.

An anarchist might argue that governments are bad because of the potential for corruption and use examples like Russia and North Korea. If they used Warhammer's Imperium of Man as an example then they wouldn't be debating in good faith since IoM is a caricature, satire and not a serious example.
