The guy you're talking about didn't consider himself a cat, he did those modifications because he believed it was an ancient Huron tradition and considered cats to be his spirit animals. I'm not going to get into the rest of this, but if you think that trans people should let allies maintain transphobic views because of a fear that they will retract support if called on it, then you're a damn fool. You are asking the oppressed to meet in the middle with the oppressor because the oppressor might get scared off.
