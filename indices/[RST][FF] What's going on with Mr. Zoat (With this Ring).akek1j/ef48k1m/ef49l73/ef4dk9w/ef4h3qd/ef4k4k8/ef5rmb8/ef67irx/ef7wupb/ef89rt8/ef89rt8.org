Yes. This is primarily a disagreement about tactics. For example, I think comparing people who are 90% on your side to a genocidal terrorist group might be just a smidge counter-productive, what with it making you seem like a fucking lunatic, and making them associate your movement with hysterical assholes. *I* stopped myself, because it would be unfair and irrational to change my stance towards trans people just because one self-proclaimed ally was being absurd, but the history of SRS will serve as a demonstration that that isn't the usual response.
