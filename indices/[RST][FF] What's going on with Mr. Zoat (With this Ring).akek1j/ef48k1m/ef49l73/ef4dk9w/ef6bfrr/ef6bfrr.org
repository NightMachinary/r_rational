  Insisting on using referents based on physical characteristics rather than self-identification is kinda dickish,

See, it's not dickish, it's cruel. I'm cis, so I can't speak to the experience personally, but everything I know (and also common sense) says that transitioning is a difficult process that takes a lot of time, money, and effort and has a lot of social pressure against it that will bring you a lifetime of insults. Making an explicit choice to not use the person's chosen pronouns is saying that their choice is not important, that they're just being ridiculous, that all of the things that made them transition in the first place don't matter.

It's like going out of your way to tell a devout Christian that their god almost certainly doesn't exist and that's a good thing because the Bible portrays Her as a slavery-endorsing, genocidal monster. That Christianity has contributed a little value to the world (beautiful buildings and artwork) but on the whole it's been a blight on humanity (pedophilia, Crusades, anti-science, wars caused by political schism, etc) and it's a really good thing that as people get more educated religion is falling away.

(Of course, the difference between those two statements is that the second one is actually true.)

There. See? I was a complete jerk for no good reason. I went out of my way to be offensive. Do you wish that I wouldn't say such things? Do you wish that I would be removed from this conversation until such time as I could learn to express basic respect towards others? That's how, from what I understand, trans people feel about deliberate misgendering backed up with attack helicopter memes.
