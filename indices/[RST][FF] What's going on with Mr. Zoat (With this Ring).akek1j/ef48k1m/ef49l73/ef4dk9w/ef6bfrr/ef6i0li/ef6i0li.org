  Making an explicit choice to not use the person's chosen pronouns is saying that their choice is not important, that they're just being ridiculous, that all of the things that made them transition in the first place don't matter.

Do you think there's no situation where this is the case? Plenty of mockery falls into this category, and the (obvious and reasonable) refusal to honor such pronouns means that we're clearly not working off some universally applicable principle here. So again, how do we justify condemning people whose standards for using another persons chosen pronouns are a /little bit higher/ than your own?

Maybe this is a function of the particulars of my own beliefs, but I see this issue in general as one of /marginal differences/ rather than /immutable categories/, and I don't feel justified in condemnation for even moderate differences in the margins. It strikes me as sort of saying "15%?! Obviously the capital gains tax rate should be 18%, /you son of a bitch/!"

  (Of course, the difference between those two statements is that the second one is actually true.)

I suspect that many people who refuse to use pronouns see "trans is a mental illness" as "actually true". Trans is fundamentally a mismatch between body and mind. The current politically correct stance is "the problem is with the body", but I don't see it as /obvious/ that "the problem is with the mind" is /wrong/. The former aligns better with my views of mental versus bodily identity, but mental illness is always going to strain that. Would it be morally wrong to cure a schizophrenic? You'd be forcibly changing their mental state, functionally killing the person who was there before. "Would it be better for trans people to take a magic potion that removed the dysphoria, but left the body intact" strikes me as the same /general category/ of moral/philosophical question. Is it customary to address schizophrenics as "Your Imperial Majesty"?

  There. See? I was a complete jerk for no good reason. I went out of my way to be offensive. Do you wish that I wouldn't say such things? Do you wish that I would be removed from this conversation until such time as I could learn to express basic respect towards others? That's how, from what I understand, trans people feel about deliberate misgendering backed up with attack helicopter memes.

No, I'm an atheist, and I'm fine with you expressing your view with no negative consequences. I'd also be fine with you expressing "atheism is a religion too". And more to the point, I see that sort of commentary /all the fucking time/ in the sort of communities that care a great deal about kindness towards trans people. Which is exactly why I find the "how dare you invalidate my beliefs and claimed experience" stuff to be hypocritical. It's certainly not /beyond question/ that the religious person's claimed, internal spiritual experiences are meaningfully real, why should other people's be so privileged? "This is my experience, believe me or not, I stand by my convictions" is one thing. "This is my experience, failing to validate it in any way makes you a /vile monster/" is rather different.
