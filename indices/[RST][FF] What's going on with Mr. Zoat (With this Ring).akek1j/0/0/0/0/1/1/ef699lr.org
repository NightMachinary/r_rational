  I don't know, if you ask me, 2 bans in ~10 years of online presence is about average.

I've never been banned from any site, and I don't think of myself as particularly virtuous. The rules of SV essentially boil down to "be respectful to each other". It's not hard, and it's your obligation to know what the rules of the site are if you get an account there, just like it's your obligation to know the rules of the road if you want to drive.
