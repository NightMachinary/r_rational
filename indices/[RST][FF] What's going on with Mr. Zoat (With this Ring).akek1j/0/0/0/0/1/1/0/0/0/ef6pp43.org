I think you missed the point of my post. Let me rephrase:

The likelihood of getting banned is highly correlated with user activity.

- Lurkers are almost never banned, because they are not posting anything.
- People like me, who are moderately active, have higher likelihood of getting a ban than lurkers.
- People like eaglejarl, who is much more active online than I am, are even more likely to get a ban.
- Zoat is completely in league of his own, because he is ridiculously active online, which also means he has the highest probability of getting banned out of all of us, all else being equal.

Eaglejarl was never banned. Zoat was banned twice. I think the difference in online activity level alone is sufficient to explain that.
