Well, nobody knows how active you are on the Internet better than you, so your estimate of your level of activity is definitely better than mine can ever be.

I also do not say it is hard to not get banned. What you say is true, most of the time.

Usually all is fine, but sometimes moderators get into a strange mood and ban people with little or no provocation. It doesn't happen often, but it does happen, and fanfiction communities, such as SV and SB, are more prone to such drama than other online communities.

Examples of questionable moderation decisions on both SV and SB are plentiful.
