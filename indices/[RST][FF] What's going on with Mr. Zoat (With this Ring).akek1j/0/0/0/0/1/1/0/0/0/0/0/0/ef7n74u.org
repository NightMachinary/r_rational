Any decision is easy to question, especially if it's against the person doing the questioning. My feeling is that the mods on SB are quite hair-trigger and heavy-handed, but the ones on SV are much better. Not perfect, obviously, but better. The only instance of (IMO) incorrect moderation that I've seen on SV was when...I think it was [[/u/OliWhail]], but it might have been [[/u/DaystarEld]] got busted for pointing out that some of the people in the "Why rational fiction is awful" thread were strawmanning rational fiction. I got 25 points for being a little snotty n that same thread; it wasn't unfair, although I think it would have been just as reasonable to make it a warning instead. Aside from that, I've seen plenty of warnings that did not carry consequences and all of the cases I've seen that did have consequences were entirely reasonable.

Your experience apparently differs, and I'm not attempting to invalidate it, I'm simply offering a countervailing view.
