I think the proper analogy would be:

A person who does not post/leave home won't get banned/mugged.

The more often you're outside/you post, the more chances there are that you will be considered a mark/offend a mod.

The more often you go to dark alleys/SB and SV, there more you risk, as the muggers/mods are more vicious there.

One can give the mugger his valuables when confronted/ be civil, follow the rules, and take his lumps when he and the mods don't agree, and then he probably wont be beaten up/banned.

​

See? I too can make up loaded analogies.

​

I insist that "Zoat asshole, Zoat hissy fit" is a childishly simplistic view of the situation.

To me it looks like:

1. Zoat is more active, so is at higher risk of ban all else being equal;
2. Zoat is a bit abrasive, so this also contributes to conflicts that may occur;
3. SV and SB mods are power tripping, SB mods more than SV ones;

You seem to think Zoat is in the wrong and behaves childishly, completely disregarding that mods can also power trip and behave childishly.

​

Also, at which odds are you ready to take a bet that Zoat will receive next ban before Eaglejarl does? 10:1? 100:1?
