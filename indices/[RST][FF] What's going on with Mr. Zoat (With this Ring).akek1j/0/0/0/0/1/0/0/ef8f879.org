True, most people don't get banned every five years, because most people are lurkers, and level of user's activity is highly correlated with chances of getting banned. Trivially so: the more one posts, the more likely someone to get offended by their post.

In Zoat's case his level of activity is very high, so I don't find it surprising he gets banned more often than an average lurker.
