Tbh, what annoys me the most is that SI Paul is acting ooc. He should be able to see intense orange in the guy to return to being male, and intense yellow about not being able to do so. But Paul doesn't use his goddamn magic empathy.

Mr Zoat is also way too sensitive to moderation. Somehow, he /will/ piss off the QQ mods, eventually.

I mostly hope he just crossposts the story to AO3. Even its review system is pretty good, and he can just keep using QQ for the forum format.
