it is true, backups are very important indeed.

and not just because power-mad mods can ban people, but because entire sites can simply disappear. think for a moment, how many old websites are simply gone now? how many fandoms have died off, and their many works vanished like so much dust on the wind? how many servers can fail with no backups, their content simply lost?

finding a good place to post ones own stories is the hard part.
