I suspect that SV moderators are a bit drunk on power.

The first bad sign for me was site-wide scandal about some futa fanfiction blown out of proportion by moderators.

This here is just another example of SV's splendid moderation policies.

My advice to all authors who publish their stories somewhere they don't control: have your story's original source at your home.

Never, ever should you publish a story online without keeping backups.

Literally insane moderators are more common than you think, and your content may be removed (and you banned) at any moment and with no warning.

Keep backups of your content. Don't expect people on the Internet (site moderators included) to behave reasonably.

And, my last advice, keep backups. Seriously. It is very important.
