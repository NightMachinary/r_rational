The forum translates it to HTML and CSS, so you'd need both of them, and the CSS probably has a fair bit of extraneous styling that you'd have to hack out. So far as porting to AO3 goes, /there/ you would run into problems with what HTML they allow and how they set up their custom CSS styling (with a work skin). That would be the case whether you ripped the HTML/CSS, or whether you ripped the BBCode and then put it through a translator.

I wouldn't know the issues without doing it myself, but especially given how often this story uses custom coloring, I feel like there /would/ be issues.
