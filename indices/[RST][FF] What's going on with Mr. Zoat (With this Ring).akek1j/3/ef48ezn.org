In one of the latest chapters, a character gets put in a female body. Another character goes through a whole thought process and decides 'Now he's in a female body, I'm gonna start calling him /she/'.

This isn't by itself a problem - there's a lot of ways that kind of misgendering could be played, opportunities for realisation and character growth down the road. Even if it's never addressed, it's still 'a character' thinking it.

The problem was that Zoat immediately doubled down in the thread itself, growing increasingly anti-trans, increasingly defensive about it and, yes, pulling out the old 'I sexually identify as an attack helicopter' chestnut as a defence [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-thread-thirteen.49418/page-508#post-11963172][in this final comment]].

When it's the /author/ saying this kind of thing in threads rather than a character they're writing, it becomes a problem for the forum, and they get treated as any other person would for making comments like that in a thread. Zoat then threw a hissy fit over the temporary suspension, upped sticks to Questionable Questing, and claimed he was being oppressed for writing a story where a character misgenders someone.

This isn't the first time he's pulled the martyrdom schtick. On SpaceBattles he accrued a whole bunch of infraction points for not covering his spoilers in a Star Wars thread. He then receives a final infraction point for posting risque art of a succubus in a place he shouldn't have, putting him over the total to receive a one-day suspension. Cue hissy fit and claims that he was being 'banned' by SB because the admins were a bunch of prudes. That's how WTR ended up on SV in the first place.
