What kind of event would a partial exclusion not be sufficient for?\\
An exponential effect can just be excluded to not be exponential at a certain boundary.\\
Any explosion/etc powerful enough to destroy all of Aerb can similarly be excluded and prevented from crossing an exclusion boundary.\\
I can't imagine a single thing that couldn't simply be excluded, seeing as exclusions are essentially 'lol nope' acts of God.
