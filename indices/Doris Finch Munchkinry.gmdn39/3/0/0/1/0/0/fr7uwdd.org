I think exclusions /do/ actually stop things that are too powerful from even happening the first time, as experienced by the denizens of Aerb and related realms by means of the anthropic principal: in cases where the world would either be destroyed or mutilated in such a way that Juniper wouldn't be able to have his little adventures, the DM uses a heavy hand to revert things and alter them so the would-be exclusion didn't even happen, so we end up only seeing the resulting world consisting of normal exclusions.
