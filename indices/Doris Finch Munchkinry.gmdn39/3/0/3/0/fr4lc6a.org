Yes and no.The Illusion Magic exclusion didn't exclude things like optical illusions or other forms of audio-sensory deception.An exclusion on the One-handed Skill would more likely cut off things like Blade-bound.An exclusion on Mathematics would probably only restrict the meta-physical hyper-reality bending properties of the skill, rather than the ability of anyone to do math.
