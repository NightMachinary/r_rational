I don't think WtC Universe operates like that. It seems to be simulated only on very rough level with some kind of intent-based option to change it into some other level (see for example Juniper's fight with Onion, where he evaded attacks he could not have knowledge about, because /he had skill for that/).

When you have some stuff and want to do chemistry to it, the system checks whether it is permissible and if so, the reaction happens. Otherwise, the elements just don't do anything interesting. Normal people don't usually need chemistry on daily basis - they need to eat not to replenish supply of chemical elements of their bodies, but because they are hungry (they just have a stat called /hunger/; when it is empty, their stat /health/ starts to decrease). When you eat non-permanent food of duplicated Doris, after a day part of your body probably /would not/ disappear - you hunger would just suddenly increase as if you hadn't eaten anything.

In your case, I would expect that after you react non-permanent magnesium with permanent oxygen and hydrogen, some part of the resulting substance (but not the components of the substance) will disappear - I would go with conservation of mass, but only DM knows for sure. So, if you started with 1 kg of Mg(OH)2 (molar mass 58,3), and your magnesium (molar mass 24,3) would cease to exist, you would end up with (1 - 24,3 / 58,3) * 1kg = *0,58 kg of Mg(OH)2* and no explosion.
