I'm fairly certain this is not how Doris equipment works.

Think about HPEV's first lessons in transfiguration, and then realize that whatever seemingly strict warnings McGonagall issued, they were not strict enough. You so much as /smell/ Doris gear, you've already chemically reacted with it. Say hello to your new friend cancer. Chemistry happens all the time. If the gear removal traced matter down to the electron levels, Dorises would've died out long ago from cancers, especially considering the violent nature of their... republic.
