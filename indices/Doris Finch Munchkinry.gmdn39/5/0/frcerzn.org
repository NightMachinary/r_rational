Good point, this can't be how things disappear after 24 hours or no Doris would consume anything they haven't held onto for 24 hours for fear of poisoning. There's no other way to know if someone is giving you duplicated food or water, which if they just vanished after 24 hours would wreck your biology. I'm assuming magic prevents disappearing chemistry bombs and disappearing poisoning.
