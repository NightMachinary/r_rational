There's huge problems with the "disappears after 24 hours" rule. What happens if you eat duplicated food? does part of your body vanish? What happens to duplicated air? When you combine with other materials, does it slice it up at the molecular level, atomic level, quantum level? so much is just hand waved in this that could go horribly wrong and cause fission/unknown physical reactions on a regular basis.
