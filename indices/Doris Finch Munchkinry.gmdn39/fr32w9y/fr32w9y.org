You're assuming chemistry still works. The electrons that disappear after 24 hours are different from the ones that don't, so they're not covered by the Pauli exclusion principle. This means that if a normal electron and a disappearing electron are in the same atom, it won't have the same number of valence electrons as normal and will behave like another element. This will make it hard to last long enough to build that bomb.
