I think the rules for duplication magic are a bit fuzzier than that. Either the magnesium hydroxide salt will all stop counting as subject to duplication magic and thus persist or more likely (because it is less exploitable), it will all start counting as duplicate magic stuff and all of the magnesium hydroxide salt, including the magnesium ions, will disappear. Splitting the difference, the duplication magic is broken partway through the reaction in a messy but not especially destructive way.

The Dorises are pretty smart, so they might have tried exploiting the magic in chemistry and run into limits already.
