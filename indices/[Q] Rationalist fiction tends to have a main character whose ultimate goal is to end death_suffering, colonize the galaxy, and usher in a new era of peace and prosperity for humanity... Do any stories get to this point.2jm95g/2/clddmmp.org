The problem is that you're asking about rationalist fiction. Have the main character be super intelligent /and/ live in a utopian civilization? What would be interesting about that? There's no point in telling you what happens after the Death Star/Dark Tower blows up except to let you know that the heroes lived happily ever after.

[[http://craphound.com/down/download.php][Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom]] is quite the opposite - The protagonist is terribly bad at life, and fucks up as much as any human possibly can in the world, but ends up for the most part completely fine.

Also I haven't read it, but doesn't Accelerando fit your description pretty well?
