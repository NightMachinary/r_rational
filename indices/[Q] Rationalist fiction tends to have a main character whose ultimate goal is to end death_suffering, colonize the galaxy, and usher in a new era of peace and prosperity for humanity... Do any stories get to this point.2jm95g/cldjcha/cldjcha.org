It'd most likely either have to be original fiction, or fanfic in an existing galactic setting. Otherwise, the basic universe/environment of the original series would be largely swept away (unless the story is more about the characters than the world they live in).

As an example, it wouldn't be easy to set anything other than maybe an epilogue in the Harry Potter universe - the irrational worldbuilding is an integral part of the setting and part of the appeal (especially to kids). You might be able to do it in, say, the Star Wars universe, as the setting already supports FTL space travel, advanced science, and very long-lived species.
