  I'm not going to say utopias are boring, because they don't have to be, but there doesn't tend to be a whole lot of conflict, and conflict drives stories.

Frankly, this sounds to me like fallacy and cowardice on the part of the writers. [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoAntagonist][Plenty of stories]] manage a [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Conflict][conflict]] with some kind of Big Bad to fight. In fact, since real people have a tendency to get into conflicts of some sort over things, you should expect that a utopia /will/ have conflicts: they just won't be /existentially risky/, Save the World-y conflicts. Besides which, that kind of conflict is exactly the kind people don't actually /want/ to /participate in/ on a regular basis.

So basically, all forms of Man vs Man, Man vs Self, and Man vs Nature conflicts that /don't threaten the total extinction of your setting/ should be available in a utopian setting -- authors just /think/ that people would sit around going "ooohhhhhmmmm" like fucking movie-Zen monks all the time because they /haven't thought about it/.
