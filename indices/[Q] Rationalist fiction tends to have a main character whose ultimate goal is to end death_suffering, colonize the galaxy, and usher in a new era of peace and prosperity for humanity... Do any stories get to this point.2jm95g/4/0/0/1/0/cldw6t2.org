I'm not saying that you can't write utopian fiction, I just take issue with [[/u/eaturbrainz]] seeming utterly flabbergasted at the idea that utopias don't tend to have a lot of conflict - like this is some act of cowardice or lack of imagination instead of just being the way that utopias are structured.

The Culture novels are all set at the hard edges of the utopian society, the places where the Culture interacts with other, less perfect societies. I'm trying to think through all of the novels, and I can't recall one that takes place purely within the Culture itself - they almost all deal with how the Culture interacts with other civilizations. And that's because within the Culture itself, there is relatively little in the way of (interesting) conflict, possibly with the exception of the Minds that do all the actual decision making.

Again, I'm not saying that you can't write successful and entertaining fiction set within a utopia, because you definitely can, I'm trying to explain why this is so uncommon - and it's not because writers are lazy or unimaginative.
