Okay. Why can't your conflict be the person in charge of minimizing drama in a utopia? Or, as in Banks, the ones who protect the utopia from the barbarians at the gates and natural disasters? Seems really arbitrary to say it is almost without conflict /definitionally/.

Why does it have to be protagonist against the government, or against someone else in their own utopian society? Those are the only two conflict elements that a utopia stops from being as effective.
