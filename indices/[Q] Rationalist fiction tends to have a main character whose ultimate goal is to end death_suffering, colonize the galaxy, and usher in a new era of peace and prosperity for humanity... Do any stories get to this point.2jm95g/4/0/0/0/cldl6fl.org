When I use the word, I'm thinking, "fun-optimized habitat for people" rather than "conflict-minimized habitat." Generally, I would hold that fun-optimizing the habitat means that a lot of "daily stuff", the little daily subgoals we have to get through in order to have fun, /do/ get minimized, not only in the sense of conflict but in the sense of just making them easier because they're bloody unimportant.
