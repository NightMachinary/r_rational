Note: "gets closest to" as distinct from "is".

Many of those criticisms are pointed out in-universe, either by the enemies of the Culture or people who live within it. But with that said, if I had free reign to pick a scifi/fantasy universe to live in, the Culture would /probably/ be it. Though the humans (and droids) can't do everything that the Minds do, they have it /really/ good compared to pretty much any other fictional society. It's the kind of place that I'd want to live, even knowing that I wasn't the guiding hand behind my fate.

(I think /Star Trek/ comes second closest, but it's never really explained how their government/economy works, and so I'm skeptical of how much that stuff has been thought out, and whether or not it's got an underbelly.)
