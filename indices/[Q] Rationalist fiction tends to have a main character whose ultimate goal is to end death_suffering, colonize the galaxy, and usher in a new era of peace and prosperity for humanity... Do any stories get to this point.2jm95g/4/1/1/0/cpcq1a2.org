  Why is owning industrial or military infrastructure relevant (also: yes they can)?
#+end_quote

Because you can't /do/ anything without industrial or military infrastructure; you have to hang out in places that Minds have already built and fenced off. (And because, in my experience, most people dislike the idea of being proles? I just would have expected more reaction from the readers to a society where we're /lower-class/.)

And no, I'm pretty sure they can't. Am I forgetting something? It's mentioned regularly that the Minds only "give" humans tech above slightly-above-our tech level by building an AI, giving the tech to the AI, and giving that AI the option to follow the human around. (Which is why the Culture's economy and military run on the principle of "persuade a Mind to do it", right?)

  What does your utopia look like?
#+end_quote

My utopia ... well, the correct answer is "I don't know", but we're certainly /immortal/, for a start. Probably resembles Scott Alexander's "Archipelago" a bit, with lots of little clades doing different interesting things and trying out different lifestyles and governments and laws. Universal "human rights" type thingy implemented by a Magically Infallible Authority, like an FAI (or nearest equivalent you can find, anyway) via universal surveillance and omnipresent security drones or forcefield projectors or something. Post-scarcity, of course, probably with heavy use of VR and/or physics-bending hypertech to effectively remove most "practical" limits.

Actually, my utopia probably most resembles The Metamorphosis Of Prime Intellect, if you've read that. (It's not very good, though, so I wouldn't recommend it.)

And, of course, *nobody* is left marooned in realtime.
