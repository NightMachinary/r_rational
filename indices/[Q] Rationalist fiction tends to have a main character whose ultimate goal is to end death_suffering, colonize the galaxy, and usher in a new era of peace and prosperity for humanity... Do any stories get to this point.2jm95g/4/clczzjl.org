Banks gets closest to a true utopia. I'm not going to say utopias are boring, because they don't have to be, but there doesn't tend to be a whole lot of conflict, and conflict drives stories. And for whatever reasons, books that are essentially explorations of an idea or setting without much in the way of story don't tend to sell (though there are a few examples of this working, the only popular ones are extensions of existing franchises).

If you just want the transhumanist happy ending that comes after the conflict is resolved ... I don't know of any. I tried writing that ending once, and it just felt too happy, but that might have been because of the type of story it was.
