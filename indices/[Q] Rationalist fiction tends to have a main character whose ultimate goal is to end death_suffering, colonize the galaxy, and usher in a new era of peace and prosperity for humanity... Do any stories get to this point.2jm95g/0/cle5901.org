If it's okay to start out with that as the setting, then:

/Aristoi/ by Walter John Williams goes on the list. Possibly Greg Egan novels although only /Permutation City/ and /Quarantine/ seem to me to be really good and they aren't set in happyland. /The Golden Age/ by John C. Wright, but the sequels suck. Many different novels by Peter F. Hamilton.

Stories where the protagonists win sufficiently hard? I'm having a hard time thinking of a single one. Some of Alicorn's writing maybe.
