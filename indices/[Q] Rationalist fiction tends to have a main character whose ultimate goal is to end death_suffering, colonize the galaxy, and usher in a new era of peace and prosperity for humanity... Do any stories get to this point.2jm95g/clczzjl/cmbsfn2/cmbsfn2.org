  Banks gets closest to a true utopia.
#+end_quote

It always bugs me to hear this, because it's so clearly a Bad Ending to me. Do people /really/ read Banks and think /that/ is a perfect society?

They life in motherfucking /castes/. The protagonists - our viewpoint characters! - are all from the lowest caste. The one that has essentially no legal protection or social standing, can't own industrial or military infrastructure and live at the whim of their masters, and mostly end up committing suicide in the depths of old age even though *they can cure aging* - because it's socially unacceptable to live. And half of the protagonists are actively fighting the Culture, for various reasons!

Is it because they're the "liberal" faction and the fanbase is primarily liberal, or because they're the most commonly-recurring faction so they get positive associations from Banks' writing, or what?
