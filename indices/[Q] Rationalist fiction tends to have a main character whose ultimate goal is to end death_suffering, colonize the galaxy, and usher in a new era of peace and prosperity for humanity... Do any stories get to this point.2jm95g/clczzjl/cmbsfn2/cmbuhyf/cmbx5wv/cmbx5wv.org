Yeah, /Trek/ is pretty good. Although ... I'm enough of a Trek nerd to be suspicious of the slightly-inconsistent tech level and the opposition to eugenics - whatever force is doing the extrapolating might end up having to conclude there's a massive conspiracy limiting advancement.

I'm less worried about being the master of my own fate (I can always go for an Unusual Life Choice, right?) and more worried by that warship in ... Surface Detail, was it? ... that publicly tortured and raped a guy for days, and then erased his memory. Also, pretty much the entirety of Excession.

They really /aren't/ kidding when they say the Culture has no laws. Minds view humans as insects, and they're no more moral or free from motivated reasoning than baseline humans.
