  I just take issue with [[/u/eaturbrainz]] seeming utterly flabbergasted at the idea that utopias don't tend to have a lot of conflict - like this is some act of cowardice or lack of imagination instead of just being the way that utopias are structured.

Well, if he and I can come up with simple and well-known examples...that sort of /does/ suggest a lack of imagination inherent in your statement. Whenever utopias are written of, they are interesting in some way.

  The Culture novels are all set at the hard edges of the utopian society
#+end_quote

Not quite true, but even Jane Austin novels are set at the "hard edges" of their part of society, even if that is upper class people who technically don't fear for their next meal. No one writes stories about people without problems, just living normal lives, but those with serious personal or external issues that need to be resolved.

/Seinfeld/ personifies this, with almost every problem the characters experience being internally generated while they live in the lap of (worldwide median) luxury in New York city. But they are also the most dysfunctional characters you can imagine, and they constantly rub up against a perfectly functioning society's minor issues and turn them into major ones.

--------------

As for conflict inside a utopia, there were several times that outsiders (like in /Use of Weapons/) were squicked out by the Culture. An entire habitat full of Culture citizens was endangered in /Consider Phlebas/, and their civilization is actively at war in that story.

People have conflicts about time use and the way they personally fit into the Culture. Body modifications exclude friends from interacting the same ways, and desires for adventure and excitement aren't drugged or genetically engineered out of anyone, so they still have them.

  I'm trying to explain why this is so uncommon - and it's not because writers are lazy or unimaginative.
#+end_quote

That is exactly what you have not shown, and what at least I am suggesting.

The fact that Dystopias in fiction are so common strongly suggests this. Dystopias are so easy because everything is rapidly approaching maximum shittiness. The level of imagination required to pull out an exciting story is minimal.

It is, in short, prone to lazy, unimaginative writing, and is more popular /amongst writers/ than the utopian fiction genre.
