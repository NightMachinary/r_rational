We disagree on the definition of utopia, I think. To me, utopia heavily implies conflict minimization, not just for the existentially risky stuff, but for all the day-to-day stuff as well. And when there is conflict, the utopia should be minimizing the drama involved.

But I feel like when you say utopia, you're thinking of normal human society with only a few large things fixed, not what I would class as a utopia.
