The ending following [Said]>[Assertion]>[No]>[Yes]>[Yes] may be the most ethical response but it doesn't seem like the smartest or most rational response as it requires the assumption that the "others" in question are themselves rational. Using common logical fallacies and appeals to emotion in tandem to your facts can often be more effective in the right crowd.
