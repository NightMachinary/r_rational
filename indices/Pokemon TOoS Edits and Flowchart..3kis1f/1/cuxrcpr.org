Enjoyed the new Chapter 1. Can't really remember the details of the old Chapter 1 to compare but what I just read is good stuff.

Quickly gets across some of Red's personality with all the business with his alarm, tugs at the heart when he's parting with his mother, and then the relationship with Blue is distinctly rivalrous, though not a /bitter/ rivalry.
