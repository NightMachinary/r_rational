Yeah, it's a really hard concept to fuck up, but then, Elder Scrolls Online took what I thought was a no brainer (just make it like their main games, but let friends join each other's games for dungeon diving and exploring and whatever) and stripped the game down to a mostly generic fantasy MMO.

Pokemon Go might screw it up by abandoning the main games' battle system for something super simple (select your pokemon, select enemy's pokemon, watch as they deal a % of damage to eachother), or make the microtransactions overwhelmingly onerous: pokeballs for 1 dollar each, some kind of limited energy system, or similar. Here's hoping it's everything we can hope for and more.
