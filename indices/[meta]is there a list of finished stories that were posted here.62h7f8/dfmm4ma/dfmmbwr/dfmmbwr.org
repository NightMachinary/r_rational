I've been cataloguing every short story every posted here as a post so I could make an anthology of sorts. Maybe "Snippets of a More Rational World"?

It's not done, but once I think I've covered every short story ever written on [[/r/rational]], I'll make a post asking about the legality of redistributing what others have posted here as a simple, free epub. Considering the writers in question are all commenters on this subreddit, I can be really sure by asking the authors.
