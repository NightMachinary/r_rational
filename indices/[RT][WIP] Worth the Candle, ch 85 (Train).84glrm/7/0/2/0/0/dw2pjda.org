Well, currently how many people that don't know anything about tabletop or games are actually reading the story?

I don't mind the segments themselves, but they are placed at points there they are not really need at times. For example in this chapter segment about guards and morality served almost no purpose, because it was almost 1-1 recreation of what was happening in the story anyways, we even had the same number of guards in his D&D story. It wasn't a metaphor or Juniper remembering something similar under the circumstances it was almost like "Hey guys do you understand that this is a moral dilemma that is happening right now."

When they are told is also crucial, they seem to just be "shoved" into the story at times. If Juniper remembered some story after or before doing something it's one thing, it would feel more organic. But it was happening during action and disrupted the flow, it's not only this chapter that it happened in.
