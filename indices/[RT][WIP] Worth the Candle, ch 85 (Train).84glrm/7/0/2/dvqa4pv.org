  I think the backstory adds to June's character building in ways other parts of the story can't

The problem for me is. All those things happened in the past, so it actually doesn't build anything. It only displays something that was similar to current situation and often the information presented and Junipers moral struggle or thought process is already obvious from the story itself.

Like, this past chapters and guard fight in particular is clearly the author addressing complaints people had about "murderhobo ways of Juniper and the Party" or "not having interactions with non party members". That's fine on it's own, but with added D&D segment it felt like that point was hammered to intensely.

For example. Did the number of Tuung guard and guards in D&D story really needed to match, so Juniper would recall that particular time? We already had Aumann's guards and Juniper almost killing a kid at that point, he already had that moral struggle and as far as i remember he didn't recall the D&D story when. That struggle to kill frankly was forgotten for a good chunk of chapters and now resurfaced again with the same premise. It's not a bad thing, just shifts are to sudden at points. He goes from killing everything that stand in the way to the goal, to not killing when it would actually put him at huge disadvantage or in danger, morality seems to jump to extremes.
