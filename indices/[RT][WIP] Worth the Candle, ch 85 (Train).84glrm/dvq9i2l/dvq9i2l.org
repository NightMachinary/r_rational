So besides this being an actually interesting and good chapter.

Last time somebody said this to my points about Anyblade transformations.

  No. There is a DM around and he manages what the backpack gives. Seems obvious that he would say no to getting whatever with the sword too. Would be stupid anyblade anyway if you could just make a hammer with a blade somewhere. Or a nuclear bomb with a blade stuck in it.

My response was that "Hammer with blade is pretty tame and doable."

Well, now we have this, so frankly it seems even more doable.
