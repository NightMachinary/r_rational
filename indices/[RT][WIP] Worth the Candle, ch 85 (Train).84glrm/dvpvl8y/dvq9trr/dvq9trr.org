I think they are fine, but their placement sometimes is not ideal. Or they state really obvious things and feel like addressing the readers directly. Them being at the end or start of the chapter would be fine or during some breaking period, but they do break the flow especially if they are in the middle of action.

It wasn't that bad in this chapter, but the worst one for me was Chapter 83.

D&D segment was sandwiched between

#+begin_quote
  “Well, I've got no idea,” I said. “I'm going to shut up and eat my food.”
#+end_quote

Joon thinking to himself.

After the D7D segment it was:

#+begin_quote
  “Mary thinks that we're the most important people in the world,” said Fenn.
#+end_quote

Which led to a whole separate conversation. So i felt confused. Did time pass, did Fenn talk to Mary, did the scene even change, what brought up this unrelated and sudden conversation? The last segment was them deciding to eat quietly, but after D&D insert the conversation jumped into a whole different topic.
