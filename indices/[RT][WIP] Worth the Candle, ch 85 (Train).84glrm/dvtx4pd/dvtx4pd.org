It just occurred to me: if Gold Magic is such a problem, why hasn't anyone Excluded it? I mean, if excluding is easier than literally reclaiming all the gold in the world, then it's a way cleaner solution.

Would excluding Gold Magic (and therefore, in a sense, taking away /all/ the gold) count as completing Grak's companion quest? It'd certainly make robbing gold mages much easier.
