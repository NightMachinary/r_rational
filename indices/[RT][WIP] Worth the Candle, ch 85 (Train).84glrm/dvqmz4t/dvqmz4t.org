I thought this was a decent chapter, although I admit I was initially disappointed we only got a single chapter. I like having 2-3 to read... I think I got spoiled, haha.

- Grak and touching butts... isn't that kind of the case? As I recall, the cloaca is an all-purpose organ for sexual activity, excrement, and laying eggs (at least in birds). So "touching butts" seems actually somewhat accurate.

- This was an interesting way to perform the heist, but not where I had hoped the story would go. I was soooo ready for a murder mystery interlude, especially since I recently finished relistening to /The Adventure Zone's/ "Murder on the Rockport Limited.

- If Joon hadn't been shifting his Level priority lower with essentialism, I wonder if he would have been having so many moral issues about killing those guards. On the one hand it fits his character and his past... but on the other, hey, cheap exp and plenty of rationalizations for it (like some of those mentioned in the D&D flashback).

- Not sure what the guard's deal will be. My guesses are, in order of what I think is likely, would be... handmaid's lover; handmaid's pheromone-slave; princess in disguise.
