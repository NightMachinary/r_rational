Whoever did the pointing should get a pad on the back, it was pretty much the genre I was looking for.

I've been exploring [[/r/litrpg]] over the last week and have been largely unimpressed with what I have stumbled into in terms of plot/world coherence and a liberal use of the idiot ball. Maybe I've been spoiled by [[/r/rational]]. It's been a small sample though so I'll keep digging a little longer.
