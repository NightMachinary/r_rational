/Far/ weaker.

I work with industrial magnets in my day job, and for something like this, or like the Mythbusters example, you have both magnetic poles in direct contact with the steel so that the fields don't have to go through any air.

A layer of powder coating 6 mils thick reduced the strength of a 200 kg magnet to 80 kg. We tested the theory with a few layers of paper.

There's an exponential decrease in strength as you increase the distance. Thick padding, even with huge magnets, would not work well. Especially if his Anyblade ring contained steel; it's closer to the magnet than the train roof and would take his finger off.

What he wanted would be electromagnets and a battery pack. Place them silently, engage the magnet, move up, wait for the field to collapse, and lift silently. That would have been a good test of Amaryliss' engineering abilities, actually.
