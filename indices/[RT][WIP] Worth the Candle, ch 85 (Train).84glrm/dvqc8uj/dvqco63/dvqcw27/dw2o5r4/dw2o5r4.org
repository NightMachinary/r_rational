perhaps no notifications from new threads will pop up, but all previous threads will continue? would go a long way towards letting Joon believe in the world more. Though I think that will push this more towards standard fiction and away from tabletropes which I wouldn't like. I love the game layer in this story and the way the game layer deceives Joon without lying to him. It's very fun to think things through with all that information and know that CRJ is going to surprise me anyhow.
