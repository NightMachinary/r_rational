I am not a native speaker, but I was taught that in cases where it's not clear what you should use you can determine the correct pronoun by removing the other. As such:

The room belonged to Fenn and I.

The room belonged to Fenn and me.

The room belonged to me.

The room belonged to I.

As I said, there might be a more complicated rule I am not aware of, so I would welcome an explanation from someone who knows better.
