Well, can't say Juniper didn't deserve it. If person is a victim of oppression it doesn't miraculously make them good or honorable. By volunteering to help Juniper put himself and possibly his party into vulnerable position and it's natural for desperate person like tuung handmaid to exploit situation to it's fullest. Juniper had absolutely no ground to expect fair play form partner who can't afford fairness. I would be surprised if a new passenger is the only complication Juniper should have been fully prepared for situation of rescuing hostile hostage complicated by traps and ambushes, if he was so insistent on rescue.
