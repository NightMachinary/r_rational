It's not what Juniper did, it's assumption he did. He assumed that handmaid should feel gratitude or they have some kind of contract which oblige handmaid to behave in most convenient way for him, or that most convenient way for him is the one most beneficial for handmaid. That is not how handmaid may see the situation. She is desperate, don't value her life much, and don't feel any obligations toward Juniper. He is just a an element of lucky circumstances which should be exploited to maximum. So she don't care about acceptable risks for Juniper or whatever. Juniper deserve it because he didn't paid much attention to handmaid motivations. If he had more empathy he may have got it and being more careful in his approach.
