Man, the dialogue early on feels stilted, and the fight was so asymmetrical it wasn't really engaging, with the DND segment appearing to try to serve as justification. It doesn't work though, because it turned out really easy to both win and let them live, and the dilemma doesn't really apply.

I hate to say it, but I only liked the touching butts part of this chapter. Maybe it felt like a rehash of previous "kill or no kill" chapters as a whole?
