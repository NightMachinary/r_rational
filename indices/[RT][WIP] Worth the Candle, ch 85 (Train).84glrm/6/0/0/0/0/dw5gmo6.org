First off, Aerb is a pretty big place, so police is stronger at some place than others. (the impression I got was that the date night was taking place in magic!New York)

On the other hand, they just let them there with no incriminating evidence, so the police would probably release them.

On the /other/ other hand, the thugs weren't /that/ murderous. They were trying to mug them, not kill them. Even when he attacked them, the leader didn't go for the throat. They're guy-who-killed-Bruce-Wayne's-parents killers, not Joker-after-he-escaped-Arkham-Asylum-5-times killers. Leaving them alive made sense to me.
