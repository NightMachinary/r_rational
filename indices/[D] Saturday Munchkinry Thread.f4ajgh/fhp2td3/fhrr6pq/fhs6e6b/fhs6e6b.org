In the setting, everyone could potentially learn magic, but 99% probably won't ever learn to do more than start a fire or mildly defy probability with it, the equivalent of a guidance or resistance cantrip maybe. Most magical knowledge ends up being hoarded both for practical and political reasons. Few mages in history ever hit the equivalent of ninth level spell slot because the magic is very wild and dangerous to master, and most are considered archmages around fifth or sixth level slots.

The only intelligent life on the continent are other colonists in different locations. Dragons and some dinosaurs are smart, but in the way a dolphin or crow is smart.

I agree with your ideas though. Underground or subsurface colonies might be the way to go at first.
