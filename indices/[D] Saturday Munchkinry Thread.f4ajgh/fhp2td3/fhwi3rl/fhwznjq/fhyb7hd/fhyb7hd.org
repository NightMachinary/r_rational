This seems like the best option. Name people Richie Rich, Moira Moneybags, Mike Millionaire, Cassius Green, etc. until one or more of them make it big.

You could also try similar things like naming people Timothy Touchdown or Olivia Olympian in exchange for some of their pro sports paychecks.

Honestly, you might have to pay people to take the names, since the majority of them won't end up wealthy anyway.
