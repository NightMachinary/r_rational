You have the power to pick a strikingly appropriate name for someone. However, this only works if they actually take on the name; it's a self-fulfilling prophecy kind of deal. They're normal-ish human names, and you don't know why they will prove appropriate until later.

e.g. a person named Romulus or Remus might grow up to be obsessed with wolves, they might be bitten by a werewolf, they might found a city or a country, they might be orphaned and raised by animals or people named Wolfe, they might found a startup named Rome, they might kill or be killed by their brother... but you don't know which, if any, until it actually happens. And it could be multiple options.

Is there any use for this other than the obvious (selling people new parents, or people planning to change their name, names so that they have a vague nearly-useless insight into the future?)
