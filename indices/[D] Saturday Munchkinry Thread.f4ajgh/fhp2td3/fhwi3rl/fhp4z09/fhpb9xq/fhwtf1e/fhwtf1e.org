So if I want to solder a wire onto something, I finally have enough hands - one to hold the wire, one to hold the solder, and one to hold the soldering iron? I can change gears while keeping both hands on the steering wheel?

This will be so incredibly useful!

Hmmm - can my telekinetic hand be injured? Or can I use it to pick up red-hot things directly? Grab a wire with high voltage running through it without worry?
