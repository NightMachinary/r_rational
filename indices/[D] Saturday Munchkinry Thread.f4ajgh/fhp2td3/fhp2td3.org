You are colonists on a new continent, and the ecology is highly magical. You have access to middle ages technology and a DnD-like magic system, but have no access to your home continent and limited access to domesticated animals. Every forest is a Mirkwood or Lost Woods, every grassland a poppy field or field of blades, and the animal life includes magical megafauna such as dragons and dinosaurs alongside the more modern mammalian fauna.

How do you go about surviving this environment as a colony?
