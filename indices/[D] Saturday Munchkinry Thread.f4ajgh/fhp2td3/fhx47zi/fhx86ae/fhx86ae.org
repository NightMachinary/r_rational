Love it. I'd probably rush mining myself for spell components, and it doesn't acknowledge the issues of harvesting trees from a deeply magical forest, but those are minor details compared to the problems of food and protection.

I wonder how the architecture would be affected. Would they end up with wattle-and-dorb walls to conserve wood and build more vertically, and if so how do you protect those tall buildings from aerial predators effectively? Perhaps concrete and steel would catch on earlier with magical refinement available.
