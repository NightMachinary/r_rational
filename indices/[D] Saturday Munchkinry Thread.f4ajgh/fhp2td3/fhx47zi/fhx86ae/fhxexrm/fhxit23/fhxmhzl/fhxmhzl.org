Don't forget about groundwater and rain. You can get away without one if you build on a hill or slope and direct all drainage that seeps in through the walls along channels that lead outside of the house, basically just using gravity as your sump pump. However, if you're just building underground on flat terrain without any way to drain seepage, you're going to be dealing with endless bugs, mold, and damp socks. Without sump pumps, I'd be building exclusively above ground or on hills/slopes. You can always just heap dirt over an above-ground structure if needed.

As far as territory expansion is concerned, once you can deal with dragons, you can start expanding pretty freely. Those forests? Burn them to the ground. You can make tree farms using benign trees to produce wood instead. The open plains? Easy expansion, just put up walls that will stop large dinosaurs and you're set. You will need a large population with a lot of mages so you can transmit messages by magic to ask people to teleport in to help fight off occasional dragons, but that will basically be the end of your challenges as a civilization.
