The easiest way to conserve materials and improve defenses is to make larger buildings and then maximize your use of the space, like with bunk beds arranged in rows in a fortified thick-walled barracks rather than having individual beds in individual rooms in multiple individual houses. The sleeping space is the main living area that needs to be optimized for security because we want pretty much everyone to be able to sleep soundly at night so they can all be awake and combat-ready together when they're outside during the day. Other living spaces should still offer some security, but they don't need the same level of security.

As for materials, assuming we're restricted to relatively low-level spells, I'd look at stone shape (3rd level druid and cleric spell in Pathfinder), and wood shape (2nd level druid spell in Pathfinder). You can use stone shape to quarry stone fairly quickly. A 5th-level cleric casting [[https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/stone-shape/][stone shape]] could create 15 cubic feet of stone bricks by casting the spell just once. A 3rd level druid casting [[https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/w/wood-shape/][wood shape]] could make 13 cubic feet of wood boards by casting the spell once.

Suppose you want to make a 20' tall 5,000 sq. ft. barracks (a square with 50 ft. on each side, internally, and two floors) with 6" thick outer stone walls, a 5' thick mass of densely packed earth, and then 1/2" thick lumber interior walls, a 1/2" thick lumber floor for each level, a 1/2" thick lumber roof sloped at 30Â° and overhanging the walls by 3', plus 1/2" thick stone shingles on top of it, plus 2" thick 4" wide framing lumber spaced 1' apart to support the floors, walls, and ceiling. To do that, you'd need about 2,500 cu. ft. of stone bricks, 170 cu. ft. of wall boards, 210 cu. ft. of floor boards, 250 cu. ft. of roof boards, 840 cu. ft. of framing lumber, and 250 cu. ft. of stone shingles. All told, it would take about 114 castings of wood shape, and 184 castings of stone shape. Once the barracks is filled with bunk beds, you should be able to fairly easily fit over 200 people inside.

With a barracks like this, the exterior walls would probably hold up to almost anything, though the ceiling might be vulnerable to a dragon actually trying to claw its way through. To reduce that risk, you'd want to build very close to some tall trees so that the building is obscured by the tree canopy and so that any dragon trying to attack it would not have room to move or fly due to the surrounding tree cover. Even simply attempting to land when there's dense tree cover would probably end with the dragon impaling itself on a tree trunk.
