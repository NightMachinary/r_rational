I would start by moving to safer-looking parts of a nearby forest and setting up a settlement on elevated ground close to a creek, river, or stream. The trees would provide a natural barrier against the larger predators like dragons and big dinosaurs, though we'd still have to fend off the smaller ones. The flowing water would provide for both drinking water as well as a natural path through the forest to help avoid getting lost, with an included freshwater supply along the way, as well as a high probability of encountering game animals that have come to drink and/or their game trails. Building this settlement on elevated ground helps to reduce risk of problems with floods or high rainfall.

I assume we'd start off by hunting and gathering food as we go, and we'd be starting with some basic equipment like axes, picks, swords, clothing, cooking pots, waterskins, etc., but if we don't have that, then getting some basic gear such as simple spears with knapped stone spearheads would be step two. With basic gear, I'd then start making small clearings in the forest and carving out trails to connect the clearings together. The small clearings would provide space to grow crops while still affording nearby cover to run to in case of dragons and such, and the process of making the clearings would provide a good initial source of wood, as well as potentially edible roots and tubers.

I'd be very cautious with any potential food sources we come across. If we have anyone who can cast detect poison, I'd want to try that on everything. If not, I would try touching the potential food first and waiting a few hours to see if there's any skin reaction. If that's fine, I'd want to boil or cook it first and then try tasting it, chewing it, spitting it out and waiting to see if there's any reaction. If we don't have cooking pots, I'd try carving out wooden bowls and then boiling the water by putting heated rocks inside. If boiling and tasting the food goes okay and I can tolerate the taste, I'd try eating a tiny amount of it. If there's no problems with that, I'd try eating progressively larger portions of it. Having other people along would help since each person could separately test out the potential food sources to avoid having one person trying multiple things at the same time and then being unsure of the cause if they have problems.

If we do identify anything poisonous, I would take note of it as a potentially useful weapon - a baited trap laced with the poison might be able to drop a dinosaur, helping us expand into the fields later on. Also, if we identify any plants or animals that are particularly tasty, I would make an effort to domesticate them.

At the same time, while we're sorting out what's safe to eat, I'd focus on getting basic shelter and defenses set up. Simple lean-tos with felled debris might have to suffice early on, but real defenses and fortified homes like log cabins would be needed quickly to reduce the reliance on a night watch. The most reliable settlement defense would be set up a wall and moat. This could start with a trench dug along a level perimeter around the settlement, with a berm raised on the inward side. Eventually that trench would need to be dug deep enough so that, when filled, it could drown nearly any of the ground-based forest predators, and the berm would need to be converted into a perimeter wall at least 10-20 ft. tall, possibly using a combination of lumber and packed earth.

Beyond this fortified zone, we might then want to start setting up all kinds of traps. Pit traps along game trails, baited traps for predators, snares for smaller game, etc. The traps would provide a fairly regular supply of food for the settlement, as well as helping to cull local game animal and predator populations, improving the overall safety of the area as long as the traps are avoided. People leaving the settlement to explore would need to be traveling with the trappers so they can be guided away from any of the traps that have been set.

As long as things have been okay up to this point, the next step would hopefully be to wait while the population starts to grow, and then begin expanding the edges of the fortified zone further and further into the forest. As before, we'd mostly keep the trees to both hide from the dragons and create an obstacle for them if they try to attack.

When we get larger than the local water supply can support, or larger than the settlement boundaries can be reasonably made to contain, it will be time for a large chunk of the population to move. The first place to settle should be a nearby mountain. There, mines can be dug into the rock which has been thankfully brought above the groundwater level, and coal or ore can be extracted. Trade can be started between the two settlements, with large and heavily-armed convoys traveling along paths that should be increasingly fortified over time. Ideally, the path will initially be given walls and intermittently-spaced bunkers to hide in. Later, it should be given arched supports and a ceiling, then finally get buried with soil so that it effectively becomes a near-surface underground tunnel connecting the two settlements. With that approach, the predators in the region have nothing left to even notice as a possibility for attacking.

The mountain settlement itself can be dug into the rock and designed so that all surface points have quick escape routes through narrow tunnels to get underground in case of a dragon attack. This way, the settlement can also have surface-level terraced farms with minimal danger. Other niches will need to be colonized over time to gain civilizational access to a wide range of resources for trade, but eventually it should be feasible to get back to a middle-ages level of technology and infrastructure, and then gradually progress beyond that point.
