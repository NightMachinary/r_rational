The most useful D&D-like spell that I can see here is Divination. If you can predict something on the scale of a Dragon attack a week in advance, you can overextend yourself across the poppy fields for farming and meet whatever is coming with your full fortification. Charm Monster, Animate Dead and the like turn Dinosaurs into an asset, and the Fields of Blades mean you don't need mines.
