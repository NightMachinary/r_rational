You have short range telekinesis and clairvoyance.

- Within 2 meters from you, you can see from any point of view in addition to your own eyes. You can only see from a single spot at a time. This is normal human level vision, so no seeing inside closed dark containers.

- Within 2 meters from you, you can manipulate objects. It works as if you did it yourself with one hand and applies as much force as you can one handed. It tires you out as if you did it yourself and requires a little focus to use so it's not automatic.

- Basically a one-eyed one-armed Stand.
