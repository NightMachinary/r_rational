Ooooh, neat. I can pick small things up out of the oven without oven gloves! I can grab and move live electrical wiring! Limited force, sure, but that can be worked around in various ways...

I can probably ruin any electronic device just by tugging randomly at its innards. I can unlock certain doors by turning the inside handle even while I stand outside. I can certainly unlock a car door in this manner (though making the car /go/ is another question entirely).

If I wanted to conquer the world with this power, I'd probably start out by winning money at card games in casinos, in order to obtain financing. Sooner or later the casinos would ban me (for winning too much), but I'd make a fair amount before then. Not /quite/ sure what I'd do with the financing, but I'd be able to do more with it than without it.
