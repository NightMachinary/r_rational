There is huge potential for espionage and illegal activity with this power combination. Sit in a waiting room and read information off a nearby computer while you read a magazine, watch someone input a password from the other side of a wall, get all the answers to a test by reading off the proctor's sheets. Combined with a disembodied hand and a lot of dexterity training, you can unlock doors from the other side to bypass most security measures, disable power grids to entire buildings without effort, even kill people with a thought by, say, crushing their heart inside their chest. A third-person view with full freedom of movement could be the kind of thing that saves you in a gunfight, too.

In terms of benevolent uses, they would be incredibly useful in animal-related professions such as extermination/relocation, wild study, and rehabilitation/zookeeping, all professions where extra eyes and hands are important, and the ability to keep your distance or access incredibly tight areas with no sightline are valuable. They could be a bomb disposal expert or factory mechanic for similar reasons. An interesting idea would be a professional photographer, cameraman or director, able to get shots without rigging that couldn't be accomplished normally to further enhance their productions.

Edit: It should be mentioned that the rules for this power are a bit hard to define. For instance, two meters from youself seems small, but what constitutes 'yourself'? Can you raise your arm above your head to get another half a meter vertical range? Normal human vision is binocular, but is the sensor? 'As if by one hand' could mean 'as if with five individual points of fine contact and one force pane in the rough shape of a hand', which leads to more flexibility by doing things a hand could theoretically accomplish without all those pesky bones in it. I could go on, but I've overthought it enough for now.
