Pretty cool ideas. As for extra definition, I'd say the brain as the center of a 2m sphere, since telekinesis is mental. And the sensor is monocular. I specified human vision so it's not seeing infrared/ultraviolet or micro/telescopic. And your definition for the hand seems like a pretty good interpretation of it.
