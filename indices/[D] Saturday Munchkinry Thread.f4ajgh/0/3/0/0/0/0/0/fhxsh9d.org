I hate to keep adding complications, but fire would be a very poor idea. Without going into a two page dissertation, strong sudden energy input can cause the environment to cast spells, enchant or cause effects using mana stored in the things and materials affected. It's actually why there are so many magical living things but humans are the only ones that can really cast; most living things have common ancestors who were magically mutated or enchanted by volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, lighting strikes, forest fires, and more importantly extraterrestrial impacts like the one that should have wiped out the dinosaurs. The same phenomenon can rarely cause permanent, self-sustained area effects, though more often it does something random like a wide-area prestidigitation.

A forest fire is probably about the lowest level of those and therefore least dangerous, but it could potentially leave the area inhospitable to invasive species for years while the native trees rise from the surviving seeds, possibly with new abilities that complement the magically altered environment.

Grasses might not care about that though, now that I think about it. They'd probably spread like wildfire themselves. Hmm.

Side note: this also makes nonmagical explosives into wild magic bombs. I doubt gunpowder will be a thing in any way we recognize, and thank the gods they can use magelights for coal mining to limit explosions.
