If bunkers are the way to go, using a Mold Earth cantrip plus these methods would allow you to build it underground, eliminating the threats of most large animals entirely. Assuming the plants above don't have magical defenses to protect their root systems(some will, to fend off parasites and burrowing animals), you could set living spaces underground and maximize the arable land you reclaim from the wilderness. Collapse and airflow would be your biggest dangers.

As settlements grew large enough in population and power though, I feel like they'd have to start building vertically. Every inch of land that has existing plant life and animal territory is land you have to work incredibly hard to claim, and magical assistance would lead to better building techniques even if the number of archmages doesn't scale with the population. Multistory communal buildings with robust weaponry to drive off attacks seems like an important step to concentrating a farming bunker into a true town or holdfast.

I can see already that this setting is going to be pretty crazy to worldbuild, with every settlement needing to take its immediate environment into account in order to survive.
