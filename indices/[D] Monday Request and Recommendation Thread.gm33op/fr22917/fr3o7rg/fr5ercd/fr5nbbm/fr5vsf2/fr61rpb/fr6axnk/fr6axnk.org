I agree with that, after all I made a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/bs0f7l/birds_of_a_feather_chapter_37_rtwipff_rational/][thread]] about Birds of a Feather after your recommendation because I thought it was too good to be left in a thread, but I still think telling people up front the status of a piece of fiction upfront is the way to go.

Some people don't want to read work that could never be finished, and yes at any point Wildbow could have suddenly stopped pumping out Worm updates but I think there's a difference between: abandoned, consistent regular updates, often has long absences between updates, finished, and potentially abandoned.
