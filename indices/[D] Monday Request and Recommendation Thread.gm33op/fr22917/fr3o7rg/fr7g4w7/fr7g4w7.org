I haven't read Let Me In 2, The Hazards of Amity or Daphne Greengrass and the Importance of Intent. I'll have to check those out!

If you have non fanfiction recommendations I'd love to hear those. Slice of life romance books are a weird niche that I'm sure exists, but I don't know where they are outside of fanfiction. Books in the romance genre tend to be more drama filled with frustrating cliches and characters acting extremely realistically irrational. Slice of life stories on the other hand tend to avoid romance on the whole.

The only non fanfiction work I've found would be the [[https://myanimelist.net/manga/42451/Horimiya][manga Horimiya]]. Anything along those lines would be fantastic.
