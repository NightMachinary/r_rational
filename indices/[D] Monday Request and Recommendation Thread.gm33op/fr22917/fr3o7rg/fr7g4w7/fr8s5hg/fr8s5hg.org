Mmm, original slice of life fantasy romance? That's a hard ask. I've got a soft spot for some classics (Jane Eyre, Jane Austen, Gone With the Wind) but I rarely read the romance genre. Most of the memorable romances for me don't revolve strictly around romance, and they hit different spots (not in everyone's comfort zone).

*Books:*

Farseer trilogy

Stardust by Neil Garman (movie as well for the Hollywood take, it's pretty good - might as well include The Princess Bride pair too)

The Lions of Al-Rassan

Kushiel's Dart series

stuff by Lois McMaster Bujold

The Books of Babel series

The Witcher book series / Kingkiller Chronicles (both are hard maybes)

--------------

*For Japanese mediums:*

Solanin (manga)

14-sai no Koi (Love at Fourteen) (manga)

Spice & Wolf (light novels)

Anything by Mitsuru Adachi is the definition of slice of life-y romance (manga) - H2 and Cross Game are probably my top 2

A few Ghibli/Miyazaki films have a low tone romance (Howl's, Kiki, Whisper of the Heart)

--------------

*Feature films with an interesting (modernish) take on romance:*

Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind
