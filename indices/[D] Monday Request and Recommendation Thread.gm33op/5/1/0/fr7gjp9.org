It's a MHA fic where Midoriya is the son of [[https://bokunoheroacademia.fandom.com/wiki/All_For_One][All for One]]. The story does a fantastic job of handling such a situation. Midoriya here is motivated to become a hero and be the opposite of his dad. He wants to help people, not hurt people. He and his mom grew up with his dad before they ran away, but there's still a lot of trauma there. The story also does an excellent job of handling that.
