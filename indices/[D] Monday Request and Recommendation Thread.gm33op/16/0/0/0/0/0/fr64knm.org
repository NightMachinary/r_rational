That's fair, there's definitely room for improvement in how that comment was phrased.

I find that generally you need to read a mix of positive and negative reviews to get a more complete picture of the quality of the work, specially when they are not purposely ordered or positioned.

Controversially, imho the classics don't tend to hold up. They were great works at the time they were written, and serve as a foundation to our modern arts but in and of themselves they aren't incredible compared to what we have today, imho.

On that MC though, Will, god I find it very hard to come up with a word that expresses how stupid he gets in service of the plot. It's just too much, he crashes a royal wedding where the guards are prepared for him ffs, it's suicidal to a point he actually dies and needs to be revived by a demi god.

I can't count how many times thought: Stop this MC, go home it takes only 30 mins and nobody can track you, read your master's books, learn some spells, get prepared first. Don't spit on the kings face when you only know one spell, stop this murder hobo crap.

Leave this country, go somewhere safe you can cross the continent in 6h, do a training montage, build yourself up before you do this. It's not as if there was any reason to rush, he had plenty of opportunity to train or prepare, but no he needs to pick fights and cause trouble non stop for no reason other than plot.

I'm sorry but imho, it's not. It's not like these problems are isolated, or happen infrequently. The issues occur constantly, I'd state with high certainty that 95% of arcs in this story are either solved via deus ex machina or caused by the MC holding the idiot ball constantly.
