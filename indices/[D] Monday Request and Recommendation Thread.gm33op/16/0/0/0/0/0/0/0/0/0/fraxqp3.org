  I think even Sanderson wouldn't agree that he's better than Tolkein, that seems like a difficult assertion to support, but I can certainly understand preferring him to Tolkein if you have certain tastes.

Obviously he wouldn't it, he'd be mocked if he did even if he was objectively correct. Even an interesting discussion about it can't usually be had, If only both had been contemporaries. But then people would just cop out with 'you can't objectively evaluate art or assign it higher comparative value to it' or some variation of the cliche that artists and critics often use to avoid objectivity.

One of the things I'm most grateful for in our western culture is our reduced levels of ancestor worship, which is one of the behaviors likely explain our tendency of overvaluing older artists over new ones.

This ancestor worship has, imho, very little value of any kind to individuals or society in general.

  If people are still reading something from a long time ago, there's a reason, and there's something in it to be appreciated. That doesn't mean you'll appreciate it, but it does mean there's something there.

Can you tell how religious that sounds? Likely there's not 'something' or 'anything' there. But just this assertion is extremely controversial and hard to be made, because the idea you hold can't be criticized. This is, imho, the reason why this tendency continues.

You can't argue against the idea, because the general response is "then you're wrong / ignorant / blind, hmph, you uncultured swine" or some variation of it and so the flawed worldview continues and is never dispelled.

It's a bad idea, that can't be killed or argued against, that serves little purpose other than employing literature teachers and justifying the actions of the unlucky people that were caught by it.

This entire tendency is uncomfortably similar to religion and likely survives with similar tactics. Evolutionary psychology, and many flawed heuristics and biases probably underline this behavior, but I'd need an entire article to properly articulate the idea without people being able to poke holes into it.

There's also not only a much larger number of people alive today, but also a higher rate of education, and knowledge. Which statistically almost guarantees that the best artists we have today are better than most that came before. There's more people in china than native english speakers, statistically all things being equal, there's likely better literature being produced and consumed in china, india, and the rest of the world than what we ever going to be exposed to..

PS. These old artists we're talking about held a myriad of very offensive and unacceptable ideas and views. People that if were alive with the same opinions today would be worst than most neonazis. It makes very little sense to worship, venerate or to put them in any sort of pedestal. We can and should appreciate their contributions, innovations, history, and work but that's about it.
