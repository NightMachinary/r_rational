Let me start by saying I don't disagree with any of the statements you've made there. You seem to have assumed I was talking more generally, when I was arguing against the argument or idea I presume you hold.

​

My main starting points were, my perception that you overvalue Tolkien, with one of the main reasons being, from what I can tell, the fact that he is from a historical time and therefore has some prestige current authors still don't.

​

Second as you got more broad in your comment with historical literature and the perception of a non measurable characteristic some of them have that inherently puts them into a higher quality tier than things of equal or superior qualities we currently have.

​

I addressed this idea broadly, and argued against the idea itself rather than the people that hold it. Addressed how the idea propagates, it's utility or lack thereof and the methods it defends itself with.

​

Then I expressed concerns over the solipsism english literature scholars tends to have. And gave evidence against it.

​

Lastly, I gave a nominal argument against consumption of content made by people that think or thought black people are inferior, or women are only fit to breed in a more concise less explicit manner.

​

The main thing I was interested in following up on, that I thought up after commenting was: Did you notice that you had no points in favor of Tolkien vs Sanderson other than better prose and other slightly notable traits that are not necessarily related to his literary work ?

​

That's interesting to me, you seem 100% sure Tolkien is inherently better, but the best points you can come up with is his prose, knowledge, and the tendency of some of his tangential work to be assigned to students, which only happens because he's now a historical figure.

​

On that note though, I find english prose lacking in general because I see it as a semi creole language. Which after some [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_English_creole_hypothesis][googling]] seems to be a discussed hypothesis among linguists, I doubt many english linguists like the idea though given the implications. It's one of the main reasons most foreign works don't translate well into english the language is too streamlined.

​

The only other point I'd like to make in response is, personally I tend not to read new releases. I find it more productive to wait 3-5 years, so the actually interesting, relevant and useful content can be filtered out.
