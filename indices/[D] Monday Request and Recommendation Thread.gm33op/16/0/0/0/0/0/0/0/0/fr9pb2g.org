Seems likely that we value different things in our literature. Tolkein has an incredible knowledge of actual folklore and linguistics, if you're familiar with those traditions what he's created is shockingly rich, and he's a miles better prose stylist than Sanderson, who can at best be described as workmanlike. Tolkein would have been notable just for his scholarship even if he'd never written a word of fiction, his essay on Beowulf is commonly assigned. I think even Sanderson wouldn't agree that he's better than Tolkein, that seems like a difficult assertion to support, but I can certainly understand preferring him to Tolkein if you have certain tastes.

I think you're right that lit tech (for lack of a better term) does improve over time, for a certain value of improve. What the past has to compensate is an extremely beneficial form of survivorship bias. If people are still reading something from a long time ago, there's a reason, and there's something in it to be appreciated. That doesn't mean you'll appreciate it, but it does mean there's something there. Fully appreciating a lot of period literature often asks for some background or experience in reading similar works, and that's a big up-front cost that many are not willing to pay. I doubt many on this sub enjoy, for example, Pride and Prejudice, but it's essentially a perfect novel. What this sub has built as a framework, and what it enjoys, is pretty orthogonal to what makes it perfect, and rich, and valuable.

There's a two cultures thing (C.P. Snowe) going on here. I'm stuck in two worlds, a humanist tradition and a technical tradition (I'm a humanist and also a programmer). My humanist friends and colleagues, reading the stuff enjoyed here, would think it was unadulterated trash. My programmer friends and colleagues, or many here, think that the broader literary tradition is posturing, or irrelevant. I can model both internally, which makes a lot of situations painful if I'm wearing the wrong hat. The humanists feel awkwardly limited in many contexts, and you all feel awkwardly limited in others. I kind of want to smack you all with the humanist mackerel, and crack the humanists over the head with the slender wand of technical understanding. But, though I could not and will not give up either tradition, being steeped in both is hard enough that I don't really wish it on anyone. IN genral, as people age, they tend to get a little more into the humanist frame of mind, so maybe this will be a thing for some of you. Or not.

That's where I'm coming from, anyway.
