Seems like a strong reaction. The goodreads reviews seem pretty universally positive, which, frankly, is likely unwarranted, but certainly not supporting your position. (4.5 stars and ~150 full text reviews, I'd personally give this a 3.5 or so but I tend to be harsh) The main character is kind of awkwardly principled, but once you accept that he's going to take disproportionate risks to save lives (admittedly, perhaps, not the most rational long-term calculation), most of his decision-making process makes sense. Perhaps the biggest lapse is in the first book, where he goes off to fight in a war, but, eh, a 16 year old in a medieval setting probably would do that, and when he does stupid things there are usually consequences. If I had to offer a more serious critique of the book, it would be in the prose...some of the exchanges, especially when the characters are joking, are pretty stilted. But people around here tend to be critical of plot and not of prose, your comment being a pretty strong example. :)

Anyway, not a full-throated recommendation, but not everything can be WTC. (Unfortunately.)
