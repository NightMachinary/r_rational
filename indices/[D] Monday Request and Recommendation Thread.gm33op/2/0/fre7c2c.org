I feel like that's more a problem of mediums and audience size than it's about this subreddit in particular. The low end budget for producing a rational webserial is the only the used time whereas practically every other medium has a high production cost, and while making a story rational by filling in naturally occuring secondary effects from the world and having the characters be consistent has some cost it's not even clear if it would increase the audience.

That's a long way of saying that I like the idea of having some colaborated source for non-written rational stories but I can't think of many off hand.
