Some recommendations:

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/31919/muds-mission][Mud's Mission]]: I very nearly posted this as a top level recommendation, but due to the weird way that RR works it's actually better to do that on Wednesday or so once the story's released to Trending. Suffice it to say that if you're on this subreddit and you're not allergic to litrpgs you'll probably enjoy it.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/30380/jayke-cipher][Jayke Cipher]]: another entry in the "litrpg protagonists with unlikely names" genre. Not quite top level post material, but the main character is fairly rational. Does a little bit of the "programming is magic" thing, but I'd like more.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/27456/castle-kingside][Castle Kingside]]: I've recommended this before but it just came back from hiatus (maybe). Uplift Isekai, starts out super grimdark but mellows out a little bit.
