I tried She-Ra, but I couldn't get into it. The characterization was too strong for me, and the development didn't feel that natural.

On the flip side, on Netflix, I've been having a lot of fun watching [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scooby-Doo!_Mystery_Incorporated][Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated]] which I think is so much better than it has any right to be. The pitch: your normal mystery shenanigans, with over the top tech, an ongoing epic storyline, and character development.
