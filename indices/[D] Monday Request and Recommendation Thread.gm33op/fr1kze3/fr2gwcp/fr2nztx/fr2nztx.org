I would argue against comparing it to Avatar.

She-Ra has legit friendship magic and somewhat nebulous magical rules.

Avatar does not have friendship magic beyond following a group of kids who trust one another.

Both are kids shows, and do focus on the characters quite Abit more than typical, enough so that you by halfway through the show can guess fairly correctly what someone is going to do.

She-Ra is good, and it ties up it's relationships nicely. I just feel like it's more a 'kids' show when compared to Avatar which is only really kiddy in season 1. Even if both shows avoid blood / gore and the like.

Might be nostalgia goggles, can't really look back on She-Ra yet. Just finished that.
