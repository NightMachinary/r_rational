  I think it's fair to say that it's quite hard/inefficient to find recommendations for any media except written fiction on this subreddit. (E.g., anime. manga, movies, etc.) Do you guys think it would be a good idea to create a Google Docs or some similar online colab system for these media and put that in the weekly rec threads?

  On a sidenote; If we could create a rating mechanism like IMDB things could potentially be better. IMDB's model is much more efficient than sifting through lots of recommendations, though the ease of "contributing" might dilute our niche. Can we emulate a rating system via Google Sheets?

I agree, but the internet is vast, and there should be SOME content somewhere that is half decent. The colab docs make those few resources easy to find.
