I'd like to recommend what I consider the most interesting and clever isekai series I know of. It's called [[https://kitsu.io/anime/juuni-kokuki][12 Kingdoms]], and it's about a woman who suddenly finds out that she was actually the ruler of one of the 12 kingdoms in the other world! She decides to follow the tall attractive guy into the portal, but trips and lands several kingdoms away from her own, having to struggle to eventually make her way towards it. It's rational in the sense that Madoka is rational: it carefully maintains internal consistency, and presents realistic consequences and implications for events, while giving different "ideologies" charitable depictions.

Beyond just being a well-paced and interesting take on the genre, it also:

1. Features likable, humble, and/or interesting main characters.
2. Elaborates on a rich and interesting world.
3. Carefully avoids contrivances to solve plot points.
4. Has the protagonist be rewarded for acting rationally.
5. Has no infuriating tension caused by immature main characters.

Unfortunately, it ends very suddenly and unsatisfyingly, and the plots following the coronation are significantly less interesting, but I still found it greatly enjoyable. The show is currently available on Crunchyroll, although watching anime through alternate means is generally accepted within the community.
