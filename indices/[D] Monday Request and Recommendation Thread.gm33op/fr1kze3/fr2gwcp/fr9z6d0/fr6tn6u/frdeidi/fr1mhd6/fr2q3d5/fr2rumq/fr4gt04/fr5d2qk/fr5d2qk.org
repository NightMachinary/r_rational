The author of Companion Chronicles makes a few recommendations [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/companion-chronicles-jumpchain-multicross-si-currently-visiting-intermission.787978/page-35#post-65027499][here]]. (To avoid sockpuppeting, I should mention that one of the listed stories is my own. It isn't really written with this subreddit in mind, though.)

There's a complete index of jumpchain stories [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17g1y3hxKkn3WOhS3CqWy1yJJQsJqm1jmSjn49NER-ks/edit?usp=drivesdk][here]]. It's not filtered by quality, but it trims down the SB list by removing snippets, so it's an option to search through.

That's all I can think of, except to second (or third, or fourth) Companion Chronicles for anyone undecided. It's very good.
