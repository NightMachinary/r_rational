I don't know where I stated I dislike 'fancy pants' literature, for you to repeatedly imply that I do. Personally I'm neutral towards literature in general, although I do prefer non fiction, what I'm criticizing is it's tendency of overvaluing past authors over better or equal current ones.

​

I've read most of those authors, Sanderson and Tolkien are just what came to mind at the time and became the subject of the discussion. I may be elevating Sanderson because the last book of his I read was fantastic and fresh on my mind, you could be doing the opposite though.

​

Tolkien is and will continue to be overrated in scifi fantasy circles, imho. Your points failed to convince me, because they were mostly unrelated to his works but focused on influence and other factors that don't correlate with their quality.
