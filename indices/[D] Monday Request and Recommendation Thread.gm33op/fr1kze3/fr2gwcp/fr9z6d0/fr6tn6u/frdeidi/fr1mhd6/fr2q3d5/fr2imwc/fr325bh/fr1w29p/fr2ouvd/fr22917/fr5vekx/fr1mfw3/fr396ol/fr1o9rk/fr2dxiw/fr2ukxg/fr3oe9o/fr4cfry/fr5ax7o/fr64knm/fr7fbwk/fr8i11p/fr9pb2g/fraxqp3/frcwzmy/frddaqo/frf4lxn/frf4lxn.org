All right, though the general case seems the interesting branch of the conversation here. I don't think I have the elevated opinion of Tolkein that your'e assuming I do. There are plenty of contemporaneous writers who could go toe-to-toe with Tolkein, though perhaps not along the extremely specific dimension along which he's hyperdeveloped. Confining myself to science fiction and fantasy, LeGuin is a better prose stylist, Bakker wrestles with bigger ideas, and Delangy engages pretty damn powerfully the issues of identity that you brought up in your post. It's a little pointless to compare writers directly in general terms, but there are few areas where Tolkein couldn't be matched up to a contemporary writer and come off the worse.

Tolkein gets to be remembered because he made an extremely credible case that the embarrassing parts of stories, the parts the facy pants you dislike so much in the literary establishment like so much, are critical and important. He makes that case explicitily in Beowulf: the Monsters and the Critics, and LoTR extends that case by creating something that has the weight of that tradition, gives it the cast of what was going on at the time (WWII), and making it all work. The fact that LoTR is legible at all, in the sense of the culture making heads or tails of it, is genius. That kind of work leaves a mark, one way or another, if you remotely know what you're doing, you have to deal with that tradition...reject, embrace, extend, condemn, whatever. So Tolkein isn't just a writer in isolation, partly you read him because writers working in that tradition that come after are responding to him, and knowing what they're responding to enriches the whole enterprise of reading fantasy, and to a lesser extent some other contemporary genres. But you also read it at least int he case of Tolkein, because iit really holds up The struggle with the ring, the pastoral vs. industrial setting, the memorable and now archetypical characters (Frodo, Gandalf, Gollum, maybe Aragorn/ Boromir), that stuff speaks to people and speaks about things that matter and will continue to matter.

Sanderson is just not that. He doesn't even stack up to his contemporaries, and if you think he does, you might be missing out on some really good fantasy. Abercrombie writes more memorable characters. Rowling writes really tight, Wodehouse-esque plots. Erikson does better worldbuilding. (Sanderson doesn't really do history or anthropology, and it makes elements in his words feel shallow.) Kay writes stuff that coheres around strong themes. Almost all of these people (maybe not Erikson...) write better prose. Sanderson does excel at crating a system, sticking to it, and playing it out in the plot, and I like that, but he'd need to shore up in many areas to go toe to toe with his contemporaries, let alone Tolkein, who broke all this ground in the first place.

It doesn't really matter for any of this, but Tolkein doesn't really have a ton of cachet in academic literary studies, though that may or may not be changing. He still has reputation as a medievalist. I'd recommend the essay I mentioned above, you can read it here, if you take a notion, though it seems fairly likely you'd hate it. :) But he's actually making a case against the snobby readings you dislike.
