I read a manga called Battle in 5 seconds after start (I may have made a mistake with the name) and the characters had unusual abilities. The MCs ability was the most unusual though : whatever his opponent thinks his ability is. So the MC had to use his brain alot in order to use his power properly. It reminded me of Stands in JoJo and their weird powers.

I'm looking for novel, web series, manga etc that has a power system like this with unusual abilities . Where winning a fight isn't just about whose ability is stronger but rather, how well you can use your ability.
