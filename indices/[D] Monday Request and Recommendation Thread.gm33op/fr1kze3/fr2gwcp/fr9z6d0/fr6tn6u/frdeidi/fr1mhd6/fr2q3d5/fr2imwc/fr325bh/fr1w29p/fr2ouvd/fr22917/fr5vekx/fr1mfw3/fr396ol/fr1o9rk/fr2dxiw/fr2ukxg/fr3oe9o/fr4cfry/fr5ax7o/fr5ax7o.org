Eh, that's a reasonable criticism. Maybe I've read too many 19th-century biographies, but a certain suicidal streak tends to dramatically increase the chance someone is written about. And you can imagine that an athropogenic principle is in place...if the character dies, you're not reading about them. But even given those justifications, he's still pretty suicidal. Still, I'd actually suggest this series is a cut or two above what usually gets recommended here.

Seems pretty tautological to say read critical reviews to get critical reviews, and there seems no reason to privilege them without a preexisting opinion about the book. If one went and read Goodreads reviews as you recommended, they'd largely or even overwhelmingly see positive reviews. Honestly, you see more poor reviews of Worth the Candle on sites where it is posted that allow comments, or, say, literary classics on Goodreads, so I wouldn't credit reviews except as judged holistically and in a broader context of who is attracted to posting on a specific book. In general, I'd say gesturing toward Goodreads reviews is pretty low value compared to articulating an opinion yourself, which can, at least, start an interesting back-and-forth.

Pushing back on your strong reaction had little to do with anti-recommending the book, which is fine---it's pretty mediocre unless the premise appeals to you---but the language chosen.

  Sorry but no. This is a big stay away, not recommended story.

This strikes me as a bit unproductive, and maybe even makes it sound like the books have some kind of objectionable content. The MC can hold the idiot ball in a few places and the books can still have chracteristics (hard magic system, progression, research) that this sub enjoys.
