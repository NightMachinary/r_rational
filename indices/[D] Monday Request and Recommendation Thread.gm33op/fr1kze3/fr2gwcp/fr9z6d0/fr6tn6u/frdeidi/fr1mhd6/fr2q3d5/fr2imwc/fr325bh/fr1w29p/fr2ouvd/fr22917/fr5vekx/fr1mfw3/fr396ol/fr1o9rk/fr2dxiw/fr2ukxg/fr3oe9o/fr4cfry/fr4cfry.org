I thought I was fairly mild, but I can see why you'd see it as a strong reaction. It's a 2.5/5 book series, imho and I would avoid recommending it to others because of it.

You need to look at the negative reviews to see the criticism, but I assume you didn't know that, instead this having an ulterior motive. There are a few informative reviews in the first page, they aren't hidden.

The MC does plenty of suicidal things, he does it so often I lost count, and 90% of the time he's saved at the last minute by a demi god that's somehow his aunt, grandpa or grandma (I know they aren't actually related btw). Almost all conflicts are solved by deus exmachina, and virtually all of those are of his own creation because the plots needs him to be stupid.
