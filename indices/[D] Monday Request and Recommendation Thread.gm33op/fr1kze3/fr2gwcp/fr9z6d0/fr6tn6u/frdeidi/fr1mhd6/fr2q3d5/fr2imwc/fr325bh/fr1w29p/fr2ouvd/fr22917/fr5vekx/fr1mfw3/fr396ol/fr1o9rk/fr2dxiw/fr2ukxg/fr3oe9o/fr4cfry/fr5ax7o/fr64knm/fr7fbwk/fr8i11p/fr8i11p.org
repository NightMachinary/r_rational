I'm of the opinion that writing 'technology' improves over time and so do writers, and no I don't mean computers. I mean writers building and improving on what came before.

For instance, this may be controversial, but Brandon Sanderson is better than Tolkien in pretty much every aspect, imho. Not necessarily because his brain is exceptionally large, but because he's standing and building on the shoulders of giants like Tolkien and others that came after him.

Also authors from earlier times tend to have very harmful worldviews like racism, sexism, homophobia etc. I don't judge their inherent characters on their views because of the times they lived in, but at the same time I'd be hard pressed to read a modern writer with those opinions, and I don't think it's fair for them to get an exemption from that just because they lived earlier.
