It's not even a hard magical system, the limitation is spells use mana, but the MC doesn't care about it because he can just absorb mana from the environment passively to a degree so high it makes him almost immune to hostile magic.

It's not brandon sanderson, that has rules or anything. It's just generic magic where mana has a different name and spells can do basically anything with enough mana. It's more structured than lower quality stuff, where magic is often the deus ex machina, but it's not a 'hard magic system', maybe medium, but not hard.
