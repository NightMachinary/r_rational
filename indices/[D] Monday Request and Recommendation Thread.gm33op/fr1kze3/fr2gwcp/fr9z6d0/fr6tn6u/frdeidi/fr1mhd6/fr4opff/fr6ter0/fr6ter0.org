Could you quickly describe what it's about, what exactly is the premise (aside from Midoria's quirk), and why did it engage you? You can spoiler-tag stuff if necessary, assume that I know BNHA.

Neither your nor [[/u/skytroupe]]'s review give me much information, and the summary that is simply an outtake from the fic gives me even less.

Thanks in advance!
