I started reading [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/27325/framework-monsters-legends][Infinite Realm: Monsters and Legends]] a while back, and I'm surprised at how competent it is. It's a litrpg/xianxia story with multiple main characters, with proper character development and pretty decent characters overall. The premise is that the system apocalypse happens on Earth, 10 years after which the most powerful 10,000 people are teleported to the Infinite Realms, which is literally an infinite plane (think minecraft). There's much more but it's all explained pretty well in the story. The story starts off with two main characters, Ryun and Zach, who are the two (2) survivors of their Earth (there are multiple).

What I liked about this story is that the power system is very consistent, and the worldbuilding has been thoughtful so far. The characters aren't cardboard cutouts and actually have motivations and personalities. I was a big fan of how one antagonist solved his problems in the end of Ryun's arc, which made sense given his motivations. While the main characters start off OP, it's evident once they arrive on the infinite realms that they're still basically ants compared to the truly powerful people. Overall it's pretty competent, and I recommend.
