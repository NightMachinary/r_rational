Brandon Sanderson is an intelligent author that can actually pull off plot twists, with fair who done it, that intelligent people can't tell from a mile away. His books start slow though.

​

Book of the Ancestors, trilogy is very good. Very far future universe is dying, very few stars left and of those most are old, humans regressed to a middle ages tech. The author is intelligent similar to Brandon, but his other books are very edgy and your mileage may vary with them. Thankfully he puts it on the table right away, so if it isn't your thing you can drop it without wasting time.

​

Other than that, they are hard to find, their distribution follows general IQ distribution and you'd have more luck in other genres like non fiction and scifi.
