  I feel like it takes quite a bit of mental yoga to be able to distance yourself from yourself to the point where you can write a self-insert story where, in a very real sense, your SI is not the main character.

There was this one ASOIAF SI where the SI takes over the body and memories of Robert Baratheon after he first sits on the throne, and while he could still be considered the main character of the story, what makes ot interesting is that je is never the viewpoint character.
