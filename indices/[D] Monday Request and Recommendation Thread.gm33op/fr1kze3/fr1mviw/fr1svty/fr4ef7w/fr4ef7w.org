Thanks for the recommendations. I am reading Jayke Cipher first and while I enjoy the story I do have some complaints.

I find that the protag makes awfully suboptimal decisions. He doesn't write down his code on paper. He doesn't try to store information from his code anywhere. He doesn't use his safehaven properly as a portable hole. He doesn't use that his shields can affect him including giving him flight, cushioning his falls, shoving him inside his safehaven in a pitch, and so forth. He doesn't make any code-analysing code for debugging.

It bugs me that the Coterie supposedly is the peak of arcane research but they don't test on anything related to arcane research during their testing process.

It's also a little unclear to me why the protag keep putting himself in life threatening battles. Even buying that getting into the Coteria is worth the level of risk, there is no obvious reason why he needs to do it now instead of training and examining his code magic until he's actually competent. This is someone who bunkered down for years to avoid the monsters outside.
