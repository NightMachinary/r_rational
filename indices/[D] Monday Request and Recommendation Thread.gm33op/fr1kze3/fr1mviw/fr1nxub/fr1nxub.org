That's true at first, but IMO the MC's poor choices mostly come from the fact that he's in an entirely outside context situation - not only is he in a magical world, he's also /destitute/.

I think the second of these two problems is actually the harder one for the MC to overcome. He starts acting like a storybook thief / beggar, largely because he has no other idea what else he could do. It goes poorly for him.

The parts this subreddit is interested in don't really kick in until the end of the first arc, when the MC has some resources and is more able to act in the middle/upper class professional milieu that he's accustomed to.
