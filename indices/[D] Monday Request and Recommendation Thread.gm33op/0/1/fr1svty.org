Didn't think Jayke Cipher was very good, within about 3 chapters he's given 3 of the most OP powers ever. So the author either needs to escalate a massive amount or just make him dumb to introduce any tension into the story.

Also the writing seems off to me and reminds me of other bad litrpgs I've read.
