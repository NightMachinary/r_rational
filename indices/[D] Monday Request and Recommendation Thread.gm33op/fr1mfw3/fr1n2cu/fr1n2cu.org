Standard answer for 3 is [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25137/worth-the-candle][Worth the Candle]]. The signal-to-noise ratio seems to be quite low for the genre, but WtC is wonderful. I just caught up with it a couple of days ago. Warning, it's quite huge, well over a million words and probably going to be close to 2 mil when it's done, going by in-story hints.
