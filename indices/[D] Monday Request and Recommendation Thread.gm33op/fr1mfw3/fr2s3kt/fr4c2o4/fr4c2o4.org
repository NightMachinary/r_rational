Yup, second these. Threadbear is also quite good (not particularly big-brain, but good), and is complete (EDIT: you may have to find it via an archive somewhere, or buy a published version). I'm also a big fan of [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-daring-synthesis-worm-the-gamer.607375/reader/][A Daring Synthesis]], but your mileage may significantly vary.
