It's a comedic xianxia set in modern day about an ordinary college student who accidentally gets added to a secret internet chat room used by a group of cultivators. Using this knowledge, he sets out to become one himself.

The story is... not especially rational in any sense, but it /is/ fairly fun. It probably helps if you're familiar somewhat with the tropes and genre that it's parodying, but I imagine it would be a decently fun read even without.

Another comedic take on the genre is [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28601/arrogant-young-master-template-a-variation-4][Arrogant Young Master Template A]], about someone getting reincarnated into a doomed "young master" role rather than a heroic protagonist. It's a bit more interesting and rational story than the above, though nowhere near as long.
