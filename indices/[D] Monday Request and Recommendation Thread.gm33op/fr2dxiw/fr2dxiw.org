Just caught up with the Art of the Adept series that starts with [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51279226-the-choice-of-magic][The Choice of Magic]]. The premise is that, in a high fantasy setting, a magical shortcut has made wizards forget the real ins and outs of doing magic. The MC is trained in the older magic, and is set against the king, who benefits from the magical shortcut being the primary way magic is done.

The author is a mediocre writer who has ground out enough fantasy novels at this point that this series is actually pretty decent. The magic system is hard, the main character is effective but set against strong foes, and his powerups come from training, research, crafting, and alliances, which make them feel earned.

Anyway, this isn't Joe Abercrombie, but given the preference for web fiction around here, this sub might enjoy it more than more literary fantasy novels. Give it a shot.
