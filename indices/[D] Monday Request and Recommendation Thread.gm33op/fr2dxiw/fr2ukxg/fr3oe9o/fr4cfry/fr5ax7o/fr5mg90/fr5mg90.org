Haven't read the series in question, but generally speaking, while hard magic system, progression, research, etc. /are/ common aspects of fiction that this sub tends to enjoy, idiot ball carrying, plot armor, and deus ex machina are literally antithetical to rational fiction. Avoiding those things is the entire point. Those other things are nice, they make it easier to avoid the bad habits by having strict rules and allowing the reader, if sufficiently careful and motivated, to predict the kinds of solutions the MC might employ. But they are absolutely secondary to having a character who makes decisions that make sense with who they all (this DOES NOT always mean smart decisions), as opposed to decisions that are just to further the plot, that solutions should not appear out of thin air, etc.
