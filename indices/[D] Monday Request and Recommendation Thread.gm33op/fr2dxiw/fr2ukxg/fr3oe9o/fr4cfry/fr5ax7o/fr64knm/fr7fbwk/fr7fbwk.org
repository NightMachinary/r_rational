Ha. Well, I can accept all that. Funny enough, I felt the same when I read Pact, but at least this MC does occasionally hit the books...eventually. Unfortunately, I think you're missing out by not reading books before this century, but to each their own. There's a lot there, perhaps you'll revisit them in a few years. (I'm guessing that I'm probably considerably older than you, would be amusing if that's not the case.)
