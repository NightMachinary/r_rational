First, in a wider context, everything written today will be considered similarly controversial in the future. Prior generations had, broadly, the same feelings that you do, privileging the current period as a moral end. Really, you should condemn current literature for violating both the reasonable criticisms and newly developed sacred cows of the future. And, when thinking that way, the most sensible thing to do is judge literature relative to the moral norms of its time, just as we judge present literature by the moral norms of the present. In fact, I'd say this is one of the main advantages of literature from the past---it contextualizes social trends and fashions, and gives you the occasional glimpse of how posterity might see us, based on how we read posterity.

I think you're reading what I'm saying as "stuff from the past is good." Really, that's not the case. Most stuff from the past is crap, and we've rightly forgotten about it. If there's nothing to regard in literature from the past, people don't read it or remember it. And there's a lot of past literature, and little time to read and study it, so the standards are pretty high. Really, my statements are more about the contemporaneous filtering process working on a huge corpus then they are about past literature as a whole. I think you didn't really address this point, or misconstrued it as just thinking that stuff from the past is great, which is a strawman, and obviously untrue.

If anything, there's a huge bias toward the present in the present. People consume enormous amounts of news, almost all of which is euphemera and won't be revisited. 95% of the bestsellers of this year will be forgotten in ten years. Creators have to churn out constant new content or be cast aside by algorithms and a public hungry for the new. Reading stuff from the past is uncomfortable, and that's partly why it's valuable.
