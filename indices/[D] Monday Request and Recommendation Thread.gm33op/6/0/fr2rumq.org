I don't know if it's "smart"-ness so much as it is a well-developed sense of empathy. It's kinda like Archchancellor Ridcully vs Granny Weatherwax from Discworld (which happened in /Equal Rites/ IIRC) - Ridcully is canonically very smart, probably smarter than Weatherwax, but he doesn't understand /people/ to the same degree.

I feel like it takes quite a bit of mental yoga to be able to distance yourself from yourself to the point where you can write a self-insert story where, in a very real sense, your SI is not the main character.

Also now that I think of it Companion Chronicles really reminds me of Blade Runner: 2049, another story where the protagonist is not the MC. Especially since "empathy" is one of the thru-line themes of Blade Runner in general.
