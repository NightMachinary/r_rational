Still in the middle of reading it, and it doesn't quite rise to the level of Fair Play Whodunnit, but [[https://mangadex.org/title/21562/kusuriya-no-hitorigoto][The Apothecary Diaries]] is a standout manga for how it involves people thinking (at all).

I'm still trying to figure out how to put into words what makes the [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/companion-chronicles-jumpchain-multicross-si-currently-visiting-intermission.787978/][Companion Chronicles]] stand out from all the other self-insert or jumpchain stories out there. There's only one or two elements I can currently put my finger on, like the author's ability to conceive of a similar story as being told from the viewpoint of a completely different person who thinks they're the protagonist (the [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/companion-chronicles-jumpchain-multicross-si-currently-visiting-intermission.787978/page-45#post-66337619][Memory Jumper]] chapter). I can very clearly tell the author is /smarter/ than average; I'm still trying to pin down the signs in ways that would be describable to other people, so that I could ask for more stories that visibly have smart authors.
