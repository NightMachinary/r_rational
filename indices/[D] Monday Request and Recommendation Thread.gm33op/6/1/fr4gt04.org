For me the what makes the story special is that it's a well done metaanalysis of a genre written such that the characters have depth and relatability, and the protagonist is competent and makes believable errors, while retaining the genre's strength (which in the case of jumpchains to me is progression fantasy, seeing settings and people we know, and solving issues of that universe).

You mention many other jumpchain stories. Can you recommend any stories in that genre?
