  You lost me at the different opinion â†’ update segue, but 6 months is a very mild hiatus for fanfiction.

Well that's why I said everyone has a different opinion regarding this stuff. Some people don't care about 3 year gaps between works, others won't read anything that's not finished.

If the author had kept up their usual pace the story would have likely concluded.

  If I recall, the author likes finishing his works so let's hope everything's alright and the end will come one day.

Yes I hope so too.

I'm just letting people know that it's an unfinished work with a sudden and unexplained, and crucially unprecedented, absence by the author.
