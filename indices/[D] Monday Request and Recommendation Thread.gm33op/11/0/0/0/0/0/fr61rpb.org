Thanks for clarifying - that bit was a real non-sequitur without context.

That's a lot of adjectives... Most of my recommendations are unfinished. My train of thought is: fanfiction rarely gets finished, good fanfics are a rarity, and cutting the pool to only the intersection means missing out on many great stories.
