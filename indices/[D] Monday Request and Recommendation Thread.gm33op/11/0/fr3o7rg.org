Since your list is all fanfiction, off the top here are some of the best when I think of fanfic romance:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15996890/chapters/37322936][Birds of a Feather]] - Harry Potter - [[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/ax82yl/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/ehs0y3x/][Original rec thread.]] Along with the 2nd, probably one of the more fitting romances for this sub.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7423061/1/Let-Me-In-2][Let Me In 2]] - Let Me In / Let the Right One In - [[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/btahxu/rec_let_me_in_2_a_rational_vampire_fanfic/][Original rec thread.]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11111990/1/][Grow Young With Me]] - Harry Potter - IMO the best and certainly one of the most realistic fanfic romances anywhere.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7962196/1/The-Hazards-of-Amity][The Hazards of Amity]] - Naruto - Just all around moving if you're a fan of Itachi. Very fitting for his character.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13166639/1/Unmade][Unmade]] - Oregairu - Hardboiled crime/romcom that's also a solid non-canon sequel.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6604037/1/Precocious-Crush][Precocious Crush]] - Kick Ass - Long (drags on), but that preteen angst is inspired. Doubles as a kind-of sequel.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13133746][Daphne Greengrass and the Importance of Intent]] - Harry Potter - Pretentious premise, great banter, satisfying fluff.

Sorry for the barebone recs, bit tired tonight to think up anything snappy, but I wholeheartedly recommend any of them.
