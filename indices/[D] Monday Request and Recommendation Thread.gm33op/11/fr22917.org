This is a recommendation + request post. Last week I got an itch to re-read stories where romance is one of the central focuses. I couldn't find any new ones so I ended up rereading some of my favorites. Here are a few of those. If you have any recommendations that are similar to these stories please reply with those. Thanks!

--------------

All of these stories have romance as one of the main focuses in the plot. Most are somewhat slice-of-lifey but some do get a more serious and dramatic at times. Please comment if you want more info/have questions about any of these fanfictions/authors/ect.

- RWBY - Jaune/Yang
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12027237/1/Breaking-Through-the-Bottom-of-the-Bottle][Breaking Through the Bottom of the Barrel]] by College Fool. 5/5. 42k words.

#+begin_quote
  My favorite Jaune as an MC RWBY fic and one of my favorite romance fanfictions in existence. It doesn't fit the definition of RomCom, but it is a romance story with comedy. It does a great job at providing fun humor while also including well written serious moments. Takes place over a single night and the author does a great job at following beat style romance formula to create an enjoyable flow. No real RWBY knowledge required to enjoy.

- Naruto - Naruto/!Fem Sasuke
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2661190/JMenace][Written in Reverse]] by JMenace. 4/5. 68k words.

#+begin_quote
  Written by one of my favorite Naruto authors, Written in Reverse is a time travel Naruto fanfic that has a fun twist. It's slice of lifey and a bit unique, but the quality is quite solid and is on the whole fairly entertaining. (The story has a !fem Sasuke if that's a dealbreaker.)

- Naruto - Kushina/Minato
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5645686/1/The-Girl-From-Whirlpool][A Girl From Whirlpool]] by SilverShine. 5/5. 248k.

#+begin_quote
  A very wholesome and happyish rendition of how Minato and Kushina met and became a couple. The author's ability to bring to life Minato and Kushina is commendable. The dynamic and story here is my headcanon about how Konoha and Naruto's parents were like before Naruto was born.

- How to Train Your Dragon/Frozen - Hiccup/Elsa
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10171267/1/A-Chance-Encounter][A Chance Encounter]] by R-dude. 4/5. 218k words.

#+begin_quote
  Another fantastic author. Actually wrote another fiction on this list as well, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11697407/1/Contractual-Invalidation][Contractual Obligations]]. This story is a well put together crossover of How to Train Your Dragon and Frozen. It gets somewhat frustrating/slow at parts, but overall worth a read to the end. The dynamic between the heads of state makes this story. Solid writing, well paced plot and great characters.
#+end_quote

- Harry Potter - Harry/Daphne
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11697407/1/Contractual-Invalidation][Contractual Obligations]] by R-dude. 4/5. 90k.

#+begin_quote
  This is a great fic. The author keeps the story tight and cuts out any fluff. The only real problem the premise is annoying the actual realism of how premise came to be in story is fairly farfetched, but the rest is is fantastic. The characters are very interesting, the conflict is very well done and the writing very high quality.

- Harry Potter - Harry/!Fem young TR
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7186430/1/Thunderstorm][Thunderstorm]] by T3t. 4/5. 40k.

#+begin_quote
  The Fem TR might be a dealbreaker, but I implore you to give this story a chance. Set in a world where TR was a woman, this story is romance between the diary spirit fem TR and HP where they're both the same age, 16. The story focuses on the relationship between the newly, created/born diary TR and a more callous/older Harry Potter. Short and sweet.

- OreGairu - Hachiman/Yukino
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11044041/1/Even-Hikigaya-Hachiman-can-write-a-Love-Letter][Even Hikigaya Hachiman can write a Love Letter]] by God Emperor Penguin. 4/5.

#+begin_quote
  A fun collection of one-shots that became a story as the author wrote more. Hikigaya's voice is very well written here and the character dynamics that exist in the LN and anime are done well if not better in this fanfiction. If you like OreGairu I highly recommend this fanfiction.

- OreGairu - Hachiman/Yukino
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11492096/1/SNAF-U][Snaf U]] by isko. 3/5. 52k.

#+begin_quote
  This is a bit more serious than lighthearted. It does a good job of taking the characters and aging them up. They all resemble the characters from high school, but it's visible how they've changed with age and maturity. Another recommendation for those who like OreGairu.

- Amazing Spiderman Universe - Peter Parker/MJ
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8952765/1/Perpendicular][Perpendicular]] by nine miles to go. 4/5. 152k words.

#+begin_quote
  This is a story for those of us who like tragedy in their romance. It's a bit dramatic and idk if folks here will resonate with this particular story, but if you find the angst-hurt/comfort tags to be interesting, you might enjoy this story. If you don't like the first couple of chapters, I doubt you'll like the rest of this. Would recommend reading at least those. s

- Star Wars (The Prequels) - Anakin/Padm√©
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7513976/1/The-Sith-The-Senator][The Sith and the Senator]] by WrittinInStone. 3/5. 237k.

#+begin_quote
  I've never watched all the Star Wars movies. I mention this because I recommend this fanfiction without a super fleshed out headcanon of Star Wars. I only know about the prequels through memes and reading the wikis. I'm not sure how well this story depicts the Star Wars universe/characters.

  What I do remember is that is this story was quite enjoyable when I read it two years ago. It makes Anakin's craziness into an interesting, unique plot point. It's not slice of life as the others, but I remember finding the story engaging and well written. (Emphasis on Anakin is crazy, so the resulting romance isn't "normal" by any means.)

- Harry Potter - Harry/Luna
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3862145/1/Contemplating-Clouds][Contemplating Clouds]] by Tehan.au. 5/5. 8k.

#+begin_quote
  The only Harry/Luna fanfiction that I've ever found and thought was well written. Luna's a character that's too often written to be a bag of quirks without any real substance. Maybe it's because this story is too short and doesn't have the chance to screw it up, but I always find myself smiling at just how well written Luna is here.

- Stein's Gate - Hououin Kyouma/Christina
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10683812/1/The-Variable][The Variable]] by meggann. 4/5. 10k.

#+begin_quote
  A Stein's Gate oneshot set after the series, but before the movie. It's an interesting well written piece that delves into the relationship between Okabe and Kirisu and the mechanics of how they interact.
#+end_quote

- Hyouka - Houtarou/Chitanda
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10529576/1/The-Rain-is-Trying-to-Tell-me-Something][The Rain is Trying to Tell me Something]] by thundercow. 5/5. 16k.

#+begin_quote
  Hyouka is my second favorite anime of all time so I'm a bit biased here, but I find this story to be beautiful. It does justice to the characters and their personalities. The story is my headcanon of what happens after their high school life comes to a close. Very poignant and just heartwarming.
