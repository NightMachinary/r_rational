Request: a story that would start (or at least largely take part) in a dynamic similar to the one /Worth the Candle/ will presumably end with.

I want to see a human who has just freshly attained godly power---the protagonist---enter into conflicts with the incumbent Literal Gods of the setting, over the protagonist's attempts to fix the Crapsack World they grew up in, and now rule over.

Sort of like where /Practical Guide To Evil/ arrived at with international geopolitics, but one level higher up, with a lot of True Dweomers and Chosen Paladins being flung around on all sides.

Or, sort of like the third book of the /Crystal/ trilogy, but with the other AI goal-agents being /conservative/ to change (wanting to keep the Crapsack World exactly the way it is, because they /already/ remade it the way they like it a long time ago, resulting in it being what it is now), rather than actively working to make the world fall apart in different ways.

Hopefully as well, the protagonist would have human friends from back when they were human, that they would still rely on and talk to even after becoming a Literal God.
