For 1, I'd recommend [[https://mangadex.org/title/36067/ultimate-rock-paper-scissors][Ultimate Rock Paper Scissors]]. It's about 8 people with different superpowers competing in a rock paper scissors competition. Surprisingly sensible usage of their different abilities, short (~20 chapters), and highly enjoyable.

For 2, I really enjoyed [[http://alexanderwales.com/darkWizardNaNo2016.html][The Dark Wizard of Donkerk]], which is also by Alexander Wales, who also wrote the /epic/ Worth the Candle, which another person's already recommended. (I recommend it as well!)
