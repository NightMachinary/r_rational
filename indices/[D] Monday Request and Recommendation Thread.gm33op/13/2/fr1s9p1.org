1- My personal Recomendation is Ajin. The last few chapters released are a little less rational, but still better than most stuff you see. The mechanics of how ajin's work are very consistent and are explored pretty throughly. You have a few less-than-rational characters but they still act as you would expect a real person would. the main character is a rationalist and is pretty much always acting in his own self-interest, and when he isn't he is still acting in a way that furthers his values. I think that it's the most rational manga I've read.
