I love Sanderson, and 90% of his character viewpoints are great and worthwhile.

However, there are some lengthy chapters where you have to deal with boring, unreasonable, whiny, or downright annoying perspectives. Sometimes it is a good character in a bad scene, and sometimes it is a bad character. A common flaw between Mistborn, Reckoners, and the Stormlight Archives.

Any multi-perspective story will have viewpoints that the reader enjoys more, and viewpoints that the reader enjoys less. I would say Sanderson does it better than GRR Martin, for instance.
