I had to try 2 times to get into it, but now it's one of my favorite stories all around. Trissiny and Gabriel start as two arses and stay that way for a while, but it's o-so-satisfying when you actually get to see their character growth. And that only two characters amidst a giant cast.

It's not quite what I'd call a "fun" series but there is humour in it, and it's pretty damn funny. Over all I really second the recommandation.
