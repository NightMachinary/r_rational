  The final season of Netflix's She-Ra: Princess of Power dropped a few days ago and now that it's complete I would definitely recommend it. It does a fantastic job of developing the characters, in particular the main protagonist and antagonist have a very complicated relationship that I thought was handled really well.

  Characters do make stupid decisions on occasion, but it usually feels like an understandable expression of their past experiences/traumas, rather than that they are given the idiot ball for no reason other than to move the plot forward. I'd also say the ending was very satisfying, albeit a bit rushed, in that I think they would have done well with twice as many episodes. On a genre level, they have some interesting twists on common tropes that I found fresh. The world also is a fun mix of magic and technology which blend reasonably well.

  All that said, it is a children's show, so the power of friendship is definitely the name of the game. If you've enjoyed other high quality children's shows like Steven Universe, Avatar, My Little Pony, etc. you might enjoy this one as well. If you do decide to watch it, don't google it because there's fairly big spoilers for the final season everywhere right now.

Avatar doesn't have too much friendship magic I remember, but it definitely has some very glaring, fatal plot holes; The two I remember being that the Avatar beats the bad guy AFTER their plan succeeds (which we are told is impossible in the whole series), and that the Avatar's super mode (shining blue thingy) works exactly the way the author needs it and is inconsistent with the plot's description of it.
