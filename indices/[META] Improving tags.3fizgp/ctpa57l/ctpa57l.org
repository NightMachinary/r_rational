I am mostly indifferent to the outcome of this discussion, but I disagree with this assertion:

#+begin_quote
  "[??] The Dusty Hat, by China Mieville" - The question marks add nothing. At least the author is noted.
#+end_quote

As I think it was intended to, the [??] makes very clear that the poster of the link is /asking a question/ about the categorization of the work and would like other people's input about it.

On a related note, stuff like this is why I try to always post an explanatory comment (e.g noting the setting, justifying [RT] or [RST], and explaining why I think it's worth reading) when I submit a link...
