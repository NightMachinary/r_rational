I changed the CSS a bit so that the field below the submission is a little bit more visible, and added a line at the bottom about adding something about the world it's based on for fanfic. I don't anticipate that this will do much, given that people tend to fill out forms on the internet by just filling in fields then clicking buttons with the minimum of reading (which is what I do).

However, having a post like this probably helps a bit for making people conscious of keeping things organized.
