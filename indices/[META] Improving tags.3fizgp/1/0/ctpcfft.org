The explanatory comment is the one thing I really wish people did more often; it's not enough for me to see the tags, I want to know why you thought it was worth reading and recommending to me, especially if it's one of those million word epics that would take up my reading time for the next few weeks. Not so important for the web serials (which mostly exist for discussion of the most recent chapter rather than as recommendation per se) but there are a lot of things I've skipped over because there's nothing aside from some tags and a title.
