I think [MK] is a useful tab if the MC comes from somewhere that gives them a different enough perspective on local physics/technology that they can optimize it in some way. It's still just basic rational fic principles to exploit situations to your advantage, but if the primary or important secondary purpose of the story is to optimize local mechanics, then [MK] is still a good idea, just like I'd rather see something tagged as [Fantasy][Steampunk] than just [Fantasy] or [Sci-Fi][Space Opera] than just [Sci-Fi].
