I'm look into changing the submission guidelines for when people submit links. Given the non-compliance thus far, I'm sort of doubtful that it's going to do anything, and I think removing things that don't have tags is too much moderator work (and probably just results in less stuff being submitted).

I'm kind of on the fence about fanfic tagging. There are a number of fanfics that span multiple franchises, and most of them are posted to ff.net where you can just read a synopsis and a whole bunch more information.

I'm also on the fence about adding a tag for original works, mostly because we already have a fanfic tag, and I would think that everything not tagged as fanfic is implicitly original.

[MK] tag is staying, mostly because it denotes a specific style, and is useful in that regard.
