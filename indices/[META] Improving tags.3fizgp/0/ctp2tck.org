The point of tags is that they can be searched for easily - type "[RT]" into the search bar and you'll get all the posts with [RT] in them.

With that in mind, people making up their own tags is worse than useless. [Worm FF], for example, won't show up when searching for [FF]. We need to have a SMALL number of tags with clearly-defined purposes listed in the sidebar. A lot of the ones there are hardly used, and would benefit from a cleanup.

It's okay to just write things in the title. Not everything has to be tagged.
