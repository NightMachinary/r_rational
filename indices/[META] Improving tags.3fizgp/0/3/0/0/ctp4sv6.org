I don't think a HPMoR tag would be redundant, fanfiction of HP and fanfiction of HPMoR are often two very separate things.

The reason people can't just search for those things is because it doesn't work.

Naruto (even though that Anko fanfiction has plenty of people saying it in the chat) doesn't bring it up. Unless it's in the title or if it's in the text of a self post.
