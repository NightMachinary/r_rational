  Bonus rant: I don't think that [MK] is a useful tag, or relevant to rational fiction. In its most extreme form (I'm looking at you, Two-Year Emperor), "look at how this system can be hilariously exploited" is simply parody. Nothing wrong with that, but it doesn't really have anything to do rationality.

Okay you don't like it, but it's a genre others here enjoy.
