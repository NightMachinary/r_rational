If we start using [FF:HPMOR] or [FF:Worm] to tag Fanfiction with the relevant work then it's easy to search for fan fiction. We can just search for [FF in that case and get all fan fictions. Likewise, searching for [FF:HPMOR] would give all hpmor derived fanfictions.

As long as we agree on a formatting, I think adding the name of the original story makes sense
