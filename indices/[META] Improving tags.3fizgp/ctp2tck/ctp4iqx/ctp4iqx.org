It doesn't seem to be that there are that many fanfics that get posted here that it would be difficult to separately tag what it is a fanfiction of.

That is to say 99% of the rationalist fanfiction come from 1% of fiction so tagging it isn't hard. [HP],[HPMoR],[Naturo], etc would all work as searchable and as long as people are consistent it would work. Also include the [FF] tag there, and a [OC] tag for when it is OC.
