  How is meaning first created in the minds of people? How does meaning first come about?
#+end_quote

First, and I may be misinterpreting, but you seem to hold a belief that reality has meaning. How firmly do you hold this belief?

Second, scientific laws and theorems are descriptions of how reality works; they do not claim to offer guidance on reality's meaning. For example, the observation that genetically fit individuals do better, via natural selection and such, at perpetuating their numbers, is a description of what goes on in nature. You can make predictions based on this description, but does that also give meaning to what is happening?

Third, I recommend a brief introspection: Become aware of the existence of, and form of, meaning in your own mind. Do you /feel/ that reality has meaning? How about your surroundings, your actions. Does your life have meaning? Do you have an idea of what it is that it means?

EDIT: These are important questions to be asking/answering, but the answers are sometimes controversial and polarizing. [[http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Ty-Guy9][PM me]] if you are interested in starting a discussion!
