  In my original post I was talking about meaning as similar to the concept of isomorphism, but you seem to talk about the more philosophical kind of concept of meaning.
#+end_quote

I suppose I /was/ going on a more complete isomorphism between 'meaning(~isomorphism)' and 'meaning(philosophy)' -- I took them to mean the same thing. (How's my meta?) Perhaps they manifest more as 'nearly the same idea', the way the author is defining/connecting them.

  The concept of coherent extrapolated volition is relevant. I was thinking about whether or not this meaning or morality would exist if people didn't exist, and came to the conclusion that yes, adding suffering to the world would still be a bad thing.

I haven't read that sequence yet, but coherent extrapolated volition ~= what you expect you should do in any given situation, based on your current values? And yes, suffering does seem to be a bad thing, if you gain nothing from having it. Which strikes me as highly relevant: it's morally obviousness comes from intuition more than from rationale.

  These were some interesting questions, and I don't feel I've comprehensively answered them... I will add more on a later date.

Then I look forward to reading it! Also, your English is excellent; what's your native tongue?
