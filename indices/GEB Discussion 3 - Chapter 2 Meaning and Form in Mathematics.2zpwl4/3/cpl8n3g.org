5) not yet a good idea

[[#s][1)]]

[[#s][2)]]

[[#s][3)]]

4) no clue, I am not sure if the hint about the snail has something to do with it, any tips for me without giving it away?

About the chapter in general: - the pq-system is only isomorphic to addition with natural numbers *not including* 0, right? There is no way to map

#+begin_example
  1 + 0 = 1
#+end_example

from numbers with addition to the pq-system as

#+begin_example
  -pq-
#+end_example

because this is not a theorem of the system. Maybe it's just nitpicking or due to the fact that positive numbers does not (always) include 0?

And aside: What I always found astonishing about /isomorphisms/ is that if you have one from A to B and then discover one from B to C you can also go from A to C (transitivity) and therefore get insights about a (probably) totally unrelated domain!
