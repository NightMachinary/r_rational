I may have an insight into this quote, and I'm wondering if anyone shares the opinion.

#+begin_quote
  If we were to delve into Euclid's proof more and more carefully, we would see that it is composed of many, many small-almost infinitesimal steps. If all those steps were written out line after line, the proof would appear incredibly complicated. To our minds it is clearest when several steps are telescoped together, to form one single sentence. If we tried to look at the proof in slow motion, we would begin to discern individual frames. In other words, the dissection can go only so far, and then we hit the "atomic" nature of reasoning processes. A proof can be broken down into a series of tiny but discontinuous jumps which seem to flow smoothly when perceived from a higher vantage point.

Does anyone beside me have an intuition that this idea of a "ground-level" for proofs is incorrect? That there will always be another breakdown into deeper assumptions?

See, I remember once getting a sense that if one looked closely enough at any proof, one should be able to break each logical step down into further and further levels of detail, drawing out assumption after assumption. It would not be like what the tortoise said to Achilles, in which he repeated the same single trick forever, but would be non-repeating (in the same sense that irrational numbers would be non-repeating if their digits formed a tree instead of a sequence).
