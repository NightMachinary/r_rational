Okay, so every time I prove something with a finite number of steps where I apply the basic rules of a system, you'll give me a different system where I have to justify those rules themselves.

Sure, you can do that, I guess, and I can't say you'd be wrong. But you're just being the Tortoise in /What the Tortoise Said to Achilles/. At some point you'll run out of systems that would explain anything new. From that point on, you /are/ repeating the same trick forever, putting infinite roadblocks in the way of concluding things, like the Tortoise is.
