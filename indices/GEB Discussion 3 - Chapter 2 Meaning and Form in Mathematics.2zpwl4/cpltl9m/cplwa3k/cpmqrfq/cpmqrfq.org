First of all, thanks for the response. I'm glad to hear anything/everything that seems to others relevant; I usually learn something new when they share it. Also, I'm pretty new to [[/r/rational][r/rational]], so it's a huge boost just to know that people are taking the time to read and consider my comments.

Secondly, thought it may seem strange at first, it's useful to have people going in both directions: down into details as well as up toward new proofs. Your reasoning, yagsuomynona, is quite correct for why going up is useful -- it saves time in proofs that are, if done right, just as valid.

The consequence of going down, of asking for the reasons behind each axiom of your system is, ideally, new information:

- You trusted your axioms before, but now you have more reasons to give for why you continue to trust them. There was a potential before, however great your prior confidence in them, that the axioms you were relying upon were imprecise/inaccurate. By questioning them you now have either a stronger confidence in their correctness, or (more exciting) you have uncovered an error that you can correct. The average integrity of your system has increased through your study and synthesis of its subfoundational principles.

- Your axioms seemed distinct from one another before, but now that you know why they should be so, you discover ways they are interconnected. As you discover that new layer below, you may even realize that your original set of axioms was an incomplete set, that there were other axioms at that level which you could have been using before, and now that you incorporate them they shed light on previously difficult-to-prove theories, which broadens the whole of your system.

Take as an example the discovery of the particles which atoms are composed of. We had a bunch of "axioms" about how different kinds of atoms worked: hydrogen explodes, gold doesn't rust, etc. Perhaps we even grouped the atoms into meaningful categories based on their observed properties. Maybe we even started forming some kind of periodic table just from those categorizations. But when we realized that different numbers of protons made things into different elements, and how electrons were responsible for creating those molecular bonds, everything changed. We then knew /why/ the periodic table made sense, we started looking for (or creating) the missing elements, and we now had "proof" of what the resultant elements be when we /split the atoms/!
