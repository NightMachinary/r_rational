Thank you for your responses! I give it to you, I don't know yet how to prove that each new level contains further information. Perhaps if we followed my hypothetical proof, we would would end up doing an N+1 type deal like the Tortoise. We might get caught in a loop; infinite repetitions do tend to happen in fractals. And maybe we could find our way out of each loop in the same way we did with the Tortoise, but it is uncertain enough that it's a question mark on my above proof-style hypothesis.

And now that my intuition is aware of the uncertainty, I need to ask you about this:

#+begin_quote
  At some point you'll run out of systems that would explain anything new.
#+end_quote

How certain are /you/ of this? Extrapolation is, by itself, inconclusive. Can you provide a logical foundation (meta not intended) for this claim that we "will" run out of new explanations for things, or is it just your intuition?
