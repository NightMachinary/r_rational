You're right, it's just my intuition. It's possible that there is an infinite sequence of foundations of math, each explaining more than the last.

But I don't see why there would be, and I certainly don't see how you'd construct such a sequence, or what math you could even use to construct it if no math is fundamental enough.

So I'm disagreeing with performing induction over a sequence that may not exist.
