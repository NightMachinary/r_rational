Sorry that I took my time in answering, but these are some difficult questions. What makes it especially difficult is that the concept of meaning is vague and hard to wrap my head around. In my original post I was talking about meaning as similar to the concept of isomorphism, but you seem to talk about the more philosophical kind of concept of meaning. But here are some preliminary answers:

  First, and I may be misinterpreting, but you seem to hold a belief that reality has meaning. How firmly do you hold this belief?
#+end_quote

I've sometimes identified as a nihilist, but yes, I kinda believe in objective meaning, because I also believe in an objective morality in a weird way. Obviously there aren't any 'meaning' tags on things. If there's meaning, it's centered around the process of consciousness, the creation of illusion of meaning in consciousness. I don't think any sentient creature in pain can claim that the pain she is experiencing at the time is meaningless. Pain has evolved because it tells about something /real/, so it's usually isomorphic to a damage in tissue.

I like Eliezer Yudkowsky's metaethics sequence, here's one quote in it that's particularly good:

#+begin_quote
  [What is the answer to the question: what should I do? The answer, according to EY, is a huge blob of computation.] I would say, by the way, that the huge blob of a computation is not just my present terminal values (which I don't really have---I am not a consistent expected utility maximizer); the huge blob of a computation includes the specification of those moral arguments, those justifications, that would sway me if I heard them. So that I can regard my present values, as an approximation to the ideal morality that I would have if I heard all the arguments, to whatever extent such an extrapolation is coherent.
#+end_quote

The concept of coherent extrapolated volition is relevant. I was thinking about whether or not this meaning or morality would exist if people didn't exist, and came to the conclusion that yes, adding suffering to the world would still be a bad thing.

These were some interesting questions, and I don't feel I've comprehensively answered them. It's really hard to write down what I have in my head as answers to these questions, especially when English is not my native language. I have to think about it more, and think about how I'd put it in words. I must try harder, and I will add more on a later date.
