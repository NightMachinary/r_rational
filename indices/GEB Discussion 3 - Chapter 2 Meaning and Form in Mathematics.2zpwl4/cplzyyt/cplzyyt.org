I liked this chapter more than the last few. It really clarified in my mind how symbol manipulation works. And talking about the dichotomy of ideal numbers and the real world was insigthful. Some questions that reading this chapter inspired in my mind:

How is meaning first created in the minds of people? How does meaning first come about? Like is said in the text:

#+begin_quote
  However, reality and the formal systems are independent. Nobody need be aware that there is a isomorphism between the two.
#+end_quote

It is necessary for you to first form an interpretation /before/ you can compare that interpretation to different kind of constructs and create meaning that way. How do you create that first interpretation without prior knowledge? The whole process sounds like pulling yourself up by your bootstraps. Evolutionarily it is surely useful to recognize similarities between different objects. Are isomorphisms what actually create the phenomenon of consciousness in the first place?

#+begin_quote
  Can all of reality be turned into a formal system? In a very broad sense, the answer might appear to be yes.
#+end_quote

This reminded me of Max Tegmark's pet hypothesis that every formal system or mathematical structure is a new reality. I actually don't like that approach very much, it sounds too much like pot philosophy.
