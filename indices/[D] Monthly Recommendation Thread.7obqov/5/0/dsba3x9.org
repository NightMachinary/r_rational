Speaker for the Dead has this in it a bit, strongest novel in the Ender series IMO (I will probably be flamed for this but WHATEVER GUYS).

You might also like the Crystal Society trilogy (though the third book isn't out yet). The first book is available online for free and has a lot of stuff like that.

EDIT: Also, Three Worlds Collide by Yudkowsky might fit what you're looking for. It's more like Speaker for the Dead than like Story of Your Life, which would have been my first recommendation but someone beat me to it!
