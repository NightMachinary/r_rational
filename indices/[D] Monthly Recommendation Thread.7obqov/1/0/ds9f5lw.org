Dies the Fire was awesome. Unfortunately I thought the rest of the series was quite bad. I liked the first book so well I tried to forge through but the rest of the series is effecting a different genre, and in my opinion poorly written. Dies the Fire is thoroughly worth reading as a stand alone though.
