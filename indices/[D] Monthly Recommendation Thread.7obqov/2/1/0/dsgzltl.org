Nioh is faster than darksouls but slower than bloodborne. The biggest issue I have is that I am about 2/3rds of the way through and trash mobs can 2 or 3 hit me. It really sucks because your recovery time (from being hit) is longer than dark souls (if you get hit, you will continue to get hit until the end of the enemy combo. You can't really recover from stagger to dodge or block before the next hit comes). To counter this combos are harshly cut short. You and your enemies cannot chain attacks together until you run out of stamina. Each combo has a set number of attacks in it and there is an enforced break after your combo is. That being said I have no other gripes with the game and I Am still playing it. I love both dark souls and bloodborne.
