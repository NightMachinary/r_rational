[[http://store.steampowered.com/app/485510][/Nioh/]] is a fun combination of:\\
- The maze-like levels and slow, cautious combat of the /Dark Souls/ series;\\
- The quick, flashy combat of the /Dynasty Warriors/ and (rebooted) /Ninja Gaiden/ series*; and\\
- The endless equipment-effect combinations of the /Diablo/ series*.

I personally think that the game's levels are a little /too/ maze-like. Still, I can't complain about the combat, after beating the campaign and nearly all the optional missions. (50 $ รท 80 h = good value, and I haven't even attempted the DLC or gotten very far into into New Game Plus yet.) The sheer quantity of equipment gets to be a little annoying---but at least the player can exchange his unwanted items for a currency that (/inter alia/) unlocks character skins, from the alchemist antagonist to the blacksmith waifu!

*Though I have no personal experience with any /Diablo/ game, I /did/ play a lot of the similar game [[http://store.steampowered.com/app/246840][/Fate/]], many years ago. Likewise, I haven't played any main-line /Dynasty Warriors/ games, but I /do/ have extensive experience with the first three /[[https://www.gamefaqs.com/search?game=dynasty+warriors+gundam][Dynasty Warriors: Gundam]]/ games.

Reminder: [[http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/details.html][/GURPS/]], the Generic Universal RolePlaying System, is [[https://i.imgur.com/i1FhD43.jpg][*ludicrously awesome*]]---and DRM-free, too!\\
- [[http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/Space/][/GURPS Space/]]: Use a 10-step process to generate (or design) an alien species! Use a 14-step process to generate (or design) a planet or moon!! Use [[https://i.imgur.com/imxm3IU.png][a 25-step process]] to generate (or design) a star system (including planets and moons)---matched to a planet or moon that you already generated (or designed), or completely from scratch!!! (If some of those page numbers look too close together, it's because the star-system-generation process refers back to some steps from the planet-/moon-generation process.) The cost is $25.\\
- [[http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/spaceships/][/GURPS Spaceships/]]: Pick components to design a spaceship or a space station! /[[http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/spaceships/spaceships1/][Spaceships 1]]/, the base book, costs $11. /Spaceships [[http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/spaceships/spaceships4/][4]]/ and /[[http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/spaceships/spaceships7/][7]]/ (each $8), plus [[http://www.warehouse23.com/products/SJG37-2634][/Pyramid 3-34/]] ($8) and maybe some other scattered [[http://www.sjgames.com/pyramid/][/Pyramid/]] issues with which I'm not acquainted, add more design options, from giant robots to ordinary buildings.\\
- [[http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/Vehicles/][/GURPS Vehicles/]]: The older, cooler brother of /GURPS Spaceships/! Pick components from zillions of tables to design a vehicle of any kind!! The cost is $15 for the base book, plus $3 for each of /Vehicles Expansion [[http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/vehiclesexpansion1/][1]]/ and /[[http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/vehiclesexpansion2/][2]]/. These books are cheap in comparison to /Spaceships/ because they were written for the previous edition of /GURPS/ (though converting Third-Edition vehicles to the current, Fourth Edition isn't hard at all) and because they're [[https://i.imgur.com/MMqxWta.png][infamous]] for their [[https://i.imgur.com/myyn0pI.png][cumbersome procedures]] (as befits the incredible breadth and depth of their coverage).\\
- [[http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/backtoschool/][/GURPS Social Engineering: Back to School/]]: If you're tired of arbitrarily-bestowed "experience points", this book offers detailed rules for advancement based on /actual training and study/! The cost is $8.

I've never actually played /GURPS/, beyond [[https://www.dropbox.com/s/x2jnfk7yb4yxsyt/ToaKraka%27s%20old%20attempt%20at%20GURPS%20Naruto%20-%20General%20Notes.pdf?dl=0][a single abortive attempt at GMing]] (note that I didn't bother to include [[http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/Basic/][the 55-dollar /Basic Set/]], which is necessary for play, in the introductory recommendations listed above), but I have a /thorough/ appreciation for its /incredible/ awesomeness. [[https://i.imgur.com/yWilcbt.png][The books are exhaustively researched]], and you even can peruse [[http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/biblios.html][their bibliographies]], which include both non-fiction and fiction!
