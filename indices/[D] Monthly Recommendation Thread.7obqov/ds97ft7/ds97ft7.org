Dies the Fire is the first book in the Novels of the Change. The premise is that after a brief light show over Nantucket, all electronics and anything that requires a significant amount of gas compression (like cars and firearms) stop working. As these things are all fairly important to society, the book explores it's collapse as well as the people who work to rebuild it within the new laws of physics. If pikemen riding bicycles sounds wonderful to you, this series is probably for you.

Edit: just thought of another: The Guns of the South, where South African apartheid supporters use a time machine to send AK-47s back to the Confederates in the civil war in an attempt to keep slavery alive. Just as good as it sounds.
