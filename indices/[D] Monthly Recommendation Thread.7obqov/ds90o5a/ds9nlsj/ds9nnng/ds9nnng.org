!!! I am so glad!

Some characters you start out hating become your new favourites and you feel SO BAD FOR THEM. And some issues come up that this show deals with in a refreshing way!

Oh I am so jealous of you if you stick with it you're going to have an amazing binge session. Let me know if you stick with it and who your OTPs are! (OTP = One True Pair = the people you think should get together)
