In response to the spoiler: yeah, a lot of the actual plot is not Rational, but the /characters/ are. You just have to go with the TV Law, TV police work, TV medicine.

I probably oversold its rationality though now I actually think about all the liberties they take... but for me the show is about the characters and those are done rationally... so yeah.
