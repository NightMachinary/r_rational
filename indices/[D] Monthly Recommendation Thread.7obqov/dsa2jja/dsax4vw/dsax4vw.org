I like the genre, but I can't really point at any book that I've read that is particularly great. They all seem to end up being power fantasies featuring a Gary Stu MC. A rational take on the genre would be awesome. Even just one that flips common tropes, like having a female MC or the MC failing to introduce guns.

Anyway, here's some that I remember reading:

[[https://www.goodreads.com/series/129874-world-of-prime][World of Prime series]] | 7.5/10 | Recommended elsewhere in this thread. Good so far.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/series/215776-destiny-s-crucible][Destiny's Crucible Series]] | 7/10 | The last book was pretty disappointing. Sometimes it seems that authors forget why people like a particular genre. In this case, the author focused to much on the antagonists and not enough on the tech and development of the island. I want to watch this guy playing civ IRL, not read 300k words on troop maneuvers and shit. And the epilogue was a travesty. Still, it's passable if you get them cheap and have a dearth of books to read.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/series/43333-conrad-stargard][Conrad Stargard series]] | 6/10 | The MC is a Gary Stu, as always in these books, and the first few are interesting. By the 5th book they get lost in these weird tangents and fantasies by the author. Like, a rotating harem featuring every female in the book, pretty much, and the MC being worshipped as god emperor(a bit of exaggeration, but not much). I never finished the 5th book, but I have read summaries of the sequels and they apparently get pretty dumb.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/series/144936-daniel-black][Daniel Black series]] | 8/10 | These books are the literary equivalent of deep fried twinkies. Pure, unabashed junk food reading. The MC is a rather bland reader stand-in(male equivelant of Bella Swan from twilight, I guess) and every female with a line of dialogue wants to get on his dick, [[https://pics.me.me/begone-thot-18089971.png][which he valiantly demurs on]], in favour of staying faithful to his (literal) harem.

I still enjoy seeing him build stuff and wreck shit with magic.
