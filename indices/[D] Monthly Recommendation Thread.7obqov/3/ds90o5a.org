In another thread I recommended the Jane the Virgin TV series to anyone looking for "rational" drama or romance - it's on netflix and it's really good.

It's got a ridiculous premise (young virgin woman saving herself for marriage is accidentally artificially inseminated during a pelvic exam), and it's in the style of a telenovela so it's ridiculous in general (lots of evil twins, people disguising themselves perfectly as others, etc), but within those constraints it is really rational /especially with interpersonal relationships/ - the mother/daughter relationship shown is very rational, romances start, stop and fade for "rational" reasons, there's absolutely ZERO "let me explain" type of shenanigans.

It is also absolutely hilarious and very clever.
