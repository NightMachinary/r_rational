I didn't get into Jane the Virgin because I've been burned by the CW so many times in the past, but if you want rational relationships /and/ a rational plot I recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6417590/1/What-I-Learned-at-SRU][What I Learned at SRU]]. I think of it's genre as more slice of life than drama, but it's damn satisfying to see these characters work through their all too relatable problems by being good friends to each other.
