Forty milleniums of cultivation is good, you've probably seen it recommended around here. I also like Spirit Blade Mountain.

A lot of them fall into the trap where the author isn't sure what to do, so they just write more words. So you need to enjoy them while they're good, but realize that there you're not necessarily going to reach any end or conclusion, and should just quit when it's a good time to quit.

So, for example, I really liked Way of Choices, but at the end of the really big arc, I just decided on my own ending and stopped reading. Or with History's Strongest Senior Brother, I just noticed it wasn't fun anymore and stopped somewhere in the early-middle. Ditto King's Avatar, Legend of the Moonlight Sculptor, etc.
