However it veers more towards the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealRobotGenre][Real Robot Genre]] than the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaremGenre][Harem Genre]]. If anyone knows of similar stories where the main character is a member of an harem as well, I would be interested in reading them.

- [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/white-collar-cultivator.44460/#post-9900763][White Collar Cultivator]] - It's an interesting story that just very recently started which can be summed up as /The Interdimensional Archival Clerk Position I Was Enslaved To Is Surprisingly Cushy, Despite The Risk Of Death And Dismemberment/.

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/percy-jackson-the-dresden-files-ceaseless-flow.407257/][Ceaseless Flow]] - It's a Dresden/Percy Jackson crossover that Ryuugi started a while ago and is now updating again recently.

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/danmachi-percy-jackson-prytaneum.352191/][Prytaneum]] - It's a Danmachi/Percy Jackson crossover that Ryuugi started a while ago and is now updating again recently.

- [[http://www.prequeladventure.com/][Prequel]] - It's a webcomic set in Skyrim about a khajit who sorta fumbles her way through life and has to exert truly heroic amounts of effort just to break even. Many inspiring moments interspersed with face-palming worthy moments. Just resumed after a lengthy hiatus again.

I have more stories that I can recommend, but my problem is that there's too many. So if anyone wants to help me narrow it down by asking me for a specific fandom, or some sort of more specific request about the type of stories/tropes, I'll be happy to rec.
