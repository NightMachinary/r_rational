I've finished re-reading Greyjoy Alle Breve, probably my favorite isekai/self-insert fanfiction works, and I'm just utterly blown away by how solid the new world the story develops into. It's a wonderful blend of the historical Westerosi attitudes with the inspired desire to innovate the SI has spread. With a majority of the story told from other viewpoints, and the SI not being the exclusive innovator, and even his enemies seeing the power of innovation, it's a far more realistic depiction of an uplift technological revolution than many other uplift stories I've read.

So my request is, is there any other isekai/uplift stories out there where the actual displaced individual isn't the POV character, or at least not the only primary one? I'd also love uplift stories in something isn't the generic feudal faux-european or Tolkienesque world.
