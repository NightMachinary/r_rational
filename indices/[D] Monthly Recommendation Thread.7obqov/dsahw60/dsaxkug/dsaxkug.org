A few months ago someone recommended [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/paths-of-civilization.36410/][Paths of Civilization]] which seems exactly what you're looking for, besides not being an isekai and not having MC at all. It's a quest (kind of like a cooperative choose-your-own-adventure story where readers pick what happens from chapter to chapter) that focuses on the development of a civilization starting from stone age nomads. The POV changes frequently, from chiefs and shamans to ordinary farmers and warriors. It's pretty good.
