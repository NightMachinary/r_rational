I recently discovered [[http://www.nofna.com/index.php?chapter=10%251][Nature of Nature's art]], a series of webcomic graphic novels drawn with the Paint BBS oekaki. The stories all take place in a shared alternate earth where animals of all kinds mysteriously gain "halo brains", and gain sapience, and each of the stories centers around individuals trying to build and understand what society is, often through the medium of creating art. Plus the action scenes are clearly inspired by shounen manga.

It's not perfect, falling into the common trap of far out sci-fi of often making things overly confusing to a newcomer, but I still loved the passion and the story.
