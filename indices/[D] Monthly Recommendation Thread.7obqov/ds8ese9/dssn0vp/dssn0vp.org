I've been playing a GURPS game on a mostly-weekly basis with the same guys for like 5 years, now. It's remarkably deep, but you can wade in slowly.

It has let us run a couple long high magic fantasy campaigns, as well as many shorter stories in other settings - sci fi, post-apocalypse stone age, modern eldritch horror, and one sci fi/fantasy hybrid that felt a lot like Shadowrun set on a fantasy world instead of Earth.

But a word of warning, only use the rules you find interesting. A story about an emergency survival situation you should track food, meals, FP loss, poor sleep, HT rolls to not get sick... in that story, it is the crux of the story. If you're magical heroes battling dragons, on the other hand, the story hinges more on combat and the rules on eating and sleeping can be handwaved.

Unless you're doing an emergency survival situation story in that high magic setting for a session, then you use those rules and they integrate with the rules you were using for combat, and being tired, cold, or hungry makes the next fight that much more difficult.

GURPS is wonderful.
