started reading it. Let's see how it goes. So far it is 1 or 2 ed of D&D. Hoe to see more magical animals and battles. It's incredibly slowly so far.

I'm not sure if he plans to equip all his army with guns, but low level guns are inferior to crossbows in every aspect... Also I dislike his source of confrontation "I looked at this guys and instantly knew I hated him". It feels shallows, antagonists for the sake of antagonists.

Does the books pic up the pace?
