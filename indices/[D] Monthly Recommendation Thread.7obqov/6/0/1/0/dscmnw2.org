I have noticed that. I like the slow building of power knowledge and resources that these types of fiction do well. There is something very satisfying about that. But the “and after they won suddenly another thing happened, and another” it gets.. very draining after a while. I know this is not a popular opinion, but this is the same problem I had with Worm, Pact and Twig. And I'm starting to have a problem with in Mother of Learning.

Thanks for the Recs though!!
