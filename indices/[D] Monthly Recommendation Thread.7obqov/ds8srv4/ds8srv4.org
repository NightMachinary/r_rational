[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/taylors-gotta-power-worm-dragonball.34428/][Taylor's Gotta Power [Worm/Dragonball]]] is not particularly rational, and has some ridiculous powerleveling implied by the crossover, but there are some neat ideas that I believe you'll appreciate:

- Dinah's power works by giving probabilities of posited scenarios, usually yielding 20+ decimal digits of precision, limited by number of questions per day. Here Taylor devises a scheme that trades this superfluous precision for extra questions.
- Scion is invisible to precognitive powers. Subsequently, putting real-time video feed of him into your glasses and predicating your own actions on his, you become unpredictable to any precognition further into the future than it takes for the signal to reach you.
