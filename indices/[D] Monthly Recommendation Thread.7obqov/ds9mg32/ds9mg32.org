I tentatively recommend the [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/129874-world-of-prime][World of Prime]] series of books.

They start off a standard portal fantasy uplift; more specifically, guy is somehow taken from our world to another (fantasy-type) world. By coincidence, he happens to have sufficient knowledge to attempt to introduce rifles to this medieval type world. There are enough twists to keep it interesting. And no harem.

Plot is interesting enough, and the writing is very competent, but what I really liked was the worldbuilding.

Mild spoilers:

The magic works by a sort of cannibalism. Every sentient being and some animals produce a substance in their brains, called tael, which confer powers after eating a certain number. So if you eat the average output of 16 dead humans it gives you the first rank, then another 32 gives you the second rank, and so on. (it's not specified if it keeps duplicating like that or not, but higher ranks are implied to be very, very expensive. Tael is treated as currency, and ranks are treated as, well, social, military, organizational rank.

These ranks of power can be used for lots of different things. If you're a priest, it allows you to select a certain number of spells from your chosen deity a day. If you're a warrior, it gives you strength and durability and some minor combat spells. There are even craftsman specific ranks, like alchemist, blacksmith, and so on, each with their own unique spells.
