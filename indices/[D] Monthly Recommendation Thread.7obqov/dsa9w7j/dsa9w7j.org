So I'm hoping that anyone here has any recommendations for any fiction involving language. More specifically the problems with different ones.

Things I have seen which demonstrate what I'm talking about. Sort of...

The 13th warrior ( or alt the Eater of the Dead novel) Portions of the Last Samurai and Dances with wolves. ( minus the white savior trope)

I just find the overcoming differences in language and cultural expectations very interesting and wish it was reflected more in fiction I read.

Any help would be greatly appreciated!!
