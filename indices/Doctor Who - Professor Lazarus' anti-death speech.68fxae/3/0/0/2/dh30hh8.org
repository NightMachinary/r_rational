I also noticed that, but I think I have an answer. It's motivation of beligerent parties that makes their conflict interesting. Eggman tries to take over the world, basically, for lulz and because he can. Sonic fights bad guys, similarily, for lulz and because he can. Tails, however, fights bad guys because he admires Sonic and wants to help his friends. He is actually more of a hero material even discounting his intelligence, but he just doesn't fit the story as a protagonist.
