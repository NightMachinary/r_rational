That seems like a lazy way to design an antagonist and a protagonist and make them fight. Wouldn't making them on more equal footing in their own kind of strength make more sense? A story about two supergeniuses or two superpowered warriors fighting each other is more entertaining than a story about a superpowered warrior fighting a supergenius with the help of his smart friend. Like for instance in the sonic the hedgehog franchise, it seems overwhelmingly obvious that either metal sonic should have been the main antagonist, or tails the fox should have been the main protagonist. Tails vs Robotnik and Sonic vs Metal Sonic would make for much more interesting stories then Sonic vs Robotnik with Metal Sonic as a minor antagonist and Tails as a sidekick. And yet no one ever notices this. /EVER/.

So why would the writers choose Sonic vs Robotnik over Sonic vs Metal Sonic or Tails vs Robotnik? Clearly this is some sort of pattern, the choice of conflict is too consistent across too many stories for it to be mere coincidence. I just don't know why they always get written like that. It shouldn't be any easier to think of Sonic vs Robotnik than Sonic vs Metal Sonic or Tails vs Robotnik. I'm pretty sure that if a random person who wasn't absorbing irrational warrior hero vs evil science guy stories all their life, who knew nothing about Sonic the Hedgehog at all was told that Robotnik was the main antagonist then they learned about all the other characters, they would think that Tails was the Protagaonist. Likewise with Sonic if they were told that Metal Sonic was the main antagonist.

Do writers think Sonic vs Robotnik will appeal more to readers for some reason? If so what is that reason, and if not why do writers keep choosing to make less interesting conflicts?
