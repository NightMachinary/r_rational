  Wouldn't making them on more equal footing in their own kind of strength make more sense?

If both are of equal strength, but agree, then there isn't any conflict. They'd team up.

  Tails vs Robotnik and Sonic vs Metal Sonic would make for much more interesting stories then Sonic vs Robotnik with Metal Sonic as a minor antagonist and Tails as a sidekick. And yet no one ever notices this. EVER.

I agree, but sonic isn't popular as a story. It's popular as a video game. The story line is a thin pretext for the game. Whenever they try to make a series out of sonic, it doesn't last very long. The writers probably aren't very concerned with this, and are more concerned with just finishing the job and not doing something unexpected. Unexpected things that work get you a pat on the back. Ones that don't work can get you fired. It's rarely worth the risk.
