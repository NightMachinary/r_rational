It's also frustratingly common in anime titles. It's like if they need to introduce a character that's [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute][supposed]] to be clever they just look at the “How to produce a generic anime” flowchart and see that the next step should be making that character spew some random “philosophical” (and\or cynical) sounding nonsense.

1) In general, a rational character would be making at least some decisions that would not go well (or would be perceived as evil) with the general audience, because the audience itself isn't rational (or is even irrational --- which is often the case with Doctor Who, for example). And since the audience identifies itself as “the goodies”, the rat!char automatically slides into being the baddie.
