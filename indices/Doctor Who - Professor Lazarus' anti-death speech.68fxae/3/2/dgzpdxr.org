  Why are the rationalist-analogue characters always portrayed as the villains or as dumb sidekicks.

Sometimes I think it's that people are inherently far too morally and spiritually /clinging/ to their magical thoughts, and seriously feel /harmed/ by having to take the Enlightenment side in [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticismVersusEnlightenment][Enlightenment vs Romanticism]].

Then I usually wonder if that's a sign we're living in a dangerously reactionary, irrationalist culture and there's some horrific tragedy coming in which the sheer chaos of uncontrolled, undisciplined irrationality will vomit itself out as mass death.

I mean, it's not like recent events have falsified that hypothesis.
