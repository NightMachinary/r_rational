I suspect the murderous instincts were part of the whole scorpion monster thing, and that it wasn't Lazarus doing it entirely of his own free will, which makes his story all the more tragic. And this /was/ significant progress just like Lazarus said. You don't give up on a Jesus machine like his just because of fatalities in the first round of human trials - you work around the bugs.
