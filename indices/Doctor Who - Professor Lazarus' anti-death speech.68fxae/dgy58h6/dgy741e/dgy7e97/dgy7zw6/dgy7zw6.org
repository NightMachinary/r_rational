The interesting thing about this is that the 10th doctor *is* blindly attached to his own life. Unlike all the other doctors he's terrified that regeneration means real death and his last words are 'I don't want to go'. The War, 9th and 11th Doctors were serene or cheerful at the very end (as were most of the classic Doctors), while 10 was bitter and angry. He agonises to Wilf about how the next doctor won't really be him in End of Time. He's vain (according to his own words as 11), and thinks his personality is unique. He cheated regeneration, using up a remaining life to prolong his own in the S4 finale.

*Reading between the lines, the Doctor is probably as afraid of death as Lazarus and I can't help but think this scene is him trying to cover up his own cognitive dissonance.*
