10th was my favorite doctor for many reasons, and his flaws were one of them.

Also the actor is amazing. That scene you mentioned with Wilfred, when the 10th Doctor was sitting across from him in the diner, and explaining what being "immortal" is like for Time Lords:

  I can still die. If I'm killed before regeneration, then I'm dead. Even then, even if I change, it feels like dying. Everything I am dies. Some new man goes sauntering away... and I'm dead.

The look on his face, his tone of voice... David Tennant is such an amazing actor that he made me look at someone in his mid 30s sitting side by side someone in his 60s, and believe that the younger man was hundreds of years older.
