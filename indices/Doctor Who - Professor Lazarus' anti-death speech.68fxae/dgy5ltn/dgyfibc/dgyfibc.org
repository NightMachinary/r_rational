  Why are the rationalist-analogue characters always portrayed as the villains or as dumb sidekicks.
#+end_quote

Suppose there are a series of tropes. Some are rational, some are not. The rational ones are accepted by everyone. The irrational ones are accepted by non-rationalists, who non-critically accept tropes.

Since stories are based on conflict, when there are irrational tropes, they are assigned to the protagonist and the antagonist is assigned the contrary /rational/ point of view. We pay more attention to this because no one likes their ideas being associated with the bad guys.

When the trope is rational, it still gets assigned to the protagonist, and that's when we get irrational antagonists. People here are less bothered by irrational antagonists because, after all, they're the bad guys who lose in the end.
