I did! Sonic Adventure DX claims that Eggman and Tails both have an IQ of 300. I didn't know about rationality yet at the time, but I definitely remember thinking that Sonic should be a side character and the main story should be about a conflict between Eggman and Tails if they're really that smart.

  So why would the writers choose Sonic vs Robotnik over Sonic vs Metal Sonic or Tails vs Robotnik? Clearly this is some sort of pattern, the choice of conflict is too consistent across too many stories for it to be mere coincidence.

I think it's just in human nature to reject science, as frustrating as that is. It's not intuitively obviously, it takes too much time, effort and math to learn, it doesn't play nice with other belief systems, people see the knowledge as useless, they think we're "messing with nature" and that man made things are automatically bad, they see scientific knowledge as flaky because it can be updated at any time, they don't like the byproducts of scientific inquiry like nuclear bombs or GMO Foods, and clearly scientists are heartless, arrogant, terrible people that destroy the mystery and fun of the world by measuring and cataloging it. Or some think they're in the pocket of the government, developing things to harm the general population or to push the agenda of the day.

I think this general distrust of science is why you see so many stories with an anti-rational or anti-science message. They want their heroes to be humble and good, not arrogant like scientists that have the /nerve/ to say things like "you shouldn't believe in things without evidence", and then "there's no evidence for souls, the afterlife, or gods". Also people get really attached to ideas like "death must be good for something, since we can't avoid it. Anyone who says otherwise has to be wrong, it would be too terrifying if death was truly bad and we were powerless to stop it".
