As a matter of fact, in Sonic Adventure 2 they paired off the Heroes and Villains, and while Shadow was introduced as the villain for Sonic to compete on speed, Tails and Robotnik do indeed go head to head a number of times in their mechanical inventions.

I don't know if they continued that trend in later games since SA2 was the last one I played, but I definitely appreciated it even as a kid. I hop they did keep it though, because you're right, it makes much more sense.

Hell I even remember playing Sonic 2 and 3 and enjoying the Robo-Sonic fights way more than the final robotnik ones.
