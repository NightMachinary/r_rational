OMG I'm starting to hate it when writers try to make their story sound deep and meaningful because they seem to almost always end up spewing crap like this.

Why are the rationalist-analogue characters always portrayed as the villains or as dumb sidekicks.

Like it's not like most people have a deep seated prejudicial hatred of rationalists. Most people probably don't even know what a rationalist is. But shows like this try to appeal to a wider audience, and I don't see why they would need to always make straw-man rationalist analogue characters to knock down if there wasn't a common deep-seated prejudicial hatred of rationalists.

I just don't get it.
