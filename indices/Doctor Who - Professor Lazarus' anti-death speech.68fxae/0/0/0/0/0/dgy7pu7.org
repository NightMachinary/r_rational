That's a great way of looking at it and lends him some more character depth. I wish they'd make that more explicit in the show, have him get called out for it properly, instead of defaulting to portraying his anti-immortality speeches as timeless wisdom.

Unless they have actually called him out on it lately? I haven't seen any episodes since that /fucking/ season finale with Missy. God that pissed me off on so many levels. Cheap, lazy, and honestly offensive writing.
