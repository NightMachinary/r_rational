That pretty much sums up my feelings about Doctor Who and its blatant hypocrisy, yeah.

Mind, it is canon that, "You spent a billion years evolving into downloads" /at some point/. The question might be at what point within human history that all happened, and what that meant for civilization. I could see the Doctor going full Culture and saying we need to achieve some level of enlightenment or sanity before being able to handle immortality.
