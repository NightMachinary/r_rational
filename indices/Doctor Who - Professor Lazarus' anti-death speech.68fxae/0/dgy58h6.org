One of the things that's always bugged me about this show is how it contrives reasons to push the "immortality is inherently bad and inhuman" aesop. "oh no you'd better not try to be immortal or you'll turn into a scorpion monster and eat people for some goddamn reason"

It's hypocritical as fuck coming from the Doctor, too. He's always the one getting all upset at the slightest hint that humans might have found a way to not die. In this episode he set out to put a stop to it /even before he knew about the scorpion monster part./ Buddy, if being mortal is so great, maybe you should precommit to killing yourself in 80 years? No? Why not?
