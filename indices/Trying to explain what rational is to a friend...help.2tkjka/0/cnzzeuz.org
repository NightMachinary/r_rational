Epistemic rationality is having correct beliefs, beliefs that are accurate reflections of reality. Instrumental rationality is achieving your goals effectively, i.e. making good decisions, prioritizing correctly, etc. In general, you need having good epistemic rationality to achieve good instrumental rationality.

There is a kind of a disconnect between epistemic rationality and instrumental rationality that less wrong and similar blogs are looking to address. It is one thing knowing the results of a lot of psychological studies, it is another to use that to be more effective in your own life. It is possible to be smart and creative and still make poor life choices by failing to apply one's intelligence and creativity to real life. One approach Lesswrong and related organization have been developing is to discuss all the major cognitive biases, then work on strategies for avoiding them, and then test if their methods work.

This subreddit focuses on fanfiction that have characters that have good instrumental rationality (rational fiction) or good epistemic rationality (rationalist fiction). When the characters try to leverage the rules to an extreme extent, we categorize it as munchkin. This sub also focuses on fanfiction that tries to construct a more rational version of the original material (deconstructionist fiction).

As I mentioned before, in real life, there can be a disconnect between epistemic and instrumental rationality. Writing fiction allows the author to create scenarios where this disconnect is less and they can illustrate various techniques to make good decision or avoid cognitive bias or creatively solve novel problems. Ideally, seeing a fictional character address their life issues rationally in an exciting context would inspire you to apply rationality in your own life better. For example, HJPEV in HPMOR continuously underestimates many key people around him (Hermione with the army battles, Dumbledore with actually thinking he might be insane, Voldemort, etc.). IRL I want to remember that even if people aren't as smart or rational as me in some areas, they may still be more competent or skilled than me in others.
