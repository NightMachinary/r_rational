Do you remember in the Matrix when, while fleeing from the agents and seeking an escape from the Matrix Trinity decided that was the perfect time to have an extended conversation with Neo about his feelings and so Agent Smith caught up?

Do you remember in Prometheus when the ship's captain was trying to outrun the circular rolling ship and forgot she had the ability to run sideways and so got crushed?

Do you remember in Skyfall when the supposed tech expert Q connected Silva's computer directly to the M16 mainframe with no precautions and predictably it hacked the mainframe?

Rational stories are stories where people use their intelligence to solve their problems. Where they use scientific knowledge to handle unfamiliar situations. Where they use the well known powers or abilities that they have in a consistent and reliable manner.

No one is an idiot for the sake of the plot, no one does things just for the evilness or goodness. They try to win.
