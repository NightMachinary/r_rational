I think you're starting off wrong. Like, you're not rational, you're an aspiring rationalist. Humans really can't be rational, only strive to be so (it's because your hardware is corrupted and your software has bugs in it :-p).

I did once write a short-ish (shorter than wikipedia) explanation on what "rationality" is. You can find it [[http://rationalist-tutor.tumblr.com/post/100427880705/what-does-rationality-mean-anyway][here]], or if you really dislike tumblr for some reason, I also uploaded it to [[https://rationalisttutor.wordpress.com/2014/10/22/what-does-rationality-mean-anyway/][wordpress]].
