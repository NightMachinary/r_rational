To me, rationality is mostly based on problem solving. Except where some people might limit themselves to just finding effective solutions to their problems, rationality takes on the additional problem of trying to figure out what method will lead to the optional solution of every relevant problem that you might face. So in that sense it's a method of problem solving that tries to optimize itself in order to more effectively solve other problems.
