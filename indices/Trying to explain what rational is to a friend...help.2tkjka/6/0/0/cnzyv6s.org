Well, I mean, I guess I may be using the wrong word, but doesn't being rational go beyond writing? Like I understand that the dictionary definition of being rational is just being able to pursue something in a logical manner, but as far as being a rationalist, or someone who considers themselves part of the rational school of thought, doesn't it go further?

Like, understanding tribalism, bayes' theorem, thought experiments? When we can dissect why something IS the way it is, and work our way past ingrained beliefs in the process, isn't that part of being a rationalist?
