To be rational, you first have to start by wanting something. Maybe it's to not die; maybe it's to keep a loved one from dying; maybe it's to keep /everyone/ from dying; maybe it's to read comics. Which thing you want is less important than /actually/ wanting it, a lot, instead of just saying you want it or thinking you want it. Specifically, wanting it so much that you're willing to go to the effort of figuring out what actually will help you achieve that goal, and what won't. "Rationality" is simply the science of winning: all the various tips and tricks that help a person sort out true things from false things, so that they can achieve their goals.

(IMHO, YMMV, HAND.)
