  To be rational, you first have to start by wanting something.

For instrumental rationality yes. For epistemic rationality, you simply have to try to reach a correct state of knowledge about reality. For some people, epistemic rationality is an end goal in itself, for others it is a useful intermediate goal.

  "Rationality" is simply the science of winning: all the various tips and tricks that help a person sort out true things from false things, so that they can achieve their goals.

I think the distinction between instrumental rationality and epistemic rationality is useful because they don't always line up. There is the classic stereotype of someone who is extremely well read but doesn't have any common sense. There are engineers who can acknowledge that science works and do a good job as engineers, and yet are still Young Earth Creationists (I was raised Southern Baptist and I personally know people like this).

Of course in the long run, epistemic rationality is necessary for instrumental rationality. But it would be a mistake not to acknowledge the fact that people can know a lot and still "lose" or be willfully ignorant and still "win".
