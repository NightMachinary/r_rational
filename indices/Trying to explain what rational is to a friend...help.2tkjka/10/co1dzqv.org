My favorite answer is a reply by Scott Alexander to someone who gets the answer completely wrong. But [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/11/27/why-i-am-not-rene-descartes/][it's not short]]. If I had to summarize it briefly using only quotes from the post:

â€œLife is made up of limited, confusing, contradictory, and maliciously doctored facts. [...] Other people can present the facts to you, but in the end you're the one deciding what and who to believe. Just like everybody dies alone, everybody decides on their beliefs alone. And rationality is what allows them to do that accurately."
