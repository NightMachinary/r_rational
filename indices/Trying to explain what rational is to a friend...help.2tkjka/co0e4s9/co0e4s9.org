In the "normal" world, rationality means having a good reason for everything you do and think. The technical definition on this corner of the internet is a little different.

Rationality is similar to being smart, but not quite - because sometimes smart people do and believe dumb things, right? Rationality is /acting/ smart.

*Each action you take leads to a different future. Rationality is what helps you choose the action that leads to your /favorite/ future off the list.* That's the one sentence summary of technical rationality.

There's also a related skill called "epistemic rationality", which is about using evidence to have true beliefs, which is more related to the non-technical use of "rational". Believing the right things often helps us to act in the right way.

Sometimes we use the word "instrumentally rational" instead of just saying "rational"for people who act in the right way despite not being smart or right. For example, you might not think George Bush is very "rational" in the commonsense way of the word, but if you want to acknowledge that he has been more successful than many others might in his circumstances, you might call him "instrumentally rational".
