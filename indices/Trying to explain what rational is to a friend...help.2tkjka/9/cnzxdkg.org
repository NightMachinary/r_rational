Rationality the art of your goals more often by refining how you think. This mostly means techniques to develop an accurate world view, and to avoid mistakes when acting on that world view.

Rational humanism is that plus using goals from a moral philosophy that accepts human values as morality, instead of needing morality to come from some deity or cosmic constant. ie: Friends are good and death is bad because that's clearly how humans value these things anyway.

Rational transhumanism is a subset of rational humanism where you look at the ancient philosophical questions that pop up in humanism - like if death is bad, then how long should people live - with the obvious (ie: forever).
