I like this, these are good rules. I just lost a bunch of would-have-been-productive time looking up examples of tensile strengths, masses, sizes, etc. Thanks for that! :P

It occurs to me that a simpler ruleset would be "everything within one foot of his skin goes with him". Under this ruleset it would be hard to UNweaponize his ability; he'd be cutting chunks out of walls, floors, people, etc whenever he teleported. Combine that with an instinctive teleport whenever startled or frightened and you've got some real potential for disaster in this guy's life.

Killing him would be straightforward: handgun will do the job just fine if you take him by surprise.

Capturing him would be tricky -- hand-to-hand with him would be instantly fatal for the attacker, so you'd need to get him at range with a taser, tranq gun, etc. He can't teleport out of handcuffs, but he /can/ teleport out of any cell. You'd need to either keep him unconscious or do something like was mentioned below -- put an explosive collar on him that goes off if it stops receiving a radio signal. Alternatively, manacle him to a wall; he can teleport out, but he'll bring the manacles and a chunk of wall with him, so he's still trapped on the far end. Strap a sufficiently powerful locator beacon to him and you could pick him up again.
