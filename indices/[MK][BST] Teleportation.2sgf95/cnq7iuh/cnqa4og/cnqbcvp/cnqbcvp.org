Thanks. My idea was to make rules that didn't depend on human intuition.

Teleporting everything within 1 foot could work. The most important rule imo is establishing an upper bound on volume teleported. Otherwise, as mentioned above, you could be moving entire vehicles or arbitrarily long lines of jumping humans. Beyond that is pretty much up to you.

The 1-foot rule does prevent teleporting in crowded places if the guy cares about other people. Or within 1 foot of large valuable items if he cares about collateral damage. It would also mean a bomb strapped to the body would stay strapped on. In any case, the simplicity of such a rule is good.

It occurs to me that, going by the theoretical rules I outlined above and assuming 'the teleporter can always teleport their own naked body no matter what', they would not be able to teleport out of handcuffs UNLESS those handcuffs were bolted to a wall or floor or some other item not possible to teleport.
