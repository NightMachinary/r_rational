It almost doesn't need to be said. Unless you have a Zion(and interventional godlike figures don't really belong in rational fiction), powers will apply just as well to organic material as inorganic material. There is the issue that if the character users that, they'll come to be seen as a living weapon, though, and they may be wise enough to avoid demonstrating that. They might even decide to lie about it.
