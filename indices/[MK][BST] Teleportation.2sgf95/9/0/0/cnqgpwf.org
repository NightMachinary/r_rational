Actually, that momentum thing is another problem. If I'm orbiting the sun, how can I safely teleport to the earth? I'm moving relative to the sun's surface, and very fast at that. Or from interstellar space -- there, it's not even a matter of safety. What are you measuring my momentum relative to, if I manage to get to the barycenter of the Milky Way and Andromeda?

For the teleporting to distant galaxies problem, it seems like you're saying I need to be able to distinguish features of a particular size to go there. I can't look at the moon and teleport there because the features I can distinguish are leagues across. I can teleport across a valley because I can distinguish features that are under a meter across. But this would place a dependency on eyesight.

Blind people can't teleport. I would be hard pressed to teleport a city block without glasses unless I'd been there before. (And it seems like you want to rule out technological assistance for this part, so eyeglasses don't let me teleport further than I could without. Or telescopes would help, at least within a few light seconds.)

Also, what about teleporting onto moving objects? If I am sufficiently familiar with the QE2's main deck, can I teleport there even if the ship is on the move? Obvious momentum considerations aside.

What about different locations that look identical?

What if I know a place very well but don't know where it is? I was drunk and wandered into the middle of a desert, had an hour of lucidity and memorized a place, passed out, woke up in a hospital... Can I teleport back?

You need to be oriented, but what if I'm oriented on Mars and want to teleport to Earth? Do I need to know the vague direction toward Earth?
