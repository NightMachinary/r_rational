Ignoring the whole found-out-and-dissected-by-the-NSA bit. Also assuming that teleportation takes place in a manner that prevents relativistic happy fun times. What I would /actually/ do is just shorten my commute. Probably do a bit more tourism and hiking.

In a clear night sky with a telescope, I can see the Andromeda galaxy. Presumably that isn't enough to let me teleport to the Andromeda galaxy -- or would it? If so, this offers extremely cheap space exploration: I don a space suit, teleport to the moon, look at a particular nebula, spend a handful of jumps getting close to that nebula, gather telemetry with my space suit, and teleport back.

You found an exoplanet? With a good image of the region, I can teleport to some spot nearby, then hop successively closer with relative jumps. If I see a place that's sufficiently Earthlike, I can investigate it further, even land. The moment I detect danger, I'm back home in a decontamination tank.

You want to set up a space station? Lift in in a helium balloon ten inches off the floor and I can teleport it to orbit. Or if that's cheating, I can at least heft 80kg chunks into space, and I can go up there with minimal preparation and cost to assemble these chunks.

How does this translate into zero gravity? Can I grab onto a giant space station and teleport with the whole thing?

  He is shifted into the momentum frame of his destination, so if he teleports from the pole to the equator he isn't mashed into a wall by the change in the earth's rotation.

Similarly, if I teleport from here to the moon while jogging, I will be going a jogging pace relative to the surface of the moon. If I am falling at 100m/s and teleport to the far side of the gravity well I'm in, I will be falling 100m/s in the opposite direction.

How about fluids?

Which is scary, actually. Some of those objects are people. I would need to install webcams in the places I typically want to teleport to in order to ensure they're empty when I want to teleport there.
