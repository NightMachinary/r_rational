His potential as an assassin or saboteur is pretty damn extreme with the current power description. Here's a very low tech example.

Put on a protective suit. Fill a creatively-designed (so you can study it and teleport back to it) storage tank to neck-height with diesel fuel, and feed non-oxygen gasses into it. Use a drone or live video to teleport to a site. Inflate a very large airbag, drop a lit thermite charge, and then teleport back into the diesel-filled room, holding the airbag below neck level. You then exit the tank out the ladder.

Even if you carry sparks back with you, there will be no oxygen in the diesel tank to ignite, but a couple cubic yards of diesel fuel will appear at the point where you teleported out, right on top of the magnesium flare you lit.
