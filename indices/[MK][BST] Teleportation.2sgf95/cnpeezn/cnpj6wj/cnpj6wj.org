      In order to teleport somewhere he needs to have a very clear picture of it in his mind. This means either he can see it directly,

  In a clear night sky with a telescope, I can see the Andromeda galaxy. Presumably that isn't enough to let me teleport to the Andromeda galaxy -- or would it?

Nope. And a satellite image of New York would not be sufficient to let him teleport to Times Square. He'd need an up-close-and-personal picture taken at the actual location.

Hm. Now that I think about it, that probably wouldn't work. Too many things would be different from the picture to the state of the target at the current moment -- tourists not there, etc.

Needing a very-close-to-exact match to current circumstances would do a lot to control the power level here. If "someone moved the couch" is sufficient to ban him from teleporting into a room things become much less exploitable.

  How does this translate into zero gravity? Can I grab onto a giant space station and teleport with the whole thing?

/grumble/ You Internetians and your difficult questions.

I honestly don't know how that would work. What would you do with it?

      He is shifted into the momentum frame of his destination, so if he teleports from the pole to the equator he isn't mashed into a wall by the change in the earth's rotation.

  Similarly, if I teleport from here to the moon while jogging, I will be going a jogging pace relative to the surface of the moon. If I am falling at 100m/s and teleport to the far side of the gravity well I'm in, I will be falling 100m/s in the opposite direction.

I think the momentum frame would need to be defined in relation to the center of mass of the object. So, if you are falling 100 m/s and you teleport to the opposite side of the earth, you're still falling 100 m/s second and you're still falling towards the center of the earth; it's just that your velocity vector has been flipped.
