Possibly tie in "what he's carrying" to some level of what he psychologically believes he's carrying? I'm assuming he makes a mental decision to teleport and then it happens, so maybe those kind of barriers would help (and he has to be directly touching it? The thing about carrying things in general is how do you define where an object ends? A rope isn't homogeneous, so how would 'the universe' know where the rope ends and say a tied string begins, especially as there could be air molecules, bacteria, etc. intertwined. Let alone how you define it's boundary with another object at a microscopic level).

Uhh you say he faces the same way as the source point, but you need to define a reference frame for that (can be a secret/ties into his eventual source of power). Facing south doesn't make sense if he teleports into space, unless he literally always is aligned based on his position and direction on Earth.

"Sense of direction" is loosely defined. As in knowing which way is the Sun/the magnetic North/South? If it's something like this it'd be worth always carrying a compass etc.
