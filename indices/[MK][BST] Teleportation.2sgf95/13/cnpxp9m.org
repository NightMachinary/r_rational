Reference frame hacking. He's falling towards the ground for some reason - can he teleport directly to the ground without plowing into it at the same speed?

If not, can he teleport to the /exact opposite location on the planet/ while maintaining a reference frame with respect to, say, the Sun, so that he's now traveling upwards instead of downwards? And when he slows to a stop, can he now teleport safely to the ground?

If his reference frame is always going to be with respect to the nearest gravitational sink, that's going to be problematic. If he falls from somewhere and reaches terminal velocity, he can keep teleporting back up into the air, but will presumably eventually succumb to fatigue unless he can find somewhere like a giant airbag to appear above.

Hacks from density-changing power exploits:\\
- being able to cut through any form of normal matter by teleporting a hand or finger into the matter, then teleporting back out again, leaving a crudely gouged hole. He could make neater cuts by picking up a knife or a chopstick and teleporting only that part of "things he's carrying" into the target. If he can control exactly what comes with him during teleports, he can disintegrate chains, handcuffs etc.\\
- being able to place items inside or the other side of things (like containers or walls) by tying them to a thin string, swinging the string until it's horizontal, and then teleporting himself, the string, and the item so that the string penetrates the container/wall and the item winds up embedded or on the other side, with only the smallest hole in the penetrated surface to give it away. Maybe use fishing line?\\
- should he take to wearing a face-mask with an oxygen supply? It'd handle the problem with destination material getting into his lungs, provide a few minutes of air while he reoriented, and it could have a built-in mini-gyroscope in his field of view which always showed which way was 'up'. Escape any embedding by teleporting a mile up, then looking for the ground and immediately teleporting back to it. Might want to start wearing shoes/boots with shock absorbers, or an airbag suit, or something which could minimize the impact of short falls. Or just have a permanent set of emergency-services giant airbags (the kind used for jumpers) set up in a cave somewhere. Or take to wearing an emergency small parachute all the time.

(On a side note, if the material of the destination fills his lungs if he has his mouth open, does he have to block his nostrils as well?)

Wealth hacking. What's the value of genuine moonrock to specialist collectors? What are people currently paying to put micro- and nano-satellites into orbit? Would the character be interested in smuggling? How about delivering "diplomatic parcels" to embassies?

How stealthy is the character? Could they track people while staying out of sight on rooftops or other locations? If he didn't want to empty out bank vaults to make some cash, would he consider tracking drug dealers to their sources, tracking those sources to /their/ sources, and eventually seeing if they could wind up looking at somewhere with a stupidly large amount of physical cash stored on the premises? Which leads to the question of how much of a pallet of cash could he grab with a jump-in, jump-out maneuver? Especially if he seeded the area with smoke grenades first and then did multiple jumps? What if he wore a sumo suit and just teleported into the cash pile from his storage location? (Sure, a lot of cash would be chopped up, but the raw volume should bring a lot of it back. And doing it again on a two-second delay would allow the cash which had been surrounding him on the first appearance to fall into the hole he'd made, making it a target for the second trip.)

Come to think of it, I'm really liking the airbag-suit/sumo-suit thing. Automatically increase his 'displace' volume /and/ handle short falls!
