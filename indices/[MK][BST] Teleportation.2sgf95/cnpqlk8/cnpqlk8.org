I can't tell from your post if you've already read the Jumper books by Steven Gould or not. While the teleport power in the books doesn't match up to your qualifications exactly, I feel that Gould's approach to it is very rational. Also I just wanted to point out that the movie is nothing, /nothing/ in comparison to the books.
