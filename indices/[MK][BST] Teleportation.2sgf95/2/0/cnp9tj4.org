Bringing things with him:

It might make sense to reduce this to: whatever solid objects he's touching goes with him, along with all solid objects that /they/ are touching, and so on. So, his socks go because he's touching them, his shoes go because they're touching his socks, and his shoelaces go because they're touching the shoes. Non-solid objects can be cleanly delineated, so he has the option to leave them behind -- basically, when he teleported the molecules that were actually touching him would go with but none of the others.

This would mean that he needs to hop up so he's not touching the ground when he goes. It would also mean that if he's holding onto a rope which is tied to the wall he can't teleport without letting go first.

--------------

Carrying:

He definitely needs to be fully supporting it, although he doesn't need to be able to do more than heft it up. Holding someone's hand while they jump doesn't count as supporting them -- they aren't supported at all.

Although. Hm. Perhaps it makes more sense to remove the weight limit and just go with the "all solid objects he's touching"? No, then he could teleport with an entire airplane and that's more OP than I want to go.

--------------

Momentum frame:

I figure that his subconscious is really in the driver's seat here -- he doesn't consciously understand the process of teleporting and when he arrives somewhere he doesn't consciously choose which parts of the new area to send back to his source.

Given that, I think he'd match whatever reference frame his subconscious decided was the "right" one. On a planet it would almost certainly be the frame of the ground. Teleporting into free space with no visual references (or while blindfolded), he'd keep the reference frame he came from...with possibly hilarious / fatal results. In the case of the baseball bat: when he teleported in the tip of it would be sent back to his origin. It would keep swinging, so he would be hit by the part that hadn't been teleported out.

Also, teleporting around water would be interesting. Imagine that he's holding some water cupped in his hand; assuming his subconscious is driving, he could bring the water with him if he wanted or leave it behind if not. Liikewise, if he's underwater he can teleport without having to bring all the water with him because he subconscious recognizes his intent.

Of course, this opens up a new can of worms about how hypnosis and other control-the-subconscious techniques work on him.
