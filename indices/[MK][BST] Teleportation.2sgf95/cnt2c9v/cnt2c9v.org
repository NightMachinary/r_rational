  Whatever he's carrying when he teleports goes with him. I need a more specific definition of "carrying" here, but the basics are intuitive: he can take it with him if he is lifting it, if it's inside something he is lifting, or if it's on top of something he is lifting.

I know you still haven't decided on a precise definition for "carrying", but: this reminds me of a scene in /The Long Earth/, which has a similar rule. Specifically, it reminded me of the scene where (extremely minor spoiler alert) the protagonist teleports while "carrying" an airship on the end of a rope, and it works.

The simplest way to do this would be to have air act as a sort of "teleport-insulator", but that would either require you to jump every time you teleport (heck, why not?) or to be able to leave bindings behind. Or, maybe, to only leave behind things that are below you?
