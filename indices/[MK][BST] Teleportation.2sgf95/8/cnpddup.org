  In order to teleport somewhere he needs to have a very clear picture of it in his mind. This means [...] he is extremely familiar with it from spending a lot of time there.

If he's teleporting to a location that has changed significantly since he last saw it, does the teleport go through anyway? Does it simply fail? For example, he's teleporting to his childhood home, but someone else has moved in and bought all new furniture.

If there are several places that his mental image could match, does it pick at random? Does it pick "the closest match"? Does it choose in some other way? Or fail? For example, he's teleporting to a hotel room, and there's 100 identical rooms in the building - where does he go?

Either way, could this be used to gain information about a place without actually teleporting? I'm imagining that Al attempts to teleport to his safe-house, but specifically pictures the door being locked and the room being empty. If the teleport fails, he knows it's not safe there - and his attackers don't know he knows.
