First off, definitely read the Jumper series. Some my favorite novels and nothing at all like the movie. The character puts a lot of thought into doing things safely and right the first time to avoid problems like teleporting into solid objects. Given what's been spoiled so far, you might think there's not much untrodden ground, but that's what I thought about my knowledge of D&D munchkinry before 2YE came along and you've proven me wrong in the most entertaining possible way.

Re: a specific definition of "carrying". When the force he applies to an object counteracts (or for purposes of teleporting out of, say, deep space, would counteract at his destination) the force due to gravity, however briefly, I think he can be said to be carrying it. That stops him from loading a shopping cart full of stuff and popping away, unless he can lift the cart and its contents for long enough to teleport and also stops him from getting away if he is, for example, chained to a wall (since he may be applying force to part of the chain but the rest is held up by the wall which is a solid object too large for him to lift). Unless he can maneuver himself in such a way as to not touch the chain at all like maybe letting it hang at its lowest point and then teleporting out of it. It seems like a reasonable power limit while still having potential to end up broken (used in combination with the reference frame momentum trick, maybe).

Edit: also, the ground: if his subconscious is already handling the destination reference frame issues, why not let it handle the ground interface issue too? He has a body image of himself as X cm tall, and that's as far as the effect reaches (just never ever wear platform shoes). Jumper handled it by having an area of his surroundings a couple of nanometers thick come along for the ride, which would be mostly air but also a small amount of whatever he was standing on.
