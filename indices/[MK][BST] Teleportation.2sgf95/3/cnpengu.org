Regarding the sense of direction aspect. Is this directionality to do with line-of-sight or is it absolute? I'm thinking here of the curvature of the Earth and tele-porting to the other side of the world.

On the same topic. How exact does that need to be? Can Al apply a process of elimination given that if he can't teleport then he knows the direction is not right?
