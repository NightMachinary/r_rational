Read the book /Jumper/, which the (terrible) movie was based on. It's got lots of cool stuff. The second and fourth books in the series are also pretty awesome. It follows almost all of the rules that you outlined above, and the author does a good job of thinking out the consequences of these rules, and extrapolating on them.

Edit: If you don't want to read them, I can spoil them for you when I get home.
