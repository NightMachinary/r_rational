This took me a second...by "pop an airbag" you mean "inflate it", right? I thought you meant pop as in "pop a balloon" and was confused.

Yeah, that would make for a pretty big problem for whatever was on the other side. I don't think you'd get a thermobaric explosion, just a giant Molotov cocktail, but that would be bad enough.
