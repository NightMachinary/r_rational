Reworded the airbag bit. I doubt there would be a thermobaric explosion, but a few cubic yards of burning diesel fuel is a nightmare in almost any place where people would be. And there's nothing to say that you couldn't do the same with more esoteric chemicals. I chose diesel because it is a dense energy liquid, and easy to get.
