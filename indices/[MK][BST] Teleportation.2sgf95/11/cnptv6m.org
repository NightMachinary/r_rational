Could be used to break practically unbreakable things? Say he needs to get his crew of criminals into a bank vault. He could stand before a wall/menacing vault door, then teleport so that a part of him is inside the door, then quickly away, then repeat until the hole is big enough for his people to get in.

Similarly, if it ever becomes necessary to break the Unbreakable Artefact, just teleport so an arm appears where half the artefact was?

I guess there would have to be other powers in the world that could interfere with his.
