Teleporting while holding onto a piece of diamond might be a way to fuse two or more of them together. Big gems fetch disproportionately higher prices relative to small ones, and diamond dust is actually cheap, so you could make money this way even just using diamonds from earth.

By using a glass replica of an exquisitely cut gem, you could turn raw uncut diamond into finished gems directly. Rest the replica on your hand and teleport to holding your hand directly under the bulk. (The diamond section ends up at the other location and the glass ends to buried in the raw diamond.)

You could also make some 'stamp' three dimensional shapes out by teleporting in plastic models from a 3D printer. So you could make durable, tough customized components for your workshop, and maybe even a good suit of armor. (In addition to the protection, picking stuff up with powered armor might be a way to increase teleport limits.)
