Thanks! That link is quite awesome.

Aren't you forgetting the power of all of that mass expanding in single moment, though? Didn't find anything about it in article.

Also I'm pretty sure it would be enough to penetrate the crust and create enormous volcano, which could be enough to change atmosphere to unbreathable, no?
