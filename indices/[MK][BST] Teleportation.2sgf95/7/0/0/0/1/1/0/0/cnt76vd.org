I couldn't find anything on how stable neutronium would be outside of the enormous pressure that created it, nor on whether it would behave like a solid or (in?)incompressible fluid.

I assumed it would be solid or fluid, but stable, i.e. wouldn't immediately explode, in which case you'd get a /really/ deep hole, which doesn't /necessarily/ create a volcano (I think).

If it /does/ immediately explode, it would probably expand into something at /least/ as dense as air, which'd take up at most as much volume as earth's atmosphere*. Now /that/ is one gib blastwave; I assume it'd wipe out most non-extremophile life, including plants; you'd have enormous tsunami-like waves crashing into approximately half the world's beaches, possibly reaching far into otherwise dry land and swallowing several islands whole.

I'd try to run some calculations on that blastwave, but it's late, I'm tired, and I'm very unfamiliar with fluid dynamics :/

*Earth's atmosphere conveniently weighs around twice as much as Mt. Everest

I will, however, submit this to Randall Munroe of xkcd and see if that won't get a What If entry. My sleepy brain refused to calculate the energy released by 66L of neutronium expanding until equilibrium with the atmosphere's reached, but I'm pretty sure it would be far more that the similar [[http://what-if.xkcd.com/1/][relativistic baseball]] entry.
