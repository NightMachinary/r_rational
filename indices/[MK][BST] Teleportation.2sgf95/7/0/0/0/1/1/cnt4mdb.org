[[http://qntm.org/destroy][Destroying Earth is not nearly as easy as you think.]]

A human-sized chunk of neutronium weighs 10^{15} to 10^{17} kg (1 to 100 times the mass of Mt. Everest).

Earth is 6 * 10^{24} kg, i.e. 7.5 to 9.5 orders of magnitude heavier.

While the crater would certainly be pretty big, Earth would still be Earth.

Plus, the neutronium would be arriving without any significant momentum (which is what makes asteroids so deadly), so the damage might not even be that big. I'd imaging the effect would be roughly similar to flipping Mt. Everest, i.e. you'd get a big ol' hole in the ground and not much else.

Nice try though.
