#+begin_quote
  What if he teleports into a block of concrete with his mouth open? Does the concrete fill his lungs? Or does it stop at his lips?
#+end_quote

I think it fills his lungs. Teleporting into a solid object is apparently a Really Bad Idea.

#+begin_quote
  What's the minimum distance that he can teleport?
#+end_quote

I'm going with "the smallest distance that he can perceive as a distance." He can't teleport a nanometer, in other words, but he can teleport a millimeter or so.

#+begin_quote
  How does he avoid ending up with his feet an inch into the floor?
#+end_quote

He teleports to the floor's surface.

#+begin_quote
  Could he hold out a piece of paper, and teleport so that the paper cuts through something?
#+end_quote

Yes. I was actually thinking that exact thing when I wrote the bit about switching mass, but I figured I'd leave it out so as not to bias people's thoughts in one particular direction.

#+begin_quote
  What's the minimum time between teleports?
#+end_quote

The smallest time that he can perceive -- less than the blink of an eye. Basically, the speed of thought.

#+begin_quote
  Could he teleport somewhere holding a grenade, then teleport back before it explodes?
#+end_quote

Yes.

#+begin_quote
  Could he teleport into the sun for a nanosecond, and teleport back out, leaving a large chunk of plasma at his original location?
#+end_quote

Yes, assuming that he can accurately target the sun somehow.

#+begin_quote
  Also, how can he teleport into a solid object if he has to picture his destination? It's pretty difficult to picture the inside of a block of granite.
#+end_quote

I'm figuring it as "he can visualize the area around it and then project himself within that image." So if he can teleport to, say, a particular room then it's very easy to extend that visualization to "in this room, but inside /this/ chunk of wall here". He couldn't teleport just "down 1,000 feet" because he can't visualize that at all.
