Possible problems:

#+begin_quote
  He is shifted into the momentum frame of his destination, so if he teleports from the pole to the equator he isn't mashed into a wall by the change in the earth's rotation.
#+end_quote

Locations don't have momentum frames, the stuff in them does, and you threw that stuff back the other way.

#+begin_quote
  He cannot take part of an object with him when he teleports.
#+end_quote

Is this a special exception to his portal-cut-swap on arrival? He has to teleport away first and then back into the object to take part of it?

#+begin_quote
  In order to teleport somewhere he needs to have a very clear picture of it in his mind. This means either he can see it directly, he is currently looking at a detailed picture of it, or he is extremely familiar with it from spending a lot of time there.

#+begin_quote
  In order to teleport somewhere, he must know roughly what direction it is. If he's lost his sense of direction (e.g. underwater, in a dark room, etc) he can't just teleport out.
#+end_quote

These two don't seem to play well together.

#+begin_quote
  There is no range limit on his teleportation.
#+end_quote

Does he speed of light lag on his way to his destination? In what frames of reference do we observe an instantaneous transmission? In which ones does his teleport provide FTL signaling and backward time travel?

Is energy and entropy conserved? If he changes from one potential in a field force (ex gravity), such as say by teleporting to a lower altitude, does he become hotter while the displaced material becomes colder?
