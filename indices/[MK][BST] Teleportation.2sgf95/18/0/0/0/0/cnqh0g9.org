Oh, I must have misunderstood. I interpreted the entire sixth bullet point way wrong, because I thought that you were just switching volume, without any respect to the energy of the system he was switching with.

I think it came from "momentum frame", which I mistook for just meaning velocity without any respect for mass because of the entire warp into space thing. I think I read into that that it was just gonna be positional wish fulfillment because there wouldn't be anything to switch with other than radiation and incredibly tiny dust molecules that would completely retard the speed he would be going at. In addition, the entire "Teleporting into a solid object is apparently a Really Bad Idea" made it seem as though he wouldn't be replacing the concrete with the oxygen in his blood and lungs.

Within the constraints of those rules though, I think the best thing he could do is to rapidly redefine how his subconscious defines self, because if he subscribes to the cosmic view that he is deity and is therefore omnipresent, he could functionally teleport anything anywhere. He wouldn't even be really wrong or irrational in believing that, because if the only delineation between what he can and can't manipulate is what he believes he can or can't manipulate, he is deity.
