There are several jumper books that explore these ideas. Spoilers below.

...

A jumper learned how to turn the jump power "On" and keep it stuck like that, so he existed in two places at the same time. This was used to flood stuff with water, as well as drain all the air out of a sealed room. Later, a jumper learned to fly. The jumper was always familiar with their current location, so they jumped to exactly where they already where, but with a new velocity vector. This trick was also used to punch really hard.
