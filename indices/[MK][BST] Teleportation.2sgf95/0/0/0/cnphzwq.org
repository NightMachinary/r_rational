One book was about the jumper building a spacesuit and traveling to outerspace. That's the jumper that could create velocity. She put on her suit, flew up, and did cool things. Very good book. Lots of hard science. By the end of that book, I felt like I could build my own spacesuit. I highly recommend it. In fact, I recommend the whole jumper series, especially if you are going to approach a similar idea.
