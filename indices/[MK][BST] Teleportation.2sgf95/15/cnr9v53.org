The ability to teleport objects you are holding, combined with the fact that whatever is there at the destination changes places with it, seems pretty exploitable.

You could hold extremely lightweight objects and teleport next to big heavy objects to move or cut through them. It could be used to tunnel your way through a mountain (just need a piece of styrofoam long and light enough).

If "carrying" applies to buoyant, inflated objects, one could conceivably use a helium balloon inflated in the desired shape and just barely heavier than air, to displace arbitrarily large structures -- entire mountains, perhaps -- lifting their rocky mass to extreme heights, etc.
