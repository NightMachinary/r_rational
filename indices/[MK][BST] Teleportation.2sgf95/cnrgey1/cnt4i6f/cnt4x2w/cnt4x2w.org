    Is this a special exception to his portal-cut-swap on arrival? He has to teleport away first and then back into the object to take part of it?

  He brings things from his source to his destination.

I have a block of cheese. I want to teleport half the block of cheese to a destination. I put my hand on top of the block of cheese. I teleport to the destination. I lower my hand slightly. I teleport back. Roughly half the cheese overlaps with my hand on my arrival and is sent to the original destination like I intended.

You haven't actually stopped me from portal cutting things I want to take with me, you've just delayed me by a jump and perhaps some setup time to find an appropriately sized/shaped object to cut with. I can murder anyone by holding out my fist, teleporting at them, and arriving with my hand in their chest, and chunks of their sternum and heart on the floor behind me.

Furthermore, portal cutting severs chemical and physical bonds which contain potential energy. Depending on how fine you grain it, I might also be severing nuclear, chromodynamic, or even mass-equivalency bonds when the edge of my portal blade slices off part of a particle's amplitude in phase space. I might cause /tacnuke explosions/ around me on arrival, or behind me.
