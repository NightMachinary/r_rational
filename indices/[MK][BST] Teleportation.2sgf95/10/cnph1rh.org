The first thing I'd do is get one of those belts that vibrates in the direction of true North, or maybe implant a magnet into a finger. People seem to have acquired tremendous sense of direction after taking those steps. That would solve the most dangerous drawback of the power.

After that, I'm not sure. It would be tempting to get rich. If I managed to resist the draw of easy riches, I'd probably get in touch with Bill Gates, Elon Musk, or someone else capable of doing great things for humanity. Teleportation could probably solve a lot of problems for the developing world.

I think it might be possible to imprison someone by standing in a jail cell, wearing a very large sumo suit, swapping places with a target, and immediately teleporting back to a safe place.
