If he himself needs to be fully supporting an object, his shoes wouldn't teleport with.

So if he's wearing a single piece of clothing, which extends into a tarp, and on top of the tarp are objects, what would happen?

A) The tarp is transported, the objects aren't, despite being fully supported by the tarp.

B) The tarp tears, despite being a single object.

C) The tarp stays behind, despite being clothing that is worn. The teleporter arrives naked.

D) Both the tarp and the objects teleport along. Transportation of arbitrary amounts of mass achievable, as long as a tarp can be placed under it.

edit: assuming this fails, what if you're "wearing" a zeppelin with cargo, such that it is just barely not neutrally buoyant, and held aloft by your own legs? If only part of the zeppelin's mass is "carried" by you, what procedure is used to determine it?
