Yeah "carry" needs some hard rules.

How much can he carry? Does he need to be fully supporting it or can he be using, say, a wheelbarrow? How about a weight too heavy to heft, or merely too awkward to balance, for more than a few moments before dropping it? For example, he's holding somebody's hand and they jump into the air.

What if that person is holding somebody else's hand?

The "momentum frame" bit needs some work as well. If he teleports into a car traveling on the highway, exchanging part of himself with the parts of the car that his standing form has replaced, one would hope he isn't immediately bi or trisected by the remainder.

Alternately, what if he happens to teleport into the edge of a baseball bat just as it's swinging to hit a home run. Does he match momentum with the bat or with the ground? Neither is going to be ideal, but think hard about /why/ either one happens and you'll have a clearer idea of how the ability works.
