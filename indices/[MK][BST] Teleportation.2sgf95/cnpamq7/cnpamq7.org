What if he teleports into a block of concrete with his mouth open? Does the concrete fill his lungs? Or does it stop at his lips?

What's the minimum distance that he can teleport? How does he avoid ending up with his feet an inch into the floor? Could he hold out a piece of paper, and teleport so that the paper cuts through something? What's the minimum time between teleports? Could he teleport somewhere holding a grenade, then teleport back before it explodes? Could he [[http://what-if.xkcd.com/115/][teleport into the sun for a nanosecond]], and teleport back out, leaving a large chunk of plasma at his original location?

Also, how can he teleport into a solid object if he has to picture his destination? It's pretty difficult to picture the inside of a block of granite.
