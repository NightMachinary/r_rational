  If it fills his lungs just with having his mouth open, wouldn't it automatically happen with his nostrils?

Feh. Ok, teleporting such that his head lands inside a solid object is apparently fatal. He could teleport such that the rest of him is in an object, though, in order to switch with part of its mass.

Just to make sure we're on the same page -- I'm assuming that he pulls the pin, teleports, drops the grenade, teleports out, the grenade goes off a couple seconds later when its fuse burns down. He wouldn't be fast enough to teleport between the moment that the grenade exploded and the moment that the blast front hit him, if that's what you're asking.
