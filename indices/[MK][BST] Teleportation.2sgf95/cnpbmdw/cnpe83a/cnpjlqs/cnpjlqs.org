Alright, I'll try to keep this fairly brief.

*Book 1: Jumper*

- David discovers that he can teleport to places that he's familiar with.
- He uses this power to run away from home (where he lives with his alcoholic father).
- He steals a lot of money from bank vaults (which he only needs to really see the inside of).
- He starts "acquiring" jump sites by going to them and solidifying his memory of the place, along with taking lots of photographs and video for reference.
- He saves a bunch of people in hostage situations (terrorists on the tarmac - much more relevant in 1992).
- The NSA get wind of him, mostly through his carelessness, and try to capture him by using the people close to him.
- He realizes that he's always "resting" with respect to the reference frame of the ground following a jump, so he practices jumping away from a fall.
- He practices a technique for lifting people up to jump them - usually going behind them, getting them off balance, lifting, and then jumping them.
- He dumps a bunch of people in a lake in the middle of nowhere, effectively keeping them imprisoned (they deserved it).
- He acquires a bunch of jump sites at emergency rooms, and then trains for jumping there reflexively when something bad happens.
- He buys a cylinder of bulletproof glass and puts handle on the inside - this allows him to jump into a room with hostiles and makes them unable to shoot him even when they've got guns drawn.

*Book 2: Reflex*

- A shadowy organization drugs him during a meeting with his NSA handler, and sedates him. They get him into surgery and put a clamp on his vagus nerve that will activate if it doesn't receive two overlapping radio signals. If he goes outside the overlap zone (say, by jumping) he gets put in an incredible amount of pain, starts vomiting, and will die quickly. I thought this was a pretty clever way of turning a teleporting man into a tool. They can control where he can and can't teleport to.
- He develops "twinning" where he teleports to a place and then teleports right back where he was, as a way to get around the limits of the implant.
- Unlike with your rules, he takes some of the surrounding air with him. This lets him use twinning to flood an office building by setting his other location as in the water.
- The shadowy organization tries to capture his wife (teleportation is either contagious or learnable with enough trips) by finding a room that she frequently jumps to, and making it airtight then filling it with noxious gas so that when she jumps in, she'll inhale it and fall unconscious right away.
- The shadowy organization develops a jumper detector - it's basically a modified gravitational-wave detector that looks for a sudden change in gravity caused by someone popping into existence.

*Book 3: Impulse*

- Ten years later, they're using their powers for good - doing a lot of humanitarian stuff, occasional work for the government (extractions mostly), trying to track down what's left of the shadowy organization, etc.
- Realizing that they are always stationary with respect to their reference frame following a jump, their daughter tries changing her reference frame, and after some trials and tribulations, is able to add arbitrary amounts of velocity while standing still - letting her jump straight up in the air at 20kmph, or letting her throw a very hard punch.

*Book 4: Exo*

- Their daughter develops a one-person space agency. He goes into a ton of detail on this, which I really appreciated - acquiring a space suit, adjusting for air pressure differences, communication with the ground, etc. They deorbit space junk and put microsats into orbit, then eventually build a space colony. The book ends with Cent becoming the first woman on Mars.
- Twinning is used with low-Earth orbit to create a hard vacuum in a room full of enemies.

(I believe that most of this is accurate, but I might have gotten a few things wrong - for the most part, its a very well researched series.)
