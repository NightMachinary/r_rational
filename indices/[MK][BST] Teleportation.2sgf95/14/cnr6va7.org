I'd prioritize setting up a lunar colony. Get a self-sustaining automated factory system going there. Port in starter batches of the small, high tech stuff like laser diodes, motors, and computer chips, make the bulkier stuff out of refined regolith, get an in-situ tech spiral going until it is truly self replicating (hiring/kidnapping engineers as needed), then cover the whole Moon with robots.

For startup cash, instead of trying to sell authentic moon dust (potentially raising questions about where it came from), maybe sell it online as moon dust [[http://www.orbitec.com/store/simulant.html][simulant]]. Martian dust simulant sells for $500 for 50lb. A few dozen trips, using an old scuba suit or something, and you have enough to finance some better engineered gear (like maybe an actual space suit). After that, you can stay long enough to look around a bit. In certain impact craters (caused by C-type asteroids) there are probably diamonds. These could be sold to finance further operations.
