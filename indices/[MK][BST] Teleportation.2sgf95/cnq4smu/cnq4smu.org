I think the mechanic would work better if instead of teleportation, it was the ability to switch position and momentum. Some of the rules you have are really ad hoc and not well defined as is(Like the entire handcuffs thing. If he can teleport without bringing the aor around him with him or just the air tpuchinf his skin, he'd be able to teleport away by just teleporting a thin slice of metal with him) and feel really janky. If instead he could could switch objects' position amd momentum with himself the rules would bw a lot more simple and elegant. You could restrict the amount of material he'd be able to transfer my some sort of muscle-like mechanism, that would gradually become more powerful as the story progressed, or just leave it to his own body mass(which could be exploited by becoming so fat he'd need the equivalent of a baby elephant to swap with every time which would cause a small boom any time he appeared). If you actually want to write a rationalist story and aren't afraid of newtonian physics, that would probably be the easiest way, because right now your system is so piecemeal it can't be explored or exploited properly.
