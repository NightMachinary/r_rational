Switching with stuff at the other end is exactly what I proposed, which is why your post confused me. Maybe I should have phrased my question as "what's the difference between what I'm proposing and what you're proposing?"

Your system would work but is OP for the story I was to tell -- I don't want the character to be switching places with a cliff. Thanks for the idea, though.
