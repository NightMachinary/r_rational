It's the difference between switching the molecules at one location with molecules of equivalent mass at a second location, and suddenly causing molecules at one location to not exist and then exist at a second location. In the second version, at the first site you would immediately notice a drop in pressure because several mols of molecules all of a sudden left the vicinity. I'm not sure how much force it would generate, but the acceleration or jerk would probably be on the order of a punch or kick pulling matter in the area in(likely a lot larger, I haven't done the math). At the site of reappearance, it would then produce an equivalent amount of acceleration/jerk. In addition, the person would suddenly have about 80 grams of atmosphere through their body. We're mostly empty space, so initially the molecules would all fit. Unfortunately, the rapid collisions would push the molecules apart pretty rapidly. 80 grams doesn't seem like a lot, but when you have about 6 grams of oxygen in your brain trying to escape as fast as possible, death would probably be the best thing you can hope for. In the first version, you avoid all of these complications, because you can switch the momentum and position of all the molecules in the relevant area. It'd be easiest if you could have a direct mass to mass exchange because then the velocity wouldn't change, but since momentums are exchanged it would work almost exactly like an elastic collision so you can easily calculate it. This has the added benefit of being able to switch with lower or higher mass objects, the person would just be going as much faster or slower as mass was lost or gained(the exact equation is M1/V1i + M2/V2i = M1/V2f + M2/V2f, where M1i is object 1's mass, V2i is object 2's initial velocity, and V1f is object 1's final velocity). Basocally, if he changes position with a cliff, he'd suddenly be moving at an insane speed. This is the best system in my opinion, because it at least conserves energy, and has enough complexity that the main character will have to experiment a lot to understand.
