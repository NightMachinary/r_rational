Thinker's probably wrong, I've edited it out. With regard to the others: the manifestations basically replace the user's body--that's what I meant by no longer has a defined location.\\
Example: the user can mimic teleportation by creating two manifestations, having one move far away, then terminating the other. Changer comes similarly(because the user's "body" becomes obsidian)
