Power 1 could be very strong and could allow for all kinds of information to be learned. If you think about why [[#s][Worm Spoilers]] you realize the value of this kind of power. Power 1 could easily replicate that effect with slightly differently worded questions ("is there a greater than 0.2% chance I get attacked today?") and also can tell you about the past ("was my dad really cheating on my mom?") or the present ("is Osama Bin Laden in Asia? Is Osama Bin Laden in Afghanistan? Is Osama Bin Laden in Pakistan?..."). Very powerful.

I also don't think your classification for Power 2 is correct. Not sure the character is Mover, Thinker, or Changer. It sounds like the power is Master (for controlling Projections), Striker (for the short ranged obsidiankinesis) and Blaster (if you can throw the obsidian and make ranged attacks) and/or Brute (if you can use the obsidian to make powerful Melee strikes and protect yourself). Since the power doesn't let you change yourself, move, or think I don't see it as a Changer, Mover, or Thinker power.
