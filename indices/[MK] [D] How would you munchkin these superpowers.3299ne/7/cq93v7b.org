The first can be abused really easily - for example, for a question about a name - "Is the nth letter of Coil's real identity a? Is it b?," etc. Also, "If I act as if I hadn't asked any questions that I will ask in the next minute, will I die today? If...minute, will I die in the next twelve hours?" You could also use categories to narrow down nearly any complex question: Does Coil have a day job? Yes. Is it in the private sector? No. Does it concern education, policing, or healthcare? Yes. Does it concern education? No. Does it concern policing? Yes. Is it concerned with parahuman policing? Yes. Is he a high-ranking official? Yes. (cross-reference with "tall, thin people with high-ranking positions in PRT") Is he Thomas Calvert? Yes.
