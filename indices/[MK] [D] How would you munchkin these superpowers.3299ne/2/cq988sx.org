Power 1 would /never/ return "sometimes". Probabilities are statements of ignorance, and the power is omniscient.

For example, say that a coin has just been flipped, and is in midair. A human would say that has a 50% chance of heads, and a 50% chance of tails. An omniscient intelligence would know the momentum, elasticity, location, landing properties etc. and therefore have a 100% chance of being right.

I think I need some clarification on power 2, or else it's horribly broken. As I'm reading it, the person can create an obsidian body for themselves in some amount of time, let's say 10 seconds. After that, they have two bodies that can each create a new body in 20 seconds (leading to 4 bodies in 30 seconds total). Those four bodies can each create a new body in 40 seconds, leading to 8 bodies in 70 seconds. It's not exponential growth, but linear is good enough for most purposes.
