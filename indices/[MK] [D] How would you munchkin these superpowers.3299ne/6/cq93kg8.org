Power 1 is probably thinker 8 or 9. They can figure out any hero's secret identity with a fairly easy search (does it begin with A? B? C? Etc).

You should probably limit it somewhat. Perhaps it gives horrible headaches upon overusage? Perhaps when you ask a question it rips that knowledge out of someone's mind, along with thoughts and such they were having? Perhaps it could have a manton limit, and not work directly on humans? Perhaps, based on some hidden variable like how many parahumans you've stabbed, it gets more or less accurate?

Power 2 is rather confusing.
