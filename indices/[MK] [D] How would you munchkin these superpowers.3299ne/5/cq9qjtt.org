It's worth noting that true omniscience is impossible in Worm; Countessa or (by WOG) Coil are about the limit. (Also, Wildbow has said P =\= NP in Worm, so that's nice.) Still, "just" path-to-victory binary search 20 times per day is still a pretty darn decent power.

The obsidian one seems like it should probably have higher ratings, being an immortal shapeshifting teleporter and all. What happens if they try/need to create obsidian inside a wall? Any details on how their "shaping" operates (force exerted, flexibility etc)?
