I've been watching it. I've said in the past that detective shows really tend to err on the side of rational, specifically because the point of a detective is to solve a puzzle (the crime). And not only does the show have the puzzle of the crime, it's got the secondary puzzle of how the characters got to where they currently are, which is one of my favorite uses of flashback, and done very well here. I also like the emotion it presents. There's this bleak worldview being shown, mingled with the bleakness of office politics.
