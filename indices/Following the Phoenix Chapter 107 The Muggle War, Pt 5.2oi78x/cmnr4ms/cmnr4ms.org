I find the comment at the end interesting. While this kind of full-powers-vested negotiation is terrible for back-door trade agreements, it would have been damn nice for the negotiators to have when /actually trying to end long-running wars/. I can't help but think that the Israeli-Arab conflict could have been over for 6 years now...
