I literally finished watching it 15 minutes ago.

It's kinda fine up to 9th episode, but the end is... butchered. I feel they were up to something bigger, maybe some intrigues, but Shindo's (protagonist) abilities were... wasted.

If they had more material, for maybe 20 episodes, and richer scenario, it had potential, but it just didn't live up to the hype it created.

I may sound negative now, but I really enjoyed watching it, it depicts humans dealing with something just out of this world with believable procedures and generally the background is nice. Visuals are nice too, but it lacks... depth.

Actually, if I cover the 'sci-fi' theme with a 'magic applied', it feels better.
