IMO Kado is not even close to rational. It's that pop-scifi nonsense that looks good on the surface as long as you avoid actually thinking about whether anything anyone is doing make sense.

Admittedly it's just about decent enough to be watchable (I've watched the first 10 episodes so far) but that's not really what this sub is about. Rational fiction is about thinking, not themes.

I'm avoiding going into specifics because I don't really want a proper debate, and if other people liked it more than me I have no reason to object. But if people are unconvinced I could give a few specifics.
