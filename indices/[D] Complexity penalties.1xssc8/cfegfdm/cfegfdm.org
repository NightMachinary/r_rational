As Harry puts it, "The concept of 'evidence' had something of a different meaning, when you were dealing with someone who had declared themselves to play the game at 'one level higher than you'."

To be more precise, the complexity is that of the top level ideas in the explanation. If the explanation involves "Quirrel wanted to confuse his enemies, so he did this very complicated thing" then the complexity of the explanation is just Quirrel being very smart, which we already have plenty of evidence for. It's when explanations start including things like "there are a dozen capable and paranoid people in the ministry who would be obstacles to any sort of takeover" when we have seen no direct sign of them that a complexity penalty needs to apply.
