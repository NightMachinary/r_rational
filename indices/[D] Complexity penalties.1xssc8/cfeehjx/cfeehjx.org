Yes, this is possible, but it is much less common than simply trying to achieve whatever objective they're seeking. Hence the complexity penalty, it doesn't say that's impossible, just that it has a lower prior, so you need more evidence to believe that. If I flip my light switch and the light goes on, it's possible that a clever bad guy has rewired my apartment to have exactly the same behavior so I won't suspect anything, but it's far more likely nothing in the wiring has changed.
