To my very basic understanding, complexity penalties are a way to break yourself out of jumping to very complicated conclusions - a mental time-out to remind yourself to look for a simpler explanation for something you've observed.

That is to say, it doesn't /rule out/ the complicated hypothesis as being the correct one, if after you've reviewed all your options it still seems to fit your observations best.
