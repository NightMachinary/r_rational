The point of complexity penalties as I see it is not so much that we should disbelieve complex hypotheses, but more that we should require evidence for each moving part we postulate.

This means that the hypothesis "Quirrel is doing something very complicated" does not get a penalty, but if you say "Quirrel is going to exploit the loophole in quidditch rules using timeturners, memorycharms and a rigged snitch for the last game of the year to make both Slytherin and Ravenclaw win the house cup" you have to prove not that he is using a complex plan, but rather that he is going to do precisely this, at precisely this time for this exact purpose.

You can expect convoluted plans, but you can't expect that these plans are easily guessable, and so you need evidence for each part. If the above statement had read "Quirrel is going to make both Ravencalw and Slytherin win the house cup, and it is likely to involve timeturners" the burden of evidence is a lot lower, since your hypothesis has less moving parts. It means that he could do all the other stuff and more, but you aren't trying to infer the entire plan, just the bits and pieces that you have enough evidence for to make a strong prediction.
