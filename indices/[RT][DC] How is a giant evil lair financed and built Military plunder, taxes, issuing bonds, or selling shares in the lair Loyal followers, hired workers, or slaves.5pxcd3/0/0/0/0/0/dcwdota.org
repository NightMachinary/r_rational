The difference is that if the original content creator is involved there may be extra material. And even if there isn't then the ordering and foreword and even page size and font use all still become part of the official author's vision. If it's just a fan compilation on the other hand then it isn't strange to prefer to make a personal compilation instead since either way it adds nothing and by making it alone one can give it whatever features one prefers.
