  I was actually wondering if there was anything already made by the writer(s) on the site since it likely would be professional quality.

What differentiates a "professional-quality" EPUB file from a "fan-quality" one? Making an EPUB file out of a webpage involves nothing but downloading the page, removing the CSS, and tweaking the HTML (to remove everything but the desired content, to add part/chapter/section headings, etc.). Is [[https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/42443024/In%20the%20Blood.zip][this three-volume copy]] of /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6207715][In the Blood]]/ not "professional-quality"?

For a physical book, you could make a case that something printed on standard 8.5"Ã—11" printer paper and collected in a three-ring binder is not "professional-quality", in comparison to fancy paper and proper binding--but I see no such distinction for EPUB files.
