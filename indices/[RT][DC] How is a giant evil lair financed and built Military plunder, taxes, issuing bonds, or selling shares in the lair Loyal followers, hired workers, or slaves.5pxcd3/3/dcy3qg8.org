Nitpick: Why does the article use feminine pronouns? I could understand if it used "they" or "Lord/Lady" and "he/she", but this is just awkward. Is this about that one Lord Dominator in Wander over Yonder?

  Doing good things for the local economy counters the “Evil Lord” narrative. What Evil Lord stimulates local economies by providing good paying jobs via a completely stable system that covers cost overruns and reaps later financial rewards in more immigration, more jobs, and large tax bases? This makes no sense.

Doesn't mean s/he's not evil. They might still have foul machinations in play.

In fact, in *Fullmetal Alchemist*, turns out Amestris is supposed to be fuel for the bad guys' evil scheme. Everyone. The whole country.

There was a 4chan quest on TG that did something like this. Audit Quest, IIRC.
