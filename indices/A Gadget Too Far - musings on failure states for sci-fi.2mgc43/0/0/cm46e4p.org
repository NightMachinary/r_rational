The very best Merlin-style gadget-overrunning-the-character short story, of all time, is very definitely Moorcock's The Stone Thing. It basically takes the premise to it's logical conclusion and beyond, and makes of it a thing of glory. You can find it included in Elric At The End of Time, among other collections.

This short story, where Moorcock parodies his own work by bringing some of his worst qualities to an extreme, is the only Moorcock story I actually enjoyed at all. Some people definitely did enjoy MM's stuff (as I become aware when reading Gaiman's One Life, Furnished in Early Moorcock) but I tried multiple series of it and never was drawn in.
