Asimov had a saying about the duty of critics: "be the subject ever so wide and vasty, screw up your nerve and say something nasty!" Given that this article consists largely of "this author / book is really well known and liked and respected and I enjoyed it, but it was awful!", it really brings that saying to mind.

Additionally, a quick google for Langford's work shows a bunch of parodies and some co-written works; I would be more impressed by literary criticism from someone who actually had some literary credits under his belt.
