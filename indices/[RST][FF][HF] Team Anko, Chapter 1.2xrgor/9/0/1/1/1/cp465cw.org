I really don't get Hiashi's motivations for his treatment when combined with his seeming complete turnaround. Presumably, it's something to do with needing a strong clan head. I guess that whichever daughter doesn't become the clan head becomes a branch member? Otherwise, what's going on with the twin of a main house member becoming a branch member? Maybe between the death of his wife and his brother, and his feelings toward the branch house system, he has had to "kill his heart" and the Chunin exams gives Hiashi the ability to make a change? I really can't tell what's going on with the Hyuga.
