In canon, it's also pretty obvious. Until the Chunin Exam (pretty much the climax of the first series), and even a bit after, it is clear her family is at the very least emotionally abusive to her, and if you count her regularly getting beaten up by her sister who she refuses to fight back as physical abuse, there is some of that as well.

By the second series / post time-skip, she seems to be a bit better situated. We never learn too much about it of course though, because she is generally a side character right up until the last movie.
