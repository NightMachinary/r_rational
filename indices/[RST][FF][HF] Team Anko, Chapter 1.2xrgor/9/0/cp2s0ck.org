The similarities are not accidental. I was reading Team 8 and liked the character matchups so I wanted to play with it a bit. Don't worry, Anko is /nothing/ like Kurenai, and my plot outline isn't like that of Team 8.

EDIT: In case it's part of what you were noticing: yes, [[#s][Hinata is]] That was used in Team 8 but my understanding is that it's pretty much canon. I think Team 8 may have enhanced it, but the basic fact is canon.
