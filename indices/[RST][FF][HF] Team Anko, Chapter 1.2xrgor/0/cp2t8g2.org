(Warning - I got lazy and only spoiler-tagged 2YE and Team Anko spoilers in the first bits. Later I didn't bother. Be warned, ye who enter.)

(Warning - this is /seriously/ long, and rambles a /lot./ There is no TL;DR. In fact, somewhat to my horror, this post /is/ a TL;DR in some sense.)

(Warning - I may have gone a little insane for staying up writing this until 3AM. I take no responsibility.)

Aaand off you go again, Eaglejarl. I admire your ability to keep up the writing pace, and would love any tips you can spare as to how you do it. Let's get started.

Okay. Okay. There are several things I want to say. Lots of tons of many things.

This is not just a review of Team Anko, Chapter 1. This also talks about 2YE and all kinds of other things. So apologies for not being entirely 100% on topic.

First of all, allow me to state that I hope you will take everything I am about to write as it is meant: as loving, well-meant constructive criticism which will hopefully be helpful and all that. I am perhaps a rather critical reader, and, as a fellow author, I feel compelled to point out as many things as I can.

Note that I've liberally strewn what sounds like absolute statements of fact "you do, you are, you tend to" and so on throughout the text. I'm merely lazy and don't want to couch every single statement with phrases like "I think" or "I believe" or "in my opinion" - this is all merely my opinion. Also note that I am /not/ in any way saying I am without flaws as an author at all. This is merely the best feedback I can think to give, and I accept that parts of it may be entirely wrong, or misunderstood, or up to individual taste.

Second of all, allow me to apologize for not leaving more reviews on 2YE. Don't tell me I shouldn't - I feel like it was owed of me, somehow, and this is how I absolve my guilt. Anyways, I started writing up a big final mega-review of 2YE when it ended, as a sort of way to (over)compensate. I had mixed feelings, and a hell of a lot of critique and feedback that I wanted to share. This review quickly began to turn into something that was more like an essay that could've spanned dozens of pages, liberally strewn with examples, suggestions, theories, generalizations of literary principles that seemed relevant, and so on.

I promptly stopped and thought about what in the world I was doing, got confused, and halted there temporarily. I've been busy, so temporarily has turned into a more permanent thing for now. The not-review is still there, not even remotely finished or saying everything I want it to say, and I'm not even sure I ought to want it to say everything it's supposed to say.

However, I will here write a... mini-edition (no really) of the mega-review-essay-paper I originally intended to write. You get a rambling, shortened midnight-writing-frenzy version instead of a neatly structured PDF document with a table of contents. So here we go.

(I can, should you so wish, post the relevant parts of this in a review on 2YE on ff.net to make your counter go up.)

You are in many ways a good writer. In many other ways, you are not yet a good writer, though you mostly appear to be working on improving yourself in the areas in which you are not yet good - which is awesome. Keep doing that! Mostly your weaker areas are character, plot and tone-related, as far as I can tell.

Let's start with tone and feel. In 2YE, it feels more like the reader is invited to sit back and enjoy the ride, however silly that ride may be, than that they are actually supposed to take any of it seriously on any emotional level at all. I mentioned this issue in a review of 2YE where [[#s][The Two Year Emperor Ch. 52]]

You tend to fall very easily into slapstick^{1} and rather generic (more on that point next paragraph) humour, and, at least to me, this kind of humour, while mildly enjoyable on its own level, makes it extremely hard to keep up the Willing Suspension of Disbelief. This is mostly because, most of the time, it feels like the jokes are out of character, and it feels like any one of many characters present could have said the exact same joke for the exact same effect. I could give numerous examples just in this one chapter you've posted of your new story, but most prominent is [[#s][Team Anko Ch. 1]]

As an example of extremely funny situations which does not have this effect, I would use HP:MoR's scene in Madam Malkin's in chapter five. The scene works better, I think, because the characters are acting like themselves, doing things that are so extremely in character that it ends up on the other side and almost becomes caricature. Another example of this, which does practically nothing at all but be funny and joke around, and somehow still makes characters work on some level, is the Naruto crack-fic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4203131/1/Reload][Reload]] (NSFW warning). The fic is mediocre at best in most respects, but it does humour incredibly well in my opinion. It constantly jumps from one joke to another and rarely pretends to be serious, but the jokes are /laced/ with character, and most of the funny scenes are only funny because the characters are being themselves. I have no idea how it makes it work, but Reload does this kind of humour so well that I was capable of ignoring the occasional glaring grammatical issues almost entirely - something which does not come easily to me.
