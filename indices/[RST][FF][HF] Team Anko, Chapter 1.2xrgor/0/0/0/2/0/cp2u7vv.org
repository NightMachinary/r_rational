The update is this February, 2015. Current chapter is about halfway done, and is languishing in writing hell while I am really busy. Sometimes I sit down and manage to write a few hundred words. Just a few days ago I had a really good spell and wrote more than a thousand. My writing speed is slowly, well, speeding up again, after crashing absolutely back when I stopped updating.

It was mostly a combination of upcoming exams, over-ambitious hobby projects and, um, well, [[#s][depressing emotional stuff]]

By the time I'd settled again, I was going to Canada on a student exchange program and I'm currently doing two academic tracks at once while I'm here. So events have really conspired against me recently, but hopefully the schedule clears up quite a bit this summer - I've begun just saying no to various projects and requests for my time.

IFF will update again! And once that happens, it will start doing so at a ferocious rate!
