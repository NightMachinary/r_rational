  When getting a review like this, there's an instinctive desire to defend various points, but I don't think I want to go there.

I know that feeling far too well, yes.

I'm glad you're thinking about those canon issues, though a lot of them really do need serious consideration ahead of time. You already appear to have bought into the absolutely tiny scale of the villages, for example, and the early graduation ages - and neither of these things make a lot of sense when you really think about it. IFF!Konoha graduates more than a thousand genin per year just to maintain a force level of 15.000-20.000 ninja (which is an actual stated number at one point in canon... not that that makes sense). This seems to me like the absolute minimum you'd need to wage true war on a large scale when you include administrative branches and logistics and the medical corps and so on.

(In fact, in IFF ninja serve a specialist role in warfare and do not even form the brunt of a country's military strength. There's just not enough of them. That would be the regular armies, which can field hundreds of thousands of soldiers, and in some cases more than a million. Then again, IFF is in /most/ respects edging rather close to WWI level tech, mostly with the twist that gunpowder technology is much more primitive in the elemental nations, and medicine is much more advanced due to the knowledge that can be gleaned by chakra scanning and so on.)

Things like this is part of why I emphasized it, as it looks like you're already making a few potential missteps and committing yourself to these features of the lore. Features which, at the very least, require unrealistic twelve year olds and a tiny world where a few hundred people can wage war between nations.
