The account name was 8Silver8, yes. I must admit that I am simply not good at generating account names - or rather, the names I now utilize were generated during my less sensible youth and I am now stuck with them.

I can understand why you're a little surprised, I suppose - and the blame lies entirely with me, of course. Part of it is that the issues hadn't really managed to truly become glaring and obvious to me yet. They were there, yes, but I was ignoring them in the rush of things.

As we began talking and I started caring a bit more about the story on the abstract level, simply because I sort-of-kinda knew and was in communication with the person who wrote it, I... well, began thinking a bit more about it. And especially after I began writing the final incarnation of my Naruto fanfic and started thinking about all this on a technical level, did I realize in retrospect what it was that bothered me about 2YE. Don't get me wrong - I wouldn't have read it if I didn't like it. But I was bothered by a few things, and I was never extremely invested in the story.

Also, truthfully, I find it very difficult and uncomfortable to give bad reviews or dish out criticism on this level. I don't like doing it and it makes me feel like an asshole, or worry that I'm coming across as one. It takes a major kick in the ass for me to get up and actually make the effort. So there's that.
