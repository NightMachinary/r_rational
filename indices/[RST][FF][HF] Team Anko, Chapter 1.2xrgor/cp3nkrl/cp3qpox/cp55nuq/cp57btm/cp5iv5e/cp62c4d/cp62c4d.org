My advice would be to start writing it. When you hit a plot hole you can probably paper over it with sufficient ingenuity. A fireball spell was used to melt iron, but it was previously stated that fireballs aren't that hot? It's a mana-heavy area and there was a wild surge. Or this is a sign that the character isn't actually human, and has larger mana reserves than a human would so s/he can make the fireball hotter. Etc.

If it has plot holes, then it has plot holes. If you never write it it will be one gigantic plot hole.
