Yes, and I have been for a couple of years now. [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1ppyqx/is_anyone_doing_a_rationalist_nanowrimo_or_really/cd4v573][Summary]]:

  Yup. The story is about the son of a legendary adventurer and his unlikely friends as they search for his recently vanished father in a world of power crazed (or just plain crazy) blood magicians in dystopian steampunk megacities fortified against a zombie alpocalypse that grows stronger, faster and /smarter/ the more it eats while airship merchants and sky pirates do battle overhead.

  There's a lot going on in the novel, but I've been planning it for more than 2 years and eliminated every plot hole I could find, even those in the math that result from my magic system. I think it qualifies as "Rationalist" because the protagonist has been trained by his father and is actually competent and genre-savy and plans ahead and takes precautions. He falls deep into the category of /a little bit dark, and a whole lot Slytherin/, and overall I'm looking forward to writing all the different arguments and fight scenes.

Unfortunately, it hasn't progressed much further than that point, due to the fact that my claim of "eliminating plot holes" turned out to be completely incorrect. I've written and deleted thousands of words, leaving the manuscript to languish at around 20k words. Add in influence creep from other epics like /Worm/ and /HPMOR/ along with getting a job and falling love... it's stuck in the literary equivalent of development hell.

A shame, really, because I do want to write it. It's just... very hard.
