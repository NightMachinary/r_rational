Woah, pretty big departure there. Probably for the best, thought, since it is so abusable (/A Drop of Poison/ is my current go-to for clone memory abuse). Are they still going to be Naruto AIs, or are you toning down the individual personality aspects in general? Depending on how you're using Chakra Transfers, though, you might still be leaving an information path open. Chakra Transfers have this know a person/instantaneous communication thing going on. If you haven't already, you'll probably want to really nail down what it means to share a blend of physical energy and spiritual energy with someone.

Edit: Then again, making the Shadow Clone spy capabilities related to Chakra Transfers and Chakra Transfers be a kind of Chakra Control technique seems like it'd be a good way to cut down on the abusability of it though. Naruto's issues with chakra control would be directly in the path of any real munchkinry, and anyone else wouldn't have the chakra reserves to really pull it off.
