It's sort of the main thrust behind Hagoromo's Ninshu in canon. Hagoromo distributed chakra to world to connect all of humanity. However, humanity used chakra to create Ninjutsu for combat. Killing Intent, Negative Emotions Sensing, Yamanaka Mind Body techniques and fist bumps all have shades of using chakra to access or send a mental/emotional/spiritual state. I tend to slot what fanon tends to call Talk-no-jutsu into this as well. Canon Naruto seems to have inherited Hagoromo's Ninshu, hence his ability to empathize with people.

Edit: Also, despite being mostly a uniform blue in the anime (or red in the case of tailed beasts), everyone has a unique chakra signature in the manga (which the mostly black and white medium doesn't show). Chakra is normally invisible to the naked eye, but expressing enough of it renders it visible, and the various eye abilities allow it to be seen. Based on dialog in the manga, chakra color is inheritable to an extent (Naruto and Minato's share a [[http://i.imgur.com/kmblPr1.jpg][yellow color]]) and the different nations tend to have roughly similar colors (the Tsuchikage comments on how many different groups of people are gathered based on chakra sensing alone).
