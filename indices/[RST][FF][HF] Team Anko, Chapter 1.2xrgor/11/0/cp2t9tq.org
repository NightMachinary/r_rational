Yeah, the forum is an experiment. I wanted a way to have stories and discussion where I could actually respond to reviews inline, which means not FFN. I also wanted something where posts didn't fall off the page as more came out, the way a blog does. The forum allows me to keep certain things (the for-pay stories) front-and-center while still being able to have conversations with readers.

It may not work out and I might end up migrating it somewhere else. We'll see.
