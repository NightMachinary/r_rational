  I'm genuinely unsure if this is because Anko is a great teacher and this team composition promotes some interesting behavior, or if the entire world works on different rules and Kakashi is similarly more competent.

Nope, Kakashi is still lazy and useless. Anko is just a good teacher and motivated. She might bitch and moan when given an assignment but, once accepted, she will do it to the best of her considerable abilities.
