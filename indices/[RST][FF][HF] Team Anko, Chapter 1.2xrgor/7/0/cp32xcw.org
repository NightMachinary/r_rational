I'm seeking to monetize my work. The first step in that process is to get everything centralized and build a following at the place where the for-sale work and, soon, the Patreon link are.

I'm crossposting at FFN as well, because it has a large audience. I'll post the first few chapters there, then leave a pointer saying "the rest is at davidstorrs.com".
