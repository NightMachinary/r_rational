Are you going to nerf everything then? Ridiculous eye bloodlines and all? Or is every antagonist still overpowered, but as irrational as in canon? I'm just having trouble seeing how Naruto is going to overcome the experience gap between himself and the antagonists without the OP clones.

I must admit that starting without huge advantages and still taking over the world due to behaving rationally would be significantly more awesome than relying on shadow clones to brute force everything, but it'll (probably) be a tough story to write.

Also, can I assume that history of elemental nations as known by an average ninja is the same as in canon? If so, then you must have set some pretty hard constraints on Aburame, otherwise they would have taken over the world by now.

EDIT: Forgot to mention: rationalist!Aburame protagonist is a dream come true. You are my hero!
