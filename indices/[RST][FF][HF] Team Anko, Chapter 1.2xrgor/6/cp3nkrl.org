I really liked it! Keep it up! When do you expect to have chapter 2 posted? (I haven't read any of your other work yet. Just trying to get a rough estimate of your posting frequency)

One piece of constructive criticism on the writing style (that may be more personal preference than anything) is that 3rd-person omniscient narration of this kind is always a bit jarring for me to read and, I think, presents certain challenges to writing a rational!fic with believable characters. If all characters' minds are available to the reader at all times (without demarcated swaps between POV characters) I feel like anything that is not mentioned explicitly as a thought /didn't/ /happen./ Let me try to explain:

It puts a burden on the author to mention anything relevant or else the readers will assume that it didn't happen (because otherwise they would have been told about it) or that the author is deliberately withholding available information. You definitely had certain characters being /more/ the POV character at any given time, but there were no logical breaks between them. It feels like I could be given a thought from any character an any time and (though it's too early to say this with any real weight) it lessens my connection with the characters. I just find that 3rd person omniscient narration with frequent, unmarked jumps between the characters' minds makes it easier to describe the content of /scenes,/ but results in the reader not having a chance to really experience anything /as/ /one/ /of/ /the/ /characters,/ which is, IMO, the main way that readers develop a connection to them.

Having set POV characters at different times also allows you to easily get the reader asking questions (eg. about what's going on in the minds of other characters, why they're acting a certain way, what information they have that the current POV char doesn't, etc.). I find this is especially important in a rational!fic, as you're able to formalize the state of knowledge and uncertainty within a particular character at any given time and then explore how they approach the situations they are faced with given their uncertainty.

Anyway, just my two cents. I did enjoy chapter 1 and am looking forward to chapter 2. Cheers!
