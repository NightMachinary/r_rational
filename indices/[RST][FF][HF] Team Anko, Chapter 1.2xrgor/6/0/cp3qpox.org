  I really liked it! Keep it up! When do you expect to have chapter 2 posted? (I haven't read any of your other work yet. Just trying to get a rough estimate of your posting frequency)
#+end_quote

I post at least once a week. Now that I'm writing full time, I intend to crank that up to twice a week. I have an original story that I will be starting on soon -- manapunk / magitek, battles between rural and city dwellers, looming eldritch evil that no one is aware of, etc. I plan to do one Team Anko post and one Manapunk post per week; we'll see if I can sustain that, but I'm at least going to try.

As to the perspective -- that's good advice, thank you. Let me think about it and see how it would change the writing.
