Rationalist? Interesting.

Very intrigued as to how you will approach this. Naruto doesn't lend itself to rationalist well, not the least of which being there is no psychology literature to draw on in universe.

Changing graduate Shino from straw Vulcan to master of interpersonal dynamics is a bit of a leap for me, but I enjoyed 2YE enough that I'm happy to see where you go with it.
