The way I'm writing it, there /is/ psychology literature in-universe. You've got a bunch of ninja who notably include sorta-telepaths like the Yamanaka, mental illusionists (every genjutsu user), and an entire department devoted to interrogation. I'm sure that psychology has actually been heavily studied.

The tricky part, actually, is the tech level. Ninja fight with knives and swords, not guns. They travel long distances on foot, not on any sort of motorized vehicle, yet a common fisherman in the Wave Arc had a motor on his fishing boat. There are [[http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_Technology][more troubling examples]].

  Changing graduate Shino from straw Vulcan to master of interpersonal dynamics is a bit of a leap for me, but I enjoyed 2YE enough that I'm happy to see where you go with it.

I'm confused -- are you saying that my Shino is a straw Vulcan, or a master of interpersonal dynamics?
