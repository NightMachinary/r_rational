Hm. When getting a review like this, there's an instinctive desire to defend various points, but I don't think I want to go there. I'll just say this:

- I appreciate the deep and carefully thought out feeback
- 'Team Anko' is not a funny story so WSOD-breaking humor won't be a thing.\\
- I fully intend to make the world make sense. It is definitely an AU from our universe so it may have a few extra primitives, but everything above that point should be consistent.
- I feel very little obligation to stick with canon, other than to make characters consistent to themselves. In particular I feel no requirement to make shadow clones work the same way as in canon and, in fact, they do not.
