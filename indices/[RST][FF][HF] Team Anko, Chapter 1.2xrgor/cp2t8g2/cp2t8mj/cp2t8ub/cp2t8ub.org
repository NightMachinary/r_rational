You are now beginning a new story. As I've already mentioned, you appear to be running headfirst into the same issues with too much comic relief and too much humour being in danger of ruining the rest, though I would say that the characters here are already much stronger than any in 2YE ever were.

This story looks like it will be perfect practice for character based humour, and the expression of character depth in general. You already have fairly strong and deep characters to work with from canon and you can utilize the mannerisms you already know so well, so a lot of the work is done already, and you can grow into it with the practice, so to speak.

My advice for the future is the following:

Try to be aware when you're setting up a humorous situation, of the different ways in which you could make that situation humorous without compromising character or WSOD or leaning too heavily on the fourth wall. Don't sell your characters short. They have very good foundations and a solid concept and potential, like Jake and Suze did.

Remember to lend emotional weight and significance to the plot, or it becomes harder to care for the reader. Show the characters truly caring about everything that is going on, don't just tell or imply that they do care. Don't just have them act on the plot without /reacting/ to it. Make the stakes deeply personal. Ensure that the characters have something to lose that they truly care about, and also that they sometimes /actually/ lose that. /Show/ it. /Describe/ it. Be emotional and /visceral/ about it. Let your characters laugh and scream and rage and cry and feel on their own.

Try to not fall into the pattern of mimicking canon too well, particularly in the case of Naruto canon. If you want a rational story, you are going to have to start making excuses, or the hand waves are going to start piling up. I've spent more than a year and thousands of words and endless (hundreds, if not thousands of) hours of Skype arguments on trying to turn the world of my Naruto fanfic, In Fire Forged, into a consistent, sensible, solid, rational universe full of competent, sane people, that retains canon Naruto flavour in the most important respects. You would not believe the hoops one has to jump through to have Naruto's canon world make any sense at all! The characters' ages, the numbers, the politics, the economics, the demographics, the /technologies oh dear god help,/ the geography, the world history, the physics! None of it makes any sense at all! It doesn't even not make sense in a way that makes sense, it literally /cannot be rationally explained away/ as presented. I had to build all of that bottom up, to spec. Spreadsheets were involved. I may have gone overboard on this, but I love world-building for its own sake. Look up [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8654967/1/Black-Cloaks-Red-Clouds][Black Cloaks, Red Clouds]] for a Naruto fanfic that perhaps strikes a better balance.

Naruto canon is one big, huge, enormous, humongous hand wave. Just having the Shadow Clone technique as presented in canon and a remotely sane Naruto plausibly results in a singularity event in a few days! I had to nerf clones so hard in IFF that they're not even remotely like the canon thing, even though they now /actually/ serve the purpose they were originally stated to serve in canon.

Consider this point about Naruto canon closely, and have a plan to deal with it. I worry that you will, as I did, stumble into some of the glaring inconsistencies, and have to start over, abort or blatantly ignore them. I started over twice before I decided to just /fix it all./ If you want, I can give you my contact info on Skype - I've spent a long time thinking about how to resolve many of these issues, and I would gladly share my thoughts.

Finally (/finally/), I will give a bunch of more specific feedback about the actual chapter which I have just read.

I like the basic twist, with the team setup. Anko is a promising character and you've handled her pretty well so far. It seems obvious that Orochimaru should feature as a big, important, huge villain, given the lovely potential that provides with Anko. I think you're being a little too heavy-handed with Shino and the Aburame. Yes, true, they're generally typecast as the "rational" or "coldly logical" types in the fandom, but making them use actual betting markets and having Shino, a twelve year old, talking in the way he does, feels... off, on some level. I like NaruHina in general, and that appears to be where you're headed, so good on that. And what is up with nobody even raising an eyebrow at Naruto's ridiculous levels of chakra? Why hasn't he been assassinated as the obvious jinchuuriki of Konoha yet? Why-- /ahem,/ and there it begins. You get my point.

And on this ending note, I should also, perhaps, point out some of the things I enjoy most about your writing. Your evil munchkin strategies are lovely (Graham's number of XP points, oh how I chortled with deep satisfaction at the sheer brokenness of that). Your sense of humour is on occasion hilarious, when it isn't acting up and being blatant. Your description and prose in particular is generally very solid, and on occasion, it is really good. Just the phrasing of the very first few paragraphs of 2YE had me caught completely.

I think you've got a lot of room to grow and are in a solid position to do so, and that is meant in the best possible way. And I really hope you won't take offense to any of this, because it took a bloody long time to write and I should have gone to bed four hours ago.

So cheers, mate - this is the end. I hope you find this hopefully constructive feedback and criticism useful, and that you will now consider the review-debt paid.

1: I use slapstick here as a general word for the kind of humour you tend to employ, full of genre comedy, puns and pop culture references and sarcastic 4th-wall-nudging commentary. The term is not strictly correct, but I could think of no better one.
