Huh. Have to admit, I'm a little surprised. I just went back through the first couple pages of reviews to find yours; every single one that you left was positive, except for chapter 24. I didn't realize that you had so many issues with 2YE. These are useful criticisms, and I wish you'd made them earlier. (Aside: You're the guy who used to be...Silver4Silver, or something like that, right? [[#s][Offtopic question about offline life]] )

As to book 2: I could have run it out longer and added more frills and subplots but (a) it wasn't testing well with the audience and (b) I had already set up everything that needed to be set up. [[#s][Spoilers]] I had reached a point where I felt that it made sense to stop, so I did.

You're absolutely right that the off-topic chapters didn't need to be there. I was experimenting with some new techniques (multi-thread storytelling, achronic narrative) and eventually decided they didn't work well for me, so I went back to standard narrative. Were this to be published I would cut many of those chapters out and put them in into a collection of short stories.
