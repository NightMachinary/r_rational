In short, the characters themselves are being funny - they are not telling generic jokes that mostly anybody well versed in pop culture could tell. I think this is an extremely important distinction, and it brings me to the next point: character.

Jake in 2YE started off well. He was smart, sarcastic, scared and bewildered. He reacted like a person would react in that situation. You got the faint sense that he was offended on some levels by the medieval society around him. You got the sense that maybe he would try to change this. You got the sense that he had a strong sense of morality. Particularly the scene where he kindly rejected a young, beautiful servant maid who has every expectation of being taken advantage of conveyed this feeling strongly.

However, this feeling of implied depth of character slowly vanished during the course of the story, absorbed into the generic pop-culture-reference-making sarcastic munchkin plot device called Jake, whole role was to be moderately clever and make the inferences and munchkin hacks that the plot required of him at the time. Occasional overtures towards character were made, but these were often overdone so much as to not work at all (his constant mental breakdowns, or worked into jokes or humour which made the character moment fall flat).

I feel like I could apply this same critique to almost every character in 2YE on some level. That might sound overly harsh, but understand that this is what it /felt/ like to me, even when I really wanted to like the story because it had elements I thoroughly enjoyed as well, and it was so, so promising.

As a last example on the topic, let me promote to attention the one instance where you got it terrifically, completely and utterly right. Loki was an awesome, hilarious, scenery-chewing character, and it was the only character at all where I /not once/ felt remotely like he was being out of character or doing something that he would not do in order to serve some joke or other. However, since he is /literally/ the god of jokes and weird shit and you can never ever count on anything he says being true or not an act... well, I think you see the conundrum. I will state unambiguously that he worked, though - reading scenes with Loki was always an utter delight.

Thirdly, we come to plot. The plot of 2YE was a big, rambling thing. You started off quite promisingly, veered slightly off course as you got further into the story, and then promptly ran off a cliff in the second volume. For the first volume, it's hard to exactly put my finger on what it was that made the plot... not work that incredibly well, and not be super exciting. You did a lot of things right, and followed by far most of the advice that I've read in many different places regarding what to do and what not to do regarding plots.

A big factor, no doubt, was the fact that it was very hard to care about the struggles of the characters, and thus it was very hard to get genuinely excited about what happened in the plot. If I had to try to describe the effect, it was that, while, yes, we've been told there is a plot, and even mostly what the plot is, and the characters are doing stuff that is relevant to the plot, it still mostly feels like we are just going through the motions of the plot rather than /experiencing/ it in any fashion.

Actually, having just written the above, I realize that the plot in the first volume of 2YE fell a little flat to me because I did not really care that much about the characters or their struggle. There wasn't any emotional investment, so I wasn't invested in their success. The plot interested me solely on an intellectual level, as I was extremely curious as to just how in the world they were going to win this one, as it seemed, frankly, completely impossible.

Now, the second volume of 2YE was... less than stellar. Let me first talk about the premise, and missed opportunities. The premise was /absolutely brilliant./ I had thought and hoped from the beginning of 2YE (as you /might/ recall from one of my earliest reviews) that this story would eventually turn into a Rage Against the Heavens plot, where the gods, collectively, became the final enemy. It was /perfect/ for this. A munchkin released into a D&D universe. Even better, a munchkin who mostly espoused modern moral and clearly had a complete lack of respect for the innate superiority of the divine. What better and more challenging foe could there be to munchkin against than the gods themselves, what better force to challenge than the laws of the universe itself? This notion of challenging the fundamental status quo on such a hardcore level, of indulging in the ultimate lèse-majesté against the literal evil tyrant dictators of the universe, struck deeply with me.

But the first volume did not turn out like this. Oh, sure - a god was the final enemy, but other gods were on the side of the heroes, and the conflict was not, fundamentally, /about/ the gods in the sense that I'd hoped. And then you did the awesomest thing: you made Suze into the frigging god of death. I lacked words for the awesomeness of the potential that entailed, and suddenly I was very hopeful, because you had just set yourself up for the /perfect/ continuation of 2YE, where Jake and Suze - the uber munchkin and the fledgling god - abhorred by the arrogance of the gods and the cost of their power games, banded together to eliminate this threat to a free universe entirely. It was so perfect. You'd even set it up, with Jake's "fuck y'all bullies" speech to the gods.

And then you didn't do that at all. You showed Suze struggling with godhood, and that part was good. It felt like you struggled a bit with the character, but this time there was clearly an effort involved to portray the sheer confusion, despair and heartbreak she was going through. Alas, you also had to hand her an idiot ball of staggering proportions, turning this formerly smart character into a complete and utter dunce. You, alas, ignored Jake entirely apart from interspersing various mostly-irrelevant snippets from his daily challenge-less life, though I held up hopes that he would get more firmly involved later.

And then, out of the blue, in a /single chapter,/ you unveiled an entire plot against Suze, we saw the villain of the story for the /first time,/ and then /it all ended./ I don't even know how many rules that breaks. There wasn't even a denouement. Up until the very end, it felt like the start of something bigger. And we were left with a universe still ruled by a bunch of arrogant, bullying, entitled tyrants, and no satisfying ending anywhere in sight. I had to cook up my own head-canon - an entirely alternate story - just so that I could feel right about the whole thing inside.

I suspect that it's mostly something you were aware of, though. I got the feeling, from the sheer suddenness with which you aborted the story, that you felt the Suze plot wasn't working out that well at all, and that you decided to cut it short before it got too far - you had bigger fish to fry and better stories to write. I may be guessing wrongly, but it seems that way, at least.

I think I shall end my feedback on 2YE here, and move on to the next part. (Think we're done? Hah!)
