For what it's worth, I agree with [[/u/omgimpwned]] about this issue. I personally hate using the visual cues of anime/manga outside of the actual medium itself. These include, but are not limited to, facefaulting, sweatdropping, and nosebleeds. My best guess is that these sorts of things were probably invented to make visual cues for facial expressions and emotions more obvious in a medium which frequently eschewed the detailed facial expressions that would actually occur in real life, because they wouldn't be perceived up on the simplified and abstracted cartoon figures being used for the characters. In writing fiction, of course, you can easily make people wince slightly or the like as appropriately and have it easily noticed by virtue of simply putting it in the text - and therefore sticking to the conventions of a genre not your own and putting in sweatdropping or whatever in lieu of a facial expression is both pointless and immersion-breaking. Thanks for editing that out before I ever read the story.
