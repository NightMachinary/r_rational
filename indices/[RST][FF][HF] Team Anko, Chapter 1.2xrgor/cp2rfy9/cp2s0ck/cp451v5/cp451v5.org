I'm pretty sure it's not canon. It is, however, a good explanation for her personality. That's how I recall Team 8 doing it (I'm not sure, it was so many years ago): Kurenai sees Hinata's behaviour and deduces there's something wrong. That would have been very nice for a rational fic, and I can't help but feel it's a lost opportunity. On the other hand, since you change from the internal point of view of one character to another, it'd hard to do.

Anyway, I have to say that this: "she had disrupted it with a panicked Jyuuken strike; she had too many bad associations with being grabbed." felt jarring, like you were going out of your way to show that she's abused. It could be more subtle, you'll build upon it later in the chapter anyway (later tells also feel a bit forced, but not so much).
