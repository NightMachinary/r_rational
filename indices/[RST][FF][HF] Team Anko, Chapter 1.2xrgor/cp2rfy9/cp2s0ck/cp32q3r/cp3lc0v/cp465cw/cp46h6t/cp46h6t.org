He blames her for the death of his brother. Maybe not consciously, but certainly subconsciously.

His brother was sacrificed because Hiashi killed a man who was trying to capture Hinata for her eyes, and Cloud demanded his head for it. So his twin brother went in his stead.

He likely at least partially, deep down, blames himself. But he also subconsciously blames Hinata. This is the reason for his harsh treatment of her, and also the reason he dotes on Neji more than is proper for his station (aside from Neji's obvious skill). After the Chunin exam fight he softens somewhat, perhaps realizing this.

The Hyuuga Clan structure is weird. The Main Family seems to consist only of the Elders, and the Clan Head's direct family. It is even noted that once one of Hanabi or Hinata becomes the new head, the other must be sent to the branch family - another reason why Hinata does not want to fight her sister truly. It's likely Hiashi beat his brother in a similar manner to win his position, adding to his own guilt for his loss.

It seems that former Clan Heads pass onto the Elders and remain Main Family, but it is never really explained.
