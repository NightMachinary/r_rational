Alright, that explanation makes sense. It probably ties into the fact that Hizashi missed out on clan head by seconds. I guess Hanabi must have lucked out by being born after the Caged Bird Seal ceremony. Maybe she would have received the seal when Hinata's children turned three? I guess that probably means each of the Main House is or will be a clan head.
