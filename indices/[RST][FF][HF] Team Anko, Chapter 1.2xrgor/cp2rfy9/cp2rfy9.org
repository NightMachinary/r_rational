Only a little bit into it, but your team has the exact same setup as Team 8 in the fanfic of the same name, minus Kurenai as the jonin. I'm moderately surprised. I'll definitely be reading this, though, because I can't get enough Naruto fanfiction.

Edit: I've now finished the chapter. It was good, and I will continue reading, but the similarities between it and Team 8 are rather large. Hopefully they're accidental, and hopefully it starts to branch out a bit more, but it's not too big a problem (yet). [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2731239/1/Team-8][Link]] for reference.
