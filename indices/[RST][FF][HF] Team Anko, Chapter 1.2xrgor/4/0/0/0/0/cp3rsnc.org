I think it looks way too narrow now.

Please use the same mechanics for Kage Bunshin as in Waves Arisen, I don't think I can stand it being any other way now. A state of uncertainty such that all and none of the clones are the "real" Naruto is brilliant. It would have interesting anthropic uses.

Possibly consider allowing Shino's bugs to share chakra at a distance so he can keep bugs attached to his teammates at all times and refill reserves continuously. Unless it's too OP.
