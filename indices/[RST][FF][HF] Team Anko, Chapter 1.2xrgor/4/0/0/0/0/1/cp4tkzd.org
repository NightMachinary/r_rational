  Possibly consider allowing Shino's bugs to share chakra at a distance so he can keep bugs attached to his teammates at all times and refill reserves continuously. Unless it's too OP.

I think this got edited in because I don't remember seeing it originally. It's an interesting idea but yes, I think it would be OP. It would mean that no on who is allied to Shino and Naruto would ever run out of chakra. (For values of 'no one' and 'ever' which are reasonably large but not actually infinite.)

What he CAN do, though, is to have bugs continuously on Naruto so that, any time someone needs a recharge, he can make some of the bugs drop off and go to that person. (Or that person can get close to Naruto, of course.)
