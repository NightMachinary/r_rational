It's so that the incentives are for betting /exactly/ your estimate. In a linear reward system, if you believe X is true with 51%, you get higher expected value for betting X at 99.9% than 51%. In a logarithmic system, betting 99.9% and being wrong is very punishing, so the incentives align so that your highest expected value is exactly at your level of belief.

I can't find the link but I'm sure this was described on lesswrong; it's also what CFAR uses in their workshops.
