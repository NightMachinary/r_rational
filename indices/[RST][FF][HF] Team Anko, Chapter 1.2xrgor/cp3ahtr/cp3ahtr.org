I quite liked it. The characters are, well, in-character, and yet the take on the world is already quite different.

Why, it's almost like they're actually /being trained/ instead of just looked after! Things are taken to their logical conclusion instead of being for show!

I'm genuinely unsure if this is because Anko is a great teacher and this team composition promotes some interesting behavior, or if the entire world works on different rules and Kakashi is similarly more competent. This is a good thing - it is /very/ believable that the characters I know from canon/fanfics would act like this in this particular situation.

What I'm trying to say is that you're writing a rational fic, and it's working, and yet so far I see no major character changes. Again, that's really cool.

I disliked the premise of 2YE (RAW D&D is just so insane) and that colored my enjoyment of the entire work, though I did enjoy it. Here the premise, the writing, and the characters seem like they'll align very well with my preferences, and I can't wait to see more.

I agree with the criticism about physical gags used as plot devices being rather silly. For instance, the Hokage being vulnerable to Sexy No Jutsu should very obviously mean he /wanted/ Naruto to have the scroll (not saying that Team Anko should have realized it already, necessarily, just that that is hopefully the actual reason).

All in all, though, very promising, and even this little was already very enjoyable.
