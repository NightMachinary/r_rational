If I'm not mistaken, I think the Hugos that are being given out at the moment are for works that were released during the year of 2014. Since HPMOR just concluded, it would be more applicable next year.

I was surprised to see this: "Works do not have to be published in a “professional” publication (as defined here) to be eligible for a Hugo Award."

I'm not sure if there are any formal rules for fanfiction, but that rule might allow HPMOR to be eligible for Best Novel. There /is/ a best Fan Writer category, which seems even more applicable.
