Yup, it'll be up for 2015. I'll be making a push for it, and I have little doubt we can make it on the ballot. If the Sad Puppies can do it, no reason we can't.

Online self-published works have gotten nominations before - Seanan McGuire has an /extremely/ loyal fan base. However HPMoR will be the first time that's been done for a novel, I believe.

2015's Hugos are gonna be awesome. :)
