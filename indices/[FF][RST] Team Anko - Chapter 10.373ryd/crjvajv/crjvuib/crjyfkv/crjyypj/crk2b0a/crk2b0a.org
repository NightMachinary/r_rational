Despite the two words having technical definitions, everybody either thinks they're interchangeable, or arbitrarily assumes the definitions one way or the other. If you want to use words to communicate, these particular ones are just plain bad at their jobs. I'd suggest just tabooing them both, and trying to paint the idea into the reader's mind instead of just clinically referring to it.
