+My mistake, I should have said "sociopathic." Does that help?+

EDIT: Interesting. I just went and verified the definitions and it turns out that I had them backwards. Psychopaths are the methodical planners who avoid risks to themselves, while sociopaths are the impulsive and erratic ones. [[#s][The character in question]] is definitely a psychopath and not a sociopath. I'll have to go back and fix it in the earlier text.
