I've read hundreds, if not thousands, of Naruto fiction over the years. (Shout out to Two Halves, for being my first one) So I've definitely seen a lot of the typical twists and tropes of the genre. So I gotta say, I'm impressed with your abilities to keep things fresh. It's an enjoyable read so far, and I'm eager to see how things turn out. My only concern is the pacing, as it seems fairly sedate so far, in so much as the power growth of Team Anko is concerned. The training's mostly been minor, and now Naruto is laid up for however many chaps. I'm assuming though, based on your previous work, that this'll be addressed satisfyingly once it comes about. Overall, really well done, can't wait for the next update.
