Thanks, I'm glad you like it.

I'll warn you that the power growth and combat stuff will happen, but it's not the primary part that interests me so it won't be a major focus. I did the 'war story munchkin fight' in 2YE; Team Anko is more about relationships, espionage, and intellectual combat. I'm interested in how the Naruto-verse could look if an intelligent, rationalist, psychopathic altruist were dropped into it and given immense personal and political power.
