Well, I mean, as far as I understand it, sociopaths are just people who don't really bother to recognize the rights of others, whereas psychopaths are mostly sociopaths, it's more like "all psychopaths are sociopaths but not all sociopaths are psychopaths", sort of? At least from my general understanding.
