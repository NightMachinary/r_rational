Yet another really good chapter.

I am curious about what Orochimaru is doing with the vivisections and how that relates to the wheelchairs. If his characterization is as it seems (which, it very likely could not be, as we saw with Quirrel in HPMOR - layers and layers) there must be a practical purpose to it commensurate with the cost.

If we knew if the subjects were civilians or ninja before or after the process, that might also be useful in determining the goals or reasoning.

As to the Naruto situation, I'm going to take the standard tactic: assume this plot went off without a hitch. What was the goal?

Lets look at the results:

- Naruto is seriously injured and convalescent. He cannot leave the village at least until he recovers.
- The rest of the team will not leave without Naruto, so their SERE is also on hold until then.
- Hinata has discovered she can kill to protect Naruto.
- Hinata and Naruto have entered a romantic relationship, and both were isolated and alone before.
- They both will likely wish to remain together.
- Orochimaru now only needs to convince one or the other to stay in the village in order to get both of them.

Lets look at the emotional states of the team:

- Hinata and Naruto will likely wish to stay together.
- Naruto is desperate to get stronger. Orochimaru understands this - see the 'training' by the river in a previous chapter.
- Hinata wants to escape her family. Orochimaru is trying to provide an out.
- Orochimaru knows that Anko is emotionally attached to Hinata. If Hinata stays, Anko likely will stay as well to protect her.
- Shino is logical. He's the most like a rational actor in the group. Orochimaru has attempted to convince him to stay through rational argument and discussion, because he is the one least likely to fall prey to the emotional manipulations Orochimaru is using on the rest of the group.

So, every action up to now appears to have been taken for the ultimate goal of getting the team (in whole, but specifically several parts) to stay in Sound permanently.

The parts Orochimaru is most interested in convincing to stay seem to be in order:

1. Naruto - Kyubi. Incredible Chakra pool.
2. Hinata - Byakugan? Keep Naruto Docile?
3. Anko - Keep Hinata in check, already trained, effective Jonin.
4. Shino - Logical, great recon, Kikai genetics?
