This is a long but fantastic read, and easily the best "reimagine the setting" fic I've read in years. A reviewer puts it well:

  This universe has absolutely no magic, but super-science can create some similar results, and biochemicals can cause mutations that create superheroes and supervillains (although that wouldn't become public during this story's timeline). This is also a James Bond crossover, so expect that level of violence.' And you might find that my characters are subtly different enough from Rowling's writing that your preconceived notions may not apply.

In other words: this is medium-hardness SF, with a huge dose of historical and technical fact, stirred well with espionage both real and imagined.
