I enjoyed it and the fact that Hermione is smarter than everyone else didn't really phase me. But, there were a few times where I thought that everyone was rather stupid including Hermione and that broke my suspension of disbelief a bit.

Beside that, I enjoyed the novel take on the potter universe and thought that the concept was rather fresh and original
