I broadly agree with there being problems with scale, and dropped the story myself, but Hermione being a particular genius ("the smartest X of her generation") seems fine to me. That saod there is unevenness in the story where sometimes we're informed of her prodigious intellect and other times she seems merely extremely bright.
