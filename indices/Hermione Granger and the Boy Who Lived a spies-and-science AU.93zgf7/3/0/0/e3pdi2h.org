It is. You are correct, but okay. Think of it this way. You're in 6th grade, and you like math. You're in an advanced private school for gifted people, and a lot of the people you are meeting come from families that not only have a family history of being smart but also having demanding and interesting and difficult jobs.

Despite being a genius, which you maybe are, do you think you can actually keep up with sophomores in that high school? Or juniors?

That's what I mean when I say things don't scale. If Hermione is X units of smart. And she's not a wildly special case (which she shouldn't be because no one at Harworts is dumb and, in fact, most of these kids have probably been trained by specialists like how Pet trained Euterpe) then the people older than her should be X + years of work smart.

And that just isn't present in the text. Which makes me sad.
