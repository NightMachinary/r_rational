I'd strongly recommend starting with this one, and maybe go back to her earlier work if you want to explore the wider setting.

(this is part four in a sprawling multiverse, most recently published but still a prequel. Personally I just ignored the whole series thing because it stands perfectly well along and I didn't want to read the others.)
