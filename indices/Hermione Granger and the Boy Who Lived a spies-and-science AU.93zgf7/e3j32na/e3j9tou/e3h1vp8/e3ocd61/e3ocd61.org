I have a problem with this story.

Things do not seem to scale, and there are parts that do not seem to make physical sense.

I'm going to bring up an example of each (scaling, physical inaccuracy) that are not spoilers, but there are other examples that would be spoilers.

Example 1: Hermione is invited to help edit/research a paper by a professor during her second year. Why wasn't an older student asked? Is the implication here that she is better equipped to do this job better than all others? She's not in the most advanced class. As there is several tiers above what she is currently in. There might be some hidden reason, but the biggest problem is that it doesn't strike Hermione as weird. And Hermione has been written and revealed to be very smart and questioning of peoples' motives.

Example 2. Hermione says she spent the summer (between First year and Second year) running 10 kilometers in 30 minutes. That is close to a 5 minute pace per mile. I ran cross country in college, and only the very top men (although it wasnt a very competitive sports college) could even get close to that. Also, their cross country team is running 12 kilometers for their races. College cross country (and they are all younger than college age) runs 8 Kilometer races. Why? No explanation is given. No one reacts like that is absolutely insane for a Second year (12-13 year old) to be doing.

Did anyone else notice this kind of thing? Did it bother them? Im curious as to what people think now that this is has been up for a couple of days and people have read some of it.
