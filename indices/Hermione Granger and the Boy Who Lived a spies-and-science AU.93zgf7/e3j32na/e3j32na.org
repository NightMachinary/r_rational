I didn't know there was non-magical hp fanfic.

After reading the first ten chapters I don't think I'm going to continue this. A lot of the first part of it seems to be just forcing the hp plot in a super spy school, and at a lot moments come off as weird.

The writing is ok, and it does have a lot good ideas. I think it would be way better rewrite without all the hp stuff, maybe also age the characters a few years?
