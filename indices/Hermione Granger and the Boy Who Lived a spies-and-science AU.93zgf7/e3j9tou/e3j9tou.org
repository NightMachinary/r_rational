OK, I've read the first five chapters. Writing style seems solid, very few errors that I noticed, the conversion from magic to SF seems pretty smooth and shows some cleverness.

It's just...not grabbing me? I'm not feeling any particular hook. The author has clearly put in effort and has talent, the story has value as a "look what you can do with this", but I'm having a hard time getting into it.
