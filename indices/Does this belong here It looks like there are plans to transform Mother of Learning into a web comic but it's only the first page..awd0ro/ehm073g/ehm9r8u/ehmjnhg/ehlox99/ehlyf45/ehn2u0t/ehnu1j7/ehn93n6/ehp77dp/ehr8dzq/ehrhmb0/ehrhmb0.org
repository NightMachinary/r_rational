  In America, fanfiction is always copyright infringement.
#+end_quote

This is not true. In many cases --- perhaps most --- fanfiction qualifies as fair use by three of the four tests enumerated in 17 USC ยง107. On top of that, it's estimated^{1} most fanfiction is also sufficiently transformative to not qualify as a derivative work at all.

The landmark case here is /Campbell v. Acuff-Rose/, but /Suntrust v. Houghton Mifflin Co./ is probably more immediately relevant.

#+begin_quote
  In the american fanfic community, any author educated on the legal realities of the practice doesn't give a damn about permission, because permission has no legal weight. It grants nothing. It protects nothing.
#+end_quote

This is also not true. In the event of an infringement lawsuit --- which is always a possibility, even when the work should clearly not be considered infringing, because [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frivolous_litigation][frivolous litigation]] is a thing --- the ability to prove that permission was given is, at the very least, likely to dramatically reduce the defendant's legal fees.

In this particular case, permission may actually be legally necessary, because /this is not fanfiction/; it is only an adaptation of the work into a new medium, and those usually attempt to minimize transformativity in order to remain faithful to their respective original works. It fails on at least two of the four factors of fair use (2. nature of the original work, 3. amount and substantiality), and --- given the above --- many judges may rule it also fails on a third (1. purpose and character).
