For anyone else like me who had to look up the common name for Sodium Hypochlorite, it's the chemical name for bleach. Drinking bleach is probably a bad idea.

P.S. Does anyone know why the manga is named Bleach? I can't see any connection to the title...unless the author is thinking of brain bleach?
