Bleach is filled to the brim with stuff that would make it perfect for a rat!fic.

Mod souls, Zanpakuto, Hollows, Quincies, afterlifes, Scientific study of spirits, take your pick.

And then we have people like Aizen, Urahara, Ichibei, Uuryu, Mayuri, Barragan, Juha Bach, Xcution, and Yamamoto, who could all /easily/ be turned into rational antagonists.

To be honest, it was hard to pick a small enough number of plotlines that the story would be coherent.
