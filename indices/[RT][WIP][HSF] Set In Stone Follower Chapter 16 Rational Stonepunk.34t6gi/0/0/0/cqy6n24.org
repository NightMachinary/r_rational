Oh, well - Psycho-Pass is one of my favourites. But there's more to it than you think (that link isn't easy to understand without context). Psycho-Pass' society criminalises people not on what they've done, but on their state of mind - a violent, tempermental person would find themselves in mandatory therapy, for example. Enforcers are those that have a high Crime Coefficient (chance of committing crime based on the above), but are useful to the police nonetheless.
