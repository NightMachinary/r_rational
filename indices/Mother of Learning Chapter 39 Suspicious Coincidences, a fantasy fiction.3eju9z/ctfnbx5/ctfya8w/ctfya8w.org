Rea and Nochke being cat shifters is pretty much sealed at this point. I feel like that scene and the Red Robe speculation were devoted to shutting down fan theories while the characters worked their way through their own questions. Which isn't a terrible method, and didn't feel particularly awkward as long as it doesn't get overused.

I think Zorian has killed a few people already, but now we are seeing his (unintentional) mind crush powers. He actually has a good way of dealing with Red Robe permanently if he is still in the loop. He would still have to defeat him first though.

Xvim is interesting
