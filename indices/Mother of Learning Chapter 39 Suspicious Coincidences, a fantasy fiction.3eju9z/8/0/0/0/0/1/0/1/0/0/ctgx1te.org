Fair enough. But for all the know Red Robe has been looping for way longer: He does have some truly insane power. Hell, we know for a fact that much of the time when he fights it is only a simulacrum which he has infused with some small part of his skills. And yet he is still able to completely destroyed a prepared opponent.

But I do agree that throwing someone out of a time loop seems like a potentially easier path, considering he clearly has some knowledge of the time loop and how it works. I just wouldn't throw out the option that Alanic is wrong about the indestructiblity of the soul as he is a bit of a biased source. Especially since he disdains necromancy so and that would be the likeliest path to such knowledge.
