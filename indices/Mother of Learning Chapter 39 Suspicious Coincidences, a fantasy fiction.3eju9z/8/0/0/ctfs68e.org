His marker isn't purely spiritual and mental - it's physical as well. It's how he killed the aranea, by killing them not in looped time but in linear time. Whatever the spell is, though, it's not resetting just Zach and Zorian - it's resetting everything, including their bodies. Red Robe just dodges the effect of the reset. He's not ever "leaving" anywhere, he's already wherever he was when Zach's death or the time limit triggered the reset.
