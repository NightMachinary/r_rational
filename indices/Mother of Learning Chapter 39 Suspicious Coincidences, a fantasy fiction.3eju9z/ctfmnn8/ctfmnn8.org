Typo thread.

""There were no problems?" Kael asked, accepting the bo+y+*x* and promptly opening..."

"Secondly, while Rea did *not* know he was reading her mind"

"Your profession had always been very expensive to practice..." Zorian's line here is in the past tense, which makes grammatical sense, but reads a bit strangely.

"I don't think I*'d* be anywhere near..."

"...he had been really rather callous when he told Kael of the disappearances in Knyazov Dveri, +was+*had*n't he?"

"However, I would really appreciate *it* if you looked" is more idiomatic.

"Did*n't* you know? There is a reason"

"He closed the book in front of +it+ *him*, setting it aside"

"...organized by a trio of magic-wi*e*lding members..."

"Eight armed cultists, three of +which+ *whom* were magic wielders." Yeah, that one's kinda pedantic.

"...of the victim's psyche and what not." 'whatnot' is one word.

"when +that+ *the* first man ended up as a mindless husk five minute*s* later."
