My theory on Red Robe's method of killing the Aranea is that he has an automated spell sequence that takes care of it within seconds of the reboot (believing they are a fellow looper and wanting to avoid additional competitors). The script might be embedded in Zach's subconscious somehow, although obviously it doesn't involve Zach teleporting.

As to RR's personal loop mechanism, one possibility is that he isn't looping at all -- instead, Zach is under a compulsion to create a set of journals and magic items really quickly after he reboots. Among the magic items would be a bomb that kills the Aranea (maybe using a recall mechanism keyed to each of their locations).
