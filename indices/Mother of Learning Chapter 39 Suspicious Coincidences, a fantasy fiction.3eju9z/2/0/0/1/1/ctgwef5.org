What bothers me in addition to that is that Zorian's passive mind detection and empathy which he is pretty much constantly using should have turned up a blank to him or if not then he should have mentioned if there was any internal reaction on Xvim's part on an emotional level.

The fact that he leaves any mention of his empathy out seems odd to me (especially since he implies the only way he could know if Xvim noticed was if Xvim said something...) So either Zorian didn't bother using his empathy sense (weird) OR the empathy sense wasn't working on Xvim (in which case why would you try a mind probe or be surprised when it didn't work?). Very confusing.
