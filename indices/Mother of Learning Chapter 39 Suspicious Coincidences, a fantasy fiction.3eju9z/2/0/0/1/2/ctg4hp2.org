There are quite a few possibilities. It could just be the normal mind shield spell, it could be an obscure spell from a non-Ikosian tradition, Xvim could be an empath or it could be unstructured magic. Xvim is presumably rather good at that and he could easily reverse-engineer the normal mind-shield into an unstructured form, without being psychic. Such a spell would give feedback, like Zorian's.
