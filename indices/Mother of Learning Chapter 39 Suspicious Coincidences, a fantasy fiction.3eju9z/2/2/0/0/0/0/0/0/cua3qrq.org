A) Agreed. Zorian has trouble re-evaluating opinions of people without something to shake up his prejudices. Once he does, however, he's pretty good at accepting that he was wrong. And with his mind focused on the invasion and studying, it's no surprise he hasn't had time to think about them. It makes him feel very human.

B) Interesting. I believe the Matriarch's message also mentioned another continent.

C) The wolf shifters are basically at war with the Winter Wolves. They really don't get along. I took Kael's conversation to mean that nothing should be attempted until Zorian is an expect of soul magic.

I have a suspicion that the Spider Whitelake wants Zorian to kill will either be the ingredient to a soul sight potion, or something valuable enough (youth potion?) to be worth Whitelake finding another method to give Zorian Soul sight. Ritual murder and the dirge moths are the only methods of gaining soul sight that Kael knows, but they're also fairly easy. Grey Hunters are dangerous enough that it's possible no one would know (or bother) to gain soul sight from them.

Power increases are a tricky thing to do. Princeps Fury was my favorite book in Codex Alera, as Tavi had to find creative uses for his furycrafters if he wanted to survive. After that, he went from "powerless muggle" to "unskilled archmage", which was far less interesting to read about. The vast, swarming nature of the Vord didn't help matters.

I'm not suggesting such a power jump for Zorian. Certainly nothing like Zach or Red Robe. But a smaller jump could be interesting, especially since it would need to be earned--I can't imagine becoming a shifter is easy.

E) Akoja Reminds me of Hermione, which is probably why I thought of the Black Chamber. It's a wild, unsubstantiated guess, and is most likely something else. I do still think it's something besides romance, however. On that note, do we actually know anything about Kiana? I can't remember anything about her, besides her being a confidant of Raynie's.

F) Basically. Taivan was unable to do anything to a single card, and she's training specifically to be a combat mage. If it takes even more power to punch through larger "cards", they would make very effective armor against magic. Even without a change in size, it would make Zorian and his golems immune to things like magic missiles, and would likely reduce the effects of stronger spells.

  Also an aside: all but certain red robe has been dabbing in black necromancy, as in human sacrifice and stuff.

Permanent body alteration spells and potions are extremely dangerous to test, as they can easily be fatal. But they're much easier to test in the time loop. Granted, Red Robe seems to be a necromancer, so he probably did use blood/soul magic, but Zorian might be able to accomplish similar things using less unsavory methods.

  do think zorian's two trump cards are his crafting of magical items and his mind magic. Don't know if you've read Worm (web serial set in a superhero setting. Rather dark. A good read!),

That, and his ever more honed shaping skills, which will likely help him with body modifications and item crafting. It also seems to help him learn new magic quicker, as well as analyse how items work. That might be very useful on the gates.

On another note, Zorian now knows where to get a spell to recover Zach's memories. He'll have to get access to the restricted section of the library, but he's planning on that anyway.

As for Worm, I've heard a lot of good things about it. I've been hesitant to read it, however. There are a lot of tropes I dislike that seem more or less attached to superheroes. I suppose I should just read it and find out.
