It seemed obvious on my second read through. There is a ton of foreshadowing in the early chapters.

1) The author is really good with foreshadowing and conservation of detail. Most plot points are hinted at before they appear (Zorian's empathy, the red-headed girl being a wolf shifter, Kirielle's family troubles, etc), and virtually no fluff is present. Is something odd is mentioned, it's probably going to come up later. Mentioning Veyers as an old bully of Zorian's is foreshadowing /something./

2) Red robe pretty much had to be on campus when the time loop started (during the first festival.) That pretty much just leaves a student, a teacher, or one of the politicians at the dance. Zorian would have noticed a teacher mysteriously being absent, and the politicians have /no/ characterization--it wouldn't match the author's style for one of them to be Red Robe. It can't be anyone who actually shows up on campus, as Zorian isn't hiding his progression, and Red Robe has no reason to stay on campus--Like Zach, he has better things to do.

3) Boranova /passed/ his exam--the reason he isn't in Zorian's year is because he lost his temper during a disciplinary hearing. We don't know when that was, but it sounds a lot like Zach's regular fights with his mentor.
