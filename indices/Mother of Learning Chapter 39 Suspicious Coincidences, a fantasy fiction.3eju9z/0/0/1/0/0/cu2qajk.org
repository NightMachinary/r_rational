It's still somewhat possible. We don't know exactly what time the loop begins. From Zorian's perspective it's when he is woken up, but it could be any time from when he went to sleep till then. So there is the possibility of there being some extra time that Zack and RR can act before Zorian becomes active.

After Zorian committed suicide RR could have went back and put a new packet in Zack, with the first batch of information being about going back to check the caves.

So RR possibly had several hours to work with before Zorian got there.
