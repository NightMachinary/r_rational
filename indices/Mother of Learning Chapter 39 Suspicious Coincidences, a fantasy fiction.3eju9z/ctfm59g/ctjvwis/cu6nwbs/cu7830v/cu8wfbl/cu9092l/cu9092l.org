  It's rather fitting that it is student yet again at the center of things- yet none of the players seem to realize that's the case. Talk about missing something literally under your nose!

Indeed. Zach at least has memory manipulation as an excuse.

As for the biggest plot points:

A) The Gates are a big one. As a side note, Damien found something deep in a jungle, and the gates are supposedly strewn all over. I wonder if he found one?

B) The historian is suspicious. I would also add the traitor student that threw the glass of poisonous gas in the panic room.

C) The Mayor and Iasku Manor are critical. That has to be where the invasion is getting the ironbeaks and winter wolves.

From what we're told, winter wolves have bounties placed upon them on the /suspicion/ that they're killing people. The alliance of Eldemar is pushing into their territory pretty hard on top of that--the winter wolves could be reasonable beings.

D) Shifters and familiars have been mentioned pretty heavily. I suspect Zorian is going to take the winter wolf alpha as a familiar/shifter, if the alpha isn't a shifter mage already. It might give him a greater supply of mana.

E) I don't think Ajoka wanted to talk to Zorian about going to the dance. I get the feeling it was more important. Maybe she was invited to use a black chamber?

F) This is less important, but I think Zorian will end up adapting those magic resistant cards as armor for himself and his golems.
