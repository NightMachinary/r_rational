  So either Zorian didn't bother using his empathy sense (weird) OR the empathy sense wasn't working on Xvim
#+end_quote

He did try using his sense of empathy on Xvim, in Chapter 23. He thought that Xvim simply had very good control over his emotions.

  Xvim's face told him nothing, and Zorian had already tried to use his rudimentary empathy on him to no avail, trying to see what made the annoying man tick. Xvim had an incredible control over his emotions, and virtually nothing fazed him or truly set him off.
