Not necessarily off the table yet. They ruled it out because Zach doesn't go off and do things consistently on each restart, but what if Red Robe is near him at the initial restart?

Zach and his caretaker don't get along. Zach even went out of his way to attack the caretaker on the restarts where he left. Maybe he found out the caretaker was working for one of the enemy factions? And maybe the caretaker is good at mind magic?

So it goes like this; Zach suddenly acts weird due to loops, Caretaker checks up on him with mind magic, finds out about loops, plants a memory packet (possibly spending several weeks preparing to plant it before end of loop), next loop Caretaker finds the packet when doing the scan and can take advantage of it from then on, as long as he can track down Zach and fix the packet by the end of the loop.

It would explain why there are long bouts of no activity from RR. Those are resets were Zach doesn't act strange enough for a memory scan or simply leaves without confronting the caretaker or something.

In conclusion: Illuminati, Half Life 3, Jet fuel can't melt time loops.
