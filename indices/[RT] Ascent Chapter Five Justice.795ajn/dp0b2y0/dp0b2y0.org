sounds like Corbin might be aiming to overthrow Vash soon, or at least remove him because he doesn't see things Corbin's way. I'm honestly surprised no one has tried to overthrow Vash for all these years or take him out, and I'd have expected more politiking. Authoritarian governments without democratic elements can get very unstable, especially in this kind of climate where the people in charge are going to be more than likely corrupt.
