You're quite right that at this point in history Arco is rife with politiking but most of this is focused on attempts to gain the Directorship of one region or another, the position that grants those who have it the most power. Whilst there have certainly been attempts to remove Vash, his position is not seen as being all that desirable because it grants no real power beyond passing on the whims of the Dyn and is a lot of hard work. Could you live in luxury? Certainly. Could you distort the wishes of the Dyn to serve your own ends? Within reason. But ultimately you're utterly beholden to them. This also makes Vash's position somewhat safer than it otherwise would be - whilst the Dyn do not care who has the Directorship in any given region, they'd take any attempt to unseat Vash, their representative on Earth, as a severe affront. As for why I've chosen not to show much of this - I could quite happily write a political thriller-type story about various factions and characters within Arco scheming against one another, but that's not really the focus here and I feel it would ultimately distract from the plot. And Corbin... well you'll just have to wait and see.
