I've been drafting the story that [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/f6bw9n/d_wednesday_worldbuilding_and_writing_thread/fi3rlwq/][I was planning in last week's thread]]. I wouldn't recommend following it live, since I've already done heavy revisions of a published chapter, and intend to do more, but it's there if you want. Feedback is appreciated, and you can't rate it lower than Allister did, so give me your worst!
