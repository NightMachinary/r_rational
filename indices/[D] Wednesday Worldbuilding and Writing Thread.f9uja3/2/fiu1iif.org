Is there a good resource for lots of 'corrupted' (for lack of a better word) creatures? A couple of examples of the sort of thing I'm looking for:

- oversized wolf with metal fur
- mallard with a scorpion tail and fangs
- flock of magpies with scrambled plumage colours and misplaced eyes
- rooster that steadily secretes crude oil from its feathers
- miniature sheep (the size of a poodle) with wispy clouds instead of wool

As part of a setting I'm tweaking, I'm looking for novel creatures that are kinda reminiscent of the weirder breed of D&D creatures. The process that creates them is metaphorically 'weird magic grafts random ideas and attributes onto existing animals'. Most of them won't be able to reproduce/their children will be normal animals, but occasionally a mutation like this would lead to a new subspecies.
