This should get you most of the "animal" SCP's:

[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/system:page-tags/tag/animal]]

You should also be able to use the tag cloud on that page to look for more specific kinds.

Unfortunately, the tag system or searches on the site itself probably won't be /great/ for what you're trying to do, since both the quality and weirdness compared to normal wildlife vary like crazy.

Asking on the subreddit will probably get you better answers than anything the site's interface can do for you.
