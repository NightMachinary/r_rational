  The conspiracy has to kill these villains to harvest their powers, but they have been able to either make the trail go cold or provide answers that stop investigations (i.e. fake bodies).

You could have the level of effort put into this be variable, which would provide a fingerhold for the characters. /Some/ villains you need to provide answers for, but others, low-level powers who live quietly unimportant criminal lives, those might be disappeared by the powers that be without the same level of care and attention. The inciting incident could be from one of those lower level targets, part of an expanded program after the success of the first wave -- and the protagonists are the only ones who actually care about the person in question, for their own reasons. (As ideas, novice villain was a friend or contact, novice hero used the victim as an informant, victim leaves a suicide note, but no body is found, and it's not immediately apparent that this is connected to other deaths and disappearances.)
