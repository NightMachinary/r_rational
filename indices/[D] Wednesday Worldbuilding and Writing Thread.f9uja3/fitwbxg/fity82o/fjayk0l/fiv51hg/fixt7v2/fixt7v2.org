villian wants to bust buddy out of prison, is caught by hero just as he find the file on where they shipped him. shows the hero the folder 'this looks wrong'.

that can even be your opening scene. or you can open with the hero stopping a different villian, setting up a checkovs gun for later as to the captured villians fate.

aside from that, you could have a whistleblower. the more people know about the conspiracy, the less secure it is over time.
