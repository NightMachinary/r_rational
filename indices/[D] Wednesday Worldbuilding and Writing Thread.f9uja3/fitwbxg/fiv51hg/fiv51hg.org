I mean all that's needed is a power transferer and a knife on the government team? Unless you're going for the government having the ability to give and take powers without the use of a super.

Though I gotta wonder what criteria the government uses to find a viable candidate to super. Also if any of their supers went rogue.

An incident you could use is the newbie villain (NV) is a side kick of a small time villain who found out the truth or that the NV was a friend of a villain who found out the truth.

The newbie hero (NH) could have gotten their power from the government power program, could have been planning to take down the minor villain and side kick when BAM the government comes bursting in and the (NH) listens into the confrontation.

As for secrecy: magic, mind control, memory wipes, pheromones, geas, lie detection, planes of existence/demiplanes that only those in charge can go and leave as they please, immoral staff/indifferent to the well being of villain, even an island out in the middle of nowhere, a small staff

Anyhow sounds dope.
