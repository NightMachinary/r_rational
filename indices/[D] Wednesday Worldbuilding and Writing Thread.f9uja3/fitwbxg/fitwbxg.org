I'm working on a superhero story where the main plotline revolves around the two main characters, a novice hero and a novice villain, stumbling onto a government conspiracy that is making villains disappear and stealing their powers to give to people who want to be heroes.

No one suspects anything up until the story proper, but for some reason I'm having a hard time figuring out a pair of inciting incidents to get these characters suspicious of what is going on. I suppose it could be one incident that catches both of their attentions, but I still can't figure out what it would be.

The conspiracy has to kill these villains to harvest their powers, but they have been able to either make the trail go cold or provide answers that stop investigations (i.e. fake bodies). Furthermore, they do need to employ scientists to make the process work. I have a feeling that them making a mistake would work, but I can't think something that doesn't make the answer super obvious.
