If you don't want to do a bunch of bespoke creatures, this might be one of those times when it makes sense to really quickly create a generator of some kind (I can give some code, but you'd have to make your own arrays), or if you're into the Next Big Thing, use something like GPT-2. [[https://talktotransformer.com/][Talk to Transformer]] gives the following when fed that list:

#+begin_quote

  - blanket birds which can turn invisible
  - cartoonish spiders that look like at least one or two hundred centipedes, including a whirligig/anti-asbestos bomber version
  - crazy-looking spiky-haired serpents (almost sure to cause a case of accidorma)
  - deadly hornets with large, shiny brains (the wasps are named after a hornet's head)
  - a dragon
#+end_quote

... which isn't the most helpful thing in the world.

Much /much/ better to do it bespoke though, maybe aided by a list of base animals, then doing either word association on their names or features, or culling from suggestions that a different random generator gives you. The superpower wiki has an exhaustive list of powers, and [[https://powerlisting.fandom.com/wiki/Special:Random][this link]] will send you to a random page.
