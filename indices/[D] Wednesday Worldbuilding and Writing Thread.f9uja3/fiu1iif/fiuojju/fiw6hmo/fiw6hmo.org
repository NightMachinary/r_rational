  which isn't the most helpful thing in the world.
#+end_quote

no way.

#+begin_quote
  Blanket birds which can turn invisible
#+end_quote

This one is great. It's a bird (go to a random bird on wikipedia), only its wings have fabric grafted onto them (I'm thinking baby blanket style, maybe trailing about 2 inches further than the normal wing would)

#+begin_quote
  cartoonish spiders that look like at least one or two hundred centipedes, including a whirligig/anti-asbestos bomber version
#+end_quote

You know how there's an ant that mimics spiders for some reason? This is a species of eusocial centipede that mimics a tarantula OR it's just a species of ant that mimics a tarantula en masse. Think of the Nesk from the animorphs-time-of-dinosaurs special.

#+begin_quote
  crazy-looking spiky-haired serpents (almost sure to cause a case of accidorma)
#+end_quote

Snakes with hair. Come on, I'm imagining one with a beehive and another with a mohawk. That's badass.

#+begin_quote
  deadly hornets with large, shiny brains (the wasps are named after a hornet's head)
#+end_quote

Human-level-intelligent hornets

#+begin_quote
  a dragon
#+end_quote

Yeah, okay, that one sucks.

Like seriously, you have a HUMAN BRAIN and you have HUMAN CREATIVITY. You can use this shit as inspiration just as well as someone's "list of cryptids" and "list of weird animals", and the WTF from a computer generating it gives you some extra special stuff.

I gave transformer another chance, too. Well, a bunch of chances until I got something roughly approximating a list. Here's an assortment of everything it gave me in several attempts. I have included the really bad stuff and riffed on it to demonstrate that creativity is possible.

#+begin_quote
  seagulls that sing around hot soup and rivers with carrion fish
#+end_quote

Seagulls with beautiful voices like nightengales

#+begin_quote
  several ugly cranes (in reality a 'cat in a hat')
#+end_quote

The cat in the hat being in quotation marks is interesting. The cat in the hat seemed simple enough but then made a huge mess. So, an ugly crane (bird) that makes a big mess.

#+begin_quote
  shaved seal -/Miscellaneous -
#+end_quote

A seal with human skin. Gross.

#+begin_quote
  threadbare pink turban by Reebok (US)
#+end_quote

.... yeah I don't know

#+begin_quote
  mini-shoe-dwarf - some small instructions included
#+end_quote

If you've got sword and sorcery, then a dwarf with verrrry small feet

#+begin_quote
  by VF
#+end_quote

yeah okay

#+begin_quote
  metallic pants
#+end_quote

yeah okay

#+begin_quote
  mini-yellow wheeled cart
#+end_quote

yeah okay

#+begin_quote
  white pet-looking and slimy gnome at the start of the game
#+end_quote

A slimy cat. Think of a slug, but a cat. Or, if sword and sorcery, a slug gnome.

#+begin_quote
  huge angry stick insect (give it a smile - it's a freaky one)
#+end_quote

Come on this is hilarious

#+begin_quote
  Rococo
#+end_quote

This is apparently a style of architecture. I have no clue.
