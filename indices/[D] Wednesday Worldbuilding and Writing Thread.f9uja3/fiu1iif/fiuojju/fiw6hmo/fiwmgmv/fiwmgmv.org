  The cat in the hat being in quotation marks is interesting. The cat in the hat seemed simple enough but then made a huge mess. So, an ugly crane (bird) that makes a big mess.

That cat in the hat, when he lifted his hat, revealed a new cat (with it's own hat). So perhaps these several cranes are /really/ a Matroishka-doll like hivemind, in which they have a strict size ordering (geometrical sequence, I'm thinking) but share one mind between all of their bodies.
