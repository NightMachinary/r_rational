The villain could have some additional part of their power they never use in public. If they had some kind of noncombat teleportation power, they could escape from holding before getting harvested, then go to a minor hero anonymously, deepthroat-style, to get the ball rolling on investigation.

As to what kind of power could let them teleport, let's say they have the ability to see their surroundings from all angles at all times. You can't sneak up on them, and they're really good in a melee, much like Skitter. However, they're careful to never let slip that the less they move, the wider and sharper their vision is, and if they stop moving entirely for about 5 seconds they can teleport to anywhere in about 100 meters, then do it again as teleportation doesn't count as moving to their power.
