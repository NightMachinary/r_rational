Reread! Damn, I forgot how much I love that story.

There are definitely issues; the situation was highly crafted, but I still find it amazing.

One of the things I've been thinking about it whether it's possible to derive a more universal morality given [[https://www.quantamagazine.org/20140122-a-new-physics-theory-of-life/][entropic life]], [[http://math.mit.edu/%7Efreer/papers/PhysRevLett_110-168702.pdf][causal entropic forcing]], and other things I've encountered. If there's interest I'll try to take some time tonight to write up more of my thinking.
