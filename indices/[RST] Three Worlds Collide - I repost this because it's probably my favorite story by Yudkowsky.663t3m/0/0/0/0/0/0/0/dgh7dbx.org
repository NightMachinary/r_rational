I don't think it's consistent with the text to interpret suffering as the price, rather than the reward, of retaining humanity's autonomy. In the "bad ending" we see Akon grieving his imminent loss of the ability to feel pain. He doesn't merely lament the loss of autonomy, but /specifically/ the loss of the capacity to suffer.
