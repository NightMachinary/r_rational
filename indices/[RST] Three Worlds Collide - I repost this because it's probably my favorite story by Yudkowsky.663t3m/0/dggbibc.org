I like many things about this story, but I don't like the "True Ending." I genuinely don't understand why we are supposed to consider the murder of fifteen billion people an acceptable sacrifice in order to...retain the ability to be unhappy? Preserve our right to allow our children to suffer? Avoid desiring to kill and eat things that look like babies but aren't even sentient?

What rational reason is there to refuse the Superhappies' compromise? It seems like the entire line of thinking is "there's something intrinsically valuable about the way humans are--and particularly, our capacity to suffer is intrinsically valuable for some goddamn reason--so we can't allow ourselves to be changed, even for the better." Which seems irrational as all hell to me, and inconsistent with the rest of EY's work. Since when do rationalists value suffering for its own sake?

I mean, in the epilogue the Confessor--the guy whose entire role is to be the story's purest rationalist--straight up says that he thinks murdering fifteen billion people accomplished something so valuable that it made up for him raping and killing an underage girl. And I don't see anything in the "facts" of the story to justify that.
