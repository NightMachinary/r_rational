I do see where you're coming from with the interpretation that humans value things that don't necessarily map to /happiness,/ but I don't think this addresses my objection that the narrative seems to portray it as rational to value suffering for its own sake. It's taken for granted that there's some kind of intrinsic value to pain and unhappiness. I keep going back to this line, but the Pilot says "To live, and occasionally be unhappy" -- not, for example, "To live, and retain the capacity to fulfill values that don't necessarily directly yield pleasure."

  I think the precise desirability of such a thing when humanity might do better on their own is very much in question.

I agree that it's in question, which is why it's frustrating to me that the narrative portrays it as obvious that it's so undesirable as to justify mass murder.
