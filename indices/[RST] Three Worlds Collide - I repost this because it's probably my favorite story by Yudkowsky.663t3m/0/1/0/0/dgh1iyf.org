  I argue that the story portrays it as rational to hold suffering as a core value, and I also argue that it's not rational to do so. I've never seen any other rationalist work endorse the unfortunately common human habit of fetishizing unhappiness.

I'm pretty sympathetic to the basic gist of what you're saying, but I do think that it's not unreasonable to take the view that human values are often more complex than pure hedonism, and within that complexity there is space for things that are not necessarily easily or precisely mapped to happiness. Like, not too many people think of the lotus eater lifestyle as necessarily being the ideal - there are features and possible experiences of existence and consciousness that it is possible to value over maximally efficient pleasure, and to what extent it is possible to want to retain those values instead of converting to a lotus eater there is also an argument for the desirability of attempting a first and foremost human-value based utopia without superhappy values crowding them out.

Maybe you thought that the story didn't make any such arguments effectively enough, but I guess as someone unsure I can say I found it sufficiently plausible and perhaps correct. For what it's worth, if I can remember right, the first time I read the story I think I was more or less on board with the superhappy solution, and although I haven't read it in a while I think I would probably still take it.
