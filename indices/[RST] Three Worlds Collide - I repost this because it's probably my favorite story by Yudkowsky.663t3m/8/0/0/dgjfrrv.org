I'm fairly familiar with the Fate franchise and I kind of get it. Copypasting from the TypeMoon wiki:

#+begin_quote
  His hesitation to kill his first love when she became a Dead Apostle resulted in the death of the whole Island. Kiritsugu, realizing that his father was the cause of this... hardened his resolve and killed his father to prevent more deaths. ... He lost all traces of youthful innocence after having spent his life going through countless battles while trying to obtain a utopia that could never be fulfilled. After finding out about the existence of the Grail, he sought to use it to obtain that utopia. He feels no emotion from personal victories over his targets... In order to pursue his dream, he attempts to distance himself from his emotions... He has managed to become completely devoted to any duty without showing any emotional wavering... He dislikes such emotions interfering with his work...

The wiki (in keeping with the source material) continues to repeat this general idea over and over in slightly different ways.

Compare to the relevant passage from Three Worlds Collide:

#+begin_quote
  In the early days of my species there were those who refrained from happiness in order to achieve perfect skill in helping others, using untranslatable 3 to suppress their emotions and acting only on their abstract knowledge of goals
#+end_quote

So probably that was the best match the translation software could come up with.
