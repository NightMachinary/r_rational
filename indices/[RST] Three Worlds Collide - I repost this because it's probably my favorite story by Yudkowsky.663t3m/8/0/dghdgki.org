One of the characters briefly alludes to Fate/Stay Night being considered one of humanity's great and enduring works, so I assume the idea is that the Superhappies borrowed the term to describe that role in a way that would be meaningful to the human crew. But I'm not familiar with Fate/Stay Night, so I have no idea why that character would be associated with what the Superhappies' kiritsugu do.
