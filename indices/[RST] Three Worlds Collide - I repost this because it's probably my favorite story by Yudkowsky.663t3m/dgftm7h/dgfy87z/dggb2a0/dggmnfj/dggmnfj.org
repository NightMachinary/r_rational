I don't know of Nabokov, but I'm betting it's some form of violent rape...?

I've been studying, thinking, and discussing a lot about consent recently (a group I'm part of has grown to sufficient size that it's necessary). One thing that's becoming apparent is there's something like three categories: consensual sex, nonconsensual sex, rape.

It's the middle category that's interesting. The classic example is a girlfriend giving into their boyfriend's pressure for sex before they're ready; classically, the boyfriend has no idea. I met someone once that had this happen to them (as the guy), and it fucked them up royally.

This seems pretty clearly of a different category of thing than the classic violent rape.

What is actually, directly described in the story is also not that. It seems much closer to the first situation.

The confessor - meant to represent us, as the modern human - does not treat it neutrally because /we/ do not treat it neutrally. They remain a solid viewpoint character for the audience.
