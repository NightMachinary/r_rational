I chose to read it as less of a personal projection from the author's idea of a weirdtopia/utopia and more as an example of something that highlights the Confessors' non-interference policy.

What other examples could you give of a social or cultural change that would be thoroughly confusing, repulsive or shocking to current sensibilities, but embraced by future humans?
