Where we disagree is that I actually think it takes a particularly charitable reading to avoid seeing this as an endorsement. I certainly prefer not to read it as an endorsement, since I otherwise like most of the story, but it skews closely to one in ways that make me uncomfortable. In some of my other comments here I've gone into more depth about why I think so. I appreciate your understanding my concern.
