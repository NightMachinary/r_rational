It does NOT help that there is an earlier line (Akon's "I've just been cyber-raped. No, I'm being cyber-raped right now." when he realizes how the Superhappies talk to him) that is written in and preceded by a tone that implies to the viewer that this future society /does/ hold the same taboo towards rape that we do in the present.

So there's mixed signals.
