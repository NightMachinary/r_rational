The various motives that can drive someone's decision to rape do not change what the act of rape actually is. The act of rape is the act of having sex with someone without that person's consent. Rape = nonconsensual sex, nonconsensual sex = rape. If you disagree, please give me either an example of nonconsensual sex that isn't rape or an example of rape that doesn't take the form of some kind of nonconsensual sex act.
