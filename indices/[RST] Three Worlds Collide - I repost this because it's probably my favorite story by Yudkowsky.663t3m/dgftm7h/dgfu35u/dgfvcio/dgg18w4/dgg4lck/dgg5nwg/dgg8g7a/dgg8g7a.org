  Wait, where did it say that was legal?

I mean, how do you think rape works? Physical violence, threat of physical violence, inebriation with drugs, illegal social pressure, along with the actual sexual contact. While it's true that the "physically attacked by a stranger" isn't the majority of rape, somewhere along the line, there is going to be something illegal to get around the lack of consent.

  Another way to put it would be if someone in the story's universe did all of what you consider rape, except the sex, they would still have violated the law.

How does the rape happen if there isn't something illegal to make it possible? Why would the captain act as if rape was legal, if in practice it is impossible to force involuntary sex without violating some other law?
