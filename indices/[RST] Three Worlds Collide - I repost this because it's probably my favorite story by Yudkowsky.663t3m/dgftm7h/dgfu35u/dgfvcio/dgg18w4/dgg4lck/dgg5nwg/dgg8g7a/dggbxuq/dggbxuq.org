  How does the rape happen if there isn't something illegal to make it possible? Why would the captain act as if rape was legal, if in practice it is impossible to force involuntary sex without violating some other law?

Another another way to put it would be that what you think of as rape is illegal, but the non-consensual sex happens in a different way in a different part of their lives. It's not associated with rape to them, they can't even think of it.

  "Give it up, my lord," the Confessor said. He was finally laughing, but there was an undertone of pain to it. "Without, shall we say, /personal experience/, you can't possibly imagine, and there's no point in trying."

Factors like legalized prostitution or any number of things could make rape a rare occurrence to begin with. Then if there's a large enough facet of culture that that has integrated non-consensual sex into their dating, possibly made more likely due to elimination of STDs, unwanted pregnancies, etc. then it becomes one of those antiquated laws that gets in the way.
