  (grabbing and holding someone down, or pressuring them to do something they don't want would be illegal even if this bizaro future culture doesn't think the sex itself is a big deal).

Wait, where did it say /that/ was legal? Because my entire understanding is that they don't even think about "grabbing and holding someone down" when they think about "non-consensual sex". I assumed that assault and/or forcing someone to do something in general is a crime, along with things like harassment.

Another way to put it would be if someone in the story's universe did all of what you consider rape, except the sex, they would still have violated the law. The non-consensual sex doesn't need to be the illegal part.
