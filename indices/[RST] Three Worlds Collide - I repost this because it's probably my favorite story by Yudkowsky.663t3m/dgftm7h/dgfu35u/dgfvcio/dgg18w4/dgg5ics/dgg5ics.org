Why would it be ridiculous for non-consensual kissing to be illegal? I mean, it /is/ illegal, for starters. Even if it weren't, it wouldn't be a "ridiculous" idea for it to be illegal to plant your mouth on someone else's mouth without their permission. That's a clear violation of the victim's bodily autonomy, and among other things it puts them at risk for disease transmission.
