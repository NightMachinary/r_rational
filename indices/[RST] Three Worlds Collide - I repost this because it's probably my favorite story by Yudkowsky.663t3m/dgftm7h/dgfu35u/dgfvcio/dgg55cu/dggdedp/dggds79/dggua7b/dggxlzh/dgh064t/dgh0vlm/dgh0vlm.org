As you said, hugging against consent is a crime, while hugging without consent isn't. But there's nothing in the story to suggest a legal distinction between "sex without consent" and "sex against consent." If it were made clear in the story that unsolicited initiation of sex is permissible but you still have to stop immediately if the person says "no," I would read it differently.

There are two possible meanings of "You should not be traumatized by X." One is the meaning I intended: "X doesn't warrant feeling traumatized." The other is the meaning you gave: "People would suffer less if they could not experience trauma as a result of X, so this is desirable." The same words can be used to express both concepts, but that doesn't make them interchangeable. My argument is that if we interpret the future-human society as being incapable of being traumatized by rape, then the story seems to imply that being raped doesn't /warrant/ feeling traumatized.

  Specifically I think that such topics that provoke strong emotions should be handled in focus or not at all

Strongly agree.
