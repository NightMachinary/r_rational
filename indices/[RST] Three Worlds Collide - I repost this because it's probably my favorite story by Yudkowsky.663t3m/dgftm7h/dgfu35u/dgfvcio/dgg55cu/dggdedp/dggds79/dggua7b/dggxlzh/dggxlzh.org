Thank you for this interpretation; it got me thinking.

It seems plausible, but it requires a lot of reading between the lines. There isn't much in the text to establish why rape should no longer be traumatic. There's also no explanation in the text for why, for example, it's apparently legal to hold someone down and imprison them against their will (in the process of raping them). This is an area in which the "waving" comparison doesn't match up well--when you wave at someone, you aren't /detaining/ them. Even doing my absolute best to look at it from this hypothetical future society's perspective, I can't imagine that there are no cases in which it would be seriously upsetting for someone to be raped, even if not because of the actual sex.

Akon seems to imply some kind of mutually sexy "consensual non-consent" scenario, but what's the logic in not allowing people to opt out of that? Legalizing rape might mean it's legal to act out that kind of scenario--which is /already/ legal anyway--but would it not also mean it's legal to hold someone down and rape them while they're thrashing and screaming "no, I am absolutely serious, I don't want to have sex"? For this society to permit such breaches of bodily autonomy implies a value shift that goes far, far beyond a mere change in attitudes toward sex, and makes it a lot harder for me to buy their visceral opposition to having their autonomy violated by the Superhappies.

And of course, if people in this enlightened utopian rationalist society are no longer traumatized by rape, then that carries the unsettling implication that enlightened people /should/ not be traumatized by rape--that the experience of being traumatized by rape is a silly overreaction that we'll eventually move past. If that wasn't EY's intention, then I think he could have handled this passage a lot more carefully to avoid giving that impression.
