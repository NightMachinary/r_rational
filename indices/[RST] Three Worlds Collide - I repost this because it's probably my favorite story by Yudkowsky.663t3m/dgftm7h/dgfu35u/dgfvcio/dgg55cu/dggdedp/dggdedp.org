It's not a shift in the literal meaning of the word. It's a shift in the culture, and in the connotation. Slavery meant the same thing in the 1700s as it does today, but it didn't carry the same weight. It wasn't considered a horrible thing, horrible thing. Heresy literally means the same thing now as it did in Old French in 1200, but it doesn't carry the weight today as it did then.
