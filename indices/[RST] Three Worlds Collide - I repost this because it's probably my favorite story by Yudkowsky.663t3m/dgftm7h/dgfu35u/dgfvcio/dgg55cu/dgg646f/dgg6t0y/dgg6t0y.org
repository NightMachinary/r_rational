If so, this should have been made clearer in the story. But even then, now that I think about it more, is that really an example of shifting morality? In this interpretation, the society hasn't actually changed their perception that what-we-call-rape is abhorrent; they've just succeeded in eliminating it.

In order for the legalization of rape to serve its apparent intended story function--which I believe is to drive home that this future human society in the story has morals alien to us--it really would need to be the case that future-humans no longer think it's abhorrent to force sex on someone. Which would honestly be a pretty off-putting characteristic for EY to write into a futuristic society, regardless of his intentions.

I don't mean in the sense that it merely makes the fictional society off-putting, but in the sense that it would make me side-eye EY. When an author makes a point of describing a society that is largely utopian by our standards, then immediately has a character from our near-future use /the fact that he once opposed legalizing rape/ as an example of why he's too old and inflexible to lead, it comes across less like an effort to portray this society as alien to ours and more like an endorsement of legalizing rape. Even though the Confessor implies that rape in their society--for whatever reason--doesn't cause the immense distress it causes now, it's difficult to interpret this passage charitably.
