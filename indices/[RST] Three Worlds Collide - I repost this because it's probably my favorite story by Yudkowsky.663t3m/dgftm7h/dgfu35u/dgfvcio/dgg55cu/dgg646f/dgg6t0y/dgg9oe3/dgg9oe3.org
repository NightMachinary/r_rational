Thought experiment: What are some thing(s) we do now that would be considered alien or off putting or heretical or simply /abhorrent/ to the general human populace 100 years ago? Or 500? Or even 1000? Rape's always been pretty bad throughout time (though its degree of abhorrence has shifted throughout history) but what HAS shifted was what we consider rape.

For example, not too long ago (and still in some countries today!), a husband inserting his penis into his wife forcefully and against her will isn't considered rape. So, in said time/place, you couldn't really say "Her husband raped her." and have the impact you may have today.

I say all that to say....I'm not sure what. Rape is bad, I suppose is my message? :|
