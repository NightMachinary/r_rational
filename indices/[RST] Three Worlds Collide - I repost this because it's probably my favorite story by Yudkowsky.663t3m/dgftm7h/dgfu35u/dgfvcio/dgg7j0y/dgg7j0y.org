After the Confessor's reaction I wondered if the word was actually referring to sex with a digital simulacrum of them. I know someone screwing a virtual doppelganger of me without my consent would feel violating to me - but of course not nearly as bad as the non-VR equivalent. This seems like the sort of software that would be almost impossible to crack down on even if it was illegal.
