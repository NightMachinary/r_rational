I don't /quite/ get it either, but I think the idea is that the old Reddit euphemism of "surprise sex" is literally how all the future-people see it, the entire connotation that the R word has for them; it's basically a more extreme, ubiquitous version of polyamory. The Confessor, who's from our own time, tells Akon "No, you don't get it, that word meant a very different and /horrible, horrible thing/ in my time", but Akon is too many centuries removed from the horror to grasp it.

It does make me uncomfortable (though that's mostly of the "I hope no one who doesn't understand the above paragraph finds out I like this story/author" persuasion), but the whole point is that their society is /so different/ that it makes us recoil a bit, just as is discussed in the backstory in the Confessor chapter. It's about a difference in the /word/ "rape" over 500 years, not a difference in how the reality of rape /today/ is perceived.
