I'm not making a moral judgement, if you didn't see the previous comment, it was OP saying that the ship crewmembers wouldn't have suicided themselves for a (percieved) greater good. This being clear because OP spends a lot of time on the suicide watch subreddit and the classic indicators of suicidal risk weren't present in the crewmembers before they decided to supernova the star to escape the sex aliens.

But to answer your question, idk if its necessarily answerable. If you agree that terminal values are terminal then its impossible to say that one set of terminal values are better than another, only that you wouldn't change your terminal values under most circumstances (i.e. wireheading is bad) . I think the point of the story is largely to illustrate that point.
