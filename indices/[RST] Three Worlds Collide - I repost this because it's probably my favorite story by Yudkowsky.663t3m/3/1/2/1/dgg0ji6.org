the people in the story are sacrificing themselves as martyrs or for the greater good (the people on the ship that contacted the aliens). Jumping that up to the category 'suicide' and then looking at run of the mill depression related suicide is pretty terrible as far as argument tactics go.

You might as well jump it up to the category 'dieing' and say 'the average person isn't killed by supernovas' as an argument against it.

basically another example of this [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/e95/the_noncentral_fallacy_the_worst_argument_in_the/]] though rather than an emotional reaction to the central member, you are simply taking a quality of the center member and assuming it applies to the edges.
