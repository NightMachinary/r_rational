Ahh, that makes more sense. But I also think, upon being told that aliens are coming to transform you and all your loved ones into baby-eating blob-like versions of humanity, quite a lot of people would rather die. Whether it's as many as the story cites (I don't remember exactly what portion) is less knowable.
