For an alien race that doesn't/can't lie, they sure understand lying quite easily.

They are by far the strongest race there with a kill switch being available for everyone, being seen as benevolent race when they forcibly modify a new race to being 1/3rd of their old selves who doesn't actually understand the tech being used may just be a quick and easy way to enslave a race.

I also agree with op on how honorable the baby eaters would be. Its more likely their society is open-secret that its extremely cut throat, in their own words they view a won war as just, they may just erase history of the quick repopulation that happens after, that they find so horrible they may strip it from their records.

I think its safe to assume any race of aliens will lie, signaling is to much a part of nature to really be otherwise.
