This is a bit of a cop out when it comes to the moral dilemma in this story, and I'm not sure if Yudkowsky did it intentionally, but to me both endings were really awful and unrealistic. Actually, I find it difficult to understand how the Super Happy People and the Baby Eaters could be the result of normal evolution.

  How come the Baby Eaters' life cycle didn't turn them into the ultimate backstabbers? The story claims that "cheaters" which tried to spare their own babies would be found out and ruthlessly eliminated, thus selecting for compliance with social dictates at one's own expense. But that sort of selection happens at the very end of the life cycle, among breeding adults. Selection pressure is always much, much stronger when it's applied to the early stages of life: if you don't survive your infancy, it doesn't make a damn bit of difference what survival-strategy you might've pursued as an adult. And the Baby Eaters' method of preying upon their own offspring - chasing groups of them down in pens, where only the fastest and most elusive escape their parents' maws - would tend to encourage betrayal as a way of life, i.e. babies tripping up other babies so their siblings will get eaten in their stead. If anything, the Baby Eaters that survive should be the ones who are quickest to shove their fellows into the path of danger; by rights, they should all be "cheaters", and should be pouncing on and killing each other, not their own young, when resources are limited.

And even they were realistic, I don't think real humans would make the kind of decisions the crew made in either of these scenarios. My biggest gripe is that people don't commit suicide that easily.
