the confessor doesn't treat it neutrally, and I disagree that he is a mere spectator or that there is anything objective about his perspective. EY is portraying an "enlightened" perfectly rational "weirdtopia" (as he puts it) and injects some of his personal opinions around rape fantasy culture in a way that is pretty off putting.

this is coming from someone who studied Nabokov extensively, and can fully appreciate the artistic use of rape, incest, and other taboo topics to push social norms and exert a reaction from the reader -- EY fails to do that here.
