Lol I was going to give you grief for not even googling nabokov but if you thought it was some class of unsavory act I suppose it can be forgiven. üòÅ

Vladimir nabokov was a Russian American author, best known for his novel Lolita, which dealt with a predatory wealthy englishmans "relationship" with his adoptive preteen daughter. It was highly controversial at the time, but is now widely regarded as one of the great works of English literature.

I brought it up merely to indicate that I am not opposed to the use of taboo topics in art categorically. I merely think it was done poorly here - and EY himself has admitted it was shoehorned in from an entirely different story.

On the other point, I never once associated myself with the confessor or his perspective. If that was the goal, it failed as well. I would also object artistically to your interpretation that he "represents" the modern human. I don't find it so blandly allegorical as to demand a Everyman who represents anything. The counselor is a character, like the others, and represents neither the narrator nor the reader.
