Maybe, but I feel like rape is an act so consistently reviled that it would take a particularly uncharitable or careless reading to assume its endorsement by the writer. Note that most people tend to take issue with it here for example only do so out of the the mere potential of association with such an idea rather than any actual misunderstandings.

In any case, it is a sensitive topic and I understand your concern.
