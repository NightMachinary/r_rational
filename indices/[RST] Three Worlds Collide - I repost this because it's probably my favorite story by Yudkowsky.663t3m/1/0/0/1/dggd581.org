A weirdtopia is not his personal opinions that we find weird. The point of a weirdtopia is that whatever utopia we create is going to violate his sensibilities, so he creates something somewhat plausible that does so. If it were his personal opinion that he'd find himself at home in but the rest of us would find crazy, that would just be his utopia.
