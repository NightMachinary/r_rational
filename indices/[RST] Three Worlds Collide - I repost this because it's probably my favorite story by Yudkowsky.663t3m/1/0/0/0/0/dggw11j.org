weirdtopia was EY's own word, this is how he talked about the topic.

using another example is easy: make the human Civ anti-abortion. This opposes most modern liberal values and laws, and the expected direction of human culture, and would provide the same "twist" to the reader while being something that could appeal to their ethical instincts. Additionally, it would be more apropos thematically and give the humans even more skin in the game with regards to the baby eaters, and the final solution proposed by the happy people.
