I disagree that it throws the story, or is a non sequitur. In the same way that from within their perspectives, both the Super Happies and Baby Eaters are moral and sensible, the nonconsensual sex is moral and sensible from the perspective of the modern humanity in the story. Since the story is more or less about such differences, it makes sense.

There are three alien cultures in the story, and our viewpoint character is the Confessor, not the other humans. There are three worlds colliding, and we are spectating - not participating in that collision.
