IIRC the point was to give this far future society a trait that would scare the bejeezus out of us, in the same way WE would scare the bejeezus out of a society from 500 years ago if if we told them how accepting we are of e.g. homosexual relationships.

IMO that wasn't actually done well. One of the problem is that there is an earlier line (Akon's "I've just been cyber-raped. No, I'm being cyber-raped right now." when he realizes how the Superhappies talk to him) that is written in and preceded by a tone that implies to the viewer that this future society /does/ hold the same taboo towards rape that we do in the present.
