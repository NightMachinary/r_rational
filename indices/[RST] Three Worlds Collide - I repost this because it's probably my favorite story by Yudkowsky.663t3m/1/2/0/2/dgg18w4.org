I think the best description I saw related it to kissing. You probably don't imagine someone kidnapping someone to non-consensually kiss them for fun. That's more or less how they see it.

I also find the gender role reversal interesting when he assumed it would be the woman initiating, an unfortunately easy part to miss. It wasn't too long ago that men were seen as the ones who must be virtuous and stand strong against all the women who want to get them into bed. Where in modern culture, men only care about sex, and it's up to the women to hold them off.
