A wake-up blowjob from an SO is probably as close as it's possible to get to "a non-consensual sex act that isn't rape," but there are many people who would consider that rape if it happened to them. In cases where it's not rape, there's generally either implicit or explicit ongoing consent to it as part of the "terms" of the relationship. It's not a "whether you like it or not" thing. If you woke up and said "No, stop that," she would stop, right?

Your example got me thinking, though. I considered that the wake-up blowjob concept might be a useful way for me to understand the 3WC-humans' way of thinking. I thought, "Maybe the same kind of implicit ongoing consent is just part of the fabric of society now." But I don't think that interpretation fits, because you're capable of revoking ongoing consent for wake-up blowjobs, but a society with legal rape doesn't allow anyone to opt out of ongoing consent, which means it's...not really consent at all.
