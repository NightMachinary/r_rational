No, rape /contains/ non-consensual sex. It's also about power and things a psychologist could tell you a lot better than me. When rape is used in a colloquial phrase, it's usually about domination or something instead of the sex.

I considered typing "what you would consider rape" every single time, but I thought it made it worse rather than better.
