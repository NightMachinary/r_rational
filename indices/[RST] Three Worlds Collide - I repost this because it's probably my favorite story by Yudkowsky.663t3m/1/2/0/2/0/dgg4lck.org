  It would be like making non-consensual kissing illegal today

It actually is sexual harassment today, so it is illegal.

On that note, if future people radically altered themselves psychologically, I could imagine they might view rape as less bad, but it seems like any reasonable set of legally-enforced personal boundaries would make rape illegal to at least some extent (grabbing and holding someone down, or pressuring them to do something they don't want would be illegal even if this bizaro future culture doesn't think the sex itself is a big deal).

Maybe if Eliezer had the person from the 21st century try to explain to the captain how he is completely removed from not only historical context but the very psychology of baseline humans, the point would carry through better, but even then a lot of potential audience for the story is going to be lost.
