My interpretation was similar: If this is a society so removed from deprivation and violence that they can "fix" sociopathy and violent tendencies in general then the whole social structure of power dynamics, abuse and violence around sex might not make sense to them.

If to them sex means a mutually pleasurable experience in all cases, and not something that can cause pain and trauma, then causing it to happen against someones will would be equivalent to doing something nice for someone by surprise, or at an inconvenient time.
