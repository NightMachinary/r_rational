  There's also no explanation in the text for why, for example, it's apparently legal to hold someone down and imprison them against their will (in the process of raping them)
#+end_quote

But "holding down someone, or restraining their movements, against their expressed wishes" could indeed be a crime that's unrelated to whether rape itself was a crime. Hell, even /touching/ people who aren't your friends might be a crime, and it'd be consistent with rape itself not being one.

Let's use the example of hugging rather than waving. In our current world hugging someone without their consent is not a crime, but hugging someone /against/ their consent is (probably, I'm guessing) a crime. But the crime description probably doesn't include the words "hugging-without-consent" at all, because hugging-without-consent is not by itself a crime.

Akon is told by the Confessor the equivalent of: "It used to be illegal to hug someone, even your friends, or your spouse, if they didn't explicitly clearly and soberly agree to it in advance. If your friends were drunk they couldn't consent to being hugged and even if they initiated the hug, you should try to stop them from hugging you. Even if they were okay with being hugged in the past, you should always clearly get consent first every time you moved to hug them."

Currently, in the real world we don't treat unsolicited-hugs like we do rape, and that makes perfect sense. But it only makes perfect sense because of our current context and culture, where rape is much more traumatizing than unsolicited hugs.

  then that carries the unsettling implication that enlightened people /should/ not be traumatized by rape
#+end_quote

What does it mean to say that someone "should" not be traumatized by X, for any X? Hopefully, in an ideal world, nobody would be traumatized by /anything/, no matter what, because being traumatized is a bad thing that we don't want to happen to anyone. (Greek sidenote: trauma is the Greek word for 'injury')

This most definitely doesn't make it a "silly overreaction" for someone to be traumatized by things in the actual world. It doesn't make it their fault. It doesn't mean they can stop being traumatized by an effort of will. I don't think the phrase 'should not be traumatized' is meaningful in the way you mean it. It's like saying "should not be injured". When one is injured they don't get a say in it, and neither do they get a say when they're traumatized.

  If that wasn't EY's intention, then I think he could have handled this passage a lot more carefully to avoid giving that impression.
#+end_quote

I do certainly think he /should/ have handled that passage more carefully. Specifically I think that such topics that provoke strong emotions should be handled in focus or not at all, as it ends up counterproductive and distracting from the rest of the story.
