You should first imagine a future world where nobody can get emotionally traumatized by rape, anymore than most people nowadays won't be emotionally traumatized by e.g. unsolicited telemarketing, or unsolicited waving.

If being waved at somehow became deeply traumatizing, it would of course (and rightly so) be utterly illegal to wave at you without your consent.

If it stopped being traumatizing, then waving-at-people-without-their-consent would again lose its automatic illegality status. You'd then need a court injuction to say that no-I'm-disallowing-these-people-to-phone-me-without-my-consent-or-to-wave-at-me.

In their future society, nobody can possibly be traumatized by unsolicited sex, and it's hard for the Confessor to explain why it was ever different, the same way it'd be hard for us to imagine someone who is deeply traumatized by unsolicited being-waved-at.
