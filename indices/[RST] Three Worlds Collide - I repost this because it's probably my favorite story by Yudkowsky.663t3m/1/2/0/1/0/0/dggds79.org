Yes, I think that's a more plausible reading than the "it's only a change in the meaning of the word" interpretation that I was arguing against.

So let's say we conclude that in this futuristic society, which is described as extraordinarily progressive and utopian by our standards, "rape" has the same literal meaning as it does in 2017, but is no longer considered abhorrent. And we also see that the Confessor, the story's purest rationalist who is framed as the wisest and most "correct" character, uses the fact that he once opposed legalizing rape as an example of why really old people are too inflexible/too caught up in the morality of the past to lead.

How exactly are we supposed to interpret this, with respect to its potential function as social commentary? I don't know for sure what the intention was, but the scene sure seems to imply that finding rape abhorrent is some kind of backwards, irrational characteristic of our society that will fade out as we become more enlightened, and that those who cling to the idea that it's /bad/ to violate someone's bodily autonomy for sexual gratification are on the wrong side of history. It's not a pretty implication.

The obvious counterargument is that EY wasn't rendering a value judgment here, and was merely presenting a characteristic of this fictional society that is unpalatable to us. However, that whole scene really /does/ seem to be framed with a built-in value judgment, for the reasons I've described. It's a sour note for me in a story that I otherwise enjoy (except for the ending).
