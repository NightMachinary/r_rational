But if it's only a shift in the meaning of the word, what's the point? If there's just some other word for what we now call rape in the future, and the word "rape" changes to mean something else, then legalized rape is basically pointless as an example of shifting societal morality. It might as well be the same culture, just one that uses a different combination of mouth-sounds to represent a specific abhorrent concept.

Plus, it wouldn't be at all difficult to explain to Akon, since the Confessor could just say "in our time the word 'rape' meant what we now call 'someotherthing.'"

The only way this works as an example of shifting morality is if somehow what we now call rape just /never happens/ in the future, and that's hard to believe without a good explanation.

Edit: I've been going through the story again, and Akon does actually use the word "rape" to mean nonconsensual sex in his internal monologue. When he realizes that the Superhappies communicate through sex, and that therefore their end of the interspecies communication involves one of them having sex with an avatar representing Akon, he thinks: "I'm being cyber-raped." This seems to contradict the interpretation that the meaning of the word "rape" has changed very much.

Edit 2: In fact, when discussing legal rape, Akon specifically uses the phrase "nonconsensual sex." The Confessor is the one who calls it rape. It seems pretty clear here that it is, in fact, nonconsensual sex that was legalized, and not some alternative definition of the word "rape."
