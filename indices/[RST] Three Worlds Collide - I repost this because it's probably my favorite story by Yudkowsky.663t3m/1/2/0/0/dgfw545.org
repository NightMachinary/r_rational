Like, to be clear: an otherwise shareable story is /effectively/ ruined by this. If it didn't have this in it, it would be shared with my friends. It does, so I don't. Still a good story. I enjoyed reading it a lot. I understand what EY was thinking, I think, when he wrote that bit in and I believe he had the best of intentions.

That's still some jacked up shit though and it means I don't share the story.
