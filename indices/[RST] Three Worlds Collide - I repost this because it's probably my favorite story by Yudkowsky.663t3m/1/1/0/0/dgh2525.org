I like your alternative proposal of the future society making all forms of abortion illegal. It's more understandable, but nevertheless a divergence from modern liberal values, and it adds to the conflict with the baby eaters. Unfortunately EY seem prone to avoiding certain kinds of criticisms and to revisiting past complete works, so this probably won't happen... unless someone writes a near identical fan fiction of it that contains only this minor alteration.
