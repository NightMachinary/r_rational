Yes, he's also responded in some less wrong threads.

It /is/ grafted on, it /does/ feel awkward, and it didn't work well in the story.

Post narrative authorial meddling to explain background that wasn't in the story itself doesn't absolve these things. The bolded text above is not in the story, so it can't be used to justify things in it.

If you are merely meaning this as an excuse for EY's /character/ then sure, that's fine. However he has talked elsewhere about "rape fantasy" from a social norms standpoint.
