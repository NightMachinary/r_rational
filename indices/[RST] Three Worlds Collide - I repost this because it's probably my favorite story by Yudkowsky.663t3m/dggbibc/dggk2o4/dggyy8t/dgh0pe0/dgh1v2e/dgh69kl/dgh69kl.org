I think that that significance is mainly in order to bring into sharper relief the hypocrisy of the main characters - they themselves are doing it with a kind of self-aware, very dry humour, but it also serves to highlight that aspect more to the reader.

It's significant, but not because suffering is being presented as somehow /right/. It's significant because the continued ability of the human race to suffer is a part of the price that the protagonists are willing to pay.
