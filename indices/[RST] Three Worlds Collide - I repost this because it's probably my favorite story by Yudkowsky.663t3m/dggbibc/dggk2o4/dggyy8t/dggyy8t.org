Really good point about the hypocrisy.

I disagree that the characters' opposition was primarily about the lack of choice, though. The emphasis is consistently on retaining the capacity to suffer. The Pilot's last words in the True End chapter aren't "To live free," but "To live, and occasionally be unhappy."
