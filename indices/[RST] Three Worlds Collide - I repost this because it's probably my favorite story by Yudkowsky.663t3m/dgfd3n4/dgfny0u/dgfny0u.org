  My biggest gripe is that people don't commit suicide that easily.

What do you define as "easily?" There exist people who jump on grenades spur of the moment to save their comrades. There exist people who willingly choose to undertake suicide missions to stop nuclear reactor meltdowns after careful consideration. Extreme circumstances often bring out not just the selfishness, but the altruism in people.

With the fate of humanity at stake, I think it's sufficiently extreme for pseudo-military leaders to make choices like those in the story. Not everyone in the crew had to choose "suicide," but in a sufficiently advanced society (socially speaking) their leaders are in positions of power for a reason.
