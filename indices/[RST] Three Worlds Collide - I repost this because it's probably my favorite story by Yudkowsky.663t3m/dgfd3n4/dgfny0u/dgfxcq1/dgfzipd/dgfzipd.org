Yeah man what we're talking about is WAY WAY more analogous to martyrdom than someone killing themselves in a way that [[/r/suicidewatch]] talks about. You're welcome to not look into what motivates people to become martyrs but bear in mind you're just finding something that has the same name as the thing we're talking about and investigating that instead. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/663t3m/rst_three_worlds_collide_i_repost_this_because/dgfqnb8/][Taboo suicide]] and the truth becomes clear. All this stuff about "a manual for mental health professionals" is highly non-relevant. People sacrifice themselves in martyrdom, and have done so for thousands of years. This has some similarities with the suicide you're talking about, but not as many as you think.
