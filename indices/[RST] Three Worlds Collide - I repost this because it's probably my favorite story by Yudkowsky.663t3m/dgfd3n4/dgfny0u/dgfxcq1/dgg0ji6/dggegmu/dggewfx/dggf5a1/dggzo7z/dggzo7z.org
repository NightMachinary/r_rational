i'm not saying its equivalent, just that the arguments against each are along the same lines. Do you want to change your utility function Y to X? no because even though X may be maximized I wouldn't be improving my value of Y which is what i care about right now even though i wouldn't care about that fact after the change.

Also, they wanted to change our values (and theirs) so they would align, not just protect children. I think the former is the more undesirable change than the second.
