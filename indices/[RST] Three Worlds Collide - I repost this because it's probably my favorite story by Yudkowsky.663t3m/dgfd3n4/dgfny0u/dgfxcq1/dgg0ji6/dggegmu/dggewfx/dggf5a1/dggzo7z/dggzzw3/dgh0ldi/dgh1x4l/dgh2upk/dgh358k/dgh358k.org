The number is in no way easy to calculate. There are too many unknowns. Even the "1%" is arbitrary, and I don't think we can justify using arbitrary values when deciding the fate of humanity.

Let's also not forget that humanity didn't /only/ sacrifice 15 billion lives. You're framing it like people lose utility compared to their pre-compromise selves, but I disagree; they gain utility compared to their pre-compromise selves, and lose it compared to some hypothetical far-future version of humanity that optimizes human values. The Superhappies were going out of their way to make the deal beneficial to everyone, remember.

The Superhappy compromise might not have optimally fulfilled all human values, but it would have fulfilled them /better/ than pre-compromise humans did. So by rejecting the compromise you not only lose the 15 billion lives, you also lose out on that gain in utility between now and whenever humanity reaches that level of utility on its own. And who knows when that will be? Will that /ever/ happen? The problem is a /lot/ more complex than you're describing it.
