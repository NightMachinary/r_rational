I enjoyed it, if only just for the combination of level of polish and subject matter.

It has potential, depending on how the plot progresses to go into more interesting territory. At the moment it's still in "slow gripping AI possibly-horror" territory, but it gets its base material more right than almost anything I can find with this level of polish on the internet, so I can't say too much bad about it.

I'd be quite happy if mainstream science fiction started to do consistent world building to this degree.
