this comic has a lot of really good minor beats and a very appealing art style, and the core concept of "a child interacts with an unboxed AGI" seems ripe for narrative potential. Unfortunately, the AGI itself is written in a very standard "scary AI does evil things for little reason" way that pretty much entirely erases all complexity and tension from the narrative. Just go read [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/62074/friendship-is-optimal][/Friendship is Optimal/]] or [[http://crystal.raelifin.com/][/Crystal Society/]] instead if you haven't already - although I guess if you want pretty pictures, you can't exactly go wrong with this; I'll certainly be coming back in a few months once the whole second season's out, just out of idle curiosity
