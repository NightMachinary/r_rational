Same reaction here. There's this undercurrent of unease in the beginning of the story where you're waiting for the pin to drop and shit to get real... and I'm still waiting for the pin to drop now that I'm caught up, lol. It does a good job of making the AI a semi-inscrutable character, at least, but when you really think about it there isn't really much reason for tension anymore. Skynet is loose, the AI has almost completely infiltrated their Internet of Everything, they are now at the mercy of their overlord's utility function
