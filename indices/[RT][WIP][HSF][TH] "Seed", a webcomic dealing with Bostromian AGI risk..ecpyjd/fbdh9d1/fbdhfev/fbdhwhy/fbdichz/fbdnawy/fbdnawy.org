My understanding of the idea of a "webtoon" style is it's reminiscent of the style's Korean web comic authors released as "webtoons" in the earlier days of the format.

Full colour, decent amount of shading and detail, doesn't tend to rely on panel design in the more traditional sense. I can't describe the style of characters well enough but from looking at different examples of it you can start to see some trends that definitely don't tend to be as common in manhwa, manga, or western comics.
