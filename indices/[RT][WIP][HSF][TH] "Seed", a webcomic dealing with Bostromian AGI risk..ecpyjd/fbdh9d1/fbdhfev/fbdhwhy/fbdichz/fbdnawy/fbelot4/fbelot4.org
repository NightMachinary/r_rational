Yeah, that's all correct.

I feel like the character designs have a lot of different influences, from manga and anime to a more relaxed internet culture art style that I don't really know where started but was very popular on Tumblr.

Explaining an art style through text is kinda counter intuitive though, the best way to understand it would just be to look through the comics of the site.
