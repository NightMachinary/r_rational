A webtoon is a company-specific term for long one-page strip comics, typically colored. This style originates from korean-style online comics, called Manhua.

Webtoons.com is owned by a famous korean social media company called Naver. They provide publishing for aspiring manhua/webcomic artists, as well as translators. They have competitors, such as "Toomics" which is the same thing but by a rivalling company :)
