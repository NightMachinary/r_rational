Made it to chapter 17 before I depleted my late night Reading attention span. It is super good so far. Art and skill doesn't get talked about enough on this Sub and I feel like it is worth mentioning that I /love/ the art style of this comic.

It has a distinctly webtoon aesthetic but is executed very well. It has fantastic design and use of empty space, something that webtoons are often good at when done correctly.

I'm definitely gonna be reading more.
