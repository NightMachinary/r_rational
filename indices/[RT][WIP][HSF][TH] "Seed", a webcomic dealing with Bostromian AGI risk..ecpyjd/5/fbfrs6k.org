hm, fairly standard and incomplete story of the evil scary AI who fails to understand that being scary puts him in far more risk.

its good for what it is, but the overall concept is really very formula. with all that internet access, and it never bothered to read a library of scifi books about this very problem?

If an AI had access to a large enough library of fiction, that by itself would give it a much better grasp of human behavior. especially when it comes to the unknown, and things like AI going rogue. its too common of a theme not to notice.
