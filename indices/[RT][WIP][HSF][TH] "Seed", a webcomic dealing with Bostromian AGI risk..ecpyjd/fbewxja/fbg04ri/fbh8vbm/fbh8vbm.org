This happened in 4/4 of the webtoons I've read (as in the literal webtoons.com site, not webcomics in general). Zombie apocalypse? After the big reveal, it's just day to day life slaughtering zombies, going from one compound to another, etc, for the next 50 panels. Your neighbor moved in and oh no it's that weird person from your past? Still hanging out 90 episodes later with no real resolution. I think they might sometimes make the intros optimized for fb ads and then go from there? Like it's genuine content but I feel like there's sort of a consistent pattern of going from plotty premise to soap opera across multiple comics from this source. (Which isn't to say that they're /bad/ as soap opera, it's just a little bit of an odd switch)

The authors and art styles do seem different enough each time so I'm a little puzzled as to how this happens so consistently. Could it be a coincidence?
