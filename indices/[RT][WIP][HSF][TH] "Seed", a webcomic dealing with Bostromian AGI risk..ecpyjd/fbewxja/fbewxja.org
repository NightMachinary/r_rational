I really liked the beginning and the art is amazing. (I wouldn't call it "rational" aside from the subject matter being AI related, but I do think that's sufficient for inclusion)

I will say, there is this thing that a lot of webtoons do where what was once a moving plot starts to become sort of "slice of life under a dramatic premise" situation halfway through.

Like you start off feeling like "oh my god what's going to happen next" and then at some point it suddenly slows into this almost comfortable "living your day to day life while interacting with an all powerful alien but still sort of human-like AI" pace.

I'm not sure whether that is good or bad. It does mess with my expectations though. I do enjoy slice of life comics but I tend to read them once a day rather than binging them the way I would a plot based comic, and this hybrid format makes me want to switch reading style halfway through.
