Is BNHA fic up your alley? I could check through the stuff I've read, but I posted a summary some weeks back in a monday rec thread here on like 10 different works I felt worth mentioning, with brief descriptions in each. Although idk what exactly "fight strategies" means, detailed one v one scenes? People working through combat/disaster scenarios with strength and cunning? Does "running and hiding from a stronger enemy" count as a fight scene? Is training up and exploring and expanding your skills close enough? Is just a life or death situation against an atagonist close enough?
