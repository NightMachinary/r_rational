I'm looking for a fanfiction of a more known universe like Naruto, DC, Marvel, Nasuverse, etc that focuses on fight strategies. I'm reading and loving The Need to Become Stronger, on the other hand I disliked The Waves Arisen (it seemed too heavy handed for me). No OC would be ideal. HP would work too, I loved HPMOR but I have no interest on reading alternatives/continuations of it, but I'm willing to read a new take on rational Harry or another character.
