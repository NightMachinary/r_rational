I dunno what to tell ya, man, the Xiulan plot might be wholesome but it's certainly not aimless. And, like, dealing with questions of trauma and how the traditional Xianxia setting is a tire fire in terms of coping with said questions of trauma might not be amusing, but it's damn well written and the plotline is very much going places.

The story has always been "Slice of life threatened by the fact that it's in a cultivation world", I feel like.
