Really? I was gonna reply to the guy up thread about how I felt it was overrated. The first book was a good parody, pretty funny, but far below arrogant young master, even though it has better construction. And now the second book just seems a bit aimless, not really amusing anymore and just falling back on "wholesomeness".

I'm sure it will pick up once some of the plotlines start going places, but it is utterly bizarre to see it praised to high heaven and sitting next to Mother of Learning in the RR rankings
