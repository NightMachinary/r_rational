I'd absolutely recommend qntm's [[https://qntm.org/ra][Ra]], both for its rational-adjacent themes and for its metaphysics. I don't want to say more as the way metaphysics comes into it is in itself a spoiler, but there turns out to be a very good in universe reason for having a structured, programming-adjacent magic system.

I've also heard that Fine Structure by the same author is in this category, but I haven't gotten around to reading it yet.
