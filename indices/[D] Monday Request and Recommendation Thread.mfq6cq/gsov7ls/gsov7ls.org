Just yesterday I started reading [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/40373/vigor-mortis][Vigor Mortis]] and, hot damn, am I glad I did (and it totally deserves its spot on RR's toplist).

If I had to boil down what I like about this, it's that the author doesn't seem to be afraid to write what she wants to write and embrace it. The escalating levels of insanity are also fantastic.

Even though they're vastly different in, well almost every way, the two closest works I can think of that exemplify this glorious-descent-into-insanity style (and are also totally awesome) are:

- [[http://unsongbook.com/][Unsong]]
- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/23539/super-science-fast-romance][Super Science and Fast Romance]]

From a more authorial perspective, I'm impressed because doing this is /hard/, especially when you're writing a web-fiction where you get instant feedback. It's all too easy as an author to cave in and abandon or twist your creative vision to follow the hordes of commentators who think they know better, and even worse, when you have a live following, it makes you scared to take the risks you'd have taken before (when you had a smaller or no audience).

This all ties back to something that I've been wavering back and forth on for a while (right now I'm on "no"), namely the old "do your read the comments" question that comes with publishing any sort of online content. On the one hand, the live feedback and praise feels good, but the scorn feels even worse. Even if you have 100 positive comments, one mean one will weigh far heavier on the psyche than all those other ones put together. Also--and sorry for not mincing words here--but most critique/suggestions/recommendations/fixes/hints outside of basic SPAG that authors of webfiction get is complete garbage. Some sites are notorious for this (*cough* spacebattles *cough*) but the RR comments section can also devolve into creative-toxicity quickly.
