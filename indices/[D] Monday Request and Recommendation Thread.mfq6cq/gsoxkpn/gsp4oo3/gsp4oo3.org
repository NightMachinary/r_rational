Hikaru no Go is under-the-radar now... something like +3 decades+ 15 years after it was *massively* popular... (damn, I could've sworn it was older than that).

You might want to look into series about Shogi too, like /March Comes In Like A Lion/ or /Shion's King/ (these both have MC's who're fairly "rational" IMAO, even if the villains & family members are less so).
