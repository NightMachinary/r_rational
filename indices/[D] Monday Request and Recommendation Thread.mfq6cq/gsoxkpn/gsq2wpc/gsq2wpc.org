I was just rewatching this myself, this time in dub (not especially high quality however Sai's voice worked really well in the emotional last half, perhaps better than the original).

Hikaru no Go is one of the genuine classics. Though the insei part drags on a little, everything before and after that is spectacular, with some powerful spiritual overtones perfecting its competitive nature.
