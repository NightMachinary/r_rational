The manga goes on past the point where the anime ends, and is paced and looks a lot better, in my opinion.

The anime adaptation is very much an early 2000s long running TV anime, meaning pretty low production values and pacing that bends to the realities of the format rather than what might be artistically for the best. The material is strong enough that it's still worth watching, I think, but for people who might struggle to stomach it the manga is a great option that I would recommend first.

It's always been a favourite of mine, and despite (and maybe in part thanks to) not knowing much about Go beyond the basics, I've found very few pieces of media more engaging and dramatic and satisfying.
