If you're yearning for a sequel to HnG, I really enjoyed [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7762027/chapters/17700841][Paper Cranes]] by spontaneite. It captures the spirit of a slightly more grown up Hikaru, but wraps back into the more supernatural aspects of Sai's presence and absence. The most recent chapters are on the author's [[https://tenspontaneite.tumblr.com/][tumblr]], but I don't think the story will be finished.
