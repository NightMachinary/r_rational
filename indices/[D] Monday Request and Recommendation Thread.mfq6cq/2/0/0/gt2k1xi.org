I'd second Release that Witch --- it's a really great read and I'd consider it one of the best web novels of this type, although

>! The ending leaves a lot to be desired. I know the Chinese government interfered in the ending (and they are forever thin-skinned shitheads for that), but it was really messy and left me feeling a bit down that the author couldn't stick the landing. !<

I'd also second Castle Kingside. It's a really good take, though it is on hiatus while the author rewrites what they've posted so far.

I'd also rec Magic Industry Empire.
