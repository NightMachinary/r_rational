I think the best way I can convey my disbelief with the situation is to talk about nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons are of such destructive force that they strip away a lot of possible government intervention *once they are made* therefore there is a lot, a ton of resources dedicated to finding out about the movement of chemicals and materials that make nuclear weapons and there are international bodies that help to relegate.

The issue with force that you bring up doesn't seem to be true because the US military seems to have its own super hero group that operates under their purview. Therefore, your assertion regarding someone saying "no" and there being no recourse doesn't seem to be true.

Also, of all possible entities that exist in our current world the American military is probably the one I would give the best chances of coming up with a way of solving (read: detaining, capturing, neutralizing, killing) super hero threats, especially since it does seem they have had 2 or more decades to work on it.

Also, while officials might be informal with each other or friends that doesn't preclude official documentation. Just because a government employee knows your name and your wife's name doesn't mean their son or daughter doesn't have to get a drivers license (bit of a dis-analogous comparison, but hopefully you understand my point here).

Also, for your point of they already knew where they lived, doesn't that point to there probably being some official documentation? So why isn't there a new step when a power shows up in someone that doesn't have a power? I don't know, again, all subjective, but it really bothers my suspension of disbelief.

Happy to keep going back and forth and trying to find out more, but we might be at a "agree to disagree" point? Regardless, I hope you've found my words to not be aggressive or insulting in any way. I am not trying to belittle any of your points, just point out where I disagree. And I've enjoyed seeing another perspective on this stuff.
