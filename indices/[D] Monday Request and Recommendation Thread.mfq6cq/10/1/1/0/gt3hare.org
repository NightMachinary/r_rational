Regarding speedsters I think that Red Rush even without super strength or any other powers besides super speed and super perception should be unkillable and undefeatable. Unless by someone possessing even greater or equal speed and perception. He just shouldn't be catchable in any way shape or form. Which means the method in which he is beaten in the show makes no sense to me. I could see how maybe Red Rush cannot defeat Omni-man, although I think with that type of super speed and the ability to think on the problem for a very long time (relatively) it shouldn't be too hard, but I think it is very hard to say that Omni-man could ever grab Red Rush, based on the speeds we have seen both move at (although the beginning of the fight seems to imply that Red Rush doesn't move 1/100th of the speed that he says he moves or does move in the picnic scene)

Regarding #3 This all depends on how you feel the series is treating Darkwing and the other members of the GDC(sp?). To me, they seemed like they were supposed to be very much good-two-shoes, paragons of good deeds, almost so much so as to be cartoonish (e.g. War Woman's line regarding her company making the world better [this just isn't how publicly traded companies are allowed to operate]). If you buy into that very LAWFUL GOOD look, then that particular scene breaks that pretty hard. But this is, admittedly, fairly subjective on what you think the show is communicating regarding Darkwing and his co-workers. That being said, just because in the real world abuses of law happen does not mean that the superhero in the fictional world is necessarily doing the same or would be doing the same. Ultimately this is a story, so it doesn't have to be the most realistic, but just consistent with its own rules (like in rational fiction, magic isnt realistic, but if the magic system is consistent and things work how they are set up to work, then its rational). And Darkwing, to me, being on the Best and Goodest superhero team in the world but also committing huge abuses of law enforcement doesn't get together to me.

Regarding #4 My assertion is not at all about what is and isn't allowed but the disconnect from being told that a person is one of the best team leaders in the world, and is therefore being promoted and then in the next scene seeing a team that is horrendously broken and doing things that are almost certainly against the rules and would and did definitely lead to problems regarding teamwork, respect, and efficiency. Again, you are comparing these teens to real world teens, which makes sense, but ultimately this is a story, and the narrative of the story in the previous scene was: Robot is one of the best team leaders in the world, so much so, that he is being promoted to lead the best super hero team in the world. That, I think, is very dissonant with the fact that the team he has been leading and presumably teaching just about imploded due to one member really fucking up. If I told you that Person X is the best person in the world at Y and then you turned around and saw Y implode, you might doubt that Person X was really the best person in the world at Y.

Regarding Government I might be mis-remembering or maybe you are but the government doesn't start spying on Omni-man's family until after the Demon Detective entity implies that Omni-man or one of the GDC super hero group was the killer. It is before that that Invincible gains his powers, and while Cecil seems to know about Omni-man's family that is very different than there being some sort of official registration or official acknowledgement of a new Invincible (haha, its the name of the series) Hero with incredible super strength, some amount of additional speed, and regeneration. For me the lack of this seems insane. Like Invincible, who is a minor (17 when he gets his powers) fights an invading military force without, it seems, any official prior training or paperwork being done (this could have happened in the background, but i saw no mention of it). This, for me, beggars my suspension of disbelief hugely. Although, it doesn't have to for you.

Curious about the "heavily implied" part (regarding government oversight). Can you do a follow up on that?
