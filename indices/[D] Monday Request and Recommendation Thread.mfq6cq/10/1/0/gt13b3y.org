  1. Awakening powers in a world where there have been powers for at least 2 decades (Omni-man has been on earth for at least 17 years, cause that's how old his kid is) does not come with registering or letting people know about it. (Seems crazy to me that a person could just continue going to school with no one knowing they could exactly destroy parts of the school or hurt someone [e.g. see what happened with practicing landing and the garbage bag])
