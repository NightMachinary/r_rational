Also, I think in general when people are discussing a story there sometimes is a tendency to say, "Well, if this is true then _____ makes sense." And that is almost always totally correct. But I feel, and people may disagree, when criticising or applauding a story, it doesn't feel correct to point to things that do not exist within the story to legitimize or support things that do exist within the story.

An example: I think someone could say, "Harry Potter sucks as a moral story because the wizards within it can produce water at will (aguamenti) and we never see anyone do that for the homeless or starving or to help crops in impoverished places."

Now to counter that you could say, "Well maybe drinking Aguamenti created water for a long period of time is harmful." And while this could be true, we have no evidence of it in the story, so I would consider this a bad counter.

A counter with evidence in the story would be, "They can't because it might break the Statue of Secrecy." We know in the story that the statue of secrecy exists and it has rules to prevent muggles from knowing about magic.

Regardless of whether you find that initial statement or the counters compelling is besides the point, I just feel like the above statement of "If so, their attitude towards weapons coupled with a photogenic superhero, a competent law firm and a bunch of friendly-minded Supreme Court Justices could easily lead to such a state of affairs." could be completely true and makes perfect sense, but as far as I know, we don't have any evidence in the story that happened.
