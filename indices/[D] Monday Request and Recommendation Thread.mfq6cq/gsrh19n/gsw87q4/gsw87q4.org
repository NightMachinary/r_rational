Katalepsis sounds like something you might be interested in. In addition to being The Big Gay, it's a setting where magic consists of humans squinting carefully at eldritch horrors from beyond time amd space and trying to jot down a few notes before they go insane / spontaneously combust / turn into a wheel of cheese.
