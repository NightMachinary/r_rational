With regards to speedsters, they should only be that overpowered /if/ their speed comes along with things like "being able to throw things at that speed" or "having the physical strength that would be required to actually move at those speeds". If literally all they do is "move fast" through some kind of hand-wavey physics breaking, even if coupled with "perceive fast", and if their power does not grant them the ability to impart momentum to other objects, or to hit with increased strength, then it's much much less OP. We are not given explicit answers as to whether or not Red Rush's power set does or does not include these things, but given that he doesn't use them, it's probably safe to say that he is the "just moves and percieves fast" kind of speedster.

With regards to #3....what is your criticism? That Darkwing is just kind of a shitty person? Ok, yeah I agree. that's probably true. There is nothing unrealistic about that. Look at the kinds of abuses that our /real world law enforcement/ engage in. Now imagine the kinds of abuses that totally outside the system, unregulated "law enforcement" would engage in. Why /wouldn't/ you expect abuses?

With regards to #4, again what's your criticism? There is no indication that this behavior was /allowed/, and if you think that it's unreasonable that teens would do disallowed things behind their boss' back, or if you think that a good leader should 100% be able to control the behavior of a bunch of teens, then it has been too long since you have spent any time with groups of teenagers.

Really, only the very first of your criticisms seems like a mostly valid (from a rational fiction perspective, you are obviously allowed to not like whatever you want) critique. And as the other commenter pointed out, in the US, it's possible (although I agree that complete anonymity would be unlikely even in the US).

Also, given that the governmental organization is /literally monitoring everything going on in the house/, the Government /does/ know who these people are, to the point of being on a first name basis in the hospital /even with an explicitely non-aligned hero family/. These people are not strangers to the government, and they have even clearly had /extensive/ interactions. It seems likely to me that some kind of loose oversight, even when not embedded in some kind of command structure, is heavily implied. Choosing to protect their identity from the public doesn't seem that unreasonable.
