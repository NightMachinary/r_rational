Amazon Prime has a new animated series out called Invincible. It's sort of like The Boys, a more realistic , violent take on the superhero genre, but because it's animated it can do stuff The Boys could never get away with.

The animation and music are consistently great too, especially in the action scenes. I watched the first episode this weekend and ending up binging all three episodes that are out now.
