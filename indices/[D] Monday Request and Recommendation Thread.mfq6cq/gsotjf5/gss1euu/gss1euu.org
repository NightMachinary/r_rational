Any story that follows the "Hero's Journey" mold where the protagonist is raised in relative obscurity, by people who may or may not be their "real" family, to go to do incredibly significant things, while a mysterious and wise old man guides them and there is some sort of prophecy in the background? Harry Potter, the Belgariad, Star Wars, etc.

Oh, and The Truman Show probably works for a more focused answer to your question too. And yes, these are all fairly well-known works that most people are familiar with, but for myself I've not actually seen any of the original Star Wars movies, bailed on the Belgariad partway through the first book, and have had a copy of The Truman Show lying around for over a year at this point that I still haven't got around to actually watching. That said wikipedia plot summaries and cultural osmosis have left me aware enough to mention them even if I'm not technically properly familiar with them.
