Unfortunately, you have just described Homestuck. Good luck.

No but seriously, Homestuck meets all that criteria, unless you're particular about spending time with your friends online rather than in person not counting. Or if you exclusively want cleverness in your banter rather than the range that Homestuck has (I mean, Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff is an in-story webcomic created by one of the characters, with worse quality than what an 8 year old who's sole source of media was Adam Sandler movies could produce, but its like that on purpose, because something something satire). It is definitely a slog to get through the early acts though, it took me 3 or 4 attempts to actually start it successfully when I was getting into it about a decade back. There's a fanmade voice-acted read through that's been going under production for yonks now that I've been meaning to give a listen to after someone linked it here a couple months back: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jMzJaztnFs&list=PLHO1rc05qiGtAidSBy_8jsEOlHXR6x4cd&index=2][This Link Here.]]

Edit: Uh maybe Love Crafted by RavensDagger (the guy who's doing Cinnamon Bun and like 5 other works right now or something)? I'm keeping up with their work Dead Tired right now. I also got to 35 chapters into Cinnamon Bun before deciding that while it wasn't bad, it didn't really grab me enough when I have a bunch of other stuff I'm keen to read. Love Crafted was a bit better, its about a fledging magic student accidentally contacting a Lovecraftian Elder/God/Entity/Thing when they were binding a familiar, and the new familiar spends its time trying to understand the world it is currently in, and also be careful to not shatter reality too much since people are using that right now. I stopped 24 chapters in because, iirc, it was one of those times I got caught up in reading something a few hours past when I should have gone to sleep, and it was similar to Cinnamon Bun in that it was pretty solid overall but I have other things I also want to read and I'll just go back to it later (although I do prefer Love Crafter to Cinnamon Bun, and also LC is apparently a finished work according to RoyalRoad).

I don't remember the work being queer, or any of the author's works I've read getting too interested in attraction or romantic relationships particularly. I'd call Lovecraft non-standard theology since its pretty incompatible with standard religious frameworks. Since the stakes aren't particularly dramatic so there is time for spending with one another rather than a hectic rush to avert world-ending disaster constantly (although I think the two works I put on hold to read kinda went a bit too far towards low stakes that it got a bit boring/aimless, but your mileage may vary). Being nice to people is definitely a major aspect of Love Crafted (and the entire motivation of Cinnamon Bun). The banter wasn't really a thing. I don't remember the dialogue standing out, just that its a young student and a horror that primarily exists adjacent to reality, so casual conversation isn't exactly their ballpark. For the record, Cinnamon Bun and Dead Tired do have a bunch of puns and wordplay, so I'll leave judgement on how clever you think puns are up to you, since I'm definitely too much of a glutton for pun-ishment to be fair here.
