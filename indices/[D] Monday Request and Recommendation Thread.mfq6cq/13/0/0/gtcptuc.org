Same. I don't remember how much I've read, but I dropped it fairly quickly because the MC's story felt aimless, the chicken's subplot felt somewhat clich√©d, and wholesomeness was definitely less than, say, in RavensDagger's works (the author of /Cinnamon Bun/)---at least in terms of the general vibe I got. At least prose is functional, which makes it better than almost all of other xianxia on RR. It feels better than average, but hoo boy it also feels like the most overrated webnovel I've ever seen.
