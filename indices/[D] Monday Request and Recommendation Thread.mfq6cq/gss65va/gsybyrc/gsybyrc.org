Seconding this.

At first I was hesitant because I don't know much about DxD and the little that I do know, I despise. Fortunately though, within like the first chapter, it becomes clear that the protagonist agrees that DxD is shit and makes it her goal to escape that universe and avoid canon which I found a very compelling premise.
