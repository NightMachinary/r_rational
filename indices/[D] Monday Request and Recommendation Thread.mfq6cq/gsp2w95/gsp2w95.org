I'd like to give a recommendation for the anime “Kaguya-Sama: Love is War” which is a high school coming of age slice of life rom-com. The story follows the life of the student council at a prestigious high school and more particularly the relationship between the president Miyuki and Vice President Kaguya. The big twist for the shows premise is that both characters want to trick the other into confessing their feelings which leads to dramatic thriller-esque scheming battles center around romcom tropes.

The first season is available on Hulu.

The first and second season are available on funimation (free w/ ads).
