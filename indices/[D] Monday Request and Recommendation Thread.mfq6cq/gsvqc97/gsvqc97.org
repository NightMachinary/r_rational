I'll make a tentative rec for There are Superheroes in this Story.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/41437/there-are-superheroes-in-this-story]]

It's a new superhero psychodrama on RR. It's still pretty early, but it shows a promising start.

The writing style is a little choppy. Like it has lots of really short scenes that switch between characters and times. But the prose is above average for webfic.
