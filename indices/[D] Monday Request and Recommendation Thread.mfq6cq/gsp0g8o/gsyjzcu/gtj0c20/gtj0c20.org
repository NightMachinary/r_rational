I thought about adding Ra (which I read), but decided against it because I thought it's not quite what I meant - solving magic with the solution being "advanced tech is indistinguishable from magic" is very satisfying, but after it happens it's just a hard sci-fi 'mundane' world.

Through now I remembered the details, and the Tanako's world related stuff sorta fits. I've also read Fine Structure, it is good and probably a closer fit than Ra. Like the A-layer being the same / isomorphic to the Universe, information being a physical thing

Some of the qntm's short stories are actually closer to what I meant now that I think about it (...probably; the concept is quite faint/ineffable/hard to pin down); [[https://qntm.org/library][I have always imagined that Paradise will be a kind of library]], [[https://qntm.org/responsibility][I don't know, Timmy, being God is a big responsibility]].
