I'd definitely recommend fine structure, having read Ra first. It doesn't really get quite as metaphysical as Ra does, although it gets plenty weird. I'm not sure which of the two I prefer. I also keep forgetting that it was originally meant to be a rational-ish take on superheroes (which is what it says in the back-cover description), but the story goes so far into 'sci-fi epic' territory that once you're reading about people flying around with super-perception, you don't get the 'superhero' vibe at all- compared to most 'rational take on superheroes' stories, where the core thing seems to be the /atmosphere/tone/image/ of superheroes in capes with special names and teams, and everything else in the story has to allow for those to exist. Not so here- it's a story that includes people that can fly fast and punch, and it all feels like sci-fi. Very cool.
