I finished watching Hikaru no Go last week. It's an anime about a boy who comes across the spirit of an ancient Go master in an old Go board, and agrees reluctantly to let the spirit play games of Go through him, in his dream of playing the "divine move". The story goes in slightly different directions after that, but I don't want to spoil anything, because the growth is really interesting to see.

I think this anime was uncommonly intelligent in theme and progression for something as under-the-radar as it is. My favourite aspect was probably the main character's character arc though - I've seen the same thing in concept in other animes, but it felt slightly more powerful here than in most.
