I'm reading magestic, and it's alright, but I'm not really sure how it fits with the others. So far, The time traveller has used future knowledge to play the stock market, warn people about disasters etc, and set up people, materiel and organizations for future plans, but he hasn't really done anything that wasn't scientifically known in the 1980s- except for his nanotech blood infusions. I guess there'll be more future-tech later on?
