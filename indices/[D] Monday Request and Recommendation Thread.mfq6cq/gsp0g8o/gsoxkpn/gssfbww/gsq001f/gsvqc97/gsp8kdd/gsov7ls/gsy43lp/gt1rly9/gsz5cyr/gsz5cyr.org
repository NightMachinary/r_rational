The Last Sovereign got a big discussion here the other week, people talking about how it was surprisingly good and rational and all. It's an RPG maker game instead of traditional erotica, set in a traditonal-ish fantasy erotica world with way more depth then that setting normally gets, but spent so long as purely text-based anyway that the distinction isn't very relevant. You can get a guide to breeze through the content a lot easier if the gameplay itself isn't your thing. I played it a few years back and enjoyed it before taking a break, but I've been meaning to go back to it for ages. I'm always terribly unmotivated to go through half-remembered works again, I don't think there's even half a dozen movies/shows/games/novels I've intentionally revisited unless it was to get a refresher on a work-in-progress to appreciate the coming ending better, and I had like 16 hours playtime my The Last Sovereign savefile years back so that's a lot to get through. Art started getting added into the scenes some point months/years ago too btw.
