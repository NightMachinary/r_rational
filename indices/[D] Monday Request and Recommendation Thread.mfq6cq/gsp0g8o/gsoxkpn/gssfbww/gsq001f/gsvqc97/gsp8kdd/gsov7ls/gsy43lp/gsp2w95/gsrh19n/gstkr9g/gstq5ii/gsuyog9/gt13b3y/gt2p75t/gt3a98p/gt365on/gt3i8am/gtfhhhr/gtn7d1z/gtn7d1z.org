Certainly! I agree with you. But to be clear I wasn't advocating for JK Rowling to explain everything in a childrens' book, I was simply using a theoretical example to illustrate a point.

But I would point out that we are currently in the subreddit of "Rational" which means that pointing out a lack of consistency in world building is probably something we are looking for here. I would make different statements in the subreddit comic books (probably stuff like Speedsters could win against anyone, even a prepared batman).

I think it depends on the assumptions that are being made, and obviously, by my post, I felt that the assumptions being made didn't line up with what I thought was reasonable or correct. You might subjectively feel a different way, which is fine.
