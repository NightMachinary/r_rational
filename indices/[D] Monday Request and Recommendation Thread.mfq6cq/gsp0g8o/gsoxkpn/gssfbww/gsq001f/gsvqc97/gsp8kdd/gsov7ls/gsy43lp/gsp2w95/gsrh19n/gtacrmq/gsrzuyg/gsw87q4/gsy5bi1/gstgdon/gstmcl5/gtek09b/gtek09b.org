These are webcomics, not prose, but they're free either way:

- [[https://www.egscomics.com/comic/2002-01-21][El Goonish Shive]] is a long-running comic centered around the interactions of a group of high schoolers with access to (secret)transformative magic and technology. Much of the plot is them talking out differences, understanding why they do or don't work as a couple, coming to terms with being queer and what to call themselves. Elliot is the "greatest power is being nice" character you're looking for, or something close. The beginning is rough but it's *rich* in minor details about characters that get explored later.

- [[http://www.leftoversoup.com/first.php][Leftover Soup]] spends a good amount of its time exploring some characters various queer/polyamourous relationships, though it does get heavy at a few points. Multiple times a sitcom-eque shenanigan set up and then defused by actually being mature and talking about it. The rest is mostly communication about interests and goals, and tabletop roleplay.
