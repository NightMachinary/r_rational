Unless the story is very oriented towards detailed and rational worldbuilding, not every author can (or should) justify every little detail within thier world. Imagine the sheer amounts of info dumps we would have had to go through had J.k rowling tried to make harry potter rational.

I think it's ok to make assumptions on things that aren't explicitly stated in the text, simply because not every style of storytelling fits the amount of info dumps that would be requierd to solve every little inconsistency.
