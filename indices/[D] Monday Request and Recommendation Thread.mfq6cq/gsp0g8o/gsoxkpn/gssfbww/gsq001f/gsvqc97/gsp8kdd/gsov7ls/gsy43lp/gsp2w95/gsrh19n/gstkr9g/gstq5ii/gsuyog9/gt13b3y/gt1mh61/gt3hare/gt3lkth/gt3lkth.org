For most of the points, we will just have to agree to disagree I guess. They don't seem unreasonable to me, but they do to you, and that's fine.

For the last one, you are correct that htey don't start monitoring until after the second meeting with the demon detective. My point was just that they already know who these people are, they didn't have to find them, they already knew where they lived. What's the point of paperwork? They know their names. They know where they live. They probably /don't/ have a method of enforcing any kind of real control, so they don't try (in order to not completely break the facade of government control), they just try to work together in whatever capacity the heroes allow. The heavy implication was that, as soon as they see Omni-man's wife, they are all immediately on first name basis. They have clearly interacted extensively. It isn't just that the government knows who these folks are, it's they have spoken to each other enough to be relatively informal. This implies (to me at least) some degree of interaction/oversight, as much as is possible for individuals for whom the state no longer has an enforceable monopoly on force. I understand your disbelief that the government would be /ok/ with this state of affairs. It's just not unreasonable to me that the government would have any real /choice/ in the matter. If Omni-man (or any of the top tier heroes) says "no", then what are they going to do? They need heroes to protect the world from threats that the government is incapable of dealing with. They are not capable of directly forcing the cooperation of top tier heroes. So they have set up the greatest degree of cooperation and oversight that the heroes will allow them to have, while not forcing a confrontation that they will inevitably lose, resulting in greater losses of face/legitimacy
