It's based on a completed comic series by the same name. The interesting thing is that the show is not just a 1:1 adaptation, but is correcting a lot of the storytelling mistakes of its source material, with the creator's help. And some of the animated character's appearance seem to have been "re-cast" based on the voice actor's appearance.

Another similar recommendation(as in western written adult animation) that came out recently is Dota: Dragon's Blood, based on the game Dota. It's pretty good, even for someone like me who doesn't play the game or know anything about the lore.
