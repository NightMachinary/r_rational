I picked up Kindle Unlimited for the free month because I'm finally getting around to reading Cradle. (It's fine, I guess. As dirtbag cultivation stories go, it's fine.) Looking for recommendations for anything that's particularly great or anything that's particularly great popcorn trash. Bonus points for any or all of:

- queerness,
- extremely non-standard theology,
- characters who actually spend time with each other (which doesn't preclude adventure; see The Boneless Mercies)
- characters whose biggest power is being nice to people
- compelling, entertaining, or clever banter
- relationship-shattering secrets being dealt with by talking about them like grown-ass adults at the earliest appropriate time
