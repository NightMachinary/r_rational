Slouching Towards Nirvana (mentioned after the main post, I've gotten up to date on it since then) is Worm/BNHA crossover fic that probably fits the best towards combat-focused. [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-heroic-chronicles-of-a-young-man-youjo-senki-my-hero-academia.875316/][The Heroic Chronicles of a Young Man]] I've read since making that post, and it also fits the combat-focused theme, and also munchkining. Its technically a crossover with Youjo Senki (The Saga of Tanya the Evil), but its really just porting over personalities/values rather than memories and abilities, so its somewhere between crossover and homage rather than fullblown crossover. Daymare was mentioned and described in the post I made but is a little awkward to recommend, since while it does have the combat and quirk understanding focus, the story and worldbuilding the author puts together is somewhat average, but their ability to write evocative descriptions is beyond many professional works I've read, so its very much a "your mileage may vary" work.
