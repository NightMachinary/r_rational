I was being hyperbolic. And I don't mind the erotic novel part, it's that the author seems incapable of portraying genuine intimacy and affection that I dislike.

An example of that is how whenever Daniel does something nice for his wives(which is a very low bar to cross), they will reciprocate with sexual acts, even explicitly saying so out loud: "Thank you so much, you're getting so luck tonight" or "I'm going to give you the best blowjob of your life for that".

Whether the author intends to or not, it comes across as a transactional exchange of sexual favours for "nice" acts, rather than a genuine display of intimacy between loving partners. It's the equivalent of a trophy wife begrudgingly giving a blowjob because he took her shopping. Not a healthy way to think of relationships.

I've read multiple works of this author, that's just how the guy writes relationships. It's unfortunate because he writes magic and base-building in a very satisfying way, but there you go.
