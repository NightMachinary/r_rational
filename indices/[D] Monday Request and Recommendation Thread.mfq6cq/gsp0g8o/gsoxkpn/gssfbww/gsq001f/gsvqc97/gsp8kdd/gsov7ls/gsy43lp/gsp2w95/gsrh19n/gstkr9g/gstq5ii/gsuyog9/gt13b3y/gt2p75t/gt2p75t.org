It is certainly possible. But even in the US (where this series does take place) where gun laws are lax, you have to have a permit in, I think, every state to conceal/carry (meaning you have a gun or weapon concealed on your person) seeing as how a superhero out of costume is "concealed" this doesn't really make sense.

Now that could be true that we just don't know the background here, but its never explained nor is there a throwaway line regarding it.

And even if you take away the "weapon" part, you could argue for flight, as flight paths in every airspace are incredibly relegated. So, that, at least, would 100% require some registration and policy attached.

But yes, it is possible there is some deep lore either in the comic or later in the series where the option you presented is true, but it doesn't seem like it.
