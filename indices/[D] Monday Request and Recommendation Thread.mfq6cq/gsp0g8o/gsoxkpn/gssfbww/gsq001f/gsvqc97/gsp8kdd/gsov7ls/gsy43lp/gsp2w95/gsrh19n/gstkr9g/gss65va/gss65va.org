I would like to recommend [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/bootstrapping-multi-cross-book-2-now-in-naruto.770733/][Bootstrapping]] a multi cross OC Self Insert where only after 350k words has the MC left the first world, Highschool DxD.

Not really rational, (though it has some rational themes), and I found the beginning a little wonky, but I love it.

The main character is reborn as a normal human in the world of DxD, and decides that the most intelligent thing to do is to fuck off, try not to interact with canon (specially with Issei, being a woman with boobs), learn how to become stronger and how to leave a world of beings that can destroy it with a fart.

Reality doesn't acknowledge her wishes, forcing her to form connections and make friends (the horror), and she learns "World Script" which is kinda like the programming code of the universe and Fuinjutsu from Naruto.

Why do I like it? Many reasons, I like Self inserts, the characters make sense and are internally coherent, the story is interesting and has a subtle charm to it. I dunno.

You can found it on ao3, SV, and QQ if you're allergic to Spacebattles, though it's there where there is more discussion. Just today the prologue from book 2 has been posted, where she appears in the second world, the one of Naruto. Currently "when" is not known.
