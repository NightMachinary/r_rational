For the Nasuverse example, vast amounts of the text in Fate/Stay Night is detailed descriptions of the moves and counter-moves in one-on one fights, including lots of weak characters running away from overpoweringly strong ones and figuring out gambits to buy themselves a few more seconds (our introduction to Shirou is this, and is pretty cool), as well as planning scenes where they go over their abilities and those of their opponents in great detail.
