DOTA: Dragon's Blood is surprisingly good! I mean, you'd expect a Netflix series written mostly to promote a MOBA to be trash, right? But the world building is actually good, the characters endearing, and the plot is... well, it's definitely flawed, but still manages to be interesting. There's even some (small) amount of rationality in there.
