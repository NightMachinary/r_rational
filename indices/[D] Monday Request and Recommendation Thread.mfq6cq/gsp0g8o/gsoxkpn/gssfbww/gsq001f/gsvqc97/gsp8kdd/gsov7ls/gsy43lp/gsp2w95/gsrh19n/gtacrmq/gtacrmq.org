I went through all my KU purchases to make this list. Ironically, it made me realize just how shit the catalogue is and I cancelled my subscription(again).

Recommended:

- Ash and Sand Trilogy - just great\\
- Cradle - I've become increasingly down on it since uncrowned, but I'll still read the next one when it comes out in a few days.\\
- The Salvage Crew - I really liked this because I went in blind, so I recommend you do that too. But if you need to know a bit more to get interested: it's a sci fi first contact story\\
- Aching God - fantasy sword and sorcery dungeon crawler\\

Recommended with reservations:

- The Traveler's Gate Trilogy - positive: anime characterization/fight logic/pacing, negative: anime characterization/fight logic/pacing\\
- Daniel Black - based on how he writes women/relationships I suspect the author has never had a conversation with a human female, but the base building and magic muchkinning are just unmatched and make up for it I guess\\
- Small Unit Tactics - the author is very knowledgeable of medieval combat, but the narrative structure is just fucking odious.\\
- Shadeslinger - overlong and too much "marvel banter"(which I fucking detest), but ultimately pretty good for a VRMMO litrpg(which I fucking detest)\\
- Destiny's Crucible - first 4 books are OK besides harem, bad pacing and a bit too fawning of the MC, but after that the author goes through a classic case of "I don't know why people like my books", changes MC and stops writing uplift isekai.\\
- Life Reset - beginning is wack with the lawyers and the time dilation, but I like the base-building\\
- Disgardium - positive: dystopian russian vrmmo litrpg, Negative: dystopian russian vrmmo litrpg(which I fucking detest)

Did not like, but many on sub like:

- Bobiverse - the author is incapable of producing narrative tension without making his MCs carry idiot balls(which I fucking detest)
