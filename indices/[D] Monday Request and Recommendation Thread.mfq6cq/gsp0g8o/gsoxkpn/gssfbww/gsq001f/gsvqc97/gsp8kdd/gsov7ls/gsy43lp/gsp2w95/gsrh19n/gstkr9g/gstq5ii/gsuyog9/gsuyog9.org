I watched 3 episodes [spoilers for the first 3 episodes ahead] and had problems with it. I am curious if anyone else experienced these same problems. This is in no way trying to make anyone feel bad about their enjoyment of the series, but more me just complaining that this type of stuff takes me out of stories like these: [Hopefully spoiler tag past this point worked]

1. Awakening powers in a world where there have been powers for at least 2 decades (Omni-man has been on earth for at least 17 years, cause that's how old his kid is) does not come with registering or letting people know about it. (Seems crazy to me that a person could just continue going to school with no one knowing they could exactly destroy parts of the school or hurt someone [e.g. see what happened with practicing landing and the garbage bag])

2. The Red Rush (flash-like super hero) doesn't win every single fight they are a part of (unless it includes someone who can move faster than them). Based on what is shown in the 1st episode Red Rush seems to move orders of magnitude faster than Omni-man (he is seen taking away civilians and putting them on a far away street corner much, much faster than Omni-man taking away soldiers who have been flung into the air, also later Red Rush seemingly leaves a picnic to stop a villain and the women he is with only barely notices his absence). Anyone resembling the Flash or a speedster should not lose any fight unless they go against someone who is of the same speed or faster than them, especially when its canon in the show that his perception is always sped up to his "speed" (see episode where he explains this during the picnic). I hate it when any superhero show or something analogous to superhero has a speedster. It almost always blows all of my suspension of disbelief instantly.

3. Darkwing captures 2 people breaking into what is assumedly an important building (based on Darkwing saying he knows what's in the building and who their boss is). He then handcuffs them and leaves them hanging from the handcuffs which are magnetically attached to a metal thingy. Their hands are above their heads and they have no support for their feet. After receiving an emergency beep on his wrist-thingy Darkwing says something along the lines of: "Ill see you gentlemen later, maybe you'll talk then" (not the exact quote but this is the sentiment of what is said).

4. Cecil tells Robot that he is an excellent leader, so excellent that he would like Robot to take on the leadership duties for the premiere super hero group in the world (I believe they are the number 1 super hero group in the world). Robot was previously leading Team Teen (teen team?) which has members of its team in high school. After the scene in which Cecil tells Robot this it cuts to a scene in which one of the members (Eve) of Team Teen returns to the headquarters of Team Teen (they were at the funeral and arrive from the Funeral still in their formal garb). There this person's boyfriend is having sex in the headquarters with another member of Team Teen (kat). Eve's boyfriend lied to Kat saying that Eve and him had split up, this was untrue. While I think this is possible I do not think that this scenario is a scenario that makes sense if the leader of this team, Robot, is one of the best super hero leaders in the world and because of that pedigree is being offered to lead the #1 super hero team in the world. Having sex with a co-worker at your place of business would not be allowed or considered good behavior at a starbucks, let alone for a group of superheroes who are dealing with invading armies or rescuing people from death.

Anyway, its possible some of these things get explained or dealt with in some way that I might find satisfying, but a lot of it just seems to point to a show or comic that doesn't have very good world building.

Again, I'd like to emphasize that if you like this show, that's awesome, and I genuinely hope you continue to do so.
