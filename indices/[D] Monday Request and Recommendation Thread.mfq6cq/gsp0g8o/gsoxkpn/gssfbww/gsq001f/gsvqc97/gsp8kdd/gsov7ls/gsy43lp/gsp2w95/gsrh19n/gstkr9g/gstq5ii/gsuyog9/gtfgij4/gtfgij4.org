What's bothering me in this, and every other superhero story really, is how casual the heroes are with their superpowers. The scene where mark and his father throw balls around the earth and the ball almost hit a plane and kill hundreds of peoples is pinnacle of that.

During mark's first cape fight, he throws a guy through a building, and flips over a pedestrian car, then he pats himself on the back for a job well done...No dude, you have just injured or possibly killed innocent bystanders.
