I read through Beware of Chicken, and I see why it's so highly rated on RR. It's like xianxia chicken soup for the soul, with a setting that is so explicitly positive that it brings a smile to my face every chapter. Any other stories like that? Preferably male lead and straight romance. The only other examples I can think of off the top of my head are Spice and Wolf, and maybe Curse of Chalion.
