Can someone recommend an isekai in the style of Destiny's Crucible, 1632, GATE 自衛隊 彼の地にて、斯く戦えり, The Salvation War, or arguably HPMOR? That is, a story where humans go to another world (or in the case of HPMOR, a hitherto unknown part of this world) and blind the natives with SCIENCE?

I've recently been reading Deathworlders, and it scratches a similar kind of itch: It is basically an isekai where the entire human race is transported into a sci-fi future.

I would prefer something where either the protagonist needs to bootstrap a tech base, or something with a military theme (and preferably both).

I am also open to recommendations for rational military sci-fi or military fiction in general, where the focus is on decisions, strategy and maybe logistics instead of tactics and action scenes?
