Don't want to speak for the Walker, but I know from EG that Chronicles of Amber and One for the Morning Glory were influences. I'd personally recommend both, Chronicles is a fast-moving fantasy about a (fratricidal) family with the ability to walk through possible realities, and One for the Morning Glory is a metacommentary on stories that is funny and a bit moving. If you haven't read it, Golden Compass is also a great series with some explorations of reality:
