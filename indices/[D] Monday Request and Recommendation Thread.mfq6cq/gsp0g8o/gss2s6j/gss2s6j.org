So as I never noticed before, "The hour I first believed" was posted the day after "The Most Meta Chapter" on Erogamer. Probably just a coincidence, but if you believe the fan theory that Erogamer was inspired by FUMMC, and then suppose that Hour I First Believed was at least partially inspired by Erogamer, you could claim that all four of your examples share a single literary continuum! Which, uh...

...yeah, good metaphysics porn is /really rare./ Even good multiverse porn is rare---three examples that come to mind are Chronicles of Amber, The Incomplete Enchanter, and Silverlock. But none of those have the same property /of metaphysics porn/ as the four you named.

Check out Egan's Quarantine and Egan's Diaspora if you haven't already, and Scott's Unsong, but I expect you already have.

Illuminatus Trilogy is not what I'd call /coherent/ but it at least doesn't have a /boringly uniform metaphysics,/ let us say.
