A little flash fiction I wrote recently, ~250 words.

That means it doesn't qualify due to the word limit, but I'd like to share it anyway if I may be so bold.

Since it doesn't meet the word limit I won't bother posting it on google docs, since if I'm breaking one rule I may as well break them all, eh?

The photos were incriminating to say the least. The man - in his 50s - was in a rather compromising position with a large she-wolf.

“Like I was saying, we, uh, made a little home movie.” His face was bright red and dotted with beads of sweat.

His lawyer nodded, silently urging him to continue as she took her careful notes.

“Yeah, so, uh, after she found out that I slept with her sister...” He trailed off nervously.

“Please continue, Mr Callahan. I am not here to judge.”

“Yeah, so after she saw the texts, I got home and all my stuff was in a box. That's fine. I deserved that. So I went to my brother's place, slept on the couch, and the next week I got a letter with these print outs. So I gave her what she asked for, she wanted five hundred bucks.”

“And when was this?” She looked up from her notebook.

“Oh, um, about three months ago. So yeah, she phoned me a couple of days ago and now she wants a thousand dollars. I'm not an idiot. I know how this ends up. Is there any way to... force her to destroy the footage? I mean, I don't think my ex-wife would ever let me see the kids again if this got out.”

“Don't worry, Mr Callahan. We should be able to get this sorted out in mediation. These photos will never see the light of day.”
