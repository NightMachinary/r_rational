  “Hey!”  I called out to him as he left.  “Did you do this for Kaplen, too?  This advice.”

  He paused for a moment.  “Yes.”  His voice was soft, hard to hear across the cocktail party.  “Not everyone's built for hell.”

This passage surprised me a little. Not the part where Lorne mentioned that he gave advice to Kaplan; he strikes me as a person who genuinely wants others to be "strong." But he seems to show a little more sympathy for Kaplen than I expected. Lorne is still a elitist and racist asshole, but this passage and other moments (especially in this chapter) give some depth to his character.
