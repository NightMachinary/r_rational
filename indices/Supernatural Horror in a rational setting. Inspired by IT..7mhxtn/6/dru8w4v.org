Any entity capable of manipulating people or that people could exploit for some benefit would scale with human weapons, since it could have human followers working with it. Or something that can take control of a small amount of humans. In ancient times it could topple a kingdom or (after a lot of time) an empire, today it could destroy humanity with nuclear weapons.

Or an entity that can only be defeated a certain way, like the creature in Dunwich Horror. If that information has become lost or scarce over time it would be more difficult to defeat.
