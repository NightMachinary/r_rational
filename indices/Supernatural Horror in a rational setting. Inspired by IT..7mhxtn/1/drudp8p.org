  The entity can't have a high intelligence
#+end_quote

I don't think it's necessary. We're talking about inhuman monsters; why can't they have high but /orthogonal/ intelligence? They can't plan for long-term, but can win any fight that could ever take place. They have a bag full of tricks, but are slow in developing new ones. They're devilishly clever, but only whenever people are involved. Or vice versa: they don't have same fine-tuned ability to model intelligent agents that we do, and so don't understand human emotions/cooperation/[insert important aspect of human condition here].

Or they're inherently self-destructive: their utility function implores them to play with their victims even as their doom creeps closer and closer. They can only derive pleasure by setting up ever-more-complicated plans.

Or their ability to affect the world is limited, either to a certain place, or a certain time, or people in certain emotional states, or to a certain kind of actions...

  So, what kind of entities would become more relatively more powerful in comparison to the pray in modern era, then in ancient times?
#+end_quote

Either they mirror human advancement, becoming more powerful as humans learn more, or... they simply can improve themselves. A species of boogeymen capable of biological self-augmentation. A malevolent ghost that learned to use her powers better after centuries she spent Sealed In A Can.

Alternatively, remove human advantages. Trap the rational protagonist somewhere where he or she wouldn't have access to modern technology or weapons, forced to rely on improvisation to win.

Alternatively, have the entity target us somewhere where we haven't advanced at all. Our defenses against dream-eaters, which could temporarily accelerate your brain in your sleep, invade your dream, and spent subjective centuries torturing you, or conceptual stalkers, which ensure that the actual timeline is always the one where they're within 100 meters away from you, didn't improve at all, did they?

  So what kind of entities would have side effects so that someone rational would aid them? What gain can you imagine?
#+end_quote

Well, it's trivial if "someone rational" is a sociopath and/or megalomaniac: they could convince themselves that they're on a road to infinite power, that /they're/ using the entity as a tool, not the other way around.

If we're talking about "ordinary" rationalists...

Mindrape: an entity that brainwashes its victims into seeing high utility in pleasing it, and capable of doing little else besides that.

Lesser of two evils: the entity /is/ going to win eventually, and the rational extremist-with-good-intentions sees helping it take over the world now in exchange for sparing 15% of humanity better than letting it kill everyone one century later. Or it would offer protection against a different eldritch entity. Or against some kind of natural omnicide.

  if weapons of 500 years ago could keep it at bay, modern weapons would make it easy target practice

There's a story based on this premise, actually: /Absolute Weapon/ by Yuri Nesterenko, where a Mayan world-ending demon gets anticlimactically mowed down by a squad of soldiers. But I can't find translation from Russian, unfortunately.
