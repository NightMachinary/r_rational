The entity could have been locked away, refining and honing its power for centuries (like a prisoner doing push-ups in his cell). Depending on the power level desired, it also could have kept abreast of human developments and been planning how to deal with them.

Or, a common component of this trope is some sort of astronomical component; the villain only arises when a comet shows up, or during a full moon, etc. The current configuration could be more conducive for the villains power. For example, the comet is on a closer pass, or the villain is even more powerful during a supermoon. This didn't occur the last time it was battled.

Or if the entity is decidedly non-human, the last time it was faced, it was a juvenile. Ignorant and reckless. This time it is fully grown and more formidable.

EDIT: One more. Since this is horror, the entity feeds on death. It feeds directly on death it causes, but it's power is drawn from the death in the world. While people live longer these days, the sheer volume of people means considerably more death in the world, making it more powerful.
