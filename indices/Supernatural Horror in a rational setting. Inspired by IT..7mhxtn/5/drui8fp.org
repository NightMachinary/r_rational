As to the ancient weapons vs modern weapons bit, I remember that the /Midnighters/ trilogy had an interesting take on that: the big bad was actually kinda held back by technological progress itself, literally. New things can stop it for a bit, until it learns. Stone weapons are worthless, though they used to be enough, steel is mostly shit, though it used to be enough, but space-age alloys are enough. So, we're essentially at the exact same level of effectiveness as the first /Homo whateveris/ that raised its wooden cudgel in defence.
