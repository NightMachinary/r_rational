I liked one story where some girl discovered magic and fought crime, then there was a regular supergirl story for a few chapters, then the magic spread out, people with talent started to use it a lot, and it turned out using magic slowly breaks a barrier between us and ancient and powerful evil.

So the ancient evil just waits and sends some trouble makers so that people have to use more magic to defend, so that the apocalypse is coming faster :)
