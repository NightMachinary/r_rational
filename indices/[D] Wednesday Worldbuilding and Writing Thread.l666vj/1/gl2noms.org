Humanity on Speed:\\
/How would the world change if the whole human population was on amphetamines?/

Scenario/:/ a new virus silently spreads throughout the population. The symptoms are mostly harmless, similar to a 7-day common cold.

However, the convalescents develop an interesting condition: their bodies and brains function as if they were constantly on a minor dose of amphetamine. They do not develop tolerance over time, and this condition does not interfere with other medication (including consumed amphetamines). The "condition" is incurable, and the penetration of the virus had reached that of the common cold viruses combined.

How would our culture, society, economy and politics change?
