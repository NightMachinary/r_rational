I'm working on the worldbuilding for a setting, but I'm having trouble coming up with a coherent naming schema.

Normally I'd just steal names from real life, but my story is a portal fantasy so Earth exists in my setting already. It stains the suspension of disbelief that you'd find two cultures from two worlds that both used the names Charlie, Kyle, and Melanie, for example.

So basically, I need a way to name a bunch of characters, where you can tell that the names come from a common culture, without explicitly copying the names from a culture on Earth.
