Depending on the translation situation, you could use the translations of the names in the new world rather than the names themselves. For example, according to behindthename Charlie is derived from the words for either "man" or "warrior", Kyle from "channel", and Melanie from "dark". Translating the names as the root words would save you from having to come up with how the other world's language works, and they might also provide an easy way to illustrate the different cultures based on what they refer to or how they're structured.
