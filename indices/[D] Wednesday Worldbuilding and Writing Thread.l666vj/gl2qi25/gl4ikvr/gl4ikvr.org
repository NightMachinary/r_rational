I'm no con-langer, but one trick is to pick distinct initial consonant clusters for words of a certain language. Although still ones that English speakers can manage.

For example Vlad, zwei, and Mbuti are easy to identify as foreign words belonging to separate cultures and regions.

Another trick is to pick consonants a language doesn't have. Having no r's will give a particular sound to a language. For example, Hawai'ian only has like eight consonants.
