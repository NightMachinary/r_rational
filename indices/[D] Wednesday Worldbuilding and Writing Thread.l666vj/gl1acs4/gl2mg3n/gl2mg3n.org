Around 1000 ad, Viking explorers sailed all the way to America, and found a settlement there. The settlement only lasted 2 years, because between the unforgiving wilderness and the worsening relations with the Natives, there was just no point in staying.

Similarly, Chinese explorers were very close to actually discover America before Columbus, and could easily sail to Australia, but there was nothing there they would need

Ancient and Medieval explorers did not seek virgin land just to settle: they wanted new land that would be relatively close to established trade routes, had some natural resources that can be exported, and robust population to conquer, enslave, or at least trade with locally.

Prior to 1500s, there were no technological or agricultural means to make remote wilderness an useful colony, so such colonies were rarely attempted. Roman, Medieval European and Chinese ships were more than good enough to sail across the globe, there was just no point to it.

It was only after European empires grew powerful enough economically to send tens of thousands of people to Americas and Australia, and have hundreds of ships going to and fro with ore and grain, then it become economically viable.
