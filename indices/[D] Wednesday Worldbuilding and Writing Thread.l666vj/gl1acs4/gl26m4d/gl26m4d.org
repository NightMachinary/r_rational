[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thor_Heyerdahl][Thor Heyerdahl]] did a certain amount of research into this matter, building boats using primitive techniques and local materials and then trying to sail them across the Atlantic or Pacific.

/Kon-tiki/ (1947) was a raft that he sailed halfway across the Pacific on, and /Ra II/ was made from mainly papyrus reed, based on ancient Egyptian designs, and crossed the Atlantic to reach Barbados. (There was a /Ra/ as well before /Ra II/, but it ran into difficulties and the crew had to be rescued).
