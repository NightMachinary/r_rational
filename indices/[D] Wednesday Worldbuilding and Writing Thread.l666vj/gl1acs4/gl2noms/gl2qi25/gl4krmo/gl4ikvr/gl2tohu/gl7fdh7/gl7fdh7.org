A trick I like to use is, when language is assume to be autotranslated, making it clear that the names are being translated too. Here's an example from an abandoned project I was working on:

#+begin_quote
  Her name was not Rose, becauses roses were not a flower endemic to this world. But the name she did bear owed its etymology to a flowering plant that was red, beautiful, and dangerous, so the appellation “Rose” served better than most at conveying the meaning behind her name.
#+end_quote

Then you can establish a pattern-- a character with green skin becomes "Esmeralda", while a character named after a historical conqueror becomes "Alexander."
