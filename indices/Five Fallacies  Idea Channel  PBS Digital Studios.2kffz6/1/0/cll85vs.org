I see this type of comment occasionally here (although somehwat inconsistnetly). While I see your point, and agree somewhat, I also feel like these kinds of posts (factual posts about rational thinking) can be useful resources for people making new rationalist fiction or for people hoping to recognize rationalist fiction.

Someone like EY clearly doesn't need a tutorial in basic rational thinking to incorporate it into a story, but if there is someone who isn't quite as versed in it that still wants to make a story around a strong rationalist protagonist, these kinds of resources could be extremely useful.

It is admittedly a specialized case and this isn't anything you can't find without a little bit of googling, but honestly, at least for now this sub isn't so cluttered with content that the actual fiction is being drowned out. So I say, that at least for now, when this type of factual, educational content is relatively limited it doesn't present a problem and could be useful to some small minority of users.

I mean heck, there is even a [EDU] tag on the sidebar (which probably should have been used in this case). So, while not properly tagged, I think there is implicit approval from the mods for this type of content on the sub.
