Thank you so much for posting this. I was thinking about this while discussing something with someone earlier. It certainly helped. I managed to keep my end of the conversation relevant and I picked up on a few fallacious statements made by the other person. I've still got a long way to go with the sequences, rational thinking and overcoming bias, but this is certainly motivation to learn more.
