  He needs other people to be able to make good decisions, because he is not and can never be as good as he would need to be otherwise.

I just binged the last 8 chapters of HPMoR, and nowhere in the text does it say this.

Yes, in the final chapter he ruminates on the catastrophic mistake he would otherwise have made, but the conclusion he draws from this is that he needs to "up the level of his game" and "think faster, grow up faster", not that he should rely on other people.

And that brings me back to the whole "fetishizing intelligence" thing. The protagonist is worthy of being the PoV character because he's so smart. He fails because the enemy was even smarter, but he eventually triumphs because he has a piece of knowledge the enemy does not. Even looking back on his near-failure, the protagonist simply decides that he needs to be smarter in the future, considering the existence of classes he could take to help him do so (which has an authorial subtext I'm not even going to touch here.)
