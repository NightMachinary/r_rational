  Did you bother to read the whole thing?
#+end_quote

Yes, I read the entire thing. I was there for the "final exam". Gotta say, I wasn't impressed. Transfigured spider silk can act against gravity? Harry has full 3d control over it despite only creating the material from a single point? Really?

#+begin_quote
  That's really not the message it sends. At all.

Different people can take away different things from a text. To me, one of the clear failings of the text was that Harry (and by extension Eliezer) fetishizes intelligence and doesn't trust other people to act in their own best interests. It's entirely possible for people to disagree with this interpretation of the text, but that doesn't make my interpretation any less valid than yours.
