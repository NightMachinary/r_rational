There are a few primary core examples of rational fiction generally used on this sub.

1. [[http://www.hpmor.com/][Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality.]] This is what got me into the genre. It's fanfiction, but far better than the original work in a huge variety of ways. Glaring plot holes, inconsistency in how magic works, and world building errors are examined and fixed. All characters behave intelligently using the resources at their disposal. There are solvable puzzles throughout, where all the evidence you need to find the answer exists in the text. It can be seen by some as preachy, but the author /really/ hates the existence of death as a concept and was using it as a platform to explain why.

2. [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/][Worm]] is the genre-breaker of superhero fiction. Superpowers are creatively described and used, fighting far above your weight class through clever use of limited resources is a major theme, and many of the bizarre worldbuilding oddities of more popular superhero universes are either not present or adequately explained. Strong female protagonist, if that's a thing you care about. Also, if you care about trigger warnings, the comprehensive list of warnings it /doesn't/ carry is an empty set. It goes to incredibly dark places, near-constantly.

3. [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com][A Practical Guide to Evil]] is utterly unique. It takes place in a fantasy world where story tropes are as laws of physics: the Heroes always win in the end, the cackling villains with their human sacrifice powered doom fortresses always lose, and everyone knows it. Heroes and Villains are literally empowered by the gods with supernatural abilities in the form of Names, which are people who are also the embodiment of a story. The Black Knight leads the Legions of Doom, while the Dread Empress broods in her ancient fortress of malice, and the Good Kingdom shivers before their might for a time before Good eventually wins anyway. Another strong female protagonist. Also loads and loads of awesome LGBTQ+ representation literally everywhere. Unfinished, but the fifth book recently ended, with a sixth slated to start in March.
