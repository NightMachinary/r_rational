HPMOR at its best is also frankly just a lot of fun. Though for me its best isn't "Harry being a smartass to everyone and somehow holding powerful wizards and the whole country in the palm of his hand", it's "Harry fooling around in school, being both very smart and very childish, and fighting mock battles with his friends in which hilarious degrees of trickery and deception are involved". Basically I'd doubly read the shit out of purely slice-of-life HPMOR in which nothing bad really happens besides some scuffle with a few bullies and it's all just about a very nerdy kid wizard making friends, experimenting with magic, and sometimes looking absolutely ridiculous.
