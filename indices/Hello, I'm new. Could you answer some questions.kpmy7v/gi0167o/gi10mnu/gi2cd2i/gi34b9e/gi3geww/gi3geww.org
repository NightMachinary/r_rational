Your interpretation would have been somewhat valid for most of the writing of the story. It wasn't the author's intention that people would read it that way (this is drawn from a recent podcast he did on the book, not a groundless claim), but he didn't do much to demonstrate that he didn't mean this in the text because he (again, his statements) just assumed people would get that he wasn't an elitist douchewaffle trying to promote elitism. I'll agree this was a mistake he made.

But at the end, Harry realizes that for all his so-called intelligence and rationality, he spent the entire story being roundly outplayed by two geniuses, and would have destroyed the world the second he gained the power to do so had he not been coerced into taking the Vow. What he learns from this is that mere rationality /is not enough./ Being intelligent is wholly inadequate in its own. He needs other people to be able to make good decisions, because he is not and can never be as good as he would need to be otherwise.
