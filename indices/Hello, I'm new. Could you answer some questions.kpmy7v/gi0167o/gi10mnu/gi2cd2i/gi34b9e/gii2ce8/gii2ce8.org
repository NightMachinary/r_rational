  Transfigured spider silk can act against gravity? Harry has full 3d control over it despite only creating the material from a single point? Really?

It can act against gravity, because it's a specific 3D structure that Harry keeps creating gradually by the Transfiguration. The spider silk has no special powers by the virtue of being Transfigured - it's the Transfiguration itself that allows Harry to defeat gravity. At time t = 0, there is no structure. At t = 1, there is part want, part of the structure, partially unfolding from the wand. At t = 2, part wand, part structure, closer to its final shape. Etc. The structure keeps moving against gravity because of how Transfiguration works, not because Transfigured silk has gravity-breaking powers.

The same thing goes for Harry mysteriously having control over the structure despite only using material from his wand.

Edit: That said, I'm not objective - I, too, believe, that intelligence is powerful (which you'd probably call fetishizing) - I've seen people use their intelligence to solve problems that others would be completely stopped by.
