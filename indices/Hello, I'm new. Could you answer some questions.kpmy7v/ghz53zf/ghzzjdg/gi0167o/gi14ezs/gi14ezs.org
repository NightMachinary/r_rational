FTR I'd like to second [[/u/abcd_z]] in saying that this is probably a bit too generous. HP's complaining about how dumb everyone else is is pretty emphasized throughout. Either he's right, or he's wrong and is being too arrogant and is therefore not as smart as he thinks he is, or a mix of both is true but in none of these eventualities is the quoted statement true.
