Also a lack of intelligence is equated with a lack of value and agency (Harry seeing no point for Ron to exist, explicitly calling many members of the Wizengamot "NPCs"), and literally the only two people in the universe who are actually smart enough to deserve agency are Harry and one other character. At one point that character says the entire country was too dumb to take action against a clear and present threat, and nothing in the text contradicts him.

HPMOR isn't considered high quality because it teaches you rationality (it doesn't). HPMOR isn't considered high quality because it addresses canon plot holes (it interprets canon in a specific way that usually translates to "everybody else is dumber than Harry").

HPMOR is praised because it's a nerd power fantasy. The protagonist has more intelligence, and is therefore better, than everybody else.
