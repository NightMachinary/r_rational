He also chooses to stop manipulating Hermione against her will, both because he needs her for the Vow, and also because he recognizes her value as a better kind of person than him. He lets Amelia Bones have the Line because he recognizes that he can't do the job holding it entails. He didn't need to forgive Snape, but he does without reservation. He explains himself, in full honesty, to Draco, and lets him make his own decisions about his life, when he definitely didn't need to do so, and when doing so was actively detrimental to his interests.

He starts the work of gathering allies, in other words.

Early in the book, Hermione mused that Harry would never, ever figure out how she beat him in the first battle. Not because he wasn't intelligent enough, not because he couldn't learn, but because he "didn't think that way." And she was right. Harry didn't think that way at the time. But by the end, he has learned his lesson. He recognizes that having others to support you is of infinite value. He admonishes Voldemort for his callousness when he couldn't even imagine creating horcruxes for his friends, because he'd never once had one.

Voldemort was the caricature you seem to think Harry always was, valuing raw intelligence over everything and considering lesser intelligences as unworthy of existence. But he was defeated /precisely/ due to this attitude. Because he'd never had a friend who would teach him secrets, and couldn't concieve of becoming that for Harry.

Harry's inner monologue is the thing you criticize, particularly at the beginning. He does consider others of lesser intelligence as lesser beings. But he learns his lesson when he /loses/ to those people. That's the message of HPMOR.
