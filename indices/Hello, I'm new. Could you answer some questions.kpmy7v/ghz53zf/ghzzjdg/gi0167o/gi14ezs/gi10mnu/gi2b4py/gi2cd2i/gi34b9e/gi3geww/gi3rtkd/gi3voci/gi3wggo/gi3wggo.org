As I said, different people can take away different things from a text. That's your interpretation of the final chapter. I didn't read it that way, and I don't think either one of us has the authority to say that one interpretation is more valid or more accurate than another (if such an authority even exists).

  Voldemort was the caricature you seem to think Harry always was, valuing raw intelligence over everything and considering lesser intelligences as unworthy of existence. But he was defeated precisely due to this attitude.

No, he was defeated because Harry knew something that Voldemort did not. In this case, the secret to partial transfiguration.
