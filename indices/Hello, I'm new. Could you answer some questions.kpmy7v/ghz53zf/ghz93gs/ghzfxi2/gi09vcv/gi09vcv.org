Unfortunately, this sub has few recommendations in any media except literature. I guess it's because of production costs; It costs nothing to write fiction, but creating manga, anime, liveaction, etc is quite expensive and has high barriers to entry.

Here is my file on manga recommendations from this sub:

- @great [[https://myanimelist.net/manga/1649/Liar_Game]]

  - short
  - If a telepath, a clairvoyant, a vice detective, a ninja with super reflexes, a spirit medium, an oil magnate, an extremely lucky boy, and an extremely strong man were to fight it out in a rock-paper-scissors tournament, who would you bet your money on? Just because it's a simple game with simple rules doesn't mean the matches will be simple. Mind games, cheat abilities, interesting characters, great humor, this manga has it all! ![]([[https://mangadex.org/images/manga/36067.thumb.jpg]])

  - 1 minute (153 words)

  - A thousand years have passed since the Battle of Primordial Chaos. Shaman bloodlines have become thin and tyrannical demonic beasts mostly hide off in remote mountains. The realm now belongs to Humanity, and it is filled with countless conflicts. We descend from our mountain to join this troubled world. We excel at subduing ghosts and sealing devils; we control spirits and souls alike. We are feared and respected in this world. We are called "Heretics."

    Society calls the teachings of the Soul-Controlling Sect, which captures and forms contracts with soul beasts in exchange for power, "Heresy." For Mo Lianjian, a young disciple who lost his parents when he was little, ascending within the sect is difficult, especially when his childhood friend, the prodigy Lian Beibei, is always picking fights. One day, Mo obtains a fragment of a legendary sword rumored to have been owned by the sect's last master swordsman... ![]([[https://mangadex.org/images/manga/34771.thumb.jpg]])
