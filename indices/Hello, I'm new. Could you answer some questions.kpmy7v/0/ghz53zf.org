The sidebar has very good explanations regarding rational fiction---sharing and discussing which is the focus of this subreddit.

Tl;dr: intelligent characters pursuing well-defined goals, consistent worldbuilding, creative problem solving.

Adjacent interests of this sub (that don't indicate a rational story but tend to be shared nonetheless) include transhumanism, anti-death, and AI safety.
