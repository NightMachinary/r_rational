I will also thoroughly recommend mother of learning it's not manga but holy crap is it by far one of the best books I've ever read. For rational fanfic lovers I'd suggest the following: 1. Mother of learning 2. Harry potter the methods of rationality 3. Worth the candle All three are of incredible quality and the world building is phenomenal as well as the rationality of course
