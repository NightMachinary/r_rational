Oh, hey. You're the guy I pointed to here from [[/r/manga][r/manga]], right?

Basically what others said. The subreddit gathers people who write "rational" stories and people who love to read them. The definition of rational is on the sidebar, but the short version is, stories often focused around worlds with consistent rules and smart characters exploiting them, or generally using their wits. Some stories are actually also focus on talking about methods of scientific investigation and reasoning openly, and these are generally classified as rationalist.

The most famous that started the trend is "Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality", if you know anything about Harry Potter, or the simple premise of "nerdy wizard boy tries to exploit magic and science at the same time", check it out. "The Metropolitan Man" is another great one, it's a Superman story from Lex Luthor's viewpoint. It's far shorter, too. "Mother of Learning" as others explained is a Groundhog Day kind of story in a fantasy world; it also has a lot in common with your typical manga about a protagonist getting increasingly more powerful in an RPG-like setting.

There's also a few ongoing stories being posted here chapter by chapter, including rational takes on Pok√©mon, Avatar the Last Airbender and, ahem, Dragon Ball (the latter being written by none other than myself).
