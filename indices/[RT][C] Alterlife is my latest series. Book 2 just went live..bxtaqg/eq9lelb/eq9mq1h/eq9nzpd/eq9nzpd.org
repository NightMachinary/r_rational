This is a bad way to sell to this subreddit. Rather, what rationalfic would you say this is closest to? Which are you favourite? How is your story different to other litrpg stories? What's different about the worldbuilding that makes it more careful and cleaner than the average for the genre?

Right now your only hook is the supplied blurb, which is particularly generic, and a claim that the MC is rational without any particular backing.
