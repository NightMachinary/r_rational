Completely agree and I would be the first to say that what you happen to like is 100% subjective and does not give anything any objective value (unless you are defining the value on enjoyment of specific people), I would clarify my statement then with the following; I define "Good writing" in my comment as "well written" or "requiring skill to write". - which may correlate but absolutely does not have a causational relationship with what any one person may enjoy, but I would argue that by the definition of "well written" being "took skill to write", well written work necessitates some level of rationality - with the obvious exception of if it is not meant to be... But I guess you could forever go into the exceptions, I guess I must generalise; the majority of what the majority of people describe as well written work is fairly rational, with the majority of the ones that aren't have a specific reason why they don't want to be rational and that it enhances the effect the author was after, specifically if it wasn't rational.

My point in general, is that making the work more rational would make it more popular with a strictly larger audience which I think still stands? Or do you disagree that is the case?
