  by the definition of "well written" being "took skill to write"

It's pedantic, but surely not, there are lots of things that take skill to write that are nearly valueless.

My objection wasn't just pedanticism; rationalist fiction might be new, but rational fiction has a fairly lengthy history and yet hasn't taken all that much of a grip on the wider market. People generally prefer Star Wars to hard sci-fi, and I'd bet most people into romance would find the idea of a rationalist take on it distasteful. Many people have a strong aversion to rational fiction as-is (albeit often that's a status issue). Most portrayals of intelligence in fiction are intelligence-as-status, and frankly people seem to like things that way. One much less obvious concern is that real rational behaviour requires more cognitive work to follow than posturing behaviour, and that's an effective way to chase off large fractions of one's audience.
