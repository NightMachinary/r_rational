  With that said, if it isn't a good fit be prepared for some harsh (and I hope constructive) criticism, because most people here believe that rational (not rationalist) is synonymous (or at the very least correlated) with good writing

Those most attracted to Shakespeare's writing, in the academic environment to foster such things, oft consider that genre to be what good writing is about. As can somebody read a work like Ulysses, see the immense talent it took to write, and figure that it stands so high and seems so great that it can only be a natural pinnacle of writing, and those others writing lesser common books do so only because they do not have the skills or audience or experience to climb these heights. Yet others think the same of Tolkien. Perhaps the animation industry thinks the same of the writing of Spongebob, or Frozen, or Spirited Away.

The punchline is obvious. Goodness isn't a measure of what you happen to like, but it's easy to think that way, so we should be cautious before making the same mistake about ratfic. Heck, if I cared too much about that goodness of writing I'd have never read Forty Millenniums of Cultivation, and if I cared too little about others' fancies I'd never have tried Moby Dick. I prefer to keep it simple: good writing is what most enriches people's lives.
