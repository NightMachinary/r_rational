If Vee wouldn't mind me chiming in here; Matt; I think everyone here would agree with me that even if it turned out your story wasn't a good fit for this sub, there is no animosity for sharing it. Releasing a book itself is a great achievement and if you are proud of it then you should share it where you can. With that said, if it isn't a good fit be prepared for some harsh (and I hope constructive) criticism, because most people here believe that rational (not rational/ist)/ is synonymous (or at the very least correlated) with good writing - me included.

To clarify what I mean by rational, in two words it would be "internal consistency", but I usually explain it to people like this;\\
"In the stories world, if you take for granted a few base premises where the world differs from ours, other than those base premises the story progresses exactly like it would in real life if those base premises were true."

So to give an example of something NOT rational that you are probably aware of: (*INFINITY WAR SPOILERS*)\\
In the scene where Dr strange, the guardians, iron man and spiderman are fighting thanos, Dr strange looks into all the futures and sees that the only future where they succeed is by letting the main guardian (forgot his name) screw up getting the gauntlet from thanos and "loose" to win at the end. This is irrational. They had almost defeated thanos, and there is no way that Dr strange would not have found a future where that defeat succeeds and the gauntlet is delivered to someone who won't fuck everything up again. There was nothing special about the future he saw which couldn't have been repeated in any other futures where they had taken the stones from thanos. This is irrational, and in my opinion also bad writing. A good writer, would have found a way to get the narrative to move the way he/she wanted with all the tension required while keeping internal consistency.

I think the misunderstanding we may have about the genre may be that a rational story isn't one were the characters don't act out of character. It is one where the characters and the WORLD doesn't act out of character.

So, getting back to the point, from only reading your summary and the review Vee quoted, so far the story seems incredibly irrational. (keep in mind I haven't read the story, so many of these points may be incorrect, but the point stands that this is the impression that this community is getting from what we have available before actually reading it)

- " Where it takes a super weird twist is when some rando dude hands him a magical invisibility cloak for a few rabbit hides. " This kind of premise is almost always irrational and IMO only done because a more realistic way of progressing the story couldn't be found. No-one gives random people random shit; say the guy has some purpose to it; he has some grand plan where this guy using the cloak does something specific he wants. Unless for the rest of the story the MC has no choice but to go with the flow such a plan is way too shaky, it has virtually no chance of happening the way the rando expects it to and so there is no way they would do that. Lets say he wants to frame him; why would he reveal himself? why would he trade for something worthless like that? - I'm not going to cover all the reasons here, but I would bet money that whatever the reason it is it isn't going to be good.

- " While there he makes plans to use his cloak to rob the place, but only steals one treasure map" this isn't how a normal human being would act. Maybe there is a better reason in the story, but according to the reviewer there isn't.

- " Including what he had in his bank some how. " Sounds like an irrational plot hole - which would pretty much kill any story for the sub

- " He tells a GM but apparently GMs have 0 power in the game they just greet new players. " and all the next things about how this game isn't just a game; If that was the case there is no way the general public wouldn't be aware of this. This is what I call "uncreative creativity" which is very common in anime from what I have seen, and I would also call irrational. Random rules and premises added to a world to make it "interesting" or to help plot along but don't have any foundation on more base rules of the world.\\
Two good examples could be comparing harry potter (or any superhero movie) with, say GOT. The former has a whole lot of rules implied form the start with no explanation, magic (for no reason) has these specific rules, these superheros have these specific powers and there is no rational reason for them (of course the shows try explaining them in some way but its obvious that the rules were made FIRST and then the explanations just tacked on to make it not obvious to children) while in GOT, the rules of the world are the means to an end, not the end itself, the story looks like it has assumed a score of facts about the world and it's magic, and then the rest of the plot was drawn around what the logical conclusions of these rules would have been. (And even if it wasn't written like that, it would be the job of good writing to make it SEEM like that was how it was written, and the books definitely deliver on this point).\\
I think if you talked to any of the people here who regularly comment in the world-building threads they could give you many more pointers and explanations to keep in mind for your future stories.

The rest pretty much falls under what I said above^. It sounds like a whole lot of irrational random things happened to set up a premise for an interesting story. And anyone who enjoys their fiction rational would have all their immersion broken by then.

Unless I am resoundingly mistaken and got the completely wrong impression I hope you would take this as advice for your future stories. making a story rational just makes it harder to write, not less enjoyable for most audiences, so I would strongly recommend to try. The highest recommended stories on this sub are also excellent examples of rational stories, so I would strongly recommend you read them. We stand on the shoulders of giants after all, standing on the ground out of pride will not get anyone anywhere.

Hope this was helpful, and subscribers to the sub, I would love your opinions and especially Matt I would love to hear from you as well.

And good luck on your book sales!
