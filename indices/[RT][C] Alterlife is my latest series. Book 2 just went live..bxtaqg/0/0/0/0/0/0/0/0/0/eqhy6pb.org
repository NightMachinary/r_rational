mmm now that you mention it i guess so, I had probably been influences too much by my social bubbles.

though i would still insist on an mean level, most people may prefer SW over hard SiFi but if any show looses too much rationality it is not enjoyed as much, take GOT; when it deviated from the books I noticed and lost interest but the general public didn't and it was going strong, but when the plot holes get too obvious it does have a negative effect.
