I've compared the MC to Walter Whyte from Breaking Bad. I can't really compare my book to anyone else's. It's not crunchy and it doesn't hold to the conventions of the genre. I guess it falls into the GameLit category. If I'm wrong in my assumption about the rational aspect, then I apologize. I find that, in many cases, rationalism is in the eye of the beholder. Everyone thinks, or justifies their actions, in whatever way they think is best. That's how I wrote the MC.
