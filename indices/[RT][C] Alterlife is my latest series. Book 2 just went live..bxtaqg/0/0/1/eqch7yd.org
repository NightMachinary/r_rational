(having only read the amazon reviews) if I had to describe the critical sticking point in one sentence: A rational fiction is something in which /every/ character is [[https://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/level1intelligent][lvl 1 intelligent]], or "rational" as per your understanding. This includes: the guy who gave mc the cloak, the guild leader who appointed mc as a battle leader, and then kicked him out, the guy who sabotaged him, but also, the other players who are searching for ways to make money but aren't finding the MC's methods, the game makers who made an imbalanced system and built in the ability to kill people in the real world.
