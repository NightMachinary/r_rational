I was thinking about flying. Your area of control is one square foot...does this mean always 12" x 12" or can it be shifted on the fly to, e.g., 6" x 24"?

If it's always 12" x 12", then flying by blowing air into yourself isn't going to work. You'd need a force greater than that of gravity, and you'd need to apply it at your center of mass, which is about at your stomach. That amount of force on your stomach is going to do bad things to you -- to test this, try just lying on a 1 sq ft table with your hands and feet off the floor. Not very comfortable, and much less so if you want to fly at any worthwhile speed.

If you can shift this to arbitrary dimensions so long as it's not more than 144 contiguous inches, then you could make it a little better by spreading the pressure across ribs and pelvis. Probably not going to be enough to matter, though.

A better approach would be to get yourself a parasail and blow air up into it.
