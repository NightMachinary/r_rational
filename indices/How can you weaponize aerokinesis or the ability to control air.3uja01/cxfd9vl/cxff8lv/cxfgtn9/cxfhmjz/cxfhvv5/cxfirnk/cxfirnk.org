I agree on the compressed air thing, what would you do with the compressed air though, just release tons of compressed air to create an extra large blast?

No sensory powers as in there is not another "wind sense" where you can feel how compressed it is or if the air behind your back is disturbed or something. That doesn't mean you can't manipulate wind somewhere you can't see, after all you are using your mind to control wind. As such if you imagine yourself sending a gust of wind from your back then it will happen.
