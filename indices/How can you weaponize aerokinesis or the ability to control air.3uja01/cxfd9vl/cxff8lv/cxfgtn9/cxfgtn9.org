I was thinking compressed air as a power source, rather than as a discrete item (and bottles like [[http://www.cyl-tec.com/images/products/compressed-gas-cylinder.png][this]]). The problem with air control isn't that you don't have enough energy to do anything, it's that you don't have enough /power/ therefore you need to get a large amount of buildup to go into a single attack.
