Yeah, you could equip the character with all manner of compressed air-powered devices, which he or she can re-pressurize as often as needed. However since apparently the character has no sensory powers over air, presumably he or she requires direct line of sight to the air that needs to be shaped and may lack the fine control needed as well.
