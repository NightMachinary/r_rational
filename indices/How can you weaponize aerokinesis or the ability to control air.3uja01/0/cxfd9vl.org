Do you obey conservation of momentum? That is to say: when you pull some air upwards, does it push you downwards as well (as if you were holding a giant fan) or else is it independent of you (as if there was a giant fan attached to the earth, that you can control/aim)?

Assuming you can get good maximum pressures out of your power instead of just good velocities, the easiest force-multiplier would be bottles of compressed air. You only need pressure at the opening of the bottle, and you can easily charge the entire bottle instead of just the portion that's within a few inches of your skin. This could help with both making a gun and with flying, but I can't think of anything novel.
