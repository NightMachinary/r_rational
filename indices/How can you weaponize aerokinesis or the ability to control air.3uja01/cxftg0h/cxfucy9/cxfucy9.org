All good ideas though some can't be achieved in my naruto story, since the powers aren't the same. It's more like he works so hard trying to get a gun to work that he can use limited wind nature transformations without any hand seals and has limited aeromancy. The working title is "Inventions of death" so I'll probably end up doing a lot of things like this. I especially like the senbon idea to fill the same role as a cannon filled with canister shot.

I'm still not sure on cutting with pure air, according to this air is 1000 times less dense than water, you'd need some sort of media like a media blaster, as you've said.

  Of course, air is nearly 1000 times less dense than water, right? Would the jet need to be 1000 times faster than a normal industrial water jet to cut through a metal sheet? To my knowledge water jets already expel their water at a velocity exceeding the speed of sound (in air). Air moving at 100s to 1000 times its speed of sound would be... plasma?
