Yes, you can cut with air. Observe this [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crgujRcyhhE][water jet]] cutting through steel plate. Both are fluids, air is simply less dense in its natural state. You could achieve a similar effect by adding small particulate matter to the air steam (sand, metal dust ect). The particulate pieces would grind through flesh and bone. It would work in either a point of plane configuration.

Similarly if you keep dust or sand in suspension with the air in motion you can create a static charge, which is how lightning is formed. Might not be any appreciable amount of lightning though, unless you're moving the air ridiculously fast. Like, fast enough to heat it to a plasma fast.

Poison is an obvious application, especially as a ninja. Poison gas, nerve gas, caustic gas ect can be spread about the battlefield and your control of air would allow you not to be killed by these things.

Take a sphere of metal (ribbed for +her pleasure+ better fragmentation). Fill it with extremely high pressure air then throw it while hiding behind a wall or rock. It will explode like a grenade pretty much the second it leaves your zone of control as the high pressure air expands against the inside of the sphere.

Use air to hold and throw weapons. Take a tube, fill one end with an airtight sabot filled with poison senbon and the other end with compressed air. Continue to compress the air while not letting it touch the senbon. Then close the open end and release control. The air will expand and propel a hail of needles against whoever.

Get a pair of aerofoils, strap them to your back and run wind over them. Makes flying more efficient and less costly of energy.

Shoot tiny blips of air into your enemies' veins for subtle assassinations. A while later they will suffer a blood clot and possible stroke or heart attack. Use wind to empower your strikes and leaps while weakening and slowing your enemies'.

If attacked by lightning or fire create zones of low pressure air. The lightning will be unable to form a plasma arc with no matter to use and thus be unable to cross the area of higher electrical resistance. The fire will not be able to cross the windbreak with no oxygen or fuel to burn, meaning that you'll only have to deal with radiation, not convection or conduction. Deadly fire attacks will become merely hideously painful.
