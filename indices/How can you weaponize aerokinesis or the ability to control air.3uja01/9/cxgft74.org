Some questions:

- Can you control the air inside of your lungs/bloodstream? [[/u/FuguofAnotherWorld][u/FuguofAnotherWorld]] noted that you could create a low pressure zone to avoid lightning and fire, but I recall stuff about how scuba divers need to wait before surfacing because the difference in pressure means they could have air bubbles forming in their veins. I'm not too sure of the specifics/numbers concerning this, but at the very least, that technique doesn't sound like something you can use without acclimatizing yourself to it first, or without those secondary powers I mentioned.

- +When you say you can compress air to a degree, are you limited in any other way? Like only being able to exert pressure in one gross (if that's the right word to use here) direction at a time, or being able to make a personal zone around your body but not make a localized ball of compressed air right in your hand. I mention it mostly for that last bit; if you /can/ make a localized air ball, well, you won't need any additional items to help you ramp up pressure. Unless your fine control over it is lacking, I suppose.+ Forget that one, just saw your mention about "magical stamina". The maximum pressure you can create should be the same whether you use a tube or create the localized point yourself, but yeah, using a tube would save energy from having to do it from all directions.

- How does the difference in control from the area closest to your body to the outermost edge of your influence scale? The way you put that (the difference being "massive") makes it sound like it's an exponential decrease. If it's only really potent when it's right up against your skin, your wind attack will almost certainly be more effective by, say, using the whole front of your chest to emit wind rather than running the air down the length of your arm or something. (I admit, I mentioned that one more for the joke factor than anything. Have you read Mahou Sensei Negima? There's a scene where a guy named Jack Rakan uses a full-body beam that leaves an impact outlining the shape of his body on a mountainside.)

Not too sure about the gimmick you mentioned, though. I dunno about the plasma torch, but an air blade probably /would/ dissipate too quickly to be an effective ranged attack. Not much details I know of lightning, but the friction needed to generate natural lightning takes place inside huge, at-least-the-size-of-a-building clouds, doesn't it? And even if you could build up more than a static charge, you'd need something to send it in a direction that's not the ground. I don't see a way around this with /just/ wind powers, especially not with a short range. That short range hurts its combat applications a lot.

Ugh, trying to think of some exotic uses you can do with it... Since it's most effective around your body, you could camouflage yourself within churning smoke or powder and no one will be able to see your face. Great for scare tactics, maybe, but doesn't change the ultimate fact that if somebody's trying to kill you, that by itself is not going to protect you. If your control is less than perfect, it might even leave a trail of smoke or powder behind. You'll want to bring some body armor that also covers your face in there with you.

While we're on the subject - inflatable body suit. Make yourself look bigger and more muscular than you are, and you have room to hide protection underneath without anyone the wiser...well, except for your face. Though maybe an iron faceguard wouldn't look too out of place on a "big and muscular" look?

You can mute the sounds you make by creating a layer of low pressure air around yourself (note that this can be slightly different from a low-pressure /zone/). It won't be 100% silent - if you have a limit on how much pressure you can ramp up, you don't have the power to make a complete vacuum that stops all sounds - but it'll probably be quiet enough.

Also if you can maintain a low-pressure area, you'll be able to do some chemical reactions easier than they would at normal atmospheric pressure. I can't think of anything potent off-hand, though.

And I'm spent. Wind seems like it's more suited towards supporting powers than outright offensive capability, huh. I hope some of that helped.
