Follows newtons third law, my last question was a little stupid but then again there are no stupid questions.

If you were using wind only you could do things without a tube but I don't see how you can control and accelerate a projectile effectively. You would have to push wind in every direction to stabilize the bullet + generate enough force to accelerate it, and then what happens if you want to spin it to add more power? I doubt I could do the math for that much less enact it with my power. Even if I could a simple rifled tube would allow me to conserve a lot of magical stamina since all I need to do is compress air and release it into the tube. You could simply push the bullet but your aim would probably suck and it would be less powerful, it would become more like a sling at that point.

+Air by it's nature is pretty inaccurate it's not like I can put constant force upon objects directly, I'd need to basically constantly hit things with small gusts of air to keep them afloat. To even hold a bullet steady and straight in the air would take a lot of skill and concentration.+

Actually now that I think about it if I can compress air then I can hold conflicting pressures around the bullet to hold it steady, but still less accurate and less power and more stamina usage than if I used a rifled tube.
