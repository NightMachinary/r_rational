That is true, and funny that you bring up Naruto this is actually for a rational reincarnated SI naruto story that I plan on doing alongside my main project [[http://royalroadl.com/fiction/3670][Wanderlust]].

The idea is the naruto universe is much more brutal, has early medieval tech (no cameras and tvs etc like in canon) and there is no gunpowder. My SI sees that hand seals slow down the battle and take precious time to create and almost no one wears much armor so he takes to recreating bullets with seal-less wind chakra and pure chakra force.

The only problem is he's born as a poor peasant farmers son in the middle of nowhere with a next to non-existent chakra pool AND his knowledge is only useful in a general sense (knowing the theory behind S rank techniques, knowing the names of the major players etc). Things have changed drastically and people are in general not as friendly or merciful as in canon and children are actually trained to kill etc.
