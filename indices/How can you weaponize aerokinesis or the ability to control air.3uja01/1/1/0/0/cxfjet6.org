The air blade should not be overlooked; even if it's little more than a weightless, invisible knife more or less held in your hand, that's still a /weightless invisible knife that cannot be confiscated/. The advantage of a knife over another weapon is the speed with which it can be wielded due to it's low weight, and an air blade maximises that advantage and then some. Moreover, a good blade is a versatile tool outside of combat, and not having to clean, sharpen, or otherwise maintain an actual knife is all by itself a pretty friggin' neat superpower, /especially/ in a medieval setting.

The nearest approximation to this technique for which I could find a combat video was [[https://youtu.be/sipbkkTNcOQ?t=75][Kabuto's chakra scalpel]].
