  Can you really cut with air or make an air blade?
#+end_quote

I don't think you can shoot one or anything like that as a high speed line of air would have low inertia and would quickly destabilize outside of your control radius, but if your air control is fine enough you can get a sort of poor man's psychokinesis by pushing things around with air molecules. Just put all your mojo into a razor thin line of air molecules and bam, instant slice and dice. But only within your radius where you can keep exerting that pressure.

This would of course be useless just about always in your setting, because it sounds like the only way you could hope to have that much control in your setting would be to do it right in front of your hands, at which point you might as well use a knife.

  Is air useless without some sort of object (like a tube) to shape it?
#+end_quote

Can't you just shape it with your powers? I mean tubes aren't magical, they just direct the motion of the pressurized air, which your powers should presumably be able to do? I suppose that would require constant effort whereas a tube would do the heavy lifting for you.

  How exactly would you fly, by pushing down on the air or by pushing air into you?
#+end_quote

Assuming this power follows Newtons third law just pull/push air above you to below you, thus pull/pushing yourself upward.

if it doesn't follow Newtons third law just make a really big updraft below yourself. Also you can do lots of other awesome stuff if it doesn't follow Newtons third law, such as pushing your spacecraft forward by pushing the air inside it forward.
