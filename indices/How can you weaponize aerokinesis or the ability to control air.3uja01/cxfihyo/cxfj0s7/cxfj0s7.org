I'm probably going to go with the cop out of living being have innate spell resistance to prevent you pulling air out of their lungs (though you can move air inside a container if you envisioned it), though if you are within a foot of the person you can kill them through other means. I'm of the opinion that the best combatant does things from far away or by proxy and the enemy never know what hit them. Blasting around and flying on gusts of wind does give you a huge mobility advantage though.

You can get super precise with practice but a super small jet of air is going to disperse the instant it get's past your zone of control while something like hurricane force winds won't, if they are already in your range you can kill them with your air gun.

A small electric current from a device on your person and you have a plasma cutter, though I don't know the exact mechanics of it, that would seem better than a needle-thin jet of air.

And yes any gas, though all you can do is push and pull not change molecules or vibrate them or whatever.
