Ah, here's what I was looking for. Observe [[https://youtu.be/P6HXn7HdawY?t=131][this]] abrasive [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abrasive_jet_machining][jet cutting]] machine.

As for cutting with actual air? Doesn't even happen in canon. Rather if you go to chapter 317 page 17 you see that it's actually the chakra doing the cutting, it just happens to look like air.
