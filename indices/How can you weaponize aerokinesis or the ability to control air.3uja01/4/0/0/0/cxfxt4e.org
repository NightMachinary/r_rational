I see, I didn't know it was just the chakra doing the cutting, whats the point of nature transformation then? I'm still trying to hammer out what exactly chakra can do, there seems to be so much random crap that it's near impossible to get a rational magic system from it.

According to the wiki:

#+begin_quote
  Wind Release is performed by making chakra as sharp and thin as possible. Wind Release is mainly short to mid-ranged offensive techniques that combine brute force and keen precision to deal cutting and slashing damage. A rarity among the five chakra natures, wind techniques are usually performed by generating air circulation and can be enhanced through this method as well. Wind-natured chakra can also be channelled into blades to increase their cutting power and overall range.

So you transform chakra into a type of chakra wind (instead of normal wind) that can be manipulated and shaped in ways normal air cannot because of its chakra infused? I guess that makes sense, kind of. I guess it's less turning chakra into an element and more of borrowing parts of an elements properties and adding them to a chakra technique.
