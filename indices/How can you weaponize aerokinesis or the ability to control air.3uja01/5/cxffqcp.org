Do you have any sensory abilities over air, i.e. can sense fine differences in pressures within your sphere of influence, or is it just that you can exert undifferentiated force in any direction you wish on air? If so, is your sensory abilities and control fine enough to separate the different types of molecules in a gas?

Note that being able to generate winds strong enough to enable a person to fly implies a rather powerful effect. You could easily knock down people with that as wind speeds of over 8o mph around you still means very powerful gusts farther away.
