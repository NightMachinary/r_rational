I would suggest building up endurance constantly. Have them spend as much of their down time hovering on a constant updraft to train staying power.

The most likely combat strategy would probably be something of an assassin/speed blitz. Use the lower control but equal power away from their hands to fly around, much faster mobility than most combatants, while keeping a highly compressed, extremely thin band or line of air at the hands to slice arteries or tendons.
