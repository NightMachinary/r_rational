This is for a naruto fanfiction so basically lightning jutsu. I didn't expect for there to be this much interest so I didn't go into specifics, you can read one of my earlier replies to get the gist of the story. My mc won't have these powers but it's a good abstraction for future things he can do with wind chakra.
