- What do you mean by "air"? Any gas? If so, get some [[http://pipeline.corante.com/archives/2008/02/26/sand_wont_save_you_this_time.php][chlorine trifluoride]]. Maintain it in a tight ball in your zone, then push it very strongly away from you. Keep pushing, because you don't want any of that crap coming back towards you. On second thought, forget it. This idea is suicide. Amazing to watch, but suicide.
- Learn some evasion- and blocking-based martial arts, get in close, suck the air out of their lungs. Do it fast enough and you can likely tear the lung tissue but no matter what they are going straight to the ground in unheard of pain.\\
- You can get stronger, can you get more precise? Shooting a needle-thin jet of air into someone's ear doesn't require a lot of power in order to deafen them and mess up their balance. A jet to the eye could rupture the cornea, blinding them. A blast up the nose might cause an embolism.
- Can you move air that's in a container? If so, control the air that's already in their lungs.

Okay, time for bed. I may edit in more of these tomorrow.
