Sound is just vibrating air. Vibrate the air near your hands to create high intensity sound in a controlled direction. You could burst eardrums and even kill by shattering bones.

Are you able to sense changes in the air around you - it seems like a necessary secondary power required for fine control. If you can you could create ultrasonic waves and sense the echoes to see in the dark.

You should Google brown noise, but probably don't listen to it.

Do you impart energy into the air you move? Vibrate the air by your body to heat it up to harmful levels - probably not safe for the user.

Get close enough to still the air around an enemy's head. The will suffocate when the CO2 levels get to high.

Push air into a person's stomach until it explodes. Create vacuum around head/face burst ear drums and eyes.

Collect sand/dust using your control of air to create sandstorms around people. Could be used to disable vision or go as far as flying them.

A fast and dense enough jet of air could probably cut holes into people.

Change the density of air to refract light, creating visual illusions while fighting. Making it easier for the user to dodge and feint.

Stop some air in a line perfectly still. Anyone walking through it will be sliced into pieces.

Well that got pretty dark and gruesome. Controlling air is terrifying and OP even with the limits you've placed.
