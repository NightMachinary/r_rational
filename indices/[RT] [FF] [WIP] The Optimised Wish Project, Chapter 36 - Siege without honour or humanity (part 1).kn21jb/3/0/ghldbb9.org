  I wonder if the Kaioken will come up in this story, seeing as the chips are already demonstrating similar abilities. I assume the Kaioken would be learning how to do it without artificial assistance, plus or minus a few details.

The Kaioken will indeed come up, though as you say, the HEP II chips already are very much just a technological version of the same technique.

  It only just occurred to me that Bulma buying a phone here mirrors a scene from canon during the same arc, where she just built one from a box of scraps.

I didn't remember that! But let's face it, genius or not, there's no way building one from scratch can be faster than just paying for one. And time is kind of the essence here.

  One thing that bothered me in canon about late-game uses of the Solar Flare / Taiy√≥ken was how characters with well-developed alternatives to sight were still rendered useless by it (post-fusion Piccolo, complete with Kami's divine senses and Namekian hearing and ki-sense, was left grumbling for several seconds from a mere flash of light?).

It's a bit bothersome, yes, though you could argue that what it /actually/ happened was just a moment of confusion that's enough to be deciding in a hyper speed fight. After all, the anime dilates time... quite a bit.

  Did Pilaf stop using the royal We at some point, and I forgot? I noticed it was missing in this chapter.

I dropped it at some point given how his repeated humiliations and losses have necessarily downsized his ambitions a little. I made the relationship between him and Shu basically slide back to what it was before meeting Mai.
