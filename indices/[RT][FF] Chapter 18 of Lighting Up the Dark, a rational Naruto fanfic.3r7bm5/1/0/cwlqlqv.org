As a counterpoint, it could be extremely dangerous to be promoted to Chunin before you are ready, which can happen if your teammate totally carries you through the exam. Also, I feel like her's is a pretty reasonable and realistic (though perhaps not rational) emotional response to 1) seeing that your teammate doesn't respect you or trust your abilities (esp. in a domain you consider a particular strength) and 2) going through a high stress situation and probably working really hard to accomplish something and not let down your team, only to find out that nothing you did mattered. Desiring communication from your teammates is pretty reasonable.

That said, I totally get where you're coming from. HPMOR!Hermione occasionally annoyed me, and I think it was for similar reasons.
