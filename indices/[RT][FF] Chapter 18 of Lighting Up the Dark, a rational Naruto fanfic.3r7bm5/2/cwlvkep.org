Very nice. I always enjoy the cheat-to-win test in the Chunin Exams.

At first I was thinking people might deliberately write down wrong answers and "accidentally" let their opponents copy them, then they themselves simply don't hand in those sheets. Then I remembered that you don't get penalized for wrong answers, so that would just be a waste.

Ino should have used her mind control jutsu to sabotage others instead of just steal answers. She could have made them run around tearing up other people's answer sheets, which would have gotten the possessed person so many negative points they would have been out, along with their entire team, and would have ruined the ability of the attacked person to turn in answer sheets without stealing someone else's. That would have been a great way to take Gaara out -- possess Temari or her brother and get them DQ'd by sabotaging other students and then punching out an invigilator. (Also, why 'invigilator' instead of the more usual 'proctor'?)

What was the method that Shikamaru thought of but didn't use?
