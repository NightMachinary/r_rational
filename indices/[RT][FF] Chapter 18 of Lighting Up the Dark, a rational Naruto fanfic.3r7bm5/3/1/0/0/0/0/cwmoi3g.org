That turns the exam into a game of "guess the teacher's password".

Naruto already understands what the exam is /for/. It's for testing people's academic and cheating abilities. His trick proves that he has both, and does not break the exam for other people (except Sakura).

Beyond that, he has no responsibility to the examiners to complete the exam in a way that follows some unstated rules which he has to guess to succeed.

Imagine if real-life exams worked that way. "Well, you've given an answer that follows the rules we've given you, and shows us that you have sufficient knowledge of the subject to receive a passing grade. But we're going to fail you anyway because you failed to model the examiner's mind".

As one further note, having to model the examiner's mind unfairly advantages Leaf ninja, who may be more familiar with the examiners or with Leaf's approach to exams in general.
