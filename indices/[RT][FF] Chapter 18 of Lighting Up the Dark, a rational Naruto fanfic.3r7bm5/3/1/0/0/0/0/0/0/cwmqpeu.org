  All nontrivial human communication works on such unstated rules.
#+end_quote

It works on universally shared rules, such that not knowing them marks you as abnormal - "lacking social skills". There are some exam rules which we can assume to be universally shared - "write in a language the examiner can understand", for example. "Cheat using methods A, B and C, but not method Z", is in no way universally shared. In fact, it couldn't be, because as you point out, only a minority of ninja could ever use clones that way, so Naruto would never have been in a situation where he was told that using shadow clones was an exception to the list of things he was allowed to do with his ninjutsu.

  Furthermore, if this counts as a "guess" it is a guess that 99% of test-takers would automatically make.
#+end_quote

Do you have any basis for that claim? In the event, the rate was at least 1/90, as of 180 ninja at least 2 (Shikamaru and Naruto) considered it a valid strategy.

  They do. Try doing your driver's license test riding a bicycle on the grounds that the examiner forgot to tell you to use a car.
#+end_quote

That harks back to the purpose of the exam. The reason you'd fail your driver's license test on a bicycle is because riding a bicycle would not allow you to prove that you are capable of driving a car. Yes, there is an implicit rule, but that implicit rule has an obvious and explicit reason. There is no obvious and explicit reason why using your skills to successfully cheat should be penalised in an exam whose purpose is to test whether you can use your skills to successfully cheat.

  The rate of Leaf ninja who didn't use clones that way is less than 100%. The rate of non-Leaf ninja who didn't use clones that way is 100%. Empirically, this is not something that Leaf ninja have an easier time figuring out.
#+end_quote

The claim you've made is that modeling the examiner's mind is part of the test, not that guessing their attitude to clones specifically is part of the test (which would unfairly disadvantage Naruto). Presumably, you'd raise the same objection to any other activity that violated the stated rules, like stealing someone else's completed answer sheets and using an ink manipulation technique to change the printed name and seat number. If every ninja capable of breaking the rules you deem unbreakable has to model the examiner's mind, then Leaf ninja will have an unfair advantage.
