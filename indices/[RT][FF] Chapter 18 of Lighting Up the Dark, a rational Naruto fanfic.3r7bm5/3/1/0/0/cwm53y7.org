  It doesn't automatically follow from "this exam is meant to test cheating" that the exam is meant to test every single thing that could conceivably fall under "cheating".
#+end_quote

Nor is it an exam in which the examinees are told "here is a list of ways in which you can cheat; use these and no others". It's not a test of how well ninja can follow orders; we've just had one of those. It's a test of cheating ability, which includes both technical proficiency and creativity. How do you envision the examiners justifying their disqualification? "Sorry, Uzumaki, you fail the cheating test because you broke the rules too hard"?

  If Naruto decides to "cheat" by excising implicature from the language, the examiners could equally well fail him by similar reasoning
#+end_quote

They could, but that would signify a lack of "actual comprehension of the intent behind the rules". The purpose of the rules is to provide a structure within which some ninja can prove themselves better at tests/cheating than others. Even if the examiners have the power to fail someone arbitrarily using the reasoning you describe, exercising that power would undermine said purpose.
