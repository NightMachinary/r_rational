  Rather, the purpose of the exam is to test cheating ability as much as, if not more than, academic ability.

It doesn't automatically follow from "this exam is meant to test cheating" that the exam is meant to test every single thing that could conceivably fall under "cheating".

It would be one thing if Naruto sat down and actually thought "let's see, given my understanding of what the examiners are trying to do, would they accept cloning answer sheets? I believe they would". It's another thing if Naruto just acts as though of /course/ cloning answer sheets /has/ to be acceptable because he literally followed the rules and hey, who could ever complain about literally following the rules?

I run into the latter type of pedants constantly on the Internet, including on LW and SSC.

Rules. "I will now tell you /the rules/ for...."

If Naruto decides to "cheat" by excising implicature from the language, the examiners could equally well fail him by similar reasoning:

"I did not say I exhaustively listed everything that affects your score. So I'll dock you 200 points for ignoring common sense. You only /inferred/ that I described every single thing that affects your score."

"I didn't say what a 'correct' question-answer pair is. You only /inferred/ that I defined it as 'expresses correct facts' rather than 'expressed correct facts and was produced using an acceptable method'."

"I didn't describe what a 'pair' is. In particular, you only /inferred/ that two instances of the same (by information content) pair counts as two pairs."

And I run into these on the Internet constantly too.
