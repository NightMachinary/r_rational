The exam isn't about the questions, the exam is about cheating. This is very clear from the way the rules are structured, the challenge rating of the questions, and the fact that /ninja/ -- information gathering is a far more valuable skill than academics, and it is far more sensible to test that.

Sasuke and Sakura tick me off, though. It's about getting it done, guys, not about your ego.
