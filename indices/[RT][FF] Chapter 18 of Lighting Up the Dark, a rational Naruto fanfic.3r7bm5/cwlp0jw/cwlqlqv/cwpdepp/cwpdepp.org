Cheating on tests is an area of strength for Sakura?

The point isn't to get a perfect score on your questions, the point is to be in the top half. And the top half will be the people who stole answers from the bottom half and have way more answers than they were given questions.

If Sakura only perfectly answered her own questions then I doubt she would have passed the exam.
