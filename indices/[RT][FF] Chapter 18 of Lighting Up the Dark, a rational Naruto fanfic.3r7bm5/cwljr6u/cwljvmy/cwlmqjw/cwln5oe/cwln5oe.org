Ah okay, I misinterpreted a few things. First, I thought that the was able to answer the question you gave an example not only because he was smart but also because clones were a particular interest of his. Also, while I at first thought that he was using the test as an opportunity to observe his opponents, at some point I got the impression (I really can't say why) that he was using his vantage point to acquire /all/ of the question+answer combinations. This is unnecessary given his shadow clone strategy, and confused me for the reasons I mention above.
