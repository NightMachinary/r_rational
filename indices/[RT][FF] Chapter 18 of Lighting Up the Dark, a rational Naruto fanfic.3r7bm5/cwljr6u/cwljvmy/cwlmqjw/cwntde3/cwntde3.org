  Naruto doesn't need to copy anyone. If we assume that Naruto is smart enough to correctly answer his own sheet, he can just copy that 199 times.

Actually, as you get points for each correct "question answer pair", you don't even need to go that far.

Solve the easiest question. Make as many copies of that question and answer as possible within the time limit. Win. 300 copies of question 1 is worth just as many points as 30 copies of all 10 questions, and it's quicker to solve and copy.
