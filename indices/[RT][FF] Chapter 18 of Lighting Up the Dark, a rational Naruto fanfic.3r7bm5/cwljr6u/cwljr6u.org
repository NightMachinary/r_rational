If the questions are all unique, why was Sasuke blindly copying from a genin a few rows away? The text said nothing about Sasuke being able to see the genin's text to make sure they were the /right/ questions to copy.

Also, who was the Naruto-clone disguised as? The only blonde females I can think of would be female-naruto or Temari. Or was he just disguised as a random blonde ninja?
