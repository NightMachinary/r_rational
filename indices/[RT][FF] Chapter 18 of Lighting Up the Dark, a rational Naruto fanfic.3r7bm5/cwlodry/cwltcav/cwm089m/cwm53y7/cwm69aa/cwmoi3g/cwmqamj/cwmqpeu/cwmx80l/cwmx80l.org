  Presumably, you'd raise the same objection to any other activity that violated the stated rules

It's your story. When violating the stated rules violates the implicit rules, and how narrow or wide the implicit rules are, depends purely on your say-so. I can't really object on the grounds that Naruto went against the examiners' implicit desires when he obviously didn't.

However, for Naruto to win on that basis would have to mean that he sat down and thought "judging from what the examiners seem to want, I believe that using clones this way falls within the parameters they would consider acceptable". (And it wouldn't be a "guess"; assessing what one's opponents are likely to do is a skill, not the equivalent of guessing a password.)

What it would /not/ mean is that Naruto thinks his solution /has/ to work because anyone can see that he didn't break any explicit rules, and as long as you don't break any explicit rules, other people are automatically obliged to accept what you did. There are lots of people like that on the quasi-real-life that is the Internet, and Naruto pattern-matches to them far more strongly than he does to a specialist who figured out that the implicit rules are particularly loose just this one time.

  If every ninja capable of breaking the rules you deem unbreakable has to model the examiner's mind, then Leaf ninja will have an unfair advantage.

By that reasoning even if the test just involved Naruto fighting the Leaf ninja, he'd have an unfair advantage.
