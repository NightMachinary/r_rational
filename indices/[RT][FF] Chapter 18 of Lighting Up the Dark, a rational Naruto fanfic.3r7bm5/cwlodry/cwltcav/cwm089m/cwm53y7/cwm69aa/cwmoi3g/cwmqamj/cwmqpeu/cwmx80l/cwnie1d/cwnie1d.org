There were three foreseeable outcomes of the "Cloned Sheet Strategy":

- Examiner goes along
- Examiner disqualifies you
- Examiner pops the clones

One is advantageous, one is neutral and one is disadvantageous. Statistics says he should go with it.

Furthermore, exam could as well have had written "Let's see how well you cheat" on the metaphorical forehead. Cheating is promoted, getting caught is not, and this is because in the life of a ninja, cheating is success, getting caught is torture and death.

This said, there is a last thing to take into consideration. If you give the results of your cheating to a favourable party (as in, one taking the role of a Kage) they will commend you for your cheating. If you give them to an objecting party they will punish you.

So the examiner will either favour you or fail you, depending on their antagonism. In terms of decision theory, this is a fifty/fifty scenario.

Naruto has chosen to be an optimist, and in doing so has taken a risk that might have been avoided.

But this risk was taken against high odds of defeat, so I guess that all in all is a viable choice.

I hope this is clear.
