Examiners: "The rules require that you write the question and answer on the answer sheets. Answer sheets were described as being, and I quote, 'in front of you' at the start of the test. Since your clones were not in front of you at that moment, clones are not considered answer sheets and all answers given on clones disguised as answer sheets are disqualified. Also, you seem to have created the clones with pre-written answers, violating the rule that you write the question and answer, so you'd have been disqualified on that basis alone".

Or even more simply: "Ninjas are expected to understand orders, not blindly follow their literal words. Cloning yourself into answer sheets may fit the literal words of the rules, but clearly doesn't indicate actual comprehension of the intent behind them. Disqualified."

This chapter is bothersome because it seems to use the geek fallacy of "what I did is what you literally asked for, so you have nothing to complain about" thinking the world works like a computer program. There may be one or two cases, such as with bureaucracies, where you can get away with it, but it usually fails miserably; in the real world it just gets you marked as a smartass. Naruto here is like the person who sees items on sale for 0.50 cents and tries to buy 200 of them for a dollar, even though context makes it obvious that someone meant $0.50 and just didn't write it down properly.
