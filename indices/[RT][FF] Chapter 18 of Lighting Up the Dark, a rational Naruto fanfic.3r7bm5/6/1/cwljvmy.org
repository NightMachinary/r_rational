It doesn't matter whether they are the "right questions" since you get points for any correct "question number" + "answer" pair. What I'm more concerned about is confirming that the copied answers are correct. I'm not sure how Naruto managed to get every question right since the questions were stated to be so difficult. You would expect some incorrect answers to be passed around, and Naruto would need to know the answers himself to either correct these responses or choose between various options. Maybe as questions are collected by better cheaters, answers are corrected (since being better at answering questions and being better at cheated are probably correlated), but this process wouldn't be perfect. (Edit: I was confused.)

Also, even if Sasuke did need answers to his specific questions, he could just blindly copy random people who seem to be writing a lot and erase/cross out any useless info.
