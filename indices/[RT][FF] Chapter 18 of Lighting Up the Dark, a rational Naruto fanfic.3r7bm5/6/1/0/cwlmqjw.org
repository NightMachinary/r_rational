Naruto doesn't need to copy anyone. If we assume that Naruto is smart enough to correctly answer his own sheet, he can just copy that 199 times.

Alternatively, he can just dispel the clones he's put on the ceiling, which have a bird's eye view of the classroom. Between them, they have to get enough data to raise his number of correct questions to 10.
