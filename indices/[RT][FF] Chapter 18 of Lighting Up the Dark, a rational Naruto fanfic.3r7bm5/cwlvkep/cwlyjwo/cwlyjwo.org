I think if Ino had been so blatant in her use of her abilities, the invigilators would have officially spotted them, at which point she'd risk being penalised for every individual thing she did through a possessed body. In the event, she did do some sabotage - as we see from Shikamaru's instruction - but sparsely and only as applied to specific targets.

I don't really know which is more common of "invigilator" and "proctor" - I heard both while at university - so I went with the one I felt sounded better.

diraniola is right about Shikamaru's method, although it would have required certain adjustments, since Shikamaru doesn't use shadow clones and doing it by hand is a bad idea for multiple reasons.
