Surely the winning strategy is still what Naruto did, namely:

a) Strongly distinguish himself from the other examinees in the examiners' minds (because they'll need /some/ criteria if they only want to pass half the group)

b) Gather as much information as possible to aid in future stages of the exam

Also, nice one.
