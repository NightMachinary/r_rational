Angband (and most variants) uses AUs for gold; IIRC intended to have a literal meaning: 'AU', and a pun meaning: 'Au'. Until weight was abolished (hurrah!), DCSS was using AUMs for weight.

That's actually all I could think of offhand. I guess Angband's usage of au really stuck in my mind for some reason. EDIT: yes, and AUTs like nifboy mentions.
