Came here to say this.

Rule of Three only applies to conflicts between named. As none of the Drow are Named in a traditional sense, this shouldn't apply.

Even if it did, I can't help but think that Rumena will be of the Black school of 'how to cheat the Rule of Three', even without /trying/. Body doubles are sort of his thing.
