As expected, the second part of the plan is to bait the Tyrant into attacking because a quick battle doesn't suit his goals, whatever they are. Cat thinks he needs leverage in order to negotiate something out of Cordelia, and a total victory for the Grand Alliance won't give him that.

But this isn't the end of the plan. Catherine, and presumably the rest of the Wild Hunt, aren't present in either location, so she's off doing something else. Are we still sure that this battle is the Prince's Graveyard? If so, then some more princes need to die, either at Kairos's hand or as a side effect of whatever Cat is doing, but I doubt she'll attack the, directly because, like Pilgrim said, a false surrender would backfire tremendously for a villain. However, maybe she can cause a civil war amongst the Grand Alliance between Levant and Procer--maybe the Procer troops won't follow Pilgrim's acceptance of surrender, or maybe there will be a difference in opinion on what to do with the POWs.
