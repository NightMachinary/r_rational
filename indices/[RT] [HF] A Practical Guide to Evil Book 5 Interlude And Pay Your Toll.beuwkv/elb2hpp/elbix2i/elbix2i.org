If he was sure he would be scheming to kill her, what he's trying to do here is making a weapon that he could use to kill her later. He's pretty explicit about the fact that, if he lets this opportunity slip, he's not going to be able to handle her if she goes all "hidden horror".

He's Above's main fixer and there's an evil queen who he failed to redeem and is growing out of his ability to handle, the possibility of her turning into a monster is there and if he doesn't set up the possibility to bring her down now then he's leaving the fate of the world up to chance.
