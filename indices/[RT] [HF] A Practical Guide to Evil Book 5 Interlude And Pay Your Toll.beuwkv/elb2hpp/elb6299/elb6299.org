The Pilgrim knows the first part of her trajectory in broad strokes. She went from an unknown to the Squire, to the commander of a legion of terror, to the queen of an evil aligned country. Then, he meets her in the battlefield and he sees a broken girl, filled with the full might of the fae's winter and, like the Dead king said, on the brink of ascending. Then, she goes off the grid just to return with a army's worth of horrors from the everdark and literal goddesses of Evil on her shoulders.

If it was me, I wouldn't be optimistic either.
