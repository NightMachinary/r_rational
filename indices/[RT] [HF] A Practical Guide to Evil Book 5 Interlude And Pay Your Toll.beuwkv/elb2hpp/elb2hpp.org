How can Peregrine be so sure Cat is destined to become like the Dead King unless he stops her, "Catherine Foundling had given the slip to every story that could bind her to an ending, and so left herself only one path: reign eternal, consumed and consuming, a herald of long prices and hard measures having made mantle of the woes of Creation."

Yet the Wandering Bard writes her off like she's on a suicide trajectory? I wonder if what WB has said to other characters about Cat is not true. Maybe she's guiding Cat along while making up excuses for why she doesn't finish Cat off.
