Probably fresh army v exhausted ones, the risk of the newly rescued villainous army starting to fight again with a broken pattern of 3. Since she seems to have actually meant it (surrender), if anyone attacks the Tyrant she could come to his rescue to slip out of the 'false surrender' narrative. Nobody is fighting, the threat is implicit, and the peace conference to add terms to that unconditional surrender to take some weight off whatever Kairos has planned for later.
