That could be. It could certainly explain Tariq's side of my question.

I still doubt Bard though. Bard can be wrong (Tyrant) but she's very good. Somehow she is consistently wrong about Cat. She is also apparently involved in setting up a lot of what's happening now, probably influencing the Auger (very important to the current story because the Auger is the reason they are not letting the Legion leave, causing this whole mess) and setting Black on a path to survival. Cat plays a central role in both of these stories, so Bard is able to predict Cat's behavior this well yet still get's her trajectory totally wrong? It's suspicious.
