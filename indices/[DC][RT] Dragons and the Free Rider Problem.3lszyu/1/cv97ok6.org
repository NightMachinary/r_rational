I love these things. But I still think it would be highly rational of dragons who want to hoard various metal gegaws and sleep on them to go into the lucrative business of backing a kingdom's money with their hoards.

It's a win win situation for both.

The dragon is given 'tribute' and all it has to give up is some form of authenticated but ultimately worthless legal papers.

The dragon gets what it wants (and as a further cost there are also sheep and what have you) and the country gets to boast that it's gold is protected by a dragon and increase trust in their currency.
