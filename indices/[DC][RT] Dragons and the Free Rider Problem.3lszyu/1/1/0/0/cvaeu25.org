Precisely, in my head canon I usually find dragons are very well modeled as effectively corporations. And in this model the dragon is acting as a central bank.

Loans, with interest to be paid either in labor, precious metals or fungible goods like sheep.

Pretty much dragons have the OPPOSITE effect on lands and kingdoms from what you'd expect. They increase and vitalize economies with their demands.

But they also are terrible monsters as well.
