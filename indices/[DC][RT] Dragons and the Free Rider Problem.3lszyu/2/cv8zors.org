*tl;dr:*

A village is under threat from a large dragon that's decided to settle in some nearby hills. The mayor asks for help from the duke, but the duke does a cost-benefit analysis and decides it isn't worth the trouble:

  The Duke made quick calculations about politics, forces, money, and how many of his expensive men the dragon would eat. Most of his dragon-slaying mounted forces were relatives. The Duke needed them should the King decide to do something random and Kingly. Having all his relatives dead by dragon was a good way to lose his hereditary Dukedom to his next-door peers. And the Duke said to the young [Mayor], ["]What you need, son, is some Murder Hobos.["]

The mayor asks for money from the villagers to hire some adventurers, but the people in each class (serfs, free peasants, and rich landholders/merchants) don't want to pay:

- The richer ones don't want to waste money on protecting the more numerous but obviously-inferior poorer people; and
- The poorer ones don't want to waste money on protecting the assets of richer people when the results won't trickle down to them.

  The [Mayor] had a choice: he could go around the mess, go to the Transmuter Bankers and take out a loan and put his village up at collateral, or try to incentivize the peasants to help pay voluntarily. He decided to try to incentivize the villagers first. He needed to recast the problem as a threat to privately owned goods to get everyone in his village to pay what they could for Murder Hobos to remove the dragon.

With his own money, the mayor hires a bard as an advisor. The bard orchestrates a scheme to lure the dragon down into the village's outskirts and scare /everybody/ into paying the money for the adventurers, who kill the dragon.
