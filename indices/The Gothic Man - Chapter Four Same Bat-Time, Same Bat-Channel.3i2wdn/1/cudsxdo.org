So, five intended avenues we have to pursue.

1. Getting loyal minions to gather information, fight major criminals. Exorcists? Veterans? Metahumans? Spies? People to watch Strange? A public works program?

2. Teching up. Radio tech. Disease curing tech. Enhanced armor. Lead in the environment. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/373fv6/ff_the_gothic_man_chapter_two_limiting_resource/crkoi78]] we're rich, we have science, we need the tech advantage over our enemies.

3. Alliances with potent decision makers. Strange, Mr Dent, mayors, police chiefs. They can sway lots of people, and with our money and charm we can buy a lot of influence, and press anti corruption reforms.

4. Buildings of great utility. Hospitals, women's health clinics, radio towers, hair dressers. We need more information, to cure people, to win people to our cause.

5. [[http://www.northyorkshire.police.uk/tenprinciples]] ideas and philosophies we can spread across the city to make it a little bit harder to do crimes and be bad.

6. A power ring.
