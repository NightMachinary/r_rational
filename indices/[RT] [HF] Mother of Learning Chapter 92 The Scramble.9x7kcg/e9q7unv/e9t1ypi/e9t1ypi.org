Would be funny if RR was Silverlake, so now there's THREE Silverlakes running around, RR, Endgame!Silverlake and OG!Silverlake.

RR is probably someone we knew about relatively early on, but didn't meet until after RR left the loop. Silverlake fits this bill, but so do Daimen, Zorian's Dad, and probably more I'm not thinking of.

It would be bullshit if it was Benisek, since he was relatively consistent across the original restarts and AFAIK RR didn't really know who Zorian was until later.
