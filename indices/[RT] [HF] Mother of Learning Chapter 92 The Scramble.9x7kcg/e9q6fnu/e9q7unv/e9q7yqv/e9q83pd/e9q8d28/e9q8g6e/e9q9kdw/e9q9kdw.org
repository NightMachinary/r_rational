he was there for decades. i guess he was aware of the time loop pretty early (in the first 10 restarts) and destroyed zach before he could do anything.

we have a false impression of him because the only time we have seen him, he was bragging and being careless. He was also not very strong in unstructured mind magic (he could be really good at the structured one,using actual spells). And zach could defeat him in a fair fight (given the huge mana reserve and the overspecialisation of zach, that was not representative of RR strenght)
