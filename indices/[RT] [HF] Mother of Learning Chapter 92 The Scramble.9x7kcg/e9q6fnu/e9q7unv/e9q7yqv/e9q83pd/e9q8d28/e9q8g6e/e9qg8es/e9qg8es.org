I'm not certain the loop existed that long. If it did, it's a near thing. Zach's original statement about the length of the loop was "at least 200 times". Mind you Zach tends to die early so that's not equivalent to "at least 200 months." We've seen Zach throw away dozens of cycles, sometimes even on the first day of the cycle. Before he learns what a mistake that is.
