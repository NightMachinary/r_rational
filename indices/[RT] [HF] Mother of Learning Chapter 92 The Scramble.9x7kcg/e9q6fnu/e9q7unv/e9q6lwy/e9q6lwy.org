Real time starts!

Alanic and Xvim etc should be safe, since SL isn't strong enough to kill them, and RR doesn't know they exist or are important. Also, I'm honestly scared about Kirielle. The don't forget me dialogue back in Ch 54 (or 53 or something), and now the decision to take her to Cyoria.... Tension.

Also, the aranea scene seemed rushed but the ending comment to the aranea was so SO on point :D
