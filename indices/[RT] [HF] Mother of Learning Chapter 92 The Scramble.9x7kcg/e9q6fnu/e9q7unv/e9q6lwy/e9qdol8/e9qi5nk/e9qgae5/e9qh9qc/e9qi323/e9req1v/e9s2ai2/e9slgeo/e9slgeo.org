best thing he could do is gate her to Damien as soon as he talk to those spiders, nobody else would be able to get there soon enough to threaten her within the time period.

SL can't since she can't use simulacra since they'd fight her to stay alive, QL could in theory but i doubt he'd listen to anyone soon enough that thought kidnapping her was a good reason for him to TP jump across those islands just to capture a girl of questionable value.
