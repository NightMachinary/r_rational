It's not a clearly rational decision to leave Kirielle in a small town where she could be attacked.

He can just move her to a safehouse in a larger, more hard to search place and she'll be safer from SL, who can't clone herself to find her.

Someone will be hiding away with the mana stabilizer for 3 or so days, bringing his sister along to entertain himself doesn't have much cost. Might make more sense for Zach to do guard duty, one of his simulcra can guard stabilizer Zorian while he gets stuff done.
