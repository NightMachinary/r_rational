Regarding 3, I seriously doubt Panaxeth's contract is so easy to bypass. After all, both RR and Silverlake are soul mages and have literally perfect vessels for possession in the real world; it would be the height of stupidity if the primordial didn't take that into account.

Silverlake isn't a fighter, so I don't think we will see her in combat unless she's desperate. Considering her paranoia, she wouldn't contact QI either; at best she will feed Red Robe the updated intel she has on their common enemy.

If I was her, while everything was going down with the aranea and Zach, I would be stealing the Sovereign Gate. Why? To prepare the ritual all by herself. She is great at dimensionalism and knows more about the primordial prison than Z&Z. She can likely do a better job than the cultists, who she has little way of trusting or influencing.
