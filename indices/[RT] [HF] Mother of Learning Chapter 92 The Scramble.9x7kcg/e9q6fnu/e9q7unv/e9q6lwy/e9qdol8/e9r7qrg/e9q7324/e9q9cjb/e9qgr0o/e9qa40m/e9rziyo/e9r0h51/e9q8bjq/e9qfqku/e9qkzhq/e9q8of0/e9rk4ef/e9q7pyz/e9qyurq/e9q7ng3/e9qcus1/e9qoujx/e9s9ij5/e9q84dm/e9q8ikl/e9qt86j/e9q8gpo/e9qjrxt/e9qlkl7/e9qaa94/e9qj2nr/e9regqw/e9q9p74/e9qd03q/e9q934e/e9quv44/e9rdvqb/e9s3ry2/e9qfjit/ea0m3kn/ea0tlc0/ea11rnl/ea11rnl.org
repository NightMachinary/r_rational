One: Zorian still had the same mana signature, so any change from Zach likely wouldn't have a big impact on their ability to share mana.

Two: Original Zorian would certainly have had enough of a shock, I would think, to get him out of his comfort zone. Being self motivated is fine.

Three: Zorian was fine with the idea of leaving his family and going independent. He wouldn't miss anyone but Kirielle, and if he knew that loop!Zorian was taking good care of her, I expect he'd be fine on that front too.

Four: Living as a golem probably wouldn't be too terrible. They're strong, durable, and by now I gather they can be pretty lifelike. Since the alternative is for him to die - if not at the start of the month, then at the end of it - I don't see this as "stealing everything" but rather helping him to retain something. And it's not as though loop!Zorian has nothing to compensate him with.

Five: Loop!Zorian has pretty much hit the limits of his mana reserve growth. Original!Zorian isn't nearly there yet, but once he's grown, that basically doubles their pool, which means twice as many simulacra. That's pretty valuable.

Six: Given good enough evidence and good enough reasons, I think I'd accept those things instead of a quick death.

For that matter, it might even have been possible, in the longer term (post primordial), for loop!Zorian to move out into a golem and put original!Zorian back in his body. Alanic could probably have found a way.
