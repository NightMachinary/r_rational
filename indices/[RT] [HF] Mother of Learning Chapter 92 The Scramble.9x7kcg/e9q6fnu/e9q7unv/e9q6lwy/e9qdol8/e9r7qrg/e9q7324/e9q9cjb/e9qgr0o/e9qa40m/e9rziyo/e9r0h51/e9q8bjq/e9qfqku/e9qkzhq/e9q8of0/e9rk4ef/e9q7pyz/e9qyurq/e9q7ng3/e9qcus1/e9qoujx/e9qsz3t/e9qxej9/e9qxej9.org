It is not. It is linked to the soul. However when RR was looping with modified temporary marker it was either QI and Pan who modified that marker. It somewhat likely that Pan is both Flesh and Soul warper - so it might be able to modify a soul somewhat - to increase mana capacity or some ability.

And there might be some body-soul level interaction which could influence those things.

It's a wild guess. Not too likely. Either way, increased mana pool would need some time for Silverlake to retrain herself - some of the spells would be harder to cast. And for mind magic she would need a lot of training (which she might be able to do somewhere in background as well to increase her chances - like kidnap some arranea and practice on them).
