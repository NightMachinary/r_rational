Wait, doesn't Zack meeting up with Silver lake in the loop mean Veyers probably isn't RR? Veyers was soulkilled in the loop, which they took to mean that his exiting messed with the template used to recreate the loop each iteration. If Silverlake survived in the loop, then unless the specific way he achieved permanence soulkilled his template upon exit, then Veyers probably isn't RR. RR obviously wouldn't be able to soulkill himself while in the loop, and no one would have the ability or motive to soulkill Veyers once he left.

Zack should make some simulacra immediately. Since only his body is damaged, the simulacra won't be hindered, so it would be fairly close to having Zack be at full effectiveness.

Also, thing that either I'm not understanding or is a mistake: Zorian said he could sustain 4 simulacra in his hometown (I'm assuming his proficiency with the spell has improved so that he can now sustain another copy with his regen). The whole point of locating Cyoria on the Hole is that it's a massive mana well, meaning mages regenerate mana faster. The author has said elsewhere that the regen is substantial, although I don't remember the numbers. Shouldn't he be able to sustain more simulacra when he is able to absorb mana from the Hole?
