to your second point if we were to entertain the theory that Damien were RR then he'd have been in the time loop, and he's a resourceful guy who is famous, a natural mind mage and would have a primordial on his side, i wouldn't put much past him at that point especially not figuring out the gates since iirc he took to dimensional magic that Zorian taught him pretty darn quick.
