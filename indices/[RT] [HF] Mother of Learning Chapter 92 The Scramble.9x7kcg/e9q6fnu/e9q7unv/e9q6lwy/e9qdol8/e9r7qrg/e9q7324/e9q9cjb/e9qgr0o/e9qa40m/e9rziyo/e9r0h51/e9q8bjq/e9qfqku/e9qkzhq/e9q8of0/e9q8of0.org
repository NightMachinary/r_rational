So did Zach catch that Zorian left the loop successfully ir did he live the rest of the time thinking that Zorian was killed and erased by the Guardian? Must have been hell on for him if it's the second.

Apparently RR devised a method to wake up early. I'm actually surprized Zach didn't.

Protect Kiri well, Zorian!
