This is actually my pet theory--Silverlake met up with her previous self and successfully convinced her to cooperate before Zorian showed. Then, original!SL (or a simulacra, if making friends with her alternate self finally teaches her the right mindset for it lololol) pretends to not know anything when talking to Zorian as a test to see if Zorian would try to kill/attack her to see if his "nice guy" act was all for show in the end. I expect both Silverlakes to secretly spend the whole month getting the death seal off Pana!SL and show up either at the climax or an especially opportune moment to fuck over RR while smugly rubbing it in ZZ's faces that they actually thought she would help the primordial.
