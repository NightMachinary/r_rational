I'm not sure it's been explicitly stated in the story, but they say their magnitude from before they started training for it. Their mana reserves consistently plateau at about 4 times their initial mana, so it makes sense for them to compare that number. Because of how shaping impacts spell cost, it would be hard to reliably measure a mature mage's mana capacity quantitatively.
