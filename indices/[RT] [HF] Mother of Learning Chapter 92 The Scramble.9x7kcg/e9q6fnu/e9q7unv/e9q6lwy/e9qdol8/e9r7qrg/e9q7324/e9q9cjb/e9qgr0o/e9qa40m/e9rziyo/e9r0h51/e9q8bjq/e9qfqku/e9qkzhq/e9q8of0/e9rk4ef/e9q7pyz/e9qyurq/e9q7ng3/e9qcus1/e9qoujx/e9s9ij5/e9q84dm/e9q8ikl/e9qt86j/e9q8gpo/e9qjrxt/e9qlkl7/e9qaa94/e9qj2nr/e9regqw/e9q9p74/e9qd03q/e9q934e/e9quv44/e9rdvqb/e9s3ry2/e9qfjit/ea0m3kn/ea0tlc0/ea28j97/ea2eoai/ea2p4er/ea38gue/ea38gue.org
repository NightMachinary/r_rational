this was in response to SearchAtlantis's statement about experiences making them the same person. not with regards to teaching. skill at magic can't be taught via memory anyways since that's soul related

right. though they didn't go in-depth into how far they got that so leave the question of discomfort out. do you remember where they mentioned simulacrum being able to sleep?

there's still just basic need of eating. while a burden of life, it's still very much a part of living and makes a difference in how it is experienced and lived.

also in regards to your response directly to SearchAtlantis: they meant the opportunity to use original Zorian as a mana battery was a choice that loop Zorian missed out on and is the amoral action. meanwhile, presenting original Zorian choice of death or golem life is also a false choice forced upon him and thus also potentially amoral, or at least a gray area and hence they said "more ethically acceptable". but that's a whole big philosophical debate (in similar vein to euthanasia)
