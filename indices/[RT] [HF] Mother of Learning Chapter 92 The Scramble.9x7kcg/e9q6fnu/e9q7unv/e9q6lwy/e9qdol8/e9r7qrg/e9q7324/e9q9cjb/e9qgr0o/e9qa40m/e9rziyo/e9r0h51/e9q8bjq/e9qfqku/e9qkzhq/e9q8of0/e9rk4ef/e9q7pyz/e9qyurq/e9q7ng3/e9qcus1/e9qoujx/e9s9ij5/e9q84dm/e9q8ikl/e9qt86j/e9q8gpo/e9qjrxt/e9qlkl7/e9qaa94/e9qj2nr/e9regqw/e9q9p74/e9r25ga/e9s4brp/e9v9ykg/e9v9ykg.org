If it had been anyone except Silverlake, I'd be inclined to think they accepted just to have one more month to live, with the intention of dying at the end to keep Panaxeth contained. But Silverlake is selfish enough and morally lacking enough that I don't think she'd be willing to make that kind of self-sacrifice.
