i want it to be the academy's principal - there's surprisingly no interaction with him which is strange as i would imagine he's a fairly competent mage to have attained the position. zach would definitely have tried to convince him. it is possible the principal is away or something but it would be strange because of the merry-making that is going to happen due to planetary alignment.

also, this would certainly explain why RR had the ability to subvert all the academy's wards neatly (although this could just be from years of being in the time loop) and explain the robe itself: many of the order of the celestial dragon were highly placed mages in the city.

this would make veyers sort of a red herring which is pretty funny. veyers might have been soul killed for annoying the principal about trying to get back into the academy and taken out just for that. (doesn't explain why he would bother putting effort into helping him the real world though)

finally, it could explain the cranium rats (as RR was a mind mage). it was mentioned that there were several swarms around the principal's office. what if it wasn't to spy on him but because that's where the swarms' leader/handler was?

the biggest flaw of this theory, however, is that zorian didn't mention the principal when he found out who the leaders of the order of the celestial dragon were. if anything, zorian mentioning the mage's guild leader makes him a suspect for similar reasons (zach would have tried to recruit him in the past as he is a strong mage but is little mentioned until finding out he is part of the order of the celestial dragon, explains how he has his signature robes so quickly at the start of a restart as well as why veyers was soul-killed if that is how he initially was introduced to zach, he would probably know the academy's ward scheme as the highest ranking mage official in the city), but it just doesn't feel as clean.

edit: veyers explanation, some extra reasons why RR is actually probably the mage's guild leader and some wording.
