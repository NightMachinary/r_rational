The Death Curse is specifically mentioned as being attached to the new body that Panaxeth creates, /not/ the soul. So if she, an experienced soul mage, can get her soul into a new body, she should be fine.

Her younger self has a body that's a near-perfect fit to her soul. Which implies that she's either already done as Zorian did and evicted her younger self's soul (and merely acted like she didn't know what was going on when they came knocking), or she has a different plan in mind.
