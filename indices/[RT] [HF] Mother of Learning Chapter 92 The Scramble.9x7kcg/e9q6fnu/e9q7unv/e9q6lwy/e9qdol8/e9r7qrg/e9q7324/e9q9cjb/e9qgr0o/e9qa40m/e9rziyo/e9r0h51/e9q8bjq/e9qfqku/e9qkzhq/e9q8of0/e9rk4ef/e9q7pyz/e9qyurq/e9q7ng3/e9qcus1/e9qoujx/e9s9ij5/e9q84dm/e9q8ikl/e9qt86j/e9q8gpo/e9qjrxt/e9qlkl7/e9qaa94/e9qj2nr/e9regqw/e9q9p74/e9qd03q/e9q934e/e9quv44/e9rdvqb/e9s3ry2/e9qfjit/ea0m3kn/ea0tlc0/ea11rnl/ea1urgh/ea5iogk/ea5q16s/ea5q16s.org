I haven't forgotten that there's a reasonably verified afterlife, but I figure that the original Zorian can always suicide if he really believes that that's a better option than golem life. So long as he's not being compelled to stay alive against his will, it's a non issue.

I suppose, if loop!Zorian would need to stick him in a soul jar for years while sorting out a golem for him, then there would be a stronger case for letting him pass on. But it really shouldn't take that long.
