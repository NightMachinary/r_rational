Well, body/soul are very closely related.

Yes, the stuff I'm talking about is related to both soul and body. But the soul is a battery of sort, which powers up various abilities. The bloodline ability is like external item which is being plugged into the soul.

It is impossible to understand bloodlines/abilities without understanding the soul.

If Pan can warp the body in any way, it has to possess the ability to make sure that this new body is compatible with the soul.

Also it is possible to have more than one bloodline. (albeit with limited success). Suldomir - owner of soul well - tried to merge dragon/troll something else and got it working in the weird fashion.

As a fleshwarper, Pan should have an intimate understanding how those abilities function. It should be possible for him to extract/plug in several such abilities on request.

So the dream Silvelator might have:

Dragon-shifting abilities. (At at least dragonoid body). With Silverlakes paranoia/strive for survival the body should be as touch as possible.

If dragon is lacking regeneration for survival, why not thrown in capability of salamander to regenerate as additional bloodline.

I'm pretty sure in the whole world there would be an ability which would increase mana pool. Let's say some sort of weird whale which uses mana to gather plankton and feed on it. The larger mana pool, the more plankton it can gather. Anyway, the point is that if you start to imagine any abilities, there could be one which would actually increase mana pool.

So with such ability available, one could add several more abilities which would complement Silverlakes abilities.

She's a very powerful soul mage (even Kael had a book on soul magic). She easily detected simulacrum attached to golem frame. So if she had additional soul ability from soul flower which almost got duo killed or the ability from monster which killed Zorian just by looking at him, she would gain ability to just slaughter anyone without soul awarines/defense.

She's dimensional special as well. So something like Zach/Zorian were using to improve their abilities - it would allow her easier to break into dimensional prison/release Pan.

Add innate ability of aranea - she would have another card to be used - but it's more long term plan, but there might be some additional tricks here as well for Silverlake.

What I'm trying to tell - Silverlake could have asked for something like this from Pan and as I said - since it's plethora of new abilities, she's just trying/testing her new abilities to be comfortable in her new body.

The bottom line, there's gotta be a nasty surprise from Silverlake. Why not Silverator - OP - mode enemy :)
