Just wanted to update and memorialize my predictions for red robe (in order of likelihood):

1. Damien - I think it would be very well foreshadowed if this was the case. Some examples: he's a latent mind mage and Zach was mind raped, Panaxeth did not even bother offering him a deal because Damien is already his agent(or possibly panaxeth intimated to Damien that he was already the agent, neatly explaining Damien's uncharacteristic resolve in ch. 91), and finally, remember that anyone trying to collect all the artifacts would almost necessarily come into contact with Damien. From the very beginning of the story Damien was built up a lot as a famous explorer/treasure hunter, that is exactly the kind of person you would give a temp marker to if you were trying to collect the keys to the Sovereign Gate. And it would even be kind of ironic given that without his sacrifice in ch. 91 Zorian could not have escaped the loop.

2. Zach's rebellious simulacrum(or some other kind of Zach doppelganger) - There is not much evidence, other than some stories of rebellious simulacrums and the unfired zach mind rape chekov's gun, so mostly a pet theory. It would be interesting though.

3. One of the female classmates - Goes along with the 'Zach was evil/powermad and mind raped into being good' theory. Would square in with the Veyers thing also, make it not a red herring (maybe Zach soul killed Veyers and this caused RR to rebel?). It would be dramatic, but not very satisfying.

Anyone have any off the wall theories?
