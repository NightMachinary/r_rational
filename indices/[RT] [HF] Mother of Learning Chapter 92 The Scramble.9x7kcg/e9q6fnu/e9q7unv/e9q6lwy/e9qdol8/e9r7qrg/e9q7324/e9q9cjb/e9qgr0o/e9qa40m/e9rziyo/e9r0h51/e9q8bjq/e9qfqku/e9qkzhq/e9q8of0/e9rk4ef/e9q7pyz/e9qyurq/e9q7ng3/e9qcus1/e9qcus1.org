Just one nagging question. At the very start, with the tunneler toad ability, it says "His body may have been perfectly matched to his soul, but it wasn't the body to which he had anchored the ability to." But hasn't he had the tunneler toad ability for multiple restarts now, and at each one getting his body destroyed, a new one made, and the soul transferred over? Did I miss something?

But aside from that, great chapter, of course, as always! It's good to see the aranea alive again, and despite the irrationality of it, I'm glad he's keeping his promise to Kirielle and taking her to Cyoria.
