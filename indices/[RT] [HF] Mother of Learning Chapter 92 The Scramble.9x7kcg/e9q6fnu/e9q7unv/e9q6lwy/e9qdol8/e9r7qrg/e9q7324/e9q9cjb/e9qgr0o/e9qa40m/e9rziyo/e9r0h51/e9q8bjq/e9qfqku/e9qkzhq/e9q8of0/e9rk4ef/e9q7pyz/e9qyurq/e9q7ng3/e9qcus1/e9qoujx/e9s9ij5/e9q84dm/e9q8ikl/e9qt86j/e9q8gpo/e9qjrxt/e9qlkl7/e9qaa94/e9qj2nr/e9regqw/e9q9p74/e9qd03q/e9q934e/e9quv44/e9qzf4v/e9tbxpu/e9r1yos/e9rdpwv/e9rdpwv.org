The royal family had used the gate in the past. We don't know the mechanism of turning it on, however we do know that the physical gate was not in possession of Zach when the loop began, so he could not have triggered it. Combine that with the fact that Zach received a divine blessing to increase his rate of mana production, and it looks likely that one of the angels initiated all of this.
