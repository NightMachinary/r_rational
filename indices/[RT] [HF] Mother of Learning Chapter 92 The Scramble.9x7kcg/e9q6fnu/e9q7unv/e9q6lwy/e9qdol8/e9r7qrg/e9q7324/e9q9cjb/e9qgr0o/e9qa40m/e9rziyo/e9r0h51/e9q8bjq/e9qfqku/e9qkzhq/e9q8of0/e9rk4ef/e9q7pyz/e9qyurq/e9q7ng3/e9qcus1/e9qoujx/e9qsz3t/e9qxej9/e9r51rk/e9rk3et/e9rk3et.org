except natural reserve increase is tied to the soul. otherwise Zach's soul being reanchored to his original body wouldn't work. it's also unlikely Panaxeth can manipulate divine energy. or at least, not given any real reason to believe such. tho maybe we should wait on nobody103 to clarify in that other thread

also, a shifter is not just about their body but also soul, so unless Panaxeth can fuse the soul, too, he can't grant that much either

even if Panaxeth could grant such abilities, natural proficiency with said abilities is impossible to achieve immediately. she might be able to learn them much quicker, but even aranea aren't going to be masters in using it at a high lvl at birth or a few days after
