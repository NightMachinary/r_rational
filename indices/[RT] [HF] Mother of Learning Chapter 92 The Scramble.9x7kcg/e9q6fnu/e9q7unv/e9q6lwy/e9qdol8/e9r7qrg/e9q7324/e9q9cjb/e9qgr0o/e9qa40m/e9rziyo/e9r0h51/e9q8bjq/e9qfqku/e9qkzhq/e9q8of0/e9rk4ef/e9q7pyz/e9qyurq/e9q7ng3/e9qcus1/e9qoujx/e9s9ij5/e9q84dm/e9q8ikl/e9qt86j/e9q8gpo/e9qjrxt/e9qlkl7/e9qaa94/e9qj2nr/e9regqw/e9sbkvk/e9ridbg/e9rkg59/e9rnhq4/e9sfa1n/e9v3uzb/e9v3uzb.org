simulacrums are ectoplasmic and thus not real bodies. they draw mana from the original's soul to use magic and otherwise don't have a soul themselves. if they're cut off from the soul, because they require upkeep, they'll dissipate immediately. for example, if they entered a black room, any simulacrums outside would be canceled. thus, RR can't be a rouge simulacrum that left the loop since it physically can't without shenanigans
