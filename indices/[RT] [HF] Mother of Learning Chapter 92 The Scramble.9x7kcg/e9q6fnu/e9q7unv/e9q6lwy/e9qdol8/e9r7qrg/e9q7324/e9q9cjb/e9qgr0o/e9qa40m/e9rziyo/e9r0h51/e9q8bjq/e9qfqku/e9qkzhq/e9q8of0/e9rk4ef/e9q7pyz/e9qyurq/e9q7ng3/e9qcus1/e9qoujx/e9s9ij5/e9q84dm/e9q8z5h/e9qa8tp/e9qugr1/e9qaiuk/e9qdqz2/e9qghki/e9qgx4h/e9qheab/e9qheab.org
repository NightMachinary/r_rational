well, your first response was misleading with regards to that since it implied using ambient mana for regen *at all* was toxic

even so, while it's not known if Cyrin's ambient levels are below Zorian's safe limit, there's also the question of whether Zorian's mana reserve levels didn't increase enough to accommodate another simulacrum in all that time. so it's not out of the question for either case, really (4 really is still his limit because safe limit is close enough and/or max didn't increase enough or 4 really was nobody103 forgetting)
