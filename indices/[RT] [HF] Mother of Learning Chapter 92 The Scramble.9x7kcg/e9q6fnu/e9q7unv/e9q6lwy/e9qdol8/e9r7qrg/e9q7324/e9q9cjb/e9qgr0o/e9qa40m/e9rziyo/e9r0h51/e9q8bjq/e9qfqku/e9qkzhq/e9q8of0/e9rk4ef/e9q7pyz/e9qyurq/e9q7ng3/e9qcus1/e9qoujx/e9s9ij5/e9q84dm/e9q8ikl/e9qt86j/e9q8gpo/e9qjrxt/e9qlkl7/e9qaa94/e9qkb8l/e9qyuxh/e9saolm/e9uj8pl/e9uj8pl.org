I'm not quite sure I understand what you're suggesting, but it sounds like it involves real time travel, which is as impossible as drawing a square circle. Also after Zorian got out of the loop and cast that spell to connect to Zach via marker, that should have shown him anyone else who had the exact same marker too. So however Red Robe got into the loop, it wasn't by the same method as Zorian, which means he can't be an older version of the current Zorian.

Even if you propose that RR is one of the older copies of Zorian, there's a lot of problems with that idea too. I think it's most likely that RR is a separate person entirely from either of the main characters.
