Panaxeth could only work within the Gate's limitations. Getting a temporary looper out involves subverting the mechanism that is supposed to get the Controller out, meaning that it bars the Gate afterward, and doesn't work if the Gate is already barred. That's why Panaxeth popped up to talk to them after they first unbarred the Gate; it was now able to get another agent out.
