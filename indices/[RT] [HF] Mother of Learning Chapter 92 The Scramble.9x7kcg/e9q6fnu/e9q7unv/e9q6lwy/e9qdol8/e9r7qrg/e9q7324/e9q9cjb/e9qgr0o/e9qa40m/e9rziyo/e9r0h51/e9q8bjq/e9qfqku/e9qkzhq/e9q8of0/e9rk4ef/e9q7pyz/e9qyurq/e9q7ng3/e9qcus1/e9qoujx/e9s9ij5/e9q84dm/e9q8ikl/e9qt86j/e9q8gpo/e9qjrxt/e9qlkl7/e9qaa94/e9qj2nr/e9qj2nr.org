Here's my guess for who RR is.

I think it might be the man that Veyers was staying with. Besides shape(Which can be changed), he fits some of the criteria for RR candidate. Veyers can't be RR because he was soulkilled. SL was moving around in the following loops after she left the loop. Whereas if it was this man then he was also moving around as well in each of the following loops.

Next Veyers and the man in the real world made different actions, so something must've changed. It has to be directly related to them.

I think that once he left the timeloop and he went and found himself and Veyers. He probably showed up as himself in front of the real him and Veyers and spooked them a bit, but told them they need to go into hiding or to follow him to a safe place.
