So excited to leave the loop and get things running. I'm upgrading my estimate of the (otherwise low) possibility that the primordial was tricking them regarding Silverlake. Who's the next most likely to take a secret deal?

I assume that the other Timeloopers are being informed off screen?

Man, Zorian not evacuating his family because he doesn't want to deal with the awkwardness makes me think that his mindset has really been warped by years of death being no big deal. You don't get second chances anymore Zorian.

Kinda disappointed that everything conspired to slow things down and stop them from doing anything for a few days. Also not sure how Zach got injured... he's a terrifying opponent, and doesn't have any real startup time. If Zorian woke him up before he was literally stabbed or whatever I feel like he should be able to beat or at least easily escape anyone short of QI.

edit: If silverlake is out, I wonder if she's just cracking the prison right now. Maybe she's good enough she doesn't have to wait.
