It's imperative for Zorian and Zach to go down their to do list by importance; hence priority list. On the other hand, Silverlake (or RR) does not have to. If she goes down her list in the same manner, it would make her action predictable. Plus, it might involve her competing with the duo to complete her task. To hurt the duo most, Silverlake must predict their list and go bottom up. I skip few steps to explain this, but in conclusion, she can ambush both Alanic and Xvim with little chance of contest. I fear for their lives.
