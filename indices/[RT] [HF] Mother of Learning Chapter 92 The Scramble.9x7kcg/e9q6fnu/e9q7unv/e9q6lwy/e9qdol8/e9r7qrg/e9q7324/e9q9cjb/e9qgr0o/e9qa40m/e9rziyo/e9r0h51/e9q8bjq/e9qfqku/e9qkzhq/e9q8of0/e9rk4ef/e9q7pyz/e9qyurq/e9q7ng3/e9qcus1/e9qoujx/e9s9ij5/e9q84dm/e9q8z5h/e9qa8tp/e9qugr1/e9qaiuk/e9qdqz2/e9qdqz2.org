There was already a clarification on a difference between ambient mana and personal mana. Tavien noted that using ambient mana in the atmosphere would cause you to get sick and pretty much incapacitated for days. Whether this affects you through a simulacrum or not is unknown.

Basically, he would need to constantly recharge his own personal mana slowly and use of ambient mana is a really risky double edged sword while time is of the essence.
