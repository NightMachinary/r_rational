  not necessarily true i think, if memory serves they basically guessed the right spell through trial and error and Zorian was able to get the spell to require many less Aranea to function even in its unrefined state.

Kind of? Zorian originally thought there had to be a better way but when he sat down with it he realized that it was actually insanely hard to improve and it would take him months/years just to make it take less time than before, let alone fewer people.

Also, you'd think Damien, who used the Bakora gates to get to Blantyrre, would mention a spell like that if he'd found it.
