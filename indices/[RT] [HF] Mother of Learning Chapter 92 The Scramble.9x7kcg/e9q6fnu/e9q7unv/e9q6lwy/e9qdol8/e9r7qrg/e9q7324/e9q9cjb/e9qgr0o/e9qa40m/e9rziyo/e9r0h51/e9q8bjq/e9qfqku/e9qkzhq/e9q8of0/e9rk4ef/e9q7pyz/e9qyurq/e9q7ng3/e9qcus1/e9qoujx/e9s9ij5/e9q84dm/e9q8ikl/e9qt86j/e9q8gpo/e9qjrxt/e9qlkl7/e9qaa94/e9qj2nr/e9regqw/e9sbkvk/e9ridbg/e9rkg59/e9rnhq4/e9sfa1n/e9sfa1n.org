Well for pure speculation... Mana is potentially solvable in several ways, like mana crystals, or the hole. More pertinent is the soul. I don't recall details of how simulacrums 'have' souls, but one kicked out of the loop may count. Maybe QI could split souls, but my best guess would be it mind fucked Zach to not notice the mana draw. Then made the deal with Panaxeth, or tricked the guardian to get out (at which point I'm not sure if it would count as having a soul or not, but it might be able to overwrite old Zach). I don't recall details of how simulacrums share the soul, but one kicked out of the loop may count as having one. Or possibly it copied its memories and got them smuggled out by Redrobe (a mind mage, perhaps Fortov, that it recruited and trained for the purpose), or by Zach himself. It's pretty complicated, hence the low estimate.
