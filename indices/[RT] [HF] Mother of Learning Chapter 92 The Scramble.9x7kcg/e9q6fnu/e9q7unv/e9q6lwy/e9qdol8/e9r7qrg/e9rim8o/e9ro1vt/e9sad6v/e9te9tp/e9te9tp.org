Except for the fact that Quatach-Ichl loses the Imperial Crown when he loses his body, and without the crown he can no longer use stall tactics against Z&Z-level threats. Add in the fact that whatever stole that crown is probably going to be on that level, and now has 10x mana reserves, Quatach-Ichl is potentially screwed. That should be the threat assessment going through his head, not "Fuck it".

But for some reason Quatach-Ichl is literally always willing to entertain a deal in good faith. Even after losing his trump card crown.
