  Quatach-Ichl is straight-forward, and, for whatever reason, is always ready to strike a deal. Maybe he runs a pawn shop in Vegas in his spare time, I don't know. Willing to trade a few divine artifacts for tutoring? Let's deal. Offer to set up a bank heist to rob the Imperials? Deal time. Ambush him and steal his crown? He's mad, but deals will be made.

Isn't that because the only valuable thing about his body are the artefacts and the materials that make it? QI is functionally immortal already with that body, excluding any soul magic attacks. I don't think there are many things that he needs to be worried about, so he might as well go "Fuck it".
