Hmm I agree re Silverlake, but I consider the danger to Alanic and Xvim from Silverlake to be negligible (Alanic knows SL, and Xvim is powerful enough at defense). From RR - Xvim should be safe since he has no idea Xvim is anyone, and Alanic... I dunno, attacking the soul mage thing seems to be a Sudomir kinda deal and while I'm sure he wants Alanic dead, he won't drop everything and send a simulacrum to kill Alanic.
