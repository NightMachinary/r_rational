Well it certainly still is a matter of skill. All magic is to some degree, though I understand your point. Silverlake certainly has the required skill to make a simulacrum, but she doesn't trust her simulacrum to care at all whether or not the original lives or dies or to care at all about working to help her original. To that end, no amount of desperation will allow her to create useful simulacrums even if she can make simulacrums in general.

She can only use her familiar which hasn't been thoroughly explained, but based on the concept of familiars in other works of fiction, would be an animal that is more intelligent and powerful than usual with some magical connection to it's master. In this case, a bird with enough skill to appear as her (whether that's polymorphing or illusion hasn't been determined) and possibly enough intelligence to speak (though this could just be Silverlake puppeting the creature, that also hasn't been determined). However, unlike a simulacrum, it most likely does not have her power and couldn't be used in the same ways a simulacrum could. It MIGHT, but that isn't the way familiars generally function. We can also surmise that it doesn't work that way based just on the fact that she largely doesn't use it in the story up to this point.
