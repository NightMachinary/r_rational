Alanic is easy enough to kill in his sleep. That's how he's easily taken out each restart without interference. Considering that by the time SL is approached, Alanic's assassination had become a non issue, she's unaware that he's already in threat of assassination.

Knowing that Zach would likely seek his help once out, Alanic should be a high priority target for her.
