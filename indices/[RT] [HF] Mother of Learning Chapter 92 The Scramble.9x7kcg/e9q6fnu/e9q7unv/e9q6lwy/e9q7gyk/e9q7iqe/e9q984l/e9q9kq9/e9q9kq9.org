En fait Silverlake knows the identify of everyone who matters yes BUT she's not strong enough to kill these people on her own right away. So 3 am day 1 of real time is not when Alanic and the others are in danger. It's day 2 or day 3 that they begin to be in danger. SL doesn't know if Zorian made it out, it looked extremely unlikely from her perspective mere days before it was all about to end. Her first priority is herself, so hide away in a pocket dimension and figure out who to kill and who to help. Plus, she's not gonna make simulacrums cuz they'd betray her right away. So she can't engage people in combat. Killing otherwise takes time which means these people aren't in danger from her right now. In a few days, of course they will be! But that gives Zorian and Zach time to assemble and warn everyone too.
