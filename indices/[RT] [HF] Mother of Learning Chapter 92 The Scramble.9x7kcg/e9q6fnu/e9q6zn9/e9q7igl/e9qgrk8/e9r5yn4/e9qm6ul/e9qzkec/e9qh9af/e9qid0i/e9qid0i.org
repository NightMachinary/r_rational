The most important point in response to this is that even if this were true, the text (namely the last four sentences of the chapter) clearly indicates that this is not a factor in Zorian's response to this. You can't read 'it was all worth it for that smile' and go 'Zorian realises he is bringing Kirielle into a situation where she could well die but if i, Zorian, fail, then she will die anyway so i might as well bring her into the epicenter of a soon to be disaster zone because she will surely appreciate the magical fireworks'.

So the character moment is still spoiled because Zorian is making a decision that is reckless and irresponsible and Kirielle is actually about to be in a great deal of danger and the intended warm fuzzies have shrivelled to nothing.

I also disagree that Zorian with all his power could not hide his family from QI if that was his goal but it's not of great relevance to how the character moment was spoiled so i'll leave it at that.
