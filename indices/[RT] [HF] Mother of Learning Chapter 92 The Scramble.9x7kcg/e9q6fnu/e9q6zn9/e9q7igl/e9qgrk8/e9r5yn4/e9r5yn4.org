Disagree. There are some important story beats set up / continued here.\\
1.) Zorian feels A LOT of guilt about being the sole survivor. He's burying his trauma of that and says as much. Before he got out he felt he owed everyone that helped him in the loop, but now it's become acute by recent trauma. You're going to see this affect his decision making going forward, at least in the short term.\\
2.) Zorian cares for Kirielle and respects her wishes even when they may be inconvenient for him. That is growth even if it isn't perfectly rational growth in this moment. He should be more of an adult, but guilt is clouding is judgement.\\
3.) Despite Zorian using the hydra-hive-mind and all of his simulacrums being in alignment sharing thoughts often, they are still independent and have independent actions. The Zorians who were not just playing with Kirielle and are not looking her in the face in this moment would not make this decision, but that is because they literally have distance from it.
