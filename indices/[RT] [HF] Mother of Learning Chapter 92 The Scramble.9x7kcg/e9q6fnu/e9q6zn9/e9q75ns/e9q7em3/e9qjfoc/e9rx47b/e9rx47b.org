I actually think it could be Jornak, think about this, starting every loop with veyers in the house is sure to get on his nerves after the first few times, ending in him using the dagger to soulkill him, so he use the loops more effective. Also Veyers being the only thing linking him to Zach makes it easy to just erase those memories to go undetected. And he took instant charge of protecting the original Jornak and Veyers after coming out of the loop. Which again points at their importance to him. Bevore he left the loop he had no idea if the house was found out by Zorian and Zach, so why protecting it first thing out of the loop if he is not RR. Then again could still be a false lead. But i dont think so..

Then again how did RR get the dagger... something which took ZZ forever... and he knew about the exit...

Maybe Veyers because of his poor marks got some help from his friend Jornak to enter the TimeRoom , so he could study and catch up. While doing this they got assaulted by Panaxeth or got in contact with the one, who got corrupted and brougt into the timeloop by Panaxeth. in Chapter 54: its said "the royals are afraid someone is going to steal their sovereign gate and check up on it constantly " . Which could be the necessary connecion to the dagger. Kinda weird that Zorian never tried to meet one of those royals and mindslave him to bring him the dagger... maybe even Krantin? He is the one doing research on the sovereign gate and thus the most vulnerable to Panaxeth.
