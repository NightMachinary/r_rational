That makes sense, although the inference so far was that RR thought that someone exiting the loop would immediately end the simulation, as he didn't do anything to work against them before leaving. That might be explained that he thought there was too big a network to fight and their chances of getting out after him were nil anyway. Which hints at Veyers having been excluded from much earlier, likely when Zach's memories were taken.

The big question is how did RR start, a similar accident to Zorian, already hinted as impossible to reproduce.

Zach might have been captured early one loop by someone affiliated with the invasion but not apart of it, getting QI's help without having him loop as well doesn't sound that doable though. (For either the crown marker being corrupted or splicing the true soul marker intentionally.)

Not had any hint toward it, but I think that leaves the primordial as the only enitiy other than QI likely to have achieved a second marker, some corrupting of the monitors laws.

RR as some one who entered the gate with Zach's help or other means and was contacted by Pax, explains why he was so set on optimizing the invasion without being a direct member.
