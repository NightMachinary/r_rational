Silverlake is definitely young now. There have been so many hints dropped. First, that was what she was working on when she is introduced. Second, that's specifically one of the things that the Cult of the Dragon Below leaders are hoping to get out of enslaving Panaxeth. Lastly, Panaxeth had to create her a body from scratch.

It wouldn't make sense from either a Watsonian or Doylist perspective if she wasn't young.
