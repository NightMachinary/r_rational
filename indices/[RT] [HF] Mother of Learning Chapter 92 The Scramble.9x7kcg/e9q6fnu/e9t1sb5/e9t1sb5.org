Would be a funny twist if it turned out that Red Robe was SILVERLAKE (Zorian didn't meet her until AFTER Red Robe left the loop), and so we don't just have two Silverlakes running around, but THREE: Red-robe!Silverlake, Endgame!Silverlake and Old!Silverlake.

But yeah, it could be ANYONE. Damien, Zorian's dad, etc... It should be someone we'd HEARD about early on, but didn't meet until after RR had left the loop, and Damien and Mr. Kazinsky seem like decent choices in that regard. Could even be Alanic.
