I feel like we aren't asking ourselves the question, "How can Zorian salvage taking Kirielle along?"

Zorian is close with Imaya, Kael, Kana, Nochka and her family, and Taiven, none of whom stand much of a chance of living if all hell breaks loose in Cyoria. He likely had already made plans to evacuate people like them from Cyoria, so if he leaves Kiri with them then evacuates the lot of them to a safehouse, they'll be fine.

I don't think this is such a huge deal, though it's certainly a little riskier than shipping her off to Koth with his parents.
