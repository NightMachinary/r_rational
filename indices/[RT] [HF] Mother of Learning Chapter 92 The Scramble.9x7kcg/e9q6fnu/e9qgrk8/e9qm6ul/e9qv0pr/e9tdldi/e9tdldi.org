Are you assuming that he's going to keep Kirielle there for the whole month? Because I'm not. Sure, he'll take her with him, but he's already taken opportunities to ship her out before.

That said, it's not like he plans to actually allow the primordial to be freed. That would mean hundreds of thousands of deaths, probably including his own and Zach's. So, Cyoria is risky, yes, but he intends for it /not/ to be primordial ground zero.
