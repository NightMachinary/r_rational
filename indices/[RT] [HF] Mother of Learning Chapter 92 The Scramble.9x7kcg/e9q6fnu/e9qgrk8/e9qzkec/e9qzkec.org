Nah, he would have to do SOMETHING with Kirielle, and having her under watch at the heart of the power of his group is actually a pretty safe place for her. He is only able to ignore his parents because he only has a few days before they are unreachable in the middle of the ocean. Unless he arranged for Kirielle to go with them she'd be stuck all by herself with some family friend in their home town. Whatever arrangements he made to keep her safe would probably be less thorough and more resource-intensive than being able to keep her with people he's already protecting.
