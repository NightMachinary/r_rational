I don't see a world in which Kirielle is safer in a city where all Zorian's enemy reside and a primordial may soon be released and Kirielle needs to be dropped off at a safehouse (an additonal risk, even when in disguise) and then visited in disguise (a risk each time), than a world in which Zorian simply goes 'Hey, i really care about Kirielle, how can i best ensure her safety and wellbeing' and then does almost /anything else/ than bringing her into Cyoria. I mean this very chapter mentions that Zorian believes his family will be safe when they're on a ship at sea.

He is clearly not prioritising her safety but instead her short term happiness and, to bring this conversation back around to the fundamental point, this ruins the intended effect of the character moment.
