Zorian thinks he killed his own soul or let it pass naturally into the underworld, but then remember that insane dude who's collecting souls for his own purposes way back when they were still deciphering the invasion? if a normal dude can do that, who's to say Old Zorian's soul hasn't been plucked away by the primordial - heck, maybe even Silverlake herself as the proxy - did some actual time travel shit to him, sent him back to when the loop first started and gave him a purpose? Time doesn't mean the same to a primordial after all.

Maybe that's why the primordial said that Zack is fated to be his enemy. Zack will try to kill RR, and then when Zorian realizes that it's his own self he can't bear to kill him a second time.
