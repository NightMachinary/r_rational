Ah. So that makes that less likely. I can't help but wonder though, what is Zorian's family gonna think? I mean, is he just hoping they don't happen to look in his room?

It's virtually a given that the mana smoothing simulacrum will be in some way interfered with at a key moment, to such a point that I think there's a significant chance of nobody103 deliberately subverting that and having nothing happen. Zorian should really at some point though set up a second simulacrum to do that in a more secure place and dismiss the first. Would make him a lot safer from that sort of interference.
