  Is anyone else really disturbed by the decision to bring Kirielle? It seems very, very out of character given how much danger it places her in.

I mean, yeah, obviously it's out of character - the simulacrum even acknowledges that the decision will make the Zorian yell at him. But we've known for a long time that simulacrums can have variations on the original personality.

Add that to the fact that the simulacrum was /right there/, having an emotional moment with Kirielle, and I /completely/ buy it.
