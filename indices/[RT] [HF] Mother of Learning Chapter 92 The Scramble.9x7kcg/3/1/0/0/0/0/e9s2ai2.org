This does not excuse not making an assessment with the available evidence and coming up with estimates.

Let's be reasonable here. What are the odds the author put in the line about 'being safe at sea' to signify, you know, them being safe at sea, versus signifying that actually Zorian doesn't care whether they or live or not so just conveniently thinks this. The latter would be some great anti-character growth, i'll give you that.

(If Zorian wants to keep an eye on her he can, you know, leave a simulacrum watching her in a place that isn't filled with every one of his enemies and where a primordial may soon be released).
