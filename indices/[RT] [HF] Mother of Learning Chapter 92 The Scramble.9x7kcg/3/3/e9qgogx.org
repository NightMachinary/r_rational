Eh, Zorian's shown himself to want to get into the thick of things over and over again, and I don't think that was solely because of the safety net of the time loop. Yeah, it'd be safer to stay behind and do the boring work, but when did he ever do that in the course of the story?

Likewise, it's wholly in character for him to keep his past promises to Kirielle, he doesn't want to see her disappointed and wants to have her with him because he loves her.

From a meta level, I would have been very disappointed if Kirielle, a major character in the latter half of the story, had simply disappeared for most of the month because she was on a boat to Koth.
