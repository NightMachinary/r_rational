This is actually a good argument. True, that the first hours should be spent on cloaking herself against divination. But only starting to disable Xvim or Alanic on second day? I find it too lenient. Besides, Alanic is not exactly security conscious person. For a witch that is only slightly less skilled at warding than current Zorian, slipping in and assassinating him on his sleep is a simple matter.
