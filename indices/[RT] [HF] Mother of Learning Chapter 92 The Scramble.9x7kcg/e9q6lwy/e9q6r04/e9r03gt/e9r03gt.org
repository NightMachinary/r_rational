She has to go to Quatach, that's the only powerful person that shares her goals that she knows about. Sure, RR is a much better partner, but she has no idea who he is or how to contact him. Her best way to contact RR is to contact Quatach, so that when RR ALSO reaches out to Quatach they can meet up. I don't see how SL gets in touch with RR faster than that scenario.
