Could RR actually be antihero motivated by Greater Good? IIRC we don't have any explicit evidences that he did anything selfish. Could be fighting against tyranny of the Gods for example. Like Gods were expelled once and are trying to push back now. Primordial game looks too risky for that version tough, unless all known history is a lie.
