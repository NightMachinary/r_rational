Oh, sure, I might as well do that too.

List of things we know about Red Robe:

- has a fancy magic robe worn by inner members of the cult, even when Zach is still waking up
- has access to the dagger in Eldemar's treasury
- can make simulacrums, has soul sight, and can do some mind magic, at least after looping for a while
- might have needed a temporary marker placed by Zach, which would also mean Zach having access to the crown

Here's my own list of suspects, roughly in order of most likely to least:

Whats-his-face, head of the mage guild and known to be a leading member of the Cult of the Dragon Below. We have good reason to suspect RR is in the Cult's inner circle, and if I recall correctly, this guy is the only one of those who was actually mentioned by name. +He would almost certainly have found out about the time loop when Zach was telling literally everyone+ (edit: that was after RR had wiped Zach's memories, so nevermind), and quite likely has the magics that we know Red Robe has. As a high-ranking person, he might have had access to the dagger, though that's a bit of a long shot. The main things against this are the lack of connection to Veyers and the way he hasn't been mentioned enough in the story for me to remember his actual name. (There's a small chance Veyers leads to Jornak which leads to the Cult of the Dragon Below, and RR scrubbed Zach's mind just because him using Veyers as a link to the cult was inconvenient in some way, even though it didn't actually lead all the way to himself, but this argument applies equally to pretty much everyone except Jornak.) For another point against, Zorian does say they've investigated all the high-ranking members of the cult and none of them are obviously Red Robe (ch 63, near the end), though this doesn't necessarily rule anything out.

Any other high-ranking cultists - all the same arguments for, but pretty unlikely narratively because we haven't even heard of them.

Novelty standing on Notchka's shoulders - we never saw it coming.

Quatach-Ichl - He'd have to be pretending to be two separate people, himself and a looper. I'd be surprised if he couldn't cast a simulacrum, and as far as we know all we've seen of Red Robe could be simulacrums. +(I wonder, do simulacrums of QI look like flesh-and-blood people rather than skeletons?)+ (edit: We saw QI's simulacrums in CH 83 when he was helping steal the dagger, and there was no comment about them not looking like a bag of bones, so presumably they do. This doesn't really tell us much though because we know QI can disguise himself.) He also probably wouldn't have too hard a time getting the dagger. One point against is that he doesn't seem like the sort to enter a death pact with a primordial, but then again, he wants to release the primordial anyway, so he has basically nothing to lose by accepting. It's a choice between dying at the end of the month or surviving to reach the real world and be able to affect stuff that actually matters. +(It occurs to me, for any of the temporary loopers who thought Panaxeth was the only way out, accepting his deal would be strictly advantageous. You get to live for one month longer, and can work against him the whole time, then die at the end of the month after helping stop his plans. (edit: Hah, I thought I was clever for figuring that out all on my own, but turns out Kyron thought of it first.))+ Now that I think about it, the complexity penalty from all the pretending he would have to do is really the main thing keeping this unlikely. (edit: The pretending might be harder than I thought, if he wasn't lying when he said "Personally, I'd have gone crazy in a matter of weeks if I had to impersonate a complete beginner at magic for several years" in Ch 81. RR is pretty close to a complete beginner compared to QI.)

(edit: forgot about Zenomir. Being able to recognize the necromancy spell makes him a little more likely than average, but we don't have too much information either way)

Sudomir - we've only ever seen him after RR left, so we don't know enough either way. Given his obsession with his wife, he probably would have been more focused on other things, so not a likely RR candidate.

Jornak - all he really has going for him is Veyers and being a member of the cult, but he does seem like the single most likely person to soulkill Veyers.

Tesen - he has no reason to let Zach beat him up every time except as some sort of elaborate cover. He's lacking enough in the morals department, and as a seventh-circle mage and a member of a noble house he might have access to the dagger and spells RR was seen using. He might even have gotten a temporary marker before Zach found out what had happened to his inheritance.

Anyone below here I rate as *less* likely than a random mage to be Red Robe:

Xvim - too competent. That mind magic attempt? Not good enough. Start over.

Alanic - doesn't seem like the sort of person who would make that bargain with Panaxeth

Silverlake - surely Panaxeth wouldn't have sent a second copy of her when she already has so much trouble getting along with herself.

Taiven, her friends, Ilsa, Imaya, Kael, Zorian's other classmates - too much interaction with them while Red Robe was still in the loop

Fortov - what a failure at life.

Veyers - doesn't explain how he got soulkilled (edit: come to think of it, it might be possible for the Guardian of the Threshold to have sent him back Zach-style rather than Silverlake-style, in which case there would be only one of him in the world, and we don't know whether he would have looked normal or soulkilled afterwards in the loop)

Daimen - wrong continent, no motive, and quite unlikely to have encountered Zach at all before Zach and Zorian met up.

Zach's simulacrum - I would expect the gate to recognize it as not a real person and refuse to recreate it in the next loop, plus we don't even know that Zach was able to cast simulacrum before meeting Zorian, plus it doesn't even have a separate soul to put any sort of marker on, plus Zach doesn't have soul sight and RR does, plus both Zach and RR seem to both have pretty good control over their simulacrums

(Wow, that was long. Oops.)
