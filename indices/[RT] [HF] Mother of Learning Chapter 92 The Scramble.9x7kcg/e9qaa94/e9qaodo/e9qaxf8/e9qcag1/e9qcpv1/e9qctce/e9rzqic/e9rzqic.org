not necessarily true i think, if memory serves they basically guessed the right spell through trial and error and Zorian was able to get the spell to require many less Aranea to function even in its unrefined state. for all we know the original gate spell could require only one human mage to operate , right? maybe an ancient spell which could be dug up by some time looping archeologist hmmmm?
