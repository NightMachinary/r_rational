We don't know what unknown capabilities he might possess. Damien was shown/told to be more talented than Zorian. Imagine Zach meeting him while searching for the keys and (as Zach does, he's shown himself to be reckless like that) giving him a temporary marker.

Damien then has a year of looping. Maybe Zach comes to him, maybe not. Then his time grows ever smaller, and he searches for a way to extend it. He either contacts or gets contacted by Panaxeth.

At that point, we can safely assume that distance is no longer a factor - especially if Panaxeth /wants/ RR to be in Cyoria, for some reason. Such as, perhaps, to have RR learn how to optimize the invasion.

Even if we assume that it's not that convenient and Panaxeth cannot just will Damien to start elsewhere inside the loop, then Damien would still have 20? years to deal with that issue. Zorian mostly solved it within 5?.

But what's most convincing for me is the mention of Damien's latent mind magic. /Someone/ screwed with Zach's mind, and we know of no other way to do it. Now, it's quite possible that there's structured magic for that, but we haven't been shown it. So I /think/ that that's good evidence for Damien being RR.

(Of course, any other candidate for RR would also have those ~20 years to find some other way to erase memories. But that would be so unsatisfying, wouldn't it?)
