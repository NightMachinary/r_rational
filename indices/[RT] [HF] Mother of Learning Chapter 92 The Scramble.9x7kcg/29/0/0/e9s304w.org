Silverlake and Red Robe left under similar circumstances right?

Panaxeth got them out of the loop.

I'm not sure if this important or not but I wonder if Veyers was restored back to normal and walking around just like Zorian and Silverlake. Also the aranea that were soulkilled. If the soulkilled ones were still incapacitated I think that proves Veyers is not Red Robe.
