A few possibilities. For one thing, Zorian might have already taken the boost from Cyoria into account to begin with.

Alternately, being in Cyoria means a TEMPORARY increase in mana regen, but it also carries a greatly increased risk of combat and mana usage. So does being in Cyoria actually mean he has more mana to spare? If anything, in this chapter, he's been consistently lower on mana while in Cyoria due to increased need to use it.
