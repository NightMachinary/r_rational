well, he could be doing it right now as he's carrying Zach to the hospital and when he's not doing anything in particular.

his simulacrum is the one dealing with the Aranea and it's still the soul that does the mana regen (and maybe supplementation?) so it'd still have to be main Zorian doing it

â€‹

can he swap places with the simulacrum acting with the Aranea? maybe. tho also possible dealing with that end would be more active in spellcasting, too and thus no time to do it anyways?
