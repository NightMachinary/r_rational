Pretty sure I'm not. Shaping is impacted when one attempts to rapidly expand the personal mana pool, something that even Taiven admits is too stupid of a thing to do.

The last resort method, the one I brought up, is something Taiven had used twice and suffered a few days in bed afterward with a fever.

Chapter 22: “I hesitate to even bring this up,” Taiven said, breaking him out of his thoughts, “but if you're really desperate for a short term mana boost, you can always absorb ambient mana faster than you can assimilate it. I'm sure you're aware of the drawbacks, though...”

In other words, there's a clear limit on how quickly he can regen without poisoning himself with the ambient mana.
