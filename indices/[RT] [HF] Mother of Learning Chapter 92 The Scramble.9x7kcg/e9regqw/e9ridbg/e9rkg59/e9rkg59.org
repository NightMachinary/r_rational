It's possible, but the margin would have to be fractions of a second to just barely fail to dodge an incoming attack. Any sort of slow acting, but hard to avoid traps they could have set up seem rather implausible when they could just decapitate him if they did find him sleeping. Zach doesn't need to summon golems or mind control minions or set out wards like Zorian. He's a nearly 60(?) year old archmage with a divine blessing and likely more combat experience than anyone else alive.

Maybe panaxeth had some crazy boost he could grant, since red robe was not nearly that good before. Maybe that's not Zach...

In fact it makes me increase my 'rogue simulacrum' estimate, since then Zach would be fighting (or replacing) himself.
