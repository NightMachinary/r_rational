  Man, Zorian not evacuating his family because he doesn't want to deal with the awkwardness makes me think that his mindset has really been warped by years of death being no big deal. You don't get second chances anymore Zorian.

Isn't that precisely why he does what he does? He doesn't get any second chances, so he doesn't want to disappoint Kirielle. He doesn't want to mind-fuck his own family. He doesn't want them to get involved in all this time-loop bullshit.
