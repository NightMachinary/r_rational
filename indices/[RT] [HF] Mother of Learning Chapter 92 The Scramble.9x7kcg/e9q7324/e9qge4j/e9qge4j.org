Nah, the time Red Robe attacked Zach early in the morning Zach had to bolt. That was the second iteration after the Zorian/Red Robe fight. Zach beat Red Robe when he was attacked during the first iteration after the Z/RR fight, but that was when he was looking for the aranea and presumably as tricked out as he ever was.
