  If it was going to naturally expire then it would've done so with all the other temp loopers.

It couldn't expire naturally though, right, so I'm just saying there's uncertainty there. I dunno if the algorithm for the Guardian is:

1. Check if any valid marker left (controller or temp) - in this case none apart from Zach
2. Save Zach's soul and continuing temp loopes (none)
3. Kill everyone else
4. Recreate everyone
5. Put Zach's soul in

If this were to have happened in the 5th restart of the 6 allowed to temp loopers, then it would mean something for soulkilled Veyers. As is, it's another piece of the puzzle that's not enough to explain everything.
