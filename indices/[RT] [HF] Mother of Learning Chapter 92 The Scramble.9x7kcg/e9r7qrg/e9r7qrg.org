I absolutely love the characterization of Old Silverlake in this chapter. When Zorian tosses her an item and tells her to catch it, she dodges it, lets it hit the ground, and pokes it with a stick. Doesn't even touch it. Now that's the kind of paranoia we've come to expect from her.

  "Here. Catch," he said, throwing a small stone disc at her. She did not bother catching it, simply stepping back and letting it hit the ground. She then used a nearby fallen branch to suspiciously poke at it.

  The simulacrum rolled his eyes at her.

  "What the hell is this thing?" she asked.

Then we have Quatach-Ichl, the overconfident millennia old lich, catching Zorian's silver disc and having his soul ejected from his body:

  "I don't suppose you would accept a bribe to pretend you couldn't catch me?" asked Zorian with as much calm as he could muster, taking out the silver disc Kael gave him and flinging it towards the lich.

  Thankfully, amazingly, the lich reacted just as Zorian expected him to: he extended his hand and snatched the coin out of the air. Zorian had figured the lich would do that instead of knocking it aside with a shield or something, as he seemed to consider himself invulnerable -- not an unwarranted assumption considering those weird bones of his. In any case, the moment the lich's skeletal hand closed around the silver disc he froze in place for a moment before collapsing to the floor like a puppet with its strings cut.

The dichotomy between these scenes is great.
