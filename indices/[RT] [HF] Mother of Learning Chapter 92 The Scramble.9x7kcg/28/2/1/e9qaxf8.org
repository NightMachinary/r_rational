There is no reason that Panaxeth would have to spawn RR wherever the person woke up normally. In fact, doing it near his prison makes sense.

It is true that an in-loop explanation would be necessary, though. RR does soul kill the Aranae really quickly inside the loop. Freaky primordial teleport powers, maybe? Move quickly to Cyoria, but not anywhere else? Idk.
