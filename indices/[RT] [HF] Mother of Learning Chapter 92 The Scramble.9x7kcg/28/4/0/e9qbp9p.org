My theory is that that before Zach was mind raped, he tried to gather all the artifacts, maybe for a specific reason, maybe just for the hell of it(which would certainly fit Zach's personality). We know he almost certainly had the crown and gave people temp markers. Why wouldn't he go for the full set, even if only for curiosity's sake? In his search for the scepter in Koth, he came into contact with Damien, gave him a temp marker, and damien came into contact with Panaxeth, and accepted his bargain.
