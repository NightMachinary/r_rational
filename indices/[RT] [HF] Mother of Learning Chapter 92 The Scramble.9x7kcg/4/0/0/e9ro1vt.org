I wasn't being sarcastic, if it came off that way. Like I said, I love the characterization in those two scenes, including the context. I think they hold up well when taken with the rest of the series. Dichotomy might not have been the best word. I liked the throwback, the characterization, and the contrast we had with these scenes.

Quatach-Ichl is an immortal, Silverlake is nearly an immortal. They both plan to live forever. They're presented with near identical situation: To catch or not to catch?

Silverlake is paranoid, but not cautious. Caution would have kept her inside her well defended, invisible house when some potentially dangerous stranger started making a racket outside. But she's paranoid and she needs to... define and manage the problem. The same way she needed to harass the time travelers by sending investigators after them, or booby trap her mind and house, or refuse to finish her youth potion in the time loop.

Quatach-Ichl is straight-forward, and, for whatever reason, is always ready to strike a deal. Maybe he runs a pawn shop in Vegas in his spare time, I don't know. Willing to trade a few divine artifacts for tutoring? Let's deal. Offer to set up a bank heist to rob the Imperials? Deal time. Ambush him and steal his crown? He's mad, but deals will be made.

Silverlake's paranoia brings her outside to confront Zorian, but it has her dodge catching the stone. She'll poke it with a stick though, and she'll probably fiddle with it later.

Quatach-Ichl's inner PawnStar has him catch the silver disc and lose his body. Yeah, he let his guard down. Yeah, it won't happen again outside of those very specific circumstances. But that one scene shows us so much about who he is as a person.
