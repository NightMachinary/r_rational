With Red Robe still unaware of Zorian's identity, that could work. Assuming the demon involvement didn't add complications to any plan or Panaxeth didn't tip Red Robe off.

With Silverlake knowing about Kana, Taiven, Kirielle, etc. any evacuation plan other than moving them all right away to a random, distant location becomes moot.

This approach appears to be a contrived setup to have Kirielle later be made a pawn or hostage for dramatic effect. I hope that's not the case.
