I think dismissing his old soul was a mistake. An understandable one, but a mistake.

Zorian is pragmatic - more so after the loop, but even before that. I'm pretty sure that the original would be able to mentally and emotionally adapt to being around his post-loop self, because /this is his own potential/. This is what he himself can become, given a few years of intense training. And post-loop Zorian is in a perfect position to provide that training. He spent about 8 subjective years in the loop, right? Maybe 10; with all the Black Room usage it's hard to be sure. I wouldn't be at all surprised if he can pass on most of what he learned in five or less.

Making a body for his old soul should really not be all that hard, either. The author has confirmed that with soul sight, it's possible to cast the simulacrum spell on someone else's behalf, and he has plenty of experience making golem bodies. Might need to tinker a little, but he's tackled much harder problems before.

And the benefits? Well, they still have the same mana signature, as evidenced by Xvim testing it to confirm his identity. They would be able to share mana really easily. And with his hive mind techniques, they should be able to cooperate really well, even though they wouldn't share a soul. Basically, Team Zorian would end up twice as big as it is now.

But it's a moot point :(
