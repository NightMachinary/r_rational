to clarify then

one: this is in reference to Zorian having the emotional capacity to accept and adapt, mostly

two: original Zorian's not going to be driven by self motivation. it'd be "forced" upon him by loop Zorian. or what, is loop Zorian going to offer then what happens to original Zorian if he rejects? if he accepts, it'll be begrudgingly and will impact his learning capabilities. loop Zorian also had time and room to calm himself and analyze the situation. original won't have room to do his own thing to distract and calm himself and would be very limited in what he can do to do so, too. loop Zorian was in a state of denial and went for normalcy for a while while original does not have that option

three: there's still a difference between distancing yourself and having yourself completely replaced. there's also a huge difference in finality, where one he can technically go back whenever and the other, he'll be forever an outcast. there's still Taiven for friends, and he can't verify his identity in anyway without piggybacking off of loop Zorian so government and getting certification is going to be very difficult (or he'll be forever chained, legally, to loop Zorian and thus he's basically enslaved). plus the fact ofc that one is of his own free will vs not

four: the point is he's not *human* anymore. and there'll be many things he cannot do anymore, many of which can affect him very deeply, like sleep, food.

five: but why does Zorian need that many simulacrum after this month?

six: Zorian is 100% not going to be rational about this. and imo you're vastly underplaying the emotional aspects of this
