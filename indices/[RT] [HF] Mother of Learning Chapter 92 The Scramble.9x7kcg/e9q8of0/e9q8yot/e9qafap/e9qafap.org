So both of you seem to have misunderstood:

Red Robe was awake from the start because he wasn't put back in his original body like Zach, he was given a new body built by panaxeth with a death-seal put inside of it to ensure they free him.

If for example, we assume red robe is Veyers, then there are two Veyers right now, the original (who was probably asleep like Zach), and the Red-Robe version, who went and evacuated Veyers/his gaurdian.
