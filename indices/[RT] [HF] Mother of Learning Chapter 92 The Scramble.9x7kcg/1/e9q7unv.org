It's kinda surprising to see RR be a threat again, my thought was that Zorian and Zach had grown so much since the first arc that RR would have been left far behind. But him being an actual threat still -- plus, the continued mystery of his identity -- is a pleasant surprise.

For all we know his identity is a massive out-of-left-field plot twist, and is revealed to be Benisek or Zorian's other brother lol
