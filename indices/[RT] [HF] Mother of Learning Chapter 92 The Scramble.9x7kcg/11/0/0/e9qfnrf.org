I feel like this is important, Zach just used his authority to fix the flaws in the loop as well, it's possible that if RR was staying in the loop by a abusing a temporary marker than the loop just kept looking for that soul with the temp marker, but since he left with Panaxeth's help then it meant it wasn't there, but after the reset it may have been back, just like Silver lake and Zorian, I wonder if Zach checked.
