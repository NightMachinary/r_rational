I predict that SL's familiar is going to play a big role. Remember how it had fooled Zorian before as some form of a simulacrum. With all we know of familiars, we know that they're bonded by the soul. We also know from how Zorian's soul perfectly fit his real body, the souls are a complete match, so loop SL is likely also bonded to that familiar and possibly others.

In other words, the common assumption that SL cannot be in more than one place at a time might be false!
