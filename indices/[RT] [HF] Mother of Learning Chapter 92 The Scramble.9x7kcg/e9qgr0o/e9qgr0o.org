God, I'm so hyped for more of this, there is likely only a handful of chapters left and it's JUST SO GOOD. I can't wait to see how everything plays out, how we conclude this very last month, the story should end on the day of the festival, or the day after, and then get a snapshot into the future that the survivors create, who survives and what occurs is going to be essential for that future.

My hope for the ending is a future where Zach manages to do something within the nobility of their country while Zorian rises to power withij the mage Guild, with their knowledge and power they could make a HUGE difference in the world, Zorian's connection to the Arenea and his ability to basically unite them under his rule would be absolutely world changing. Zach's sheer power could make a huge difference, Zach could basically be a nuclear deterrent, he could stand in the middle of court and say, "hey y'all, Don't fight each other, if you do my friend and I will stop you, period."

Part of me wants some kind of follow up, not a story but something interactive, not a videogame (though that would be awesome), but perhaps a roleplaying game rulebook, the early chapters were heavily DnD influenced but I feel like by now we could write a fully original game based on this world.

What are all of your predictions for epilogues and such?
