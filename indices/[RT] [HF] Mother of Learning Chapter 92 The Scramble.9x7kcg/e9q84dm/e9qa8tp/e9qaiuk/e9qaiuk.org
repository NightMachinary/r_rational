Probably a mistake, yeah. I don't think it's a hard fix though. Let's say he can sustain 4 with the regen he gets from Cyoria. He makes his 4 simulacra, putting him at negative regen, so he's on a limit. Quickly teleporting to Cyoria puts him back in the positive, and the chapter continues as normal.
