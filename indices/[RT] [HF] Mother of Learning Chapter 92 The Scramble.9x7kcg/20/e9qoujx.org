We've seen what is happening and I guess some of the scariest stuff usually is silence before storm.

The storm here might be Silverlake in her new body. Why is she not doing anything yet? The scariest thing about Silverlake would be - she's adjusting. She's adjusting to her new body Pan had crafted to her. She requested to craft a body with mana reservers like Zach, empathy/mind magic potential like Zorian. Physically very fit. Young. She's not doing anything because he needs to adjust to her new body. Adjust to immense mana reserves, adjust to new capabilities on natural mind mage...

Silverator will come into scene and there will be bad things happening!

I'm thinking Pan-Silverlake came to original house and took the familiar away. Or she's communicating/plotting with original herself via familiar.
