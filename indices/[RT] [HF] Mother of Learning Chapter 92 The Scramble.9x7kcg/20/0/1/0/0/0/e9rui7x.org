as I said, yes, maybe the body to accommodate an ability is ideal, but the source of the ability itself is still tied to soul related things. shifting in particular requires an actual soul to be fused to the original. so Panaxeth would have to be able to get/make such a soul and know how to fuse it

assuming there'd be such a convenient creature with an ability such as increased mana reserves sounds highly convenient and breaks too many rules too easily and so I /highly/ doubt such a thing exists. and this is also crucial to all these other abilities (which I doubt Panaxeth can do anyways), and thus she'd cannot plug as many abilities as she would like
