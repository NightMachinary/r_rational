I see a few possibilities for Silverlake:

1. +Panaxeth never actually offered her a way out; it just killed her in that iteration. It claimed that she left in order to increase pressure on Zach and Zorian.+ (The Guardian says the Gate is barred. Thanks [[/u/sambelulek]].)
2. She has a new, freshly made body courtesy of Panaxeth.
3. She found somebody young and fit, and took their body for herself. It sounds like this would be painful because the soul and body don't match, but... this is Silverlake.

Silverlake didn't go back to her home because she didn't want to have to fight herself, or deal with an ambush.

Alternatively, her new body isn't quite aligned with her soul, so she's not ready to get into a fight yet.
