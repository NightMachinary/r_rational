so . . . . I guess the author wasn't amused by the 'Kiri jumps on a soul-killed Zorian' idea

+simuZorian has to lay perfectly still on his bed to concentrate so the mana control doesn't collapse even for a second. Cut to him horsing around and casting illusions all over the place+ nvm, read it wrong

getting his family to safety doesn't necessarily imply teleportation. They could just walk to the nearest hotel or something so they would be harder to find

this has been bothering me for a while, but how does one even enter the Gate normally? Presumably you have to physically go to the gate so shouldn't Zach's body be down in the research facility. Even if there's some sort of 'remote trigger' that Zach's holding in his estate, shouldn't he be awake when that happens?
