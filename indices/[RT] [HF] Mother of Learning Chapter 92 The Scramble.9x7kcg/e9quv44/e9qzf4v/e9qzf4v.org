Simulacrum 1 was maintaining the mana reserves while laying in bed. Simulacrum 2 was on 'guard the house' duty, and was the one who woke up Kirielle.

I agree that letting his family go on like normal is stupid. Zorian could easily mind-control his family into going into hiding (or just going to visit Damien early).

My impression was that a god or angel marked a human soul to be a looper in the real world, then hit the on button so the gate started. The gate takes a snapshot of everything, recreates that snapshot in its dimension, and then any marked soul is treated as the controller.
