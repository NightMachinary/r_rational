if that's so, I do wonder how the mana reserve maximum are determined by the soul. from what I understand, I'd guess it's the mana reserves doesn't have an actual limit (it not really being physical and all). it's actually simply filled up by the soul filling it up. the soul meanwhile is able to tell how much mana is there and has a safety to stop generating when maxed out. OR the soul can only keep a certain amount of mana in place in the mana reserves and the excess leaks and the soul is constantly generating?
