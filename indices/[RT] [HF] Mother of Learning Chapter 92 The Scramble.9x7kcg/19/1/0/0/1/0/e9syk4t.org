Outside the soul but seperate from the body, yes. I imagine a person's mana reserves as a sort of 'atmosphere' held in check by the soul's 'gravitational pull'. A shroud of personally attuned mana surrounding the soul itself.

Loop doesn't bring over mana reserves across restarts, but it never mattered so I never mentioned it. Zach and Zorian slept through the actual arrival point every time, so by the time they woke up their mana reserves would fill back up to their 'new' normal. Divine blessing is brought over, though, because gods.
