Wow, that ending was great. At the start of the chapter I was like "What if Kirielle interrupts the soul healing, did he seriously forget about that?".........I like what he did much more

Massive catharsis though. Also if leaving means you wake up normally, then we really have no clue who red robe is. Assuming it is not veyers attendant. And i seriously doubt that.

So plans around plans. We are on to the start of the final battle. Also I wonder were silverlake went :D
