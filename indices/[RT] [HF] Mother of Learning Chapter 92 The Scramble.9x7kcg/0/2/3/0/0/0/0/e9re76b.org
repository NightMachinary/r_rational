This moment is powerful because, unlike before, this is the last iteration. He can't loop back to this point and take her to Cyoria in the next restart. This is it. And things are going to change a lot following the battle, so much so that a future visit might be hard if not impossible. Everything is unpredictable because there's no longer the safety valve of a restart.

Sure, Zorian could do the rational thing and let Kirielle go with their parents. But most likely that would mean that he can't keep the promise with her time loop self, at least not completely. He knows he might die in the coming battles, it's a real possibility. And if he does, no one will ever take Kirielle to see Cyoria.

This likely won't be the last chance that Kirielle gets to see Cyoria in all its glory, but it might be the last chance that /matters/. (There's also the whole arranged marriage thing to consider, which will likely be another headache Zorian will have to deal with).
