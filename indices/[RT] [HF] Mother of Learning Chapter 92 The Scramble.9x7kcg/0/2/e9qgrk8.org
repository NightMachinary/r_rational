To me the ending looks like this: In an effort to create a touching moment, give us readers some deserved warm fuzzies and show us just how far Zorian has developed as a character over the course of this series...

...we have Zorian make a decision that will bring Kirielle and himself much happiness for the next ~24hrs before putting her in a huge amount of danger by bringing her /directly into/ a city where he will fighting against Red Robe, SilverLake, an immortal cult and a millenial old Lich. Oh, lets not forget that a primordial is also going to be released and likely kill the majority of the cities population if Zorian fails.

Even if i hand-wave my issues about how this decision impacts Zorians effectiveness it *still fails* to move me as a character moment because purely from the perspective of Kirielle's well being it is massively shortsighted and tremendously irresponsible.
