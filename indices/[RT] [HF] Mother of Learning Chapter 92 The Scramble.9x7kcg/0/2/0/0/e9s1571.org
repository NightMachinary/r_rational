I'm not sure we are disagreeing. While i would not attribute your above thoughts to what the author was thinking or intended when writing the ending of this chapter, if i am to proceed from the basis that i have to justify the ending in a way that has the most internal consistency then i think all your points fit very well.

The issue is that none of the points work to induce a touching character moment whereby we feel good about how far Zorian has come as a person and brother unless the fact that he is making a really poor decision, based largely on guilt and putting Kirielle in great danger, is supposed to not be spoiled by the fact he cares for Kirielle. You can see how the likely outcomes of his decision work against what the chapter intended from this moment, right?

This is a moment the story has spent innumerable time building up to and having that moment be 'Zorian makes a really poor decision that greatly reduces the life expectancy of Kirielle because he has clouded judgement and feels guilt...but he wouldn't have made this poor choice if he didn't care!' is not satisfying, in any way at all.
