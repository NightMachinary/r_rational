The comment you replied to was phrased oddly, but he was actually talking about Zach observing how Silverlake and Zorian leaving the time loop resulted in them still being produced as their initial versions in subsequent iterations. As in not soulkilled like Veyers was, which makes RR's identity a persistent mystery, since he's the only one we know of who used the Dagger inside the loop to soulkill.
