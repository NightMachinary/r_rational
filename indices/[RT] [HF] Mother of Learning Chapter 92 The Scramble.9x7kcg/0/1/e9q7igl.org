Only Zack would wake up normally, as he was the only one who had his soul inside his original body when the loop ended. RR and SL would have their souls transplanted into their Panaxeth constructed bodies at the end of the loop, and would presumably be awake after that. There's similarly no guarantee about where those bodies started. RR had to contact his original self and his lawyer friend to move them.
