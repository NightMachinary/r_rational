That would require Zach's soul marker to be perfectly copied including damage as it's twinned with Zorian, and that the copy response to the marker ritual even when it's not the original. Zorian to have not noticed mind differences while in telepathy with Zach, can't have been thinking to each other with mind blank up. Also with Zorian's soul proficiency likely require some cover / illusion of Zach soul as well.
