Yeah, this pretty much opens up RR to being practically anyone again.

Zach's observation that both Silverlake and Zorian were present in later loop iterations means that someone else entirely would have needed to Soulkill Veyers. We know it wasn't Zorian, so that limits it to Zach or (non-Veyers) RR. Zach may seem like a stretch, but we don't know exactly what's hidden as far as any compulsions on him are concerned.

The main hint we got this chapter is that RR evacuated Veyers and Jornak, which is odd, because those two didn't seem to have much value to anyone. They did minor work for the Dragon Cultists, but I didn't feel that they were too important.
