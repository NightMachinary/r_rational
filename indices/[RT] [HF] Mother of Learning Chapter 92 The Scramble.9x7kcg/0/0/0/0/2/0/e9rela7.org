Not even remotely likely. First, that's not how the time loop works. If RR didn't have a marker, he wouldn't have been preserved. Whoever got the marker must have had QI's help. Second, Zach wasn't proficient enough in soul perception to make a simulacrum. Third, simulacrums don't have souls, so none of that is possible anyways.

Plus, most of your justifications are already explained by the fact that RR fucked with Zach's mind in order to keep him from figuring out what was going on. The soul killed Veyers was intentionally misleading.
