Not necessarily, remember that Zorian considered the possibility that RR had worked with the Lich, but that the Lich hadn't been able to be made permanent, perhaps because the mark could only be modified in such a way in the first loop it existed in. RR could have given the Lich (or someone else) a temporary mark, and tasked them with soul-killing him the iteration after he left the loop, before their temporary mark lapsed.

That would require a great deal of trust, as the helper would have to carry out the task without RR's presence. It would also require quite a bit of power, as the helper would have to acquire the artifact that does the loop ejection without RR's help, and with only a few loops to practice.

It's definitely more likely that Veyer is simply a link between Zach and RR that RR cut some point soon after becoming permanent, but since both Zorian and Zach avoided the rebellion and Cyoria in general for many, many loops after RR left it's technically possible that a helper got him, without Z or Z noticing loop differences from another actor having loop knowledge for a few loops.
