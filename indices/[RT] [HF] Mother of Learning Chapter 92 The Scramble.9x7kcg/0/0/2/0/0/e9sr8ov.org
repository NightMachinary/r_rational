Theory:

Zach, in an early Loop, went to Red Robe (or an acquintance of his) seeking help - for whatever reason. Presumably they were introduced to each other by Veyers. Between Zach and Red Robe, they managed to provide Red Robe with a Marker. Red Robe then betrayed Zach, swiss-cheesed his memory, covered his tracks by removing Veyers from the simulation, and went off to do his own thing...
