Silverlake is not using simulacrums, but she has her familiar which kinda of can act as a single simulacrum.

Her soul magic is so advanced that she detected Zorians simulacrum attached to golem frame straight away.

To cast simulacrum one needs to have soul awareness / be familiar with the soul so it can be copied. It is not a matter of skill. I'd say it's related to the paranoia - there's a chance that a simulacrum would try to attack her/overwrite her personality via mind magic, something like this. There were some horror stories Alanic told Z&Z. But the SG-Silverlake has a time limit which may force her use steps she's not doing otherwise. To avoid the death by not getting Panaxeth release, she might resort creating simulacrums (she might have borrowed golem blueprints Zorian uses for his simulacrums).
