I forgot about the familiar. Good call. Wonder if the author remembers it :P

Still even if conceivable it's potentially unnecessary. As a soul mage and a witch her life has been in danger from countless sources for decades. She doesn't hunt people. She hides and she plots. If she doesn't NEED to go fight people, she doesn't strike me as the person who would. Can you think of any time she's fought anyone in the story at all? Besides a random off-hand attack at a child yelling obscenities at her in her yard, I suppose. (She also stops engaging pretty much immediately when she see's that Zorian is competent).

Though we may start chapter 93 with Zorian running across Alanic's corpse. Conceivable. I'm sure if Zorian had more simulacra, he would be out there checking on him already.
