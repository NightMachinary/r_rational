However Alanic is only killed in his sleep by a group that made unknown preparations that put them in a position to do that. When their time table is accelerated they are unable to do that and have to do an all out assault. We don't know what exactly happens to let the assassins kill him, but getting through his wards in secret is obviously not a trivial task for them, and the same is probably true for Silverlake.

Honestly Kael is the one I'm most worried about, but given that he never warmed up to Silverlake for heart-to-hearts it's likely that she doesn't actually know where he and his daughter start the time loop.
