Silverlake isn't ancient because she brave and headstrong. She's ancient because she's cautious and shrewd. She doesn't know where Zach is going to show up, but she knows he has simulacra, can be in many places at once, can teleport like a motherfucker, and can kill her.

At this point all Silverlake NEEDS to do is free her master. As a dimensionalist expert who was studying exactly how to open this particular prison with Zorian and Zach already, she probably has other ideas on how to do that that don't require possible confrontations with a person who's damn near a demi-god and will kill her on sight.
