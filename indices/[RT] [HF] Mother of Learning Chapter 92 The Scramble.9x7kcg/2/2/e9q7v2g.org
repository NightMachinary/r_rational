I think Xvim and Alanic are less safe then you think, although I don't necessarily think they are in danger currently or already dead. Convincing original SL to come into their side takes time, resources, and doesn't give them all that much advantage in countering loop SL. Xvim and Alanic are easier to convince that they are in danger even if it might take a while to inform them of the exact nature of the danger, and are substantially more useful in combat comparatively. Alanic is in even more danger than Xvim, since RR probably knows he's one of the only living soul mages anywhere nearby, so both escapees have a motive to attack him.

Warning original SL is sufficient; she has pretty good defences set up already
