Silverlake going to QI? Makes total sense, tbh. Honestly, if I were RR or Silverlake, I'd go to QI right away too. Get the one man army on your side stat.

SL knows she's no match for Zach, and Zach can leave even if Zorian can't. Going to get her old place and having to fight a 12month older version of herself... while being vulnerable to an attack by Zach... not ideal. She doesn't know and can't trust RR to handle Zach.
