You guys are all forgetting that in this world there's an afterlife. Would you really want to inhabit a golem body, unable to eat or do anything biological, instead of going to heaven? I know Zorian's been improving the golem bodies for some time now, but they started off sounding pretty uncomfortable, and I don't think they'll have gotten all the way to being so natural it feels like your own body yet. Plus, the traditional rationalist conclusion that the optimal strategy is to live forever assumes no afterlife. If there is a heaven, you might want to go there someday.
