one, you can't be sure how much influence Zach's soul fragment affected Zorian

two, loop Zorian was self motivated and his previous issues became irrelevant and minor compared to the constant shock he had to experience

three, what exactly is original Zorian supposed to do after that, socially...? disappear from his family and friends and acquaintances and government? for how many years of training before becoming independent and working elsewhere?

four, live life as basically a non-human or effectively a lich not of his own volition while everything is stolen from him?

five, would Zorian really need another Zorian 5 years down the line? how much *actual* benefit is this, post-month?

six, accept someone that claims to be you and *stole* everything from you and you had no say in and forced to do things against your will for years to live a life you did not choose?
