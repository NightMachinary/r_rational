but does he even need that after this? and he's definitely not capable of doing that during the month as I highly doubt he's that skilled in soul magic

why wouldn't there be competition over the body? in normal life, it's 100% the inferior option and leads a very different feeling of life (sleep and food at the very least). it'll also be time and effort before they can make a golem body that's not too awkward to move in (and reduce this gap of inferiority)

there's also a difference (potentially) of memory downloaded as packets vs memories you experienced. there is a distinct difference between knowledge memory and experience memory irl. maybe memory packet download would still make it experience memory, with it being able to attach emotions and all but that's just an if. but even then, *time* is a factor in shaping a person and I'd imagine original Zorian with same memories would still not be quite the same. not to mention original Zorian wouldn't be able to process the memory packets 100% efficiently until after some mind training
