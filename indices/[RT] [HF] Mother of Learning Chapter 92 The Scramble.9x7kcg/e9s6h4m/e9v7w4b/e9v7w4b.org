Disagree. 4 times the popularity is well deserved here. Zorian Kazinski is more appealing than Cat Foundling. Her struggle is often bloody, depending on might more often than wit. Maybe because the problem over there is never simple enough for us to tinker and approach. Especially when seen through the Cat's eye.

I'm not saying PtGE is worse than MoL. But for me who is more attracted to engineering way of problem solving -- that is finding ingenious way to avoid the problem altogether due to deeper understanding, do better whenever we have chance to iterate, or take away wastefulness when trying to achieve goals -- MoL stands supreme. If Amadeus is the main character over there, with his brand of appropriate application of force, I might not be able to take break from reading it.
