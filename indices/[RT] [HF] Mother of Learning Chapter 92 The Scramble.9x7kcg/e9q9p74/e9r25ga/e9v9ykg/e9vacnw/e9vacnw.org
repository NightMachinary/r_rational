I agree that Silverlake wouldn't plan for her own death. But I don't believe she'd work for Panaxeth's release, either - she wouldn't want to introduce into the world a variable she can't control which could crush her like a bug.

She's got a month to figure out how to break or avoid the Death Curse, and she'd happily inflict it on someone else to avoid being subjected to it herself. I don't think she'll be dying at the end of the month, and I don't think she'll be releasing the Primordial, either.
