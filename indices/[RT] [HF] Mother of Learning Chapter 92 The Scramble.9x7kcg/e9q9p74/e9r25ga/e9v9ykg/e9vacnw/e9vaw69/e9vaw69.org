That's true, if she thinks she can get out of the death curse without releasing Panaxath she'll probably do that. I personally think a being the gods had trouble dealing with would be able to make it so a mere human (almost said mere mortal there, whoops) wouldn't be able to break it in a month, but maybe not. But if she thinks the angels will only send Pan straight back into prison afterwards like QI does, and she couldn't figure out how to get the curse off, she'd probably release him rather than die.
