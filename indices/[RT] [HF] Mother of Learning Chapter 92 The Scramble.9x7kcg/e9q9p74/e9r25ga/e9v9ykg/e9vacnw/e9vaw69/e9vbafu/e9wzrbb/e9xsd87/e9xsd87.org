  Or maybe he just really didn't take a close enough look to see she was a capable soul mage beforehand, after all, he did make that second offer to Zorian claiming he hadn't noticed he was that good a mind mage.

This is my theory. Panaxeth doesn't care about humans - humans are mere insects in comparison to him. So he doesn't care enough to bother to take too close a look.

Kyron explicitly asked what stops people from taking his deal and then working against him, and was promptly and quite abruptly exiled from the conversation - presumably because he doesn't want to give his deal to anyone who thinks of that. Silverlake no doubt /did/ think of that - but was presumably sneaky enough not to ask Panaxeth directly.

  As for Silverlake, I think Zorian really did meet old Silverlake, but new Silverlake had already snuck into the pocket dimension or something and was just waiting for that meeting to occur before taking over.

That's also a possibility.
