I'm not convinced that Silverlake is going to be a villain here. She's often done (or proposed) morally questionable actions with not entirely unreasonable motivations.

She may have reasoned as follows: Panaxeth is in a position to keep working on making this offer until someone breaks and accepts it. Depending on who does so, it could be one of a dozen flavours of disaster - even /if/ Silverlake manages to get out of the loop without Panaxeth's help, she then has to deal with a hostile former comrade (and all of them will stick to the deal once they make it). But if /she/ is the one who accepts the deal - then Panaxeth will stop working on getting the others to accept it. At the very least, Zach will escape, and presumably save the city - while she has a month to figure out a way around the Death Curse (such as by swapping bodies with someone a good deal younger and letting that other person deal with the Death Curse).
