Yes, that's very likely to happen. It fits with Silverlake line of thinking of robbing a profit or avoiding loss. But along that line, she will be the supposed hostile former comrade. Time loop escapees will be out to hurt her, regardless her success in releasing primordial. It's a great danger I'm not convinced she will ignore.

She may rely on her usual trick of retreating into pocket dimension whenever hostile mage out to find her, but it's unlikely she will think it's still suffice.
