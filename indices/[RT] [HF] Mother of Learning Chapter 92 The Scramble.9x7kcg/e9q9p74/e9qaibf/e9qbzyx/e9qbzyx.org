There's a stark difference between facing an opponent on the field of battle and assassinating him on his sleep. Ambush is always the first option for non battle mage like Silverlake or Zorian.

Benefit her? That's debatable indeed. That's why I open the sentence with 'to hurt the duo.' She might not need to hurt the duo at all. But if I were Silverlake, I'm in favor of hurting them; as putting disadvantage on your opponent is equal to put advantage on yourself.

You can't assume others failed. You hope for the best, but prepare for the worst. I imagine just like Silverlake when Panaxeth talked to her; you hope your ritual spell to escape the loop is successful, but if it's not, better take the deal.
