I mixed up a bit about clothing. It was indeed the talk about transformation potions in chapter 31:

  You see, when you cast a regular transformation spell on yourself you are essentially putting clothes on your soul. Don't look at me like that, it's what it is. Yes, the official term is 'transformation shell', but they're basically like soul clothes. You can put them on, see, and you can take them off. Even if you mess up the spell and can't turn back or you get locked into an alternate form by a malicious opponent, you are still just a dispel or a curse-breaking session away from returning to normal. Your soul is still intact and unchanged beneath the transformation shell, and once the spell is gone you revert to your base form. The problem is that sometimes people overreach and end up transforming too far, so you end up with a mage, say, transforming into a troll in both mind and body and killing his entire family before the spell runs out of mana and he reverts back to normal. Or they attach the transformation shell too firmly to their soul and can't change back, and are then stuck in the form of a sparrow or something and can't talk to people or meaningfully interact with their environment. That's why a lot of people don't do transformation via invocations and rituals any more, and just buy transformation potions from people like me who know what they're doing -- no chance of messing up, just drink a potion made by an expert and you're golden."

The main reason I've put shape shifter form is the ritual used by cultists to break Pan out of prison (they are extracting Pan's essence from young shifters and are using that essence in summoning ritual). Panaxeth helped to create those shapeshifter clans (willingly or not - the essence might have been given or stolen). So that was the main reason I've put a shape-shifting body as viable option.

If Pan's whatever essence acts like grease between animal and human soul - this counts an argument that Pan might be able to work with souls in some fashion alongside the flesh since Panaxeth is a natural soul-mingling creature.
