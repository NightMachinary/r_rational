If Pan is able to craft a foreign body which is compatible with a soul 100% - there might be additional transitional period where soul adjusts to the new body. So let's say it the soul attaching into such body would allow some sort of hooks into the body, but it would take some time for body and soul to sync.

As for such animal - if it is arctic whale where there are no people going to fish. There's a limited amount of them, they are very hard to get to and to kill - they can just dive and go away. Also this capacity is not known. It is just very hard to perform such ritual in the ocean. Pan is not limited by this since he's fleshwarper and knows all abilities of all animals cause he was stuck into SG.

Anyways, I'm waiting for an author to reveal what Silverlake is up to (and it should be a nasty stuff) so why not flex imagination :)
