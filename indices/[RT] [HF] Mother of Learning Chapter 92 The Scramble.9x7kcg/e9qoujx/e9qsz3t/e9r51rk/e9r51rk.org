Actually there are two stages of gaining abilities. The first stage is getting some ability extracted and added via blood ritual - e.g., stuff done with tunneling toad - [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9x7kcg/rt_hf_mother_of_learning_chapter_92_the_scramble/e9qcus1/]]

Since this ability gets attached to the body, it makes sense to Pan able to do it itself - a better alternative for doing via unreliable blood magic/ritual.

The most kick-ass body we've seen was dragonoids. We've seen some shifters as well.

So SG Silverlake could have asked for dragonoid or dragon -shifter body (most of the shifters used Pan's essence and that's why shifter kids were used in ritual). In addition to that body, throw in aranea natural ability tied via blood magic (psion or natural mind mage - whatever you call it. Also maybe some other ability which gives larger/max mana pool). If possible, apply copy of divine blessing as well - and here's the Silverator ready to kick some ass.
