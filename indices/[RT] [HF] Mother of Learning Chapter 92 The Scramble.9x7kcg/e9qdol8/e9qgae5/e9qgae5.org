You mean the fact that Zorian is massively increasing the likelihood that Kirielle comes to harm, endangering his efforts to save the continent from a Primordial by dividing his attention and resources and acting in such a blatantly non pragmatic manner that it is hard to believe spoiled for you the Zorian/Kirielle character moment that's been building up for half the series?

Yeah, me too.

You dont have to be 'competence before feels' or 'plot > character' as a reader to have a character moment feel contrived and ineffective because of how a) unbelievable it is, in the literal sense and/or b) how overshadowed it is by the fact that the very decision that is designed to give you warm and fuzzies is a decision that actually is a gigantic -EV decision to the characters future wellbeing.
