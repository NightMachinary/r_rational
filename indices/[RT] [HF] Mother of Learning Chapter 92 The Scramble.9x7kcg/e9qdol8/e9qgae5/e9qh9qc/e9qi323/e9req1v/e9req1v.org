Actually, if Zorian didn't take her, she'd be with the parents on the way to Koth.

Now that I think about it, I think Zorian low-key doesn't care if his parents die here. Sure he talks about wanting to shift them to safety, but then thinks that they might be safer on Koth (no way to be sure). But Kirielle, if she went off with them, would also be out of Zorian's protective area. And I don't think he was comfortable leaving her in a place where he couldn't keep an eye on her.
