Is anyone else really disturbed by the decision to bring Kirielle? It seems very, very out of character given how much danger it places her in. It's a horribly selfish act at the expense of someone Zorian loves. He knows that isn't what is best for her. And that it endangers the entire world indirectly.

Also, it seems pretty questionable to me that the original Damien was not the one that stayed to protect his family, given that that was the safest job. Simulacrums are expendable, the original is not.
