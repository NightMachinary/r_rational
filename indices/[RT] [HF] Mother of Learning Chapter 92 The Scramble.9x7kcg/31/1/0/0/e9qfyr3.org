I forget if it was a comment here or if it was in the chapter itself but Silverlake's capabilities /are/ still limited by her not being able to use simulacrums so it's debatable if she has the time to be doing something with questionable returns and chances of success. also, she probably only suspects Zach coming out. otherwise, there was much less reason for her to take Pax's offer

ofc it's best to take Alanic in his sleep but it's questionable how easily she can do it, too. he'd still have wards and is not necessarily capable enough with wards to beat them with little time and resources (won't have most of her assets without raiding her original's home). meanwhile, the assassins in the loop presumably had time, resources, experts, and manpower
