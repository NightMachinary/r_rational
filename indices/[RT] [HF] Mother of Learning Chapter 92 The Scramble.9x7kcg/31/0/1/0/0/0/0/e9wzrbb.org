Hmm. What you say sounds true, but if it is, then Panaxeth made a suspiciously big mistake in releasing her. Maybe he just wanted ZZ to have to be defensive (checking up on Alanic, and stuff) at the beginning of the loop so they wouldn't get around to other things as quickly? Maybe he noticed that Silverlake's teaching was pretty important to the group (they did have to get QI to replace her, iirc), and figured she wouldn't do as much harm outside of the loop as in it? Or maybe he just really didn't take a close enough look to see she was a capable soul mage beforehand, after all, he did make that second offer to Zorian claiming he hadn't noticed he was that good a mind mage. I suppose he might even have deceived them about releasing her at all, if there were any way he could get rid of her soul (maybe put in the real world after his best effort to sabotage it, or somehow abuse whatever mechanism the time loop has of destroying souls). Sometimes I wonder if Silverlake was just a complete distraction, and he actually just modified Ilsa's marker so it wouldn't run out and she could escape in a future loop, or something. (If we're assuming that's how RR happened, then he's capable of that.) Too many possibilities. (edit: forgot one more: Panaxeth thinks she'll release him despite not being forced to because of the interest she's been taking in his pocket dimension.)

As for Silverlake, I think Zorian really did meet old Silverlake, but new Silverlake had already snuck into the pocket dimension or something and was just waiting for that meeting to occur before taking over. There's some risk from her perspective that Zorian would kill her old self, but she does think of him as squeamish. Of course, that's all just guessing.
