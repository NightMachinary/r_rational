The number that he can support is a function of proficiency with the spell and mana regeneration. Since mages restore mana based on their maximum mana reserves (regeneration is linearly proportional to maximum mana so that all mages go from empty to fill in about the same amount of time), and Zorian can support 4 at magnitude 8, the maximum amount a mage proficient in the spell can sustain is their magnitude divided by 2, so long as they have plateaued in their mana capacity.

The simulacrum that got Veyers and his lawyer friend out could have later gone after the Aranea. We don't currently have evidence that RR can support more than 2 indefinitely, which doesn't give any useful information since Zorian can do the same with below average reserves.
