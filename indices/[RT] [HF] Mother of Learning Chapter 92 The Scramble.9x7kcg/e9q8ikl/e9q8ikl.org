How many simulacrums can RR cast? One for Zach, one for aranea, one (I assume) for Veyers and Jornak with the first two going all out with mana intensive attacks. Plus, he may have had some simulacrums go check up on some other stuff with QI or someone else, cuz he's not labouring under the issues Zach and Zorian are. We were treating RR too lightly it seems.
