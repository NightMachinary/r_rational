If Silverlake and Zorian were just newly remade in the next loop then Red Robe doesn't seem to be Veyers but soulkilled Veyers instead.

Unless... Zach didn't get along with Veyers before the timeloop maybe he soulkilled Veyers instead and now Red Robe is trying to protect Veyers from Zach.

+Edit: Last time Red Robe early attacked Zach, Zach kicked his ass despite just waking up. Now Zorian woke Zach up early yet Red Robe did a much better job and almost killed Zach.+

Edit2: Comments reveal I misremembered.
