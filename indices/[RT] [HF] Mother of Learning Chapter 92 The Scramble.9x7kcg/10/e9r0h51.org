In a writerly sense this chapter gives me an appreciation for how necessary the Silverlake-shaped wrench in the works is.

In a world where Silverlake isn't also a threat, things are much simpler for our dear heroes. Yes Red Robe has an army, but they have a +Hulk+ Xvim. The allies and information Z&Z gathered over the course of the loop are resources RR wouldn't know about and wouldn't have much of a way to counter, so far as we can see.

Silverlake being out, about, and aware of all of those allies and plans makes things a lot more touch-and-go, in a good way.
