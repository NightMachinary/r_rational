Kind of late to this but... thanks a lot for the comment! It's always great to hear from someone that they liked it. And yes, that feeling of a story that tries to be rational while also having pretty fallible characters is exactly what I was going for. I enjoy the occasional overpowered genius schemer like the next guy, but I didn't think it'd fit the setting, or make for a gripping enough story.

  Please, continue this as well as you can, because it is one of the most satisfactory rational-DB fics I enjoyed ...

This makes me wonder... wait, are there any /other/ rational Dragon Ball stories? I don't know of any.
