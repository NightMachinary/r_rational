The question is never settled straightforwardly in canon, but I believe that by the point Goku and Tien fight, they're both stronger than their respective masters. Goku barely loses against Roshi in his PREVIOUS tournament. He powers up a lot since then, and Roshi has no reason to grow much more, since he's so old and has basically peaked his potential. Then Roshi surrenders against Tien, basically saying that it's better if his old generation leaves the field to the young ones. He's acknowledging that he's been surpassed: there's new, fresh blood now. And there's no reason to think Shen is much stronger than him. I think at one point Roshi tells Tien that he's surpassed his master and should not feel bound by his will any more.
