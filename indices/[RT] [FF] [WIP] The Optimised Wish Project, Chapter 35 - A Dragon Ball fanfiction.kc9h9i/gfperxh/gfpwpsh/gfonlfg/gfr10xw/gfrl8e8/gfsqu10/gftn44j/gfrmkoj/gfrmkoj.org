Thank you for the chapter, I was happy to read it.

A minor technical question, just to help me complete my mental picture of the fight. How did Goku do the move with the Pinecones? I feel like I can visualize almost the whole fight except for that part, because I can kind of imagine several ways he could do it, but I'm not sure which one he used.
