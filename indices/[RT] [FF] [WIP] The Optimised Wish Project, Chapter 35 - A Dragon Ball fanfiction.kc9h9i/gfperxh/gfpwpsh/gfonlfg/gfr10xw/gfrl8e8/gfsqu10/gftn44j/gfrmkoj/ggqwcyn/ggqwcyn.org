Hi, just wanted to drop a quick note right here were I'm sure you'll read it. I really enjoy the story, the divergence from canon, how you grew some side characters, and the worldbuilding you are doing. The good mix between RATIONAL characters, simple smart/rational characters and strongly emotional characters.\\
The story flows well, because for all the good communication most main characters have, there are a lot of normal miscommunication, unsaid things, normal human failings.\\
This is the perfect rational fic for me, some very smart characters, some more normal ones, not everyone is a Machiavellian mastermind, not everyone thinks at 30 levels deep, and even "simple" characters can have valuable input both in story and in the meta message.-

Please, continue this as well as you can, because it is one of the most satisfactory rational-DB fics I enjoyed ...
