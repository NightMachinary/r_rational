I say it in the introduction, that the goal was malicious; however the AI vastly exceeds its original scope and goal. Killing Goku only meant sending him to the afterlife: anything else it does is value creep. I think the title makes sense on the face of it, it describes what the story is about - while inspired by the Paperclip, I never meant it to be a 1:1 analogy.
