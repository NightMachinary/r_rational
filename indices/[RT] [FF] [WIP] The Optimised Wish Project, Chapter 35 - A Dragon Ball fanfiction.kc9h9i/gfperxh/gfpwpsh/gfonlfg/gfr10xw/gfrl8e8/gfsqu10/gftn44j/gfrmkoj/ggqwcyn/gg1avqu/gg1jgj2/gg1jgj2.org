Hm, talking about that in detail would be too spoilerish. But I think by this point you can already imagine divergences will get pretty big - seeing how Dr. Gero is changing allegiances, and the whole original reason for him to build Cell has evaporated. Besides, Cell is a /hugely/ ethically problematic project - given that he subsists entirely by absorbing the energy of other people and killing them, plus incorporating the androids #17 and #18.

BTW I'll direct you to my /other/ Dragon Ball ratfic, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13001348/1/The-Killing-Goku-Maximizer][The Killing Goku Maximizer]], if you're interested in my most unhinged possible take on Gero's androids and haven't read it already.
