Basically the idea is, Goku has become really good at delicate ki control. Look up for example Yamcha's Sokidan technique; what he's doing is something like that, but with very small blasts, and no need for large gestures to control them. So in this case what he did was:

1. use small, faint blasts as explosions to propel pinecones towards Tao from direction A;\\
2. hide some brighter blast behind one such cone, so that it would blind Tao when the cone itself was deflected;\\
3. use the diversion to then get to land in an attack from a completely different direction, where he was actually hiding.

As for how he could get the blasts in position while keeping them hidden, with enough time and patience there would be several methods. He could delicately slip them under the first layer of leaves and soil of the forest's floor, or have them go vertically from his position, up above the tree cover, so that they might be ignored or simply look like planes or satellites flying overhead without a closer inspection while they move, then have them come down in position.
