For me, this is a common issue in all kinds of fiction, including Bleach as well. Power levels are not consistent and hero always barely wins and learns something, what always makes me wonder "what if he fought his opponents in a different order".

It's the same with fighting games, the opponents are always magically one step above the player. The real question is how to rationalize it.

You have kinda written Tao as best world fighter (assasin) and Crane as kinda scared of Tao. Tien and Chiaotzu are Crane's pupils, so I would think they are way weaker than him. It's suprising that you're saying "Tien is stronger than Crane", is it the same as in canon?
