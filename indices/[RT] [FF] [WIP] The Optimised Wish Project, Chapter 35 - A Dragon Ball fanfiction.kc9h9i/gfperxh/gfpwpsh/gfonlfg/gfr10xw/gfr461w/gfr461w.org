Not really. In canon Goku beats Tao much more comfortably than here - after training with Korin - and still has trouble and eventually loses against Tien at the next Tenkaichi. But regardless, I also didn't really stick to canon power levels all the time (for example, I made Bandages and Spike significantly weaker than they should have been - in theory, THEY are stronger than Tao too, since in canon Goku fights them after him). As a general rule, in this world, Tao and Tien are both stronger than the Crane master and Chiaotzu. I won't pronounce myself on who's stronger between Tao and Tien though; the former had more experience, the latter is more of a rising young talent.
