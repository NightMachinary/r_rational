Well, blowing up a planet doesn't just kill everyone, it also destroys a whole culture, history etc. and stops it from ever going on. I would say that's still a net loss, even if everyone went to heaven. But you're right that I might bring that up - but there will be plenty of time once I get to the Frieza arc (which will actually be sooner than you might expect).

Also, speaking of one shots and Bleach, I /did/ write one, “End of Empiricism”. That one was about the problem of connecting our senses with reality, though. But I am also considering something short along the lines said above.
