From a meta viewpoint, I think the problem is that if I spent whole chapters on my characters musing philosophy, this would become quite a different story. Not necessarily an /uninteresting/ one, just a different one. I've considered delving fully into that notion, but if I were to write a rational fiction about the philosophy of the afterlife, I think it would be a Bleach fanfiction, not a Dragon Ball one. I say this because Bleach has both a higher focus on the afterlife and a ridiculously oblivious attitude to just how /shitty/ its afterlife is for pretty much anyone. Also, I like the idea of Ichigo as a rational hero focused on this issue - he's canonically pretty smart, albeit not a genius, and he's grown up in a clinic, with a doctor as a father, seeing death up close (and then ghosts) from childhood.

From an in-story viewpoint: while they know there is an afterlife, they also are really ignorant about how do you go one place or the other. There is not a holy text or a prophet's word. Bulma, at the very least, knows she's doomed to Hell no matter what, and that's simply because Enma is pissed off with her personally. Baba learned about Enma and tried her best to butter him up, and that obsession actually ended putting her in a worse spot than she started from. I may have made these world-shattering revelations sound too trivial, I'll admit, but in general my idea here is that knowing that there is an afterlife but also a capricious deity who decides if you go to Heaven or Hell based on unknown and arbitrary rules takes the edge off many of those questions. Such as, killing someone at the height of their virtue to have them go to Heaven might sound like a /good/ thing... but then again, will it send /you/ to Hell because that's how Enma thinks, regardless of your good intentions? How do you even tell if that person will go to Heaven anyway? Really, the fact that Enma has /mood swings/ suggests he could send the same exact person to Heaven one day, to Hell the next, simply based on how he feels that day.
