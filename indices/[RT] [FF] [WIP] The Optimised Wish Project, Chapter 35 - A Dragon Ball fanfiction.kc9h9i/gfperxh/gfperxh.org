Hello, first off just wanted to say that I have really been enjoying this story. I discovered it only a few days ago and sped through the whole thing (which I normally do not do) because of how high the quality is. This latest fight scene was really great and definitely lived up to my expectations.

The one thing I was curious about is the moral ramifications of Dragon Ball's afterlife and how they have (or have not) affected the characters. Bulma has been aware of the specifics of this afterlife for months, but her moral system seems to have changed in almost no way beside seeking personal immortality to avoid hell. From her characterization thus far, it seems to me that she should have received a much bigger shock from the new knowledge.

There exists a heaven, where sapient beings go and keep their sapience, and a hell where sapient beings are damned to eternal suffering. Is sending people to heaven early a good thing? I think you could easily argue it is, as people in heaven is surely not any materially worse than the world of the living, and you save them from the possibility of being sent to hell. This is just the first question which comes to me when I imagine learning that heaven and hell are real, but I imagine that a character as smart as Bulma could think of many others.

Is there a reason that Bulma's actions and motivations do seem to stay mostly intact after experiencing the afterlife? Does she experience a large amount of moral reflection which just happens to land very similar to her own moral system before discovering the afterlife, or has she not fully considered the ramifications?
