that's why I asked. The only rational explanation for your storyline now I can imagine is that the process was already started when Bulma arrived and it went haywire when Gero left his lab.

i've seen that but I haven't read it that before. Still, now it turns out great. Altough I can see two small issues with that:\\
1. as far as i know, the paperclip maximizer idea is that AI starts with innocent goal and ends up badly, the AI in the story has kinda different vibes and I'd say it's doing what it is supposed to. The world 'singularity' would fit the story more\\
2. in order to fix 1), I'd change your storyline AI to create more artificial Gokus just to kill them later. Maybe somewhere after the point when he sacrificed himself
