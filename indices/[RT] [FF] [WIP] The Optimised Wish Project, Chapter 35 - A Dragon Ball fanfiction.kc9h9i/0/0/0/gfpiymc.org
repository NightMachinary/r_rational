First off, I just want to say that the Bleach fanfiction idea you mentioned sounds insanely interesting to me. I would definitely read that if you ever found the time / motivation to create it (though to me it sounds like it may also be well suited to a short-story or one-shot format?)

I definitely agree that characters having these moral quandaries is probably not something which will fit into the flow of this story. That does not mean, however, that they cannot happen "offscreen" and modify the perspectives of characters. I have noticed the examples you have given, and I think that how you have handled personal motivations in the face of afterlife knowledge has been very strong. I also see how a great deal of uncertainty existing muddies the waters and makes logical reasoning about the afterlife very difficult for our characters.

However, I still think that Bulma especially should have a different set of motivations after these revelation which could be concisely added to the story in a way which does not inhibit the flow of the story or seem confusing to the audience.

An example of this for me is Freiza. Bulma is horrified at his widespread genocide. Why? While the obvious answer is that "genocide is bad," under the afterlife system set out killing seems at least a much more neutral action, simply sending someone off to a realm which they would go to eventually. There are still many reasons to oppose Freiza's action and he is still almost definitely an immoral figure. However, I think even a throwaway line about why she is so motivated to prevent his actions (beyond the normal motivations of killing=bad which she would have before knowing about the afterlife) would deepen our understanding of her character.

I love the story, and I don't think this is something that needs to be focused on at all, The elements of the afterlife and the personal issues it poses are already present. I think that the moral issues do not need to be heavily focused on at all to be added and to richen the story. Of course, you may disagree: that's why you're the author and I am the random fan writing paragraphs on reddit (lol).
