I honestly like Archive of Our Own a lot - the default format is clear and nice to read, it's got an easy interface to use, and it supports downloading automatically generated .epub / .mobi / .pdf / .html and ALSO it's supported by the FanFicFare fanfiction downloader for Calibre.

Fictionpress is sort of garbage in terms of interface and useability, but it's also supported by fanficfare at least and it's still readable.

Wordpress-based blogs host several pieces of writing I like a lot - Unsong, Worm, etc. The formatting is almost always clear and fine to read, but involves more setup work on the author's end. However, as far as I know, there aren't any really good automated tools to make wordpress into portable formats automatically and I lose fanficfare compatibility to monitor / download fics into a calibre archive for me. This is less of a problem if the story is either already all done or is updating with great regularity.
