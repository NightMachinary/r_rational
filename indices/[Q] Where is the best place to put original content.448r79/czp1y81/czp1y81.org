Archive of Our Own has the best features, SpaceBattles in the creative writing board will get you the most passing readers and community interaction. Sufficient Velocity is SpaceBattles with slightly different mods about half the readers. I use SpaceBattles, Sufficient Velocity and Fanfiction.net, because I figure I get more readers from using all three than just the one, although it means I have to spend more time correcting spelling errors and uploading.
