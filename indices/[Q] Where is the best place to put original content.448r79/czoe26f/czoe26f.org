Wordpress blogs are fine, e.g. unsongbook.com.

Your own website might or might not be better, depending on the aesthetic you're going for. For example, I quite like localroger.com/prime-intellect/mopi1.html

Self-publishing as a pdf or getting onto google books is also an option, but probably requires you to know your way around typesetting at least a little. A medium-successful example would be [[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tYyxCQAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&lpg=PP1&source=bl&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false]]
