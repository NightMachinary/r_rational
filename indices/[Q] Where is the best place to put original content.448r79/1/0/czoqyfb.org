Speaking of "your own website", Github Pages gives you all the control of "just throwing some HTML up somewhere" with none of the worries about /where/ (you.github.io, with optional custom domain), /how/ (=git push=), or about maintaining servers or paying for bandwidth or anything similar. Plus, if you decide you hate Github one day, "exporting" your site is unnecessary: you've already got it.

(You can achieve the same benefits at a slightly lower level using e.g. S3 + CloudFlare---which I used to do for some of my own personal website projects---but when the point is just removing all stumbling-blocks in the way of /putting up your writing/, I honestly don't think it's worth the extra bother.)
