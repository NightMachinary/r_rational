Apologies for the confusion. I pulled my quote from a post titled [[https://medium.com/@andrhia/the-problem-with-medium-336300490cbb#.57y5riv8m]['The Problem with Medium']] which appears to be outdated (2013). The [[https://medium.com/policy/medium-terms-of-service-9db0094a1e0f#.knhdc7wfh][current ToS]] are what the previous user was quoting.

With such reasonable terms in place, I'm actually quite surprised we don't see more fiction on Medium. The analytics, accessibility and interface are very impressive.
