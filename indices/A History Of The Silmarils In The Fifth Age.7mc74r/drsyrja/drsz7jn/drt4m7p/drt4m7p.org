Indeed, Scott's weird speculative epileptic-trees-type fiction is some of his best writing (which is saying a lot coming from a massive SSC fan).

Anyone interested in OP's link should also check out (besides [[http://unsongbook.com/][Unsong]], obviously):

[[http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/03/15/answer-to-job/][Answer to Job]] and [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/04/21/universal-love-said-the-cactus-person/][Universal Love, Said the Cactus Person]] which are both very Unsong-like (and that's all I'll say because Unsong spoilers)

[[http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/11/16/hardball-questions-for-the-next-debate/][Hardball Questions For the Next Debate]] which is partly political humor but also very Scott

[[http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/04/03/the-study-of-anglophysics/][The Study of Anglophysics]] which is... kind of hard to explain

[[http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/10/15/it-was-you-who-made-my-blue-eyes-blue/][It Was You Who Made My Blue Eyes Blue]] about that one riddle

[[http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/02/27/a-modern-myth/][A Modern Myth]] which is basically Scott's take on American Gods

[[http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/06/02/and-i-show-you-how-deep-the-rabbit-hole-goes/][...And I Show You How Deep the Rabbit Hole Goes]] based on a tumblr pill CYOA

[[http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/07/a-story-with-zombies/][A Story With Zombies]] about zombies... maybe ;)

[[http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/05/27/transhumanist-fables/][Transhumanist Fables]] which are actually all about AI risk

And there are a few others, just go down [[http://slatestarcodex.com/tag/fiction/][All his posts tagged 'fiction']] or just binge every post on the site like me :P
