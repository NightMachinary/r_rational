[[http://unsongbook.com/][Unsong]] is a book that's available for free online. The premise is that an Apollo mission crashed into and broke the crystal sphere surrounding the world, damaging portions of the celestial machinery, and now magic is leaking back into the world. Companies are using sweatshop labour to try to find Names of God that cause magical effects, so they can copyright them, and Hell is a major geopolitical faction. The majority of the story is set roughly in the present day, but there are many interludes that cover events in the setting's past as well. The exploration of the world and the background are a major part of the story and I don't want to spoil any of it, but it's really good.

There are a few extremely depressing parts, but a lot of it is lighthearted. The author loves puns and references, and it's got a ton of genius bonuses. Probably the worst part is that the main plot advances slowly because of all the time spent filling out background details - but that was a worse flaw when it was being posted slowly, and now that it's finished the pacing decisions are probably less annoying.

I strongly recommend it.
