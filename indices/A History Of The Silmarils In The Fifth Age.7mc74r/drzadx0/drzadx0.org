For an interesting and /really, staggeringly, incredibly long/ treatment of silmarils and the First Age (and probably a lot more), consider [[https://alicornutopia.dreamwidth.org/31812.html][the glowfic constellation [?] /Silmaril/]]. Recommended if you enjoyed /Luminosity/ and /Radiance/, but wished they didn't get to the point so quickly.

Warning: really, really, reallllly long. I'm using it as a break from my academic reading (/Superintelligence/, /Arms and Enlightenment in Revolutionary France/, /Technics and Civilisation/, etc) and don't expect to run out.
