Thanks for reading!

Regarding cio, she's just a reference, but an in-universe one. "cio_cielle" (which isn't even the same name as K6BD's Ciocie Cioelle) is her screenname in just about any online community, not her real name. When, for example, the bookseller refers to her under that name, this is something she edited to protect her identity (which is what the Editor's Note in Chapter 1 is talking about). If I had actually borrowed the character of Ciocie Cioelle, I would have had to flag The Library Unpublished as K6BD fanfic :) (also, I would have had to imitate Ciocie's way of speaking, and I'm not sure I would have done a good job of that)

Ah, there are a few things in effect here. First off, depending on the route M1k takes to reach the computer (91->22...), the Library isn't magical, but mundane, and not actually capable of generating books. And if we do stay in the realm of the mundane, taking the computer at face value, it's actually not possible to generate non-fiction books filled with useful information. Cultural Topology describes only stories, which means the computer can only generate books of fiction.

This means that in the realities in which we take the computer at face value, quite a number of books m1k actually sees have to have been created by hand (such as the textbooks from the Harry Potter universe, or the Anglo-American Cyclopedia).

Do you mean the "reader in invisible writings"? It's the only thing that gives me fitting google results. In that case, I guess I just haven't read enough Prattchet; it would have been a good reference :)
