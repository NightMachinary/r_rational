Just finished bingeing the whole thing, and I've got to say, it's a great read.

I'm still trying to figure out if cio is just a reference, her cannon (KSBD) self, or some bizarre hybrid of the two. The library seems to lean towards the more fantastic side of things, given more trope driven segments of 9, but the lack of marble anywhere in the library points to more mundane super-intelligences.

M1k's recruitment is likewise suspicious, seeing as, taking the computer at face value, after summarizing a few books, you could just generate /how to create an idealized summarization program/. This either casts doubt on the whole speech, which contradicts conservation of detail, which seems to be in full effect in the library, or means we're missing a major aspect of the book generation power.

(Also, disappointed that there weren't any references to the reader of invisible writings)
