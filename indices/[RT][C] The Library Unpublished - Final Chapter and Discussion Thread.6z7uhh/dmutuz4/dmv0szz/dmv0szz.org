  (57), curious about the effects on reality
#+end_quote

That thought raises an interesting point. If the CYOA-weirdness is spatially constrained to the Library, what happens to _sein_? The important thing is that even after m1k rescues _sein_, we don't know whether _sein_ actually escapes (they could still be a cultist in disguise or have other motivations for staying in the Library).

And I don't actually think we have any ending where we can be sure that _sein_ never exited the Library! The cultists could have lied when they claimed _sein_ was dead; even when we know they and m1k had gotten captured, they might have escaped after.

So basically, the presence of _sein_ outside the Library doesn't prove which timeline had happened and I think that means 57) doesn't have any special effects on reality at all.

Regarding your other question: Cio already knows how to summon fictional books; she created The Library Unpublished this way, after all, which means _sein_'s presence is irrelevant to that approach of getting the passwords. I'd assume that she tried and didn't succeed.
