  There's also the audio clip

Indeed. That's an interesting piece of evidence, because it rules out the possibility that no _sein_ ever leaves. Several possible answers: 1. _sein_ always gets out; 2. it is possible to distinguish between Library-timelines because _sein_ sometimes leaves, sometimes not; 3. the audio clip cannot be trusted (perhaps _sein_ was forced to lie while recording that part, because the librarians had already captured them).

  I wonder why it didn't succeed

Basically, Cio wrote "The Book of Answers" as a last resort. The fact that the titular book came to exist in the Library was to be expected; that it turned up at her doorstep was not. There must have been someone in the Library willing to smuggle it out. I'd say that it's not too strange that attempts to hack passwords that way didn't work, even if creating a book full of passwords did work, something which, as you say, is already doubtful enough.

An unrelated question which has been bugging me. Why do you put entire paragraphs into parentheses? You don't always do it, but sometimes you wrap entire posts in such a way. Generally, people use parentheses for digressions, but that's clearly not what you're doing. I'm just curious; if you don't want to answer, you don't have to.
