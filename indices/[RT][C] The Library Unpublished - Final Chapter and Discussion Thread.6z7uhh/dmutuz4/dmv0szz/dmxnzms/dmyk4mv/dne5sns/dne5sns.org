A thought occurred to me: it would be rather fun if, rather than 'never leaves' or 'always leaves' (which could still give information about the source timeline), the apparent 'never leaves' rule in several timelines were in fact 'always leaves (up to) ONCE'--the Library only ever lets one iteration out, presumably by default the one who tries to get out the soonest. (Once /any/ entered person has exited, all other iterations are prevented by some rule of (local?) reality itself.) Granted, that wouldn't explain why not even one version of m1k got out and reconnected with Cio.

Hmm, then the question of whether the book would have even existed, or been delivered, had she specified that it contained only m1k's password/s too... or maybe "...and contains m1k's passwords if and only if such is posible for the Library'...

I tend to use parentheses to make sections into 'asides'; for instance, I might have a main point, but also a side train of thought. For an entire post, it might be 'commenting from the sidelines' in one form or another, such as cheering on an author without necessarily trying to stand forth and press for a response, or lobbing in a few thoughts from the side into a conversation between multiple people without necessarily trying to interrupt the conversation, intrude into the conversation, or otherwise raise my participation status to their same level in that conversation. Contemplating, my use may be describable as being primarily to indicate deference (of one form or another), rather than any display of unwillingness to participate, as I believe I'm fully willing/glad to respond to thoughts on what I've said regardless of whether parenthesised or not.
