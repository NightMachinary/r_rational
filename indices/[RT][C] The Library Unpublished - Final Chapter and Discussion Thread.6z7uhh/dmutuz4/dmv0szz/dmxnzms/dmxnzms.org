(There's also the audio clip from where /sein/ only found a small space and left shortly after entering, if it could be trusted. If both leaving and rescued, multiple _sein_s? Alternatively, perhaps the Library is such that leaving (having entered) is absolutely impossible, with any delusions to the contrary only tricks or wishful thinking. (71) comes to mind, as the path where m1k seems to have the best shot at actually leaving (and the ultimate result).)

The passwords thought was in terms of how to get /sein/'s contact details (from the computer/hard drive?), in order to talk with a hopefully-escaped /sein/ and find out more about m1k that wasn't in the book. I wonder why it didn't succeed... I'm reminded of the doubtful claim of making a curve that the author(?) can't distinguish as distinct from the work described, and the matter of information that the reader doesn't have at time of writing, such as all the encyclopaedia entries in the encyclopaedia with an extra entry (maybe a bad example, since easy to supplement externally).
