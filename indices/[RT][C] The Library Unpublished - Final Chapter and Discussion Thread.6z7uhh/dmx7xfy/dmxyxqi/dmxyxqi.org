(Disclaimer: I'm the author, and I'm answering this mostly because there aren't any other answers yet. Other opinions are still welcome.)

Whether you'd like the plot kind of depends on your personal taste. I think a pretty good Litmus test is whether you liked /The Northern Caves/, a work which is referenced here. It's not necessary to have read /The Northern Caves/, but you do risk getting spoilered for that work.

As far as some kind of objective "quality of writing" goes, I'm not the person to answer that. Just try reading the first few chapters to see whether you like the style :)
