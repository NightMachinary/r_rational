Just a wandering question I had, but assuming a civilization who lives completely underground like mole people or something, what would their maps look like?

Would everyone just make 3D models of the tunnels and huge subterranean caverns that people live in, or something else to handle the fact that height data needs to be included somehow in their maps?
