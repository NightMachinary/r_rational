would they even have visual maps? I imagine a civ that lives totally underground would be super darkness-adapted, to the point where their "writing" would be more like braille anyway

- some sort of varying array of properties ("follow the scent of roses until you smell fungus", or "rough granite, then NW at smooth limestone")
- just get gud and memorize everything, scrub
