Spelunkers have [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_survey][cave survey maps]] and I can't think of any particular reason that an underground civilization wouldn't converge on some of the same techniques. For the most part, you would arrange your map so that it can represent the three-dimensional in two dimensions. Height data can just be noted on the map itself, and most of the time, it's not hugely vital to knowing where things are in relation to each other. You have to remember that a map of a cavern is going to be mostly blank space, since you don't show the rock, and that means that you have lots of room to annotate features (especially height).
