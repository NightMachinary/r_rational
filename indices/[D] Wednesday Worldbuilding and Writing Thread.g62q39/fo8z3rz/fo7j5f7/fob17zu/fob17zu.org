Regulatory Capture. this is when the organization responsibe for a thing is taken over by the thing it is responsible for.

in fiction, this has been done in G I Joe, an episode back in the 80s when cobra took over the government organization that gave the joes funding and red tape. likewise, in Worm the cauldron organization captured the PRT even before it formed. however, it could also be applied to a lot of other things. does your D&D game have an adventurers guild or mages guild? who is to say that some lich has not already captured the organization at some point in the past? superhero game, you could likewise easily have a villian in control of a major organization with authority over the heroes.

its funny how this is a thing, and yet anytime we see it in a story its as a plot twist, rather than a logical conclusion of how such a world would be run. if we start our worldbuilding from an assumption of regulatory capture, then we would more easily get the end state many settings end up in anyway.
