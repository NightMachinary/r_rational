Dungeons are dangerous monster holes, why would they have respawning treasure? If the dungeons respawn themselves, just make it so the treasure doesn't and is tied to the dungeon spawn.

If a dungeon has 5 bosses, killing the sword boss is the only way to loot a sword, and then no more sword mobs appear and the boss doesn't respawn. Killing all the bosses let's you loot the dungeon core, which as pure mana is the most expensive item that can be looted there anyway. And if you don't, the dungeon is empty anyways, so some else will come loot it. If you try to farm loot from normal mobs, assuming they even respawn, maybe their loot doesn't; once you loot 10 daggers that's all the dungeon will ever have.
