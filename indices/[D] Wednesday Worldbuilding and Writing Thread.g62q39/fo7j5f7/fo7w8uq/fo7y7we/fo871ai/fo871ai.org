Eh, I have like 30K words put into it, but don't plan on publishing it for a bit, when I can actually focus on getting chapters out at a reasonable pace. The current focus is only halfway on the dungeon stuff, mostly it's comfy slice-of-life. There are a couple of things that I like about it, the biggest one being that dungeon delvers have to be fully prepared to completely exploit the dungeon before they go in, and dungeon delvers are travelers, encouraged by the system to go seek out new places. It gives a good rhythm to the life of a dungeoneer.
