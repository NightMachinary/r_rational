I've been reading a fair bit of isekai/dungeon lite-lit and the most common solution is that indeed strong governing bodies regulate access to dungeons. Either state or adventurers guild.

Do you really need the dungeons to be shut down? Just accept that they are in fact a natural ressource that can be exploited and run with those implications.

If you want to go with shutdown, active dungeons could just deplete environmental mana, thus harming life on the surface.
