In a fantasy world where 'dungeons' of some variety pop up full of monsters and treasures, what could keep the powerful players of the world from just farming them for profit? Other than them being so dangerous or popping up so frequently that it's seen as an actual existential threat, I don't see how you make sure everyone keeps shutting them down instead of just sitting on them and getting rich.

Solo Leveling solves it by having the boss monster come out of the dungeon to wreak havoc on civilians after a timer runs out, and killing the boss monster closes the dungeon. But that feels a bit artificial (I love Solo Leveling, don't get me wrong, I'm just not a fan specifically of the boss being locked inside the dungeon until a timer runs out).

So what other properties could dungeons have that make it so the rich and powerful would want all or most of them shut down immediately, even though there is plenty of magic treasure inside them?
