You'd probably need several kinds of map: maps for navigation, where all that matters is the graph of connections; maps for caverns, where regularish paper maps /probably/ suffice; and maps for people doing excavation, which are probably fancy 3D-recreation-equivalents

Maps for navigation are essentially just string tied together to show the graph of tunnel connections. They don't necessarily need to be to scale, though good/big/fancy ones probably are. Portable maps of this style are rigged up in a collapsible frame so that it can be compactly stored and then expanded out to check directions when you get to a junction and need to figure out which way to go.
