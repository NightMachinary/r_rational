There's a whole lot of it (I think it's still longer than Wake of the Ravager? imo there's about a trilogy plus half a book of content), and although it ends in kinda the middle of something the author had also written himself into a corner by having the main character(s) optimize themselves so heavily that things are kinda grindingly paranoid, sorta like the soul magic parts of Worth the Candle. He was right to take a few steps back imo.
