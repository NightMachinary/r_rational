The Outer Sphere (story by the same author as Wake of the Ravager, but currently on hiatus) solves it thusly:

Dungeons are living entities from another dimension that burrow into the planet. Should a dungeon reach the planet's core, globally bad but (IIRC) unspecified things will happen - probably something along the lines of banishing the whole planet to the shadow realm or something like that.

Dungeons are also super tricky and very dedicated to their cause, so even if you /think/ you've managed to stop one or negotiate with it, you probably haven't.

Also the core of a dungeon is worth more than the value you'd get out of a few century's worth of production from a young dungeon, so there's that too.
