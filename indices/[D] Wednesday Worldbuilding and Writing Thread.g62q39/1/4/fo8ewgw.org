instead of having a single “boss” escape from the dungeon, you could instead have occasional less organized monster raids come out and terrorize local villages looting and enslaving local populations. It could be similar to barbarian “invasions” of Rome.

Whatever you do, you have to make the incentive to destroy dungeons either actively destructive, or too unpredictable and terrible to allow (similar to a natural disaster). Otherwise, local powers would eventually adapt, becoming able to profit off said dungeon.
