The monsters respawn but the treasure doesn't. The optimal way to exploit the dungeon is to sweep the entire thing at once with overwhelming force, because it reduces the amount of time monsters have to respawn. The major powers do this, but it takes time to point an army at something, so small bands of adventurers have time to sneak in and take whatever they can first.

That does imply a loot system that feels more like a traditional roguelike than like an MMO. You don't kill monsters for their drops, you kill them because they're between you and the loot. And tool-using monsters are very inconsistently dangerous because they're usually armed with wooden clubs but sometimes one finds Excalibur.

  Other than them being so dangerous or popping up so frequently that it's seen as an actual existential threat

Bordering on this thing you said to avoid a bit: if the dungeon's threat level keeps increasing the longer it's around, someone will need to clear it before it becomes a threat, even though no dungeons (near civilization?) are actual threats.
