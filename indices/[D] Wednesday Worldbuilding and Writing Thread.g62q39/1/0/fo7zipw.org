The usual solution seems to be to give high level people better ways to profit than farm low level dungeons. And make high level adventuring time consuming and dangerous enough to limit the number of high level people in the world.

Also, modern readers always seem to underestimate how little information dissemination there was in middle age society. Even with magic, or even with institutionalized magic, it takes a lot of effort to even know where all the dungeons in the world are. It's not as simple as just looking up the list on the internet, hopping on a plane to run over and farm it. The world's a big place.
