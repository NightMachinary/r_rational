It's like all the worst parts of an intelligence agency turned to 11 and thrown in a blender. It's an excellent parody, but anyone who worked in a "progressive" government office will be horrified by how well it mimics the idiocy and incompetence inherent to them.

All in all a good job, if a bit ham handed.
