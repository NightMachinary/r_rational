I love Stargate! It does make a lot more sense than pretty much any other popular sci-fi franchise of the last few decades. One of the things it did a lot was to dissect and subvert the tendency towards "Awesome but Impractical" tech that very advanced species seem to have in fiction. The MP5 is definitively superior to most other handheld weaponry they encounter, even though most species dismiss it as a "primitive rock-thrower".
