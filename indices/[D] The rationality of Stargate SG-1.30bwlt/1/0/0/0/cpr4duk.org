Oh no, not that.

It's that sometimes they needed Daniel anyway, and there didn't seem to be any pattern to it.

Also, you have to explain why, in the film, they needed Daniel to translate on Abydos but, in the series, they didn't need Daniel to translate on Abydos.

Not that this would matter much in an r!Stargate, but if you're trying to explain canon itself then you run into issues.
