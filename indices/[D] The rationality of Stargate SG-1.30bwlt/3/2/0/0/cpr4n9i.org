  That would make more sense... I am pretty sure the show described it as the ancients encountering the evolutionary predecessors of humans. I am pretty sure canon (TV-show, I've never read the books) only mentions interbreeding, however I've seen fanfics that described them as genetically modifying the early humans to be more like the ancients and/or interbreedable with them.

Canonically, Both.

Humans were engineered by Ancients, or at least their predecessors were, hundreds of thousands of years ago.

Then, in about 8000 BC, the refugees from Atlantis returned to Earth after the loss of the war with the Wraith. Some of them ascended, others crossbred with the new existing humans.

This is the origin of the ATA gene in the modern human population, and it is why it is only in Tau'ri or Pegasus natives.
