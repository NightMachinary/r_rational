Atlantis was on and left Earth in 5-10 million BC. This is shown in a flashback in episode 1 of Stargate Atlantis.

They left around the same time the rest of the ancients in the Milky Way were dying from the ancient plague.

They then went to Pegasus, where they explicitly did create Human life.

While it is never directly said that they in whole or in part modified the development of Earth, they were the first evolution of the human form, and had proven to be able to create more humans when needed, and they were on Earth and in the Milky Way for 40 million years.
