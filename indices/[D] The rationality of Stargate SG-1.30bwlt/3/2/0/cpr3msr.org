  No, that doesn't quite cover it. They're able to communicate even in episodes where they travel by ship. Unless the gates supposedly effect everything within a few lightyears of their position. Nice thought, though.

Yeah, it doesn't quite work with the show as it is. However, ff you were doing a rationalist take on it, you could use this idea to keep events fairly consistent with the show. You would need to remember that they need translator technology when on ships or otherwise away from the gate. I think the Gouald had some kind of translator tech... maybe they could use this in a rational!fic?

  I thought they explained this in the show, that humans were actually created by the ancients.

That would make more sense... I am pretty sure the show described it as the ancients encountering the evolutionary predecessors of humans. I am pretty sure canon (TV-show, I've never read the books) only mentions interbreeding, however I've seen fanfics that described them as genetically modifying the early humans to be more like the ancients and/or interbreedable with them.
