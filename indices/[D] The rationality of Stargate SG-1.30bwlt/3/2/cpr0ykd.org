  Telepathic function of the gates?
#+end_quote

No, that doesn't quite cover it. They're able to communicate even in episodes where they travel by ship. Unless the gates supposedly effect everything within a few lightyears of their position. Nice thought, though.

  Explain more about Goauld Politics
#+end_quote

I totally agree. They seem to operate somewhat independently, but also with a kind of feudal system. Some of the Tok'ra episodes started to explain their politics and tendencies, but it still divided the species along strict lines of 'good' and 'evil', with no real in-between.

  limitations or dangers of timetravel
#+end_quote

That's one thing we never see happen. The leaders of the Stargate program know that time travel exists, but they never really get into the possible uses or rules for it. Aside from just putting the time machine in a locked room until they /really/ need it, that is.

  Convergent evolution... with the ancients
#+end_quote

I thought they explained this in the show, that humans were actually created by the ancients. They were leaving the planet, going to their magic energy sky palace, but some of them wanted to leave something behind. So, they created a species that would look just like them and could potentially follow in their footsteps.
