I liked Universe a lot, mostly because of the atmosphere. It went right back to the roots of the Stargate series, where people are thrown into a situation with technology they barely understand and motives they can only guess at. It also has the stranded-on-a-desert-island vibe, so it was cool watching the crew figure out what they needed to do to survive. I would recommend it, though you may find yourself wanting more when you reach the end of the limited run of episodes.
