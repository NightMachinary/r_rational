  lso, you have to explain why, in the film, they needed Daniel to translate on Abydos but, in the series, they didn't need Daniel to translate on Abydos.

I assumed Daniel taught them English during his time living there. And any Goauld could have learned English by briefly taking an English-speaking host. The real question is why the Jaffa (like Tealc) or the other human populations could speak English before they could have learned it.
