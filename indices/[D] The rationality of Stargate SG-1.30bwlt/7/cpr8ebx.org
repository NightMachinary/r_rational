Loved Stargate SG1 as a kid, recently rewatched all of it. I think it's an excellent show, and they did a really good job of remaining creative in terms of the encounters / types of episodes they have. Good mixture of things happening and character development etc etc.

Watched some of Atlanis but never got that enthralled. Is Stargate Universe any good?
