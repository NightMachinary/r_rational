  Explain more about the Goauld Politics and Politics with the Asgard and Earth to justify why they don't repeat the blackhole dialed stargate into sun trick more often (and other OP tricks or uses of tech like that).

Because if they used it once, the Goauld have no idea what was done or how they did it. If they use it more times, maybe the Goauld figure out how it works and just wipe earth off the planet. Plus, earth was never in as dire a situation again after that point. So it could have always been a "last minute backup plan".
