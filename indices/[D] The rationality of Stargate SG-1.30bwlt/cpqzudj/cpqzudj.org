I agree with all you comments pretty much. I really liked the show.

Telepathic function of the gates? If it provided enough to understand the basic language, but no idioms, it would explain why they still needed Daniel Jackson for communication sometimes but not normally. It would also mean that they need to have other communication plans when they are away from the gate.

Other stuff to reconstruct...

Whenever a tech doesn't show up again, mention problems with adapting or reverse engineering it.

Explain more about the Goauld Politics and Politics with the Asgard and Earth to justify why they don't repeat the blackhole dialed stargate into sun trick more often (and other OP tricks or uses of tech like that).

Have them speculate on limitations or dangers of timetravel and develop a policy about it to explain why the don't ever risk abusing it more. (But are willing to risk it other times)

The whole convergent evolution into a biologically compatible form with the ancients... my head-canon is that human life actually originated on earth and the ancients descended from time-traveling humans (who went back in time). The only thing that could be construed as evidence for this is the ancient's taboo against time travel, the fact that the ancients have a civilization so old they can't remember their own origins, and the fact that the convergent evolution explanation is completely implausible without introducing other factors... (As another alternative... perhaps the ascended realm is actively manipulating the physical universe to create humanoid beings that can eventually ascend?)
