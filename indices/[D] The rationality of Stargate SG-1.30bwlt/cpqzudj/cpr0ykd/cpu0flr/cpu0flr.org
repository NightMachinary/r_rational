Maybe an AU from season 4 that has Osiris and Tanneth represent a rival goa'uld faction, rather than just mooks for Anubis.

Also, when we see certain villains in isolation they seem more relatable, Baal collaborates with the SGC, fat goa'uld scientist guy seems more bumbling than villainous, and Todd is tentatively allied to Atlantis.
