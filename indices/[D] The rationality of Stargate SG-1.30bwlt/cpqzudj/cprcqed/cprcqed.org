  Telepathic function of the gates?
#+end_quote

There was a fanfic that I read (forgot which) that hypothesized that the gates rewrite your brain to understand a common language, but it's meant for Ancients-and-similar, and as a result the feature caused brain damage in the Goa'uld, gradually turning them into the lovable megalomaniacs we know now.
