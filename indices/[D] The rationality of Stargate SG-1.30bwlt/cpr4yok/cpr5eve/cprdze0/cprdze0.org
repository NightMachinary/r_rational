We're talking about technology that we, currently, can only wave a stick at. Also, unless I am mistaken, most of the 'species' in stargate are actually humans. If you design a system of transport that can transport beings from solar system to solar system, and make the technology durable enough to last millennia, then it would seem to me to be foolish to /not/ include some sort of translation package to keep vastly diverged languages from becoming an impediment to peaceful interactions between representatives of the different solar systems.

I think that the chances of human populations separated from one another for many, many generations being able to speak to one another with little difficulty is far less possible than the idea of a technology we do not understand making communications possible. The airplane can't make the natives speak our language, but you can certainly buy a book of phrases from the shop in the airport.
