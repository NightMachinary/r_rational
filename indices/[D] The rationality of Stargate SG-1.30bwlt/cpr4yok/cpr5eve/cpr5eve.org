I wouldn't agree that its the most rational explanation. Let's say you hop in a plane and fly somewhere very remote, and find that the people there speak English. Is the most rational explanation that the airplane reconfigured your brain to understand their language? No, it's that someone before you visited them and taught them English.

The brain is extremely complicated, and different for each species. It's unlikely that the Stargate system was designed to be able to figure out how the brains of different species work, and do it well enough to change how they process language.
