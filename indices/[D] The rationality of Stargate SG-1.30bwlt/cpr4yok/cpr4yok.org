There are some comments about the common language issue, but I don't see anyone saying what seems to be the most rational thing to me. When you pass through a stargate, your brain is rewritten to include a modification to the language center that allows you to translate multiple standard languages. Instant babelfish. Some languages or text might still might require translation.
