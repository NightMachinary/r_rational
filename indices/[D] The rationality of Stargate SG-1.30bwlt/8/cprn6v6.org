  Now, this is not to say that the show doesn't have big problems. It never gives a good explanation as to how everyone in the galaxy speaks English.

The movie made a nod in that direction by having everyone speak a language close to Egyptian. And this makes sense if the Goa'uld ruled that region during that timeperiod, though we'd then expect Egyptian to be a linguistic isolate. The Goa'uld would keep a static language of administration; the Jaffa would all speak it; there should be a decent supply of human slaves that speak it. Furthermore, since the Goa'uld territories are widespread and many of the other races are fighting against them, there should be people who speak this language in pretty much every race.

However, being a lingua franca or the language of administration isn't the same as having most everyone speak it. The Hittite Empire had a Hittite language, but I believe Hattic was the language of administration, and most of the people typically spoke Luwian. We can imagine, though, that the Goa'uld, insisting on being able to interrogate even the lowest slave, would insist that everyone speak Egyptian on pain of pain.

Furthermore, you can pretend that the entire Stargate base operates in Egyptian and English interchangeably.

Independent planets would still pose a significant communications problem.
