What would be the implications of a relatively widely available machine giving you access to a virtual environment that would allow for time compression, i.e. for every hour objective time, 2-4 hours virtual time would pass?

While the factor of compression is important, obviously, it's a factor that may be variable between virtual environment. How would that impact society?

I'm wondering since I've been reading a lot of litRPG these last few weeks, and time compression is a common staple of the genre. Yet I've not seen this part really explored. You have these MMORPGs where players play many hours subjective while only a few objective pass. While that is nice to have for a game, and it makes sense from a narrative perspective, there are so many implications for this outside of games.

For instance I could see economic pressures for head-only jobs to spend their time in virtual environments to make use of the time compression, so they accomplish more work per objective time. On the other hand, if mental fatigue is affected, this may also translate to an inverse effect, shorter work objective hours for those with head only jobs, since you can only do constant 24 virtual hour shifts pushing virtual paper for so long before you get burned out, despite working /only/ 8 hours objective.

On the other hand you could have physical labor workers being encouraged to spend their free time in time compression to relax and, uhm, â€˜decompress' better, so to speak.

On the gripping hand, what if time compressed sleep is just as reviving as regular sleep? There's be a huge incentive to research and develop this capability.

And on the vestigial hand, what if the brain was able to experience only so many waking hours, and the time compression would effectively decrease the awake/asleep-ratio of people?

I'm obviously not listing every case, but what do you think would happen in a world with such a technology, how it would develop?

Incidentally, I kept the time compression intentionally relatively small, since this wasn't meant to be a hyberbaric time chamber or anything like that, but somewhat remotely congruent with current science.
