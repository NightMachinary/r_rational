I'm not sure if [[/u/alexanderwales][u/alexanderwales]]' idea would let figure it out it for certain. A timeline where no object was sent to the past is still possible in multiple-timelines model; you could see it if you draw a graph. It would matter in a /probabilistic/ sense, I suppose: if there's 100 acts of time-travel in all, then the probability of finding yourself in a timeline indistinguishable from the overwritten_model!timeline is 1%. The more cases of objects coming from the future you see, the less probable multiple-timelines hypothesis becomes, but you can never be /certain/ it's wrong.

  what if the ability only allows himself to time-travel and he can't send anything else back in time? Is it still possible to differentiate between the two possibilities?

I don't think so. In multiple-timelines model, you would always find yourself in that 1/[number of acts of time-travel] timeline that is indistinguishable from overwritten one.
