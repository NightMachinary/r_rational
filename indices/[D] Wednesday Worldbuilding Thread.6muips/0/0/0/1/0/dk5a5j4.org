  A timeline where no object was sent to the past is still possible in multiple-timelines model; you could see it if you draw a graph.

This statement is ambiguous to me.

Assuming that our multiple timelines model can be accurately drawn using a binary tree, then there will always be a timeline in which things have only disappeared into the subjective past, never come from the subjective future. However, this only serves to confirm to our hypothetical researcher that he's in the multiple timeline model (unless he's not confident that he actually has a time machine, in which case he might think that he's merely destroying the objects put into the machine). If the researcher can hop into the machine, he can confirm for himself that objects are not destroyed, though this is obviously dangerous.

There also necessarily exists a timeline where things have arrived from the subjective future but have never been sent to the subjective past ... but if the researcher has a time machine and exists in such a universe, then it's as simple as using the time machine once to prove the single timeline model (thereby creating a new universe which will contain a researcher who has never sent anything to the past, but that's the other guy's problem).
