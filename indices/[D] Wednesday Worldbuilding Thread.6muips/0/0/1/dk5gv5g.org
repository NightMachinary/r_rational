Incidentally, I also came to the converse conclusion on one occasion - that is, that the multiple timeline model will only show you things going to the past, and only very rarely things coming from the future. This was sort of my solution to the "where are all the time travelers" problem - that traveling back in time only creates an infinitesimal probability of your appearance there; essentially 0 for someone at that time, but obviously 1 for you, if you understand what I'm saying. It's as if there are essentially infinity duplicates of the moment in time where you /don't/ appear in your time machine, and using your time machine to travel back to that moment only creates /one/ moment in time where you /do/. This incidentally means that if you witness the appearance of a time traveler, you have been present at a statistically miraculous event.
