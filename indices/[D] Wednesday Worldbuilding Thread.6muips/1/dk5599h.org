So, one of my vampires (William) identifies as catholic - not super devout, of course, since as a vampire he does the whole "murdering people to eat" thing, and he believes a whole bunch of megalomanical stuff in general (e.g. divine right of kings). He believes on some level that his vampire body is an animated soulless corpse, and his soul is already in heaven enjoying paradise because he was a good, faithful person in life (he hopes). So to him, his current life is "hedonism" in its purest form, so to speak.

Keeping aside that Christianity has changed a lot since the dark ages when he was born, I'm trying to work out whether vampires would have their own catholic church equivalent, or whether they'd attend the human institutions. The idea of vampires having their own catholic church, when My Vampires went through a population bottleneck of ~800 vampires around the year 1650, seems a bit silly. Plus, jesus and all that did come to save /humanity/, not vampire-anity. Then again: if William is a religious vampire, there are surely others, and there might be priests who were turned since the bottle neck, or turned priests who survived it (then AGAIN, [[/u/ccc_037]] had the wonderful idea that the bottleneck might have been /caused/ by a religious vampire, and that vampire distaste for religious iconography is because they associate that with the Catastrophe that killed 90+% of vampires rather than because it has any power over them, so in that case William's religiosity might be a closely guarded secret...)

Anyway, I'm not really sure if this was appropriate to post in a worldbuilding thread, but I have been thinking about it the past few days and I find these threads really useful for forcing me to articulate my ideas/thoughts and for brainstorming in general. So call this "Wednesday Worldbuilding with Brainstorming Posts from [[/u/MagicWeasel]] Thread" if you like... ;)

--------------

Background on why I'm asking this:

I never expected William's religion to come into it - it was just something I kept in the background. But my husband was doing some beta-reading and we got into discussions about how the story doesn't show the /personality/ of my characters as much as my IRL descriptions of the motivations for things, so I showed him some dumb drabbles I wrote to get plot bunnies out, and he thought that those little moments of character/etc that I thought were silly really humanised the characters. For example, he enjoyed a real half-assed "attending confession" scene I wrote for William where he just listed a bunch of sins he'd committed.

In light of the above I decided I wanted to try putting a short little "interlude" in between each "real" chapter, and these interludes would contain just kind of one-shot or out of left field things, maybe half a page. And the confession scene made a lot of sense at the beginning of the story - it's a romance, and while you get the love interest (Red)'s impressions about how he feels about the whole thing, you don't get much of William's point of view. For Reasons, William wouldn't really have anyone he could talk to, but going to confession would totally work. It kind of makes sense that a vampire would go talk to a human about things they needed privacy for, because they have ways to keep them from spilling secrets to even other vampires.

Of course, no longer being catholic myself, I have faint memories of what confession was like 12 years ago, but I don't seem to think that there's any reason that the confession scene can't include the priest giving the confessor "counselling"/"advice"/etc, i.e. having a sort of conversation with them.
