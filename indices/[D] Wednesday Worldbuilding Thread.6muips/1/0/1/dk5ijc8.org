Thanks for the comment! You've given me a lot to ponder.

  Would they be the equivalent of a separate faith that follows Catholic traditions, similar to Anglicans?
#+end_quote

It would be more, "each individual vampire has their own separate faith that follows X traditions, where X is a combination of the specific faith they grew up with (at any point in history) and what they have decided they liked / didn't like during the periodical "reboots" that religions have" - so the idea of the vampires having a catholic church, or William /being/ catholic in any meaningful sense, is kind of stupid.

This is why I said William "identifies as" catholic - no doubt /he/ thinks that he's the /right sort of catholic/, whatever that means to him, and that having church services in the local language rather than latin or whatever are aberrations to the True Faith, but they're as close as he's going to get and he's /so special/ and /so wonderful/ that The One True God will understand he had to do the best he could.

  If the Catholic Church knows about the vampires
#+end_quote

I'm not opposed to this on principle (though it could get pretty Da Vinci Code if there's secret vampire infiltration of the catholic church), but in my mind William is essentially brainwashing individual priests to secrecy whenever he feels the urge to "confess", so it does not require the church to know.

#+begin_quote
  I think the most realistic option, aside from vampires just using Catholic services and pretending that they're keeping the faith (similar to Easter and Christmas Catholics)
#+end_quote

This is William for sure: confession when he needs to talk about something that he feels vulnerable about without having to risk it being used against him someday, church services when he's bored / interested / looking for prey / feeling like it's been a while

#+begin_quote
  like-minded vampires that are attempting to maintain their culture having Catholic-ish services similar to lay ecclesial ministry
#+end_quote

OOOOooo. I like /this/ very much. It could definitely be something that William was doing before the Catastrophe, as there'd be a decent number of Catholic-during-the-dark-ages vampires living that he'd have the appropriate cultural connections to. Then the Catastrophe happens and he loses most of his friends, and such lay ministry may have become quite taboo depending on the exact nature of the Catastrophe (I am not really interested in telling the story of the Catastrophe or anything else "historical" in my setting: I was barely interested in telling the origin story of William and Red's romance because I thought writing a story set in the 1940s would be too boring, but it turned out to be actually really interesting).

It provides some context for perhaps some of William's closest pre-Catastrophe friends and their values, and moreover ways they might have previously come into conflict with others, and that's awesome. It's hard when your main character is 1500 years old to try to figure out how he filled the time, and I'm slowly patching things together.
