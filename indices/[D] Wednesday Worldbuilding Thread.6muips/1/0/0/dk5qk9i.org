I am a Catholic; I haven't made a great study of Catholic history, but perhaps I can help out a little here.

  They wouldn't have a pope, right?

The Catholic church has only one Pope. It's very much an individual role. If there's a vampire pope, then they're a separate but (presumably) related Church.

Under the Pope comes the Cardinals. They're also the ones who elect the new Pope, and form his advisors. Then there are the Archbishops. Each Archbishop is responsible for a particular area - these are quite large areas. Then there are the Bishops; these are generally responsible for smaller areas. Then there are Priests - one or two working in a given church. Then there are the Deacons, who can act to assist the Priest in certain ways.

The Catholic Church does keep records, and would eventually notice if a given priest, bishop, or other member of the clergy seemed to hang around for a few centuries or so. But a member of the congregation who moves every twenty or thirty years could probably quietly attend a succession of churches without drawing major attention.

That might well have worked, too, right up until the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Vatican_Council][Second Vatican Council]]. See, the Second Vatican Council made a few important changes - such as no longer doing the Mass /entirely/ in Latin, but rather doing it in a language familiar to the congregation (so that people understand what's going on), and removing the rules about abstaining from meat on all Fridays.

Some people... objected to this. And [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditionalist_Catholic][still object to this day]]. A vampire would, I imagine, /most likely/ be a traditionalist of some sort; in extreme cases, perhaps even a sedevacantist (one who believes that the Second Vatican Council was outright heresy and that no-one who accepts said teachings can be a valid Pope).
