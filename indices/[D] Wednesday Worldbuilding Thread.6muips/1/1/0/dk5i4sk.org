The potential that he's wrong, habit, tradition (all the above require confession to have been part of catholic traditions c 600 CE, so maybe not), desire to support the church somehow, guilt (catholics are MASTERS of that one), coping mechanism for not being able to trust other vampires (can't trust priests either, but ghoul them to you as a one-time action and you can swear them to secrecy and other vampires can't "overwrite" it, so it's the same thing).

Why specifically priests and confession I don't know; the sort of scene I had in mind could just as well be served by William going to a bar and chatting with one of the locals.

Then again (more thinking aloud): he doesn't view humans as equals (well, yet), whereas at least priests have (theoretically) divine support, which means they're better than mere humans. That could well go a way to explaining it.
