If he thought he could be wrong, he'd tone down the killing a lot. Habit andtradition would have worn off in the past few centuries.

This seems... possible. (Instead of ghouling the priest, he could simply be intending to kill the priest once he's done - dead men tell no tales, after all).

  Why specifically priests and confession I don't know; the sort of scene I had in mind could just as well be served by William going to a bar and chatting with one of the locals.
