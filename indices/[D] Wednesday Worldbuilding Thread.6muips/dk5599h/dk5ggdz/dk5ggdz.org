What would it mean for them to have their own Catholic church? They wouldn't have a pope, right? Where would their authority derive from? Would they be the equivalent of a separate faith that follows Catholic traditions, similar to Anglicans?

If the Catholic Church knows about the vampires, it might make sense for them to appoint one as a ... well, my knowledge of Catholic org charts fails me, but one vampire appointed as the spiritual leaders of the other vampires, answerable to a higher authority in the Church?

I think the most realistic option, aside from vampires just using Catholic services and pretending that they're keeping the faith (similar to Easter and Christmas Catholics), would be to have like-minded vampires that are attempting to maintain their culture having Catholic-/ish/ services similar to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lay_ecclesial_ministry][lay ecclesial ministry]]. So you've got someone who isn't ordained doing church services, basically.

(Note: I am not currently and have never been a member of the Catholic Church, apologies for any of this that's just flat out wrong.)
