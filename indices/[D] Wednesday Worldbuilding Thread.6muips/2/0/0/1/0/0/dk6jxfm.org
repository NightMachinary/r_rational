  I'm not trying to make game rules that create a game which resembles the real world, or even game rules intended to hook in a player, I'm trying to make game rules that hijack the reader's pleasure centers as efficiently as possible. I don't even need to worry about suspension of disbelief, because the reader is meant to be fully aware that these are mechanics - anything that reinforces that its a game rather than real life is a feature, not a bug.

Mechanics that are based on nothing but "balance" can be viewed with confusion and anger by players who consider the developers to be acting merely on baseless whim and fancy, and who expect mechanics to have at least /some/ basis that they can understand. That basis may be real life, or it may be the fictional literature on which the game is patterned---but it /definitely/ can't be anything as esoteric as Skinner boxes and game theory.

As long as some territory exists---as long as the game isn't a jumble of numbers totally divorced from everything else---players expect the game to be a representation of it with at least /some/ faithfulness. Even in a game as abstract as /Tetris/, some versions have gravity affect blocks that aren't connected to the walls (called the "Cascade" mechanic, IIRC), while others do not.

  Giving them xp as an incentive will get players moving in preferred directions so there aren't bitter forum posts about how "the most efficient thing to do is just slog through the grind".

...and, in turn, will prompt bitter forum posts complaining about a lack of player freedom and an excess of nonsensical railroading and undeserved rewards. The question is: Which opinion has more adherents among the players?

  You're playing the game, you get into character, you invest yourself in the story, and not only is that rewarding on your own, but you get an extra reward on top of it!

"Oh, look. The developers /actually/ are /screenwriters/, and I'm their protagonist. Now that I've gone through the predetermined motions, I get a pat on the head for being an obedient little Tom Cruise. Yay." How many players want to be /real boys/ instead of /puppets/, though?

Well, I'm not well-versed in any arguments for universal basic income.
