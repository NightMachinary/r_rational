I dislike these. They have nothing to do with the skills or attributes of the character---so why should they grant experience points toward those skills and attributes? In my opinion, if they're considered at all, they should contribute only to "personality experience points" that can be spent /only/ on personality traits and /only/ on traits that match the roleplaying or decisions (e.g., if you start a game with several 100% Paragon decisions, you can't suddenly switch to 100% Renegade later, because you've already locked in Paragon-aligned personality traits---but you can regress to 50% Paragon decisions in an attempt to remove those Paragon personality traits).

I don't even understand how that term makes any sense. If you're talking about characters or factions in which you can slowly build up trust, it doesn't make any sense to call that trust meter "experience points", because it can drop precipitously at the drop of a hat when you betray those characters or factions. If you're talking about a general "fame" statistic, I have the same opinion: The number goes up in fits and starts whenever you do something major, and gradually declines as people forget about you and think about other things, while "experience points" typically rise almost 100% of the time and fall only extremely rarely (when forced to do so by level-draining monsters or resurrection).

[[http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/costanza-jpg-george-costanza-reaction-face][/Literally/ leveling up for doing nothing??]] It might be tolerable in a survival game in which constant conflict (with wild animals, zombies, starvation, etc.) is a basic assumption---but, outside that genre, the concept is worth nothing but a laugh.

It seems redundant when a character already can steal some gold to pay for training.
