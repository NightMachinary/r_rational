I like them... occasionally. I dont want to see ever skill rank, I dont want to know that mid fight your character recieved his 500th skill rank in jumping. But I also love when you hear someone bragging about how good they are, and you can go and find the MC's skill level to put it in perspective.

So, want a huge character sheet? Go for it, but put it out of the way, and make it IN ADDITION to the story, not required reading.

Good uses for a skill rank: Comparing between enemies, so you know how outclassed someone is. (Frequently Ive seen it mean "Bouncer over there is 200 levels above me, im not picking a fight) a source of a goal/tension. (I can almost do X, I just need to leave and train more) Pacing. (This PVP area is resricted to levels 55+ with at least 3 combat skills at level 100)
