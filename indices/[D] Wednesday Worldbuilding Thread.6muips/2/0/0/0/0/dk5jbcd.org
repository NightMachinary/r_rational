So something like "*One-handed weapons increased to 23!*" does nothing for you?

I think in terms of actual writing the mechanics stay mostly in the background, but with occasional flashes of a character sheet, and transcriptions of in-game logging to mark advancement and work some of that Skinner boxing on the reader of the story.

Plus using achievements/afflictions/boons as a method of conveying story truths, adding drama, or adding comedy (e.g. the main character agrees to shepard a wizard across the wastes and an ominous achievement "Deal with the Devil ..." pops up).

... and then there are mechanics like faction reputations, NPC favor, base-building, companions, etc. to consider, which are part of the complete reward system package, though I'm not sure how to deal with that.
