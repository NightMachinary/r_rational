A LitRPG I enjoy is [[http://blastron01.tumblr.com/kumoko-contents][I'm A Spider, So What?]], and it has this kind of system, where there are /tons/ of skills and they're all tracked. These days, every time kumoko calls up her status it's a giant list of skills and I have a hard time evaluating things because there's no coherent order. That's a matter of logistics, though, and if you can organize the skills properly it shouldn't matter how many there are.

As for the skinner box levelups, I am one of those people whose reward system ticks on from hearing the likes of "*One-handed weapons increased to 23!*". Obsessively rattling it off mid-battle would suffocate the action (though is perfect for lulls in battle or in small doses), and hearing every single levelup would bog things down anyways, but using the levelups to give a sense of reward or to help show progress (/"X reached level 7" oh, and by the way I've been practicing my X skill today/) is useful and validating. At early stages, when you only have a handful of skills, by all means report every levelup, it's significant, but once you have dozens of skills you only need to invoke them intermittently.
