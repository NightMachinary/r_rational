  I'm guessing given the example you mean that it comes with a concept of "skill xp"

This is my personal opinion, but please avoid having different XP categories for individual skills. One of the biggest mistakes I see LitRPGs make is to give their characters a massive list of skills with their own independent values that as a reader I'm somehow expected to interpret. The actual video game mechanics are almost always aesthetic; From a rational perspective, I never see them used in a particularly clever way, so they should probably be kept to a minimal style as much as possible.
