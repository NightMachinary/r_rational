  as well as extending the power fantasy as far as possible

Games vary pretty wildly in terms of how much of a power fantasy they are. On one extreme, you have single player RPGs that are explicitly designed in such a way that every single encounter is somehow beatable, and if you spend the time to overlevel yourself, you can trivialize everything but endgame encounters. As an example of this, Pokemon is set up so that nearly every single opponent can be easily beaten through regular play, without a single party wipe. On the other extreme, you have competitive multiplayer FPS or dogfighting games where, in a 1v1, all your gear will be the same, so with even a minor skill differential, a superior opponent will win (almost) every single time. For example, CS:GO.

Somewhere in the middle lie MMOs. The vast majority of any player's time is spent killing AI specifically designed to be beatable (by a level appropriate party.) PVP encounters can still happen, but they can be optimized for by having above-average gear, and only targeting players that you know you can beat. Thus, every encounter is still "beatable", contributing to the power fantasy.

So, abstracted, your game mechanics should:\\
* Have individual mobs be unquestionably worse than the player character (or than the player character + their party). This establishes the "power" of the player character. * Have the primarly, credible threat to player characters be large groups of enemies (such as a boss + adds, or massive swarms of minions.) This allows you to show the player character plausibly struggling, but, as the obvious underdog, still makes even their barest, hardest won-victories still "badass." * Allow the player character to get into fights with multiple, lower level players for the same reason as above. * Allow for the player character to only engage other individual /similarly leveled/ player characters when the player has reason to suspect that they'd win the fight

That last point is particularly important, because it allows you to keep the power fantasy going without explicitly making your character a god-tier mary sue. You can have arbitrarily high amounts of players more powerful than the PC, but so long as the player can decide to simply not fight them, the power fantasy keeps going.

To provide an example from personal experience, I used to play an MMO called [[https://www.planetside2.com/home]["Planetside 2"]]. Now, planetside 2 differs from nearly every other MMO in that it's actually an MMOFPS. There /are/ equipment differences, but at the infantry level they mostly just give you a slight edge. So you're on a level playing field with all ~600 enemy players, and there aren't any AI to farm. And the thing is, I'm only a fairly middling FPS player.

But the other thing about planetside 2 is that it allows you to pull vehicles. More specifically, I constantly used something called an "ESF", a helicopter/fighter jet equivalent. Now, those things were considerably less versatile than infantry, and considerably less powerful than other, heavier vehicles, but their primary advantage was pure manueverability. Except against other ESFs, I was the person who got to choose when a fight started, and if I realized it wasn't winnable, when it ended. It didn't matter than I couldn't (usually) engage tanks, and infantry inside buildings were untouchable, because when I /did/ get into a 1v1, I tended to win.

And I'm willing to bet that sort of 1v1 dominance will be what resonates with readers looking for wish fulfillment. Because in FPS games, or MOBAs, it's every player's fantasy to "carry" the rest of their team to victory, contributing the preponderance of damage, or kills, or objective time, or whatever metric is used by the game. /Real/ MMOs don't allow this by design-- their intention is to exploit the social aspect of the MMO to keep players coming back, and to do that they need to provide reasons for many people to come together at once. Even for planetside 2, where individuals could three or four times their weight in less experienced players, large groups were absolutely required to have any significant affect on the macro scale. Because if you were worth three players, the enemy could always just send four.

But LitRPG isn't required to do that. Look at the sucess of SAO, where kirito can solo a /boss/. Even the comparatively more balanced Log Horizon places significant value on individual prowess in the sense that the more diplomatic and player-interaction-focused parts of the storyline tends to revolve direcly around the actions of the main character.

So the *TL;DR* is that, to provide for the power fantasy as best as possible, the game should have mechanisms to usually allow the player be virtually guaranteed to win any 1v1s they get into (monster or player), and if the player needs to lose or almost-lose it should be against multiple opponents.

Oh, and one more thing: this neatly dovetails into the "Skinner Box" elements. If you give the best XP bonuses and rewards for PVP combat, you get into a nice little core gameplay loot of grinding mobs to get to the point where you can PVP so you can grind mobs better so you can PVP better... etc.

For example, a mechanic where both players wager an item they have on the outcome of a duel. They lose their item regardless of whether they win or lose, but the winner of the duel gets a randomized loot box of semi-random value based on the value to their /enemy's/ wagered item, times some multiplier. So players have a reason to duel instead of trade, and players have a reason to duel often.

This would also keep the game economy in check, as dueling, on average, destroys value (2x items of value n turned into an item of value m such that m is usually smaller than 2n)

But regardless of what you do, make sure there's /some/ sort of randomized element. If the items you get from a boss are pre-set, maybe there's an additional "quality" variable than gets randomized on drop, so two otherwise-identical drops still differ in power, so you have to farm a bunch of copies to get a really good one.

Anyways, good luck.
