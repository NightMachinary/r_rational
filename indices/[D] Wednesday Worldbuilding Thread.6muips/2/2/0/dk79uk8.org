  For example, a mechanic where both players wager an item they have on the outcome of a duel. They lose their item regardless of whether they win or lose, but the winner of the duel gets a randomized loot box of semi-random value based on the value to their enemy's wagered item, times some multiplier. So players have a reason to duel instead of trade, and players have a reason to duel often.

  This would also keep the game economy in check, as dueling, on average, destroys value (2x items of value n turned into an item of value m such that m is usually smaller than 2n)

I would exploit this /so hard/.

Duel a friend, with their 10k gold "Sword of Awesome" against your rusty iron dagger. Defeat them (with their cooperation), and get a 11k gold "Helmet of Amazing". Repeat with your helmet against their rusty dagger, to get 12.1k gold "Breastplate of Badass" etc.
