  I would exploit this so hard.

  Duel a friend, with their 10k gold "Sword of Awesome" against your rusty iron dagger. Defeat them (with their cooperation), and get a 11k gold "Helmet of Amazing". Repeat with your helmet against their rusty dagger, to get 12.1k gold "Breastplate of Badass" etc.

I should note that the multiplier wouldn't be /positive/ in every case. For example, you could get a randomly chosen multiplier from the set {0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 1, 1.11, 1.43, 2} so, on average, you get back the value of your enemy's weapon, but lose whatever you used for buy in. I can still see it being used to mulligan items you don't really care for, for a nominal fee, but that's still results in some pretty skinner box gameplay.
