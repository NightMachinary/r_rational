I am writing a litRPG similar to "The Gamer" or "Sword Art Online". Assuming that my intent is to add Skinner box elements to the work and otherwise integrate videogame/tabletop reward mechanisms, as well as extending the power fantasy as far as possible, what should my handcrafted RPG mechanics look like?

(I'm deliberately not including all the things that I've thought of in order to not adversely affect discussion, hope that's okay.)
