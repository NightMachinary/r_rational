I have been trying to write about a researcher investigating a device that may induce time travel, but I ran into a tricky question. Assume that when traveling back in time either you create a new timeline as if it is a fork in the timeline where the previous and current timeline both exist or that you overwrite the old timeline with a different one. One allows for an infinite number of timelines and the other only allows for one timeline.

My problem is that both methods of time travel seem as if they look identical from the perspective of the time traveler and I can't think of a test for the researcher to figure out which type of time travel is actually occurring.
