Can he travel freely?

What if he travels back to point X, then travels back to point Y (which is 30 seconds before X), then waits?

In the single-timeline model, after waiting 30 seconds, he should see his subjectively-past self appear.

#+begin_example
  ----Y----X---->
#+end_example

In the timeline-splitting model, when he travels back to point Y, he'll create a new timeline, in which trip 1 never happened. So after waiting, he won't see himself appear (because point X was on the old timeline).

#+begin_example
  ---Y-----X-----> (original timeline)
       \     \
         \    ----> (created by trip 1)
           -----------> (created by trip 2)
#+end_example

*EDIT:* Ah, nevermind, I misunderstood the premise. Sounds like in the single-timeline model, going back to any point causes all events after that point to cease to exist - so when the traveler went back to point Y, there would no longer be a point X.
