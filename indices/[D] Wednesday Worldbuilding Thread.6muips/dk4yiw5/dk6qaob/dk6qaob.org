To give my own thoughts, partly to have them down somewhere:

I think having rewards along as many different channels as possible it probably preferable, so long as the reader doesn't lose track of what those channels are.

- Level (and increments to level, i.e. experience points)
- Abilities (base numerical attributes)
- Skills (domain-specific abilities)
- Equipment (in various slots)
- Fame
- Reputation with factions
- Ranks in organizations
- Friendships
- Companions
- Skills known
- Spells known (and spells per day)
- Feats (and levels to feats)
- Titles
- Real estate
- Achievements

You can also mix and match a lot of these. Equipment is a reward mechanism, but you can have equipment for your equipment (in the form of sockets), feat equivalents (permanent enchantment), reputation levels (representing a closer bond with the item), etc. Similarly, you can gate various reward tracks to each other, so you need to be a certain level to have certain skills, and higher levels in skills unlock abilities, and certain abilities in combination create new abilities, etc.

As for what to actually include in the game-within-the-novel, partly that depends on length. My general idea is that in terms of an author using reward mechanisms against the reader, you go slow and add things into the mix gradually as the reward response starts tapering off. As in, the protagonist gets their first companion right about when there's enough familiarity with the equipment/skill side of things that it's no longer fresh.

[[/u/daystareld]], you're not writing a proper litRPG, but you are writing literature with translated game elements in it. I'd assume that you've thought about power progression within Origin of Species a bit and how power is doled out; I'm curious as to your thoughts on pacing that. That is, Red, Blue, and Green occasionally get new pokemon, and their pokemon get new moves or evolve, and this is presumably in accordance with some kind of scheme for pacing the novel?
