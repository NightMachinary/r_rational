For my story, most fights are formulated at the outline stage as "Insert battle scene here, with X as the desired outcome," and then the particulars of the battles are thought up and written more or less in the moment. Insofar as planning out power curves goes, there are general trends I want each character to follow for their own stories and to keep up with the major combat related plot points as a whole, but in terms of individual aspects of power, the main motivation is really just not wanting any two fights to be the same, and so varying things by adding new pokemon, moves, or strategies to the mix whenever possible or necessary. Does that make sense?
