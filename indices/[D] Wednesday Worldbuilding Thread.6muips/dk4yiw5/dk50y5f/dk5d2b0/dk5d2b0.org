I'm having a little bit of trouble with "actions taken", since that feels like it encompasses everything that a character could do. I'm guessing given the example you mean that it comes with a concept of "skill xp"? e.g. you do a thing and get better at that thing you just did?

But you also say xp awarded for completing a task, and "task" is a concept that's so large it could mean almost anything.

Others which I think don't fall entirely within what you've outlined:

- Roleplay xp
- Decision-based xp (the first /Bioshock/ awarded variable xp depending on if you chose to do the "moral" thing or not)
- Reputation-based xp (e.g. you gain xp on the basis of how much certain people like you)
- Interval-based xp (e.g. you gain 10 xp/hour)
- Acquisition-based xp (e.g. there are xp crystals which can be bought/sold/stolen)
- Story-based xp (e.g. you gain xp for advancing the plot, even if that is on tangential to tasks being accomplished)

Of course, to some extent it depends on what you mean by "xp", and there are lots of /other/ reward mechanisms fed to players in the form of feats, boons, achievements, etc.
