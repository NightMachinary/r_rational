  So something like "One-handed weapons increased to 23!" does nothing for you?

Nope. Now, Iunderstand that for some people, it /does/, but there's a balance to be found between "basically not a litrpg" and "hundreds of skills whose points don't matter anyways."

Personally speaking, I think everything beyond overall level and a list of special abilities is overkill, but I tolerate up to level+mp/hp+strength/charisma/intelligence/wisdom/dexterity+skill list. But I honestly just don't see the point of skill levels-- either the character is or isn't able to perform an action, and I find it more elegant to simply have the outcome be determined by experience/practice without going into arbitrarily defined skill points anyways.

That being said, I don't have any problems with notifications, providing they're done in a stylistically interesting way (instead of just infodumping in lieu of actually writing stuff out.)
