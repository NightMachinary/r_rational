  ...and, in turn, will prompt bitter forum posts complaining about a lack of player freedom and an excess of nonsensical railroading and undeserved rewards. The question is: Which opinion has more adherents among the players?

  "Oh, look. The developers actually are screenwriters, and I'm their protagonist. Now that I've gone through the predetermined motions, I get a pat on the head for being an obedient little Tom Cruise. Yay." How many players want to be real boys instead of puppets, though?

I think you're bringing MMO sensibilities to this, rather than tabletop ones. In D&D you can have a DM that can make judgement calls on roleplaying and story, rewarding you for immersing yourself or in doing things that are narratively neat. I've seen xp given out for a player writing a drinking song, or for two players arguing the tenets of their respective religions. This is unplanned by the DM, but can still be rewarded by them. Similarly, I've /given out/ xp for players subverting plans entirely by siding with the person I thought was going to be their enemy, since that can be a good pivot within the narrative that makes them feel rewarded for thinking outside the box.

The only reason that this isn't often done in computer games is because it's a very difficult problem and making stories that have lots of options doesn't tend to be financially sound. In other words, it's largely an economic or technologic problem, rather than a game design problem.
