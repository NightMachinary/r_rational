  They have nothing to do with the skills or attributes of the character---so why should they grant experience points toward those skills and attributes?

You're bringing in some outside values, namely that the game systems should be simulationist, i.e. the rules are a map with the world as the territory. I understand that as a principle of design, since it's basically a cousin of skeuomorphism, but I think it's overly constraining. Moreover, I'm not trying to make game rules that create a game which resembles the real world, or even game rules intended to hook in a player, I'm trying to make game rules that hijack the reader's pleasure centers as efficiently as possible. I don't even need to worry about suspension of disbelief, because the reader is meant to be fully aware that these are mechanics - anything that reinforces that its a game rather than real life is a feature, not a bug.

Game designers include things like roleplay xp for two basic reasons. First, they want to push players in certain directions. Part of the worry is that players will only ever do what's most efficient to make the numbers go up, which doesn't always tend to be what's most fun for the players. Giving them xp as an incentive will get players moving in preferred directions so there aren't bitter forum posts about how "the most efficient thing to do is just slog through the grind". Second, game designers include things like story xp in order to add an extra dopamine hit when the play is already having fun; it's icing on top of the cake. You're playing the game, you get into character, you invest yourself in the story, and not only is that rewarding on your own, but you get an extra reward on top of it!

  Interval-based xp

I guess I would point out that one of the most common houserules for D&D is to have players simply level up every two or three sessions regardless of what gets accomplished, and one of the most common mechanics in MMOs is having an equivalent of "rest xp". Also, EVE Online has real-time skill training which follows almost exactly the outlined interval model; this design decision was made for a number of reasons, but I think the two most important are A) it means that you don't need a huge investment of time in doing things you don't want to do and B) you have to learn to work with what you have.
