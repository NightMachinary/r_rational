How many options even exist for granting experience points?\\
- Based on actual training/learning (see /[[http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/backtoschool/][GURPS Social Engineering: Back to School]]/)\\
- Based on actions taken (see /[[http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Increasing_Skills][The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion]]/)\\
- Based on the difficulty of a successful task (e.g., the combat-relevant skills and attributes of a monster defeated in combat, or the cooking-relevant skills and attributes of a master cook defeated in a souffl√©-making contest)\\
- Based on the overall value of a defeated monster (e.g., if you defeat a monster whose stats would take 1000 XP to accumulate, you get 1% of that total, or 10 XP, for defeating that monster, whether in combat or outside combat)
