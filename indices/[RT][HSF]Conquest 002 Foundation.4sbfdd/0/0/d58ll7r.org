Sounds like the ponders basically act like neurons/beacons in a giant distributed network. Each one has some processing power and an interface, but actual decisions about ikon routing are evaluated and performed by the network in agregate. Thus, tamper with one, and the new instructions it sends won't trigger a viable response in the network. Might be totally wrong about that though.
