[[http://storiesonline.net/a/Lazlo_Zalezac][Lazlo Zalezac]] has written several Earthfic stories where normal everyman kinds of guys solve their problems, often reinvigorating their sex lives in the process; in particular, [[http://storiesonline.net/s/43891/thunder-and-lightening][Thunder and Lightening]] is a nearly ideal example thereof, and a story currently in progress, [[http://storiesonline.net/s/13830/the-future-of-miss-powers][The Future of Miss Powers]] may also provide interesting thoughts to fans of ratfic.. (He also does genre fics; I discovered him when looking for stories about John Carter of Mars, and found an entirely unexpected, but still quite enjoyable, set of stories about an entirely different character with that name.)

As for myself in fictional terms - I tend to think more in terms of tropes than characters. [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanPopsicle][Human Popsicle]] because [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingForeverIsAwesome][Living Forever Is Awesome]] is obvious for a cryonicist, and I tend towards being [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared][Crazy Prepared]] in the form of being a member in good standing of [[/r/edc]] (among other preparations).
