The thing about suffering is that it stress-tests one's ability to spin meaning out of life, which can sometimes lead one to abandon cliche philosophy and form a more reasoned and complete answer to the question "why do you live". I say "sometimes" because this is unlikely enough that breaking people does not create a net gain, but the outliers gain a hell of a lot of individuality in the process.

Art is, in one way or another, an expression of one's worldview. Therefore, people with unusual worldviews tend to produce "originality" and "wisdom". (The scare quotes are because I subscribe to Yudkowsky's theory that wisdom is simply having a coherent and well-reasoned viewpoint that diverges from the conventional.) Both of these are likely contributing factors to whether any given art piece is considered "good".

To put this syllogism together, suffering can create unusual worldviews, unusual worldviews are interpreted as "wisdom", and "wisdom" is probably one of the factors that leads to something being considered good art.
