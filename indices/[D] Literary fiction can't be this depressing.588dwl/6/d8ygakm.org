I think the "why" of it is related to why it seems like artists in great pain make better art, but it's not like I have a great answer to that, either.

There are a few authors that are genre, but on the more literary end of things: Most/all of Asimov and Zelazny. Louis McMaster Bujold (the stuff after her military SF).

For individual books - these get way more "literary": Child of Fortune by Norman Spinrad, Dune*, Diaspora by Greg Egan, The Martian.

- I don't know if this counts as "not depressing", but it's definitely a role model source for me.

I /want/ to say Ursula Le Guin, but I honestly don't remember well enough. Still, check out "The Dispossed", not just Earthsea.

China Mieville's "Embassy Town" finally managed to teach me what "literature" is (I can't explain the idea the story conveys without telling you story), but it's not what I'd call "feel-good".

Maybe the problem is like that R!Lucius tells R!Draco about the play: If the writer was clever enough to solve the problem, they'd do it, instead of writing about it.

As for myself in fictional terms - Ehhh maybe a cross between Twig's Sylvester, a Mentat, annnnnd the weird wise wanderer? Sometimes I think my life is half-fictional already, the shenanigans I get up to.

(I have a friend who really should be all the way fictional. Her idea of summer camp is an archeological dig at the great pyramids; her idea of poker is winning money from Richard Branson while transiting the bearing straight; her idea of a vacation is hitch hiking across Nicuragua solo, at 19. She gets it from her dad, who's similarly wtf).
