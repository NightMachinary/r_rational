If the movie Legally Blonde had been about a nerdy socially impaired aspiring rationalist, rather than a blonde fashion-obsessed law student, that would be me. I don't think there is any other character or combination of characters that I have ever seen in fiction which I can use to describe myself. I don't really see any of my own life experiences mirrored in fiction at all, and that can be kind of alienating some times.
