While watching Log Horizon, I began to identify more and more strongly with Shiroe with each episode. I'm a strong leader and a powerfull multitasker; I have an aptitude for unique, lateral-thinking solutions utilising all the disparate resources at my disposal; and, like Shiroe, I have not yet realized that a full half of the women I know secretly harbor romantic feelings for me.
