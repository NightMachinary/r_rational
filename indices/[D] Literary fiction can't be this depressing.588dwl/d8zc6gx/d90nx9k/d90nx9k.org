  Remember the discussions about how difficult it is to write a character smarter than you?

But it's /not/ hard to write a character at least somewhat smarter than you. As the author you can easily give your character two things you can't have in reality -- unlimited time to think things through and perfect deductive knowledge.

You know when something happens unexpectedly, and you go over and over it later in your mind figuring out what the optimal response would have been? You can easily write a character that thinks faster than you do and can come up with those optimal reactions on the fly. In fact, almost all fictional characters do this to at least some extent -- that's how you have clean, sharp, witty, hard hitting dialog so much more often in books than in real life.

Inhumanly perfect deductive knowledge is what Sherlock Holmes runs on. In real life drawing deductions from events and details is difficult and fraught with errors, alternate interpretations, and gaps in one's knowledge, generally producing a range of fuzzy possibilities. In fiction this is not a problem. As the author you have all the knowledge about the setting and characters, and can grant that knowledge to your characters at will.

Done poorly this results in insane yet correct Bat/Tattletale deductions, and taken to extremes you get an omniscient Sherlock Holmesien superintelligence who knows the reason behind the fall of every sparrow and the disposition of every grain of dust, but every author does it at least a little, as when they grant knowledge of one character's thoughts to another character and justify it with some line about seeing their expression or the way they move.

In a way, the author's perfect knowledge of the fictional universe and of cause and effect in it is a form of superinteligence. I think one of the reasons superintelligent characters are rare is because the have the same problems as post foom AIs -- they are boring because they always know the path to victory in any situation, and so they will win no matter what. Essentially, a Mary Sue. To make it interesting you have to have an opposing superintelligence, and then write the conflict between them in a believable, interesting, and understandable to lesser intelligences (aka humans) way. And THAT's what's /really/ difficult.

As far as realism goes, you can easily apply heightened intelligence to reality or stories trying to be set in reality. For lower levels of enhanced intelligence, hard work and drive is functionally equivalent to intelligence. A character in a best approximation of reality who ignores fatigue and boredom to acquire skills or accomplish objectives is displaying a form of low level enhanced intelligence.
