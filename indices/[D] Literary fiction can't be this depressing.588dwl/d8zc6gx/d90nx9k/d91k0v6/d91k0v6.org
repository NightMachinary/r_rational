I think the best example of this is Star Wars character Grand Admiral Thrawn. He never makes a reasoning you couldn't have come up with on your own, and for that reason it's not too hard to follow his thought processes, but he's just faster, more accurate, more attentive to details than the average person, which makes him feel like a great genius.
