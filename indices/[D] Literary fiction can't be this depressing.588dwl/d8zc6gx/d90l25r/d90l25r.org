  On the other hand, someone writing literary earthfic is constrained to realistic solutions for realistic problems.

If they understand the problem well enough to write it realistically, then they know what to change, in the problem, to make it possible for the protagonist to solve.

The author may be constrained to have his protagonist as efficacious as he is (I'm not sure he /is/, but even if he is) but he is not required to make the world as challenging as it is. It merely needs to /seem/ as challenging as it is.
