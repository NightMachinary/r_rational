Remember the discussions about how difficult it is to write a character smarter than you? I posit that there is a corollary - it is difficult-to-impossible to write a character more efficacious than yourself, given the same constraints. Genre writers get to play around with the constraints. Even if they may be ineffective in their actual lives, "what if I had magic", or "what if I were on a spaceship" may trigger different thought patterns that allow them to punch above their normal weight class in regards to problem-solving creativity.

On the other hand, someone writing literary earthfic is constrained to realistic solutions for realistic problems. If you struggle to maintain or improve satisfying relationships irl, you'll probably struggle to write a character who can accomplish the feat, in a way that seem realistic to readers. To paraphrase EY, if the writer knew how to actually take over the world, they wouldn't be writing a story about world domination, they'd be sipping the drink of their choice from the caldera-heart of their Volcano Lair. If the writer knew how to mend relationships, find career success and rightfully earn the admiration of worthy peers, they'd probably be doing that instead of putting in time at a writers workshop.

This is not to say that all people using writers workshops are failures, or anything. But it seems likely that the people you're seeing there are more likely than average to be generally ineffective in the rest of their lives, which will naturally make it difficult for them to write characters who can do things they themselves /could/ do, but probably struggle with.

So, with that constraint on what you can actually write well about, I'd imagine many of those literary writers can /easily/ imagine how to send the functional parts of their lives crashing down in flaming wreckage. Every pessimistic fantasy in which your SO gets dramatically furious about something becomes a plot point. All the things that existential terror suggests you /could/ do, that you /wouldn't/ do because you don't want to burn all bridges become easy sources of conflict to write about. It may be depressing as hell, but it's at least more conceivable than the magical formula to success that you've never actually figured out.
