I think one of the story that inspired me the most was /Prequel Adventure/. There's something great about seeing someone feel truly pathetic, feel like they failed at their best chance, maybe their only chance to finally get their life in order, that they gave in at the most pivotal moment of their life, feel like they're already dead... then shrug and decide to pick up the pieces, and try again.

"Well, you're alive."
