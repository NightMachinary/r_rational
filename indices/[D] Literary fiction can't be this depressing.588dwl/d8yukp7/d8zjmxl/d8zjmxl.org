I agree with this, with the addendum that I often end up liking the changes. The best example I've personally experienced is the MCU, which has generally toned down how goofy and weird the comics could be. I'm not a big fan of Jeph Loeb's comic since they tended to be gritty in ways I didn't enjoy, but he's done a great job produced Marvel's tv shows since he has so much experience grounding the silliness.
