  On the other hand, someone writing literary earthfic is constrained to realistic solutions for realistic problems. If you struggle to maintain or improve satisfying relationships irl, you'll probably struggle to write a character who can accomplish the feat, in a way that seem realistic to readers.

True, but I find it easier to believe IRL literary writers are subject to a broken, ineffective Reviewer 2 than that they're all personally screwed-up.
