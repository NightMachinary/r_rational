I write stories about people slowly breaking because I was subject to a significant amount of psychological trauma when I was very young and therefore have an inbuilt assumption that things by default get worse. I have been able to bend my built-in story trajectory upwards a /little/, with an immense amount of work.

Also, part of the process of bending that trajectory upwards involves me actively continuing to write stories about people slowly breaking, just in fractionally less horrifying situations each time, and actively continuing to read stories about people slowly breaking, /also/ in situations that have become somewhat less terrible as my tastes have been able to expand upwards.

If I did not think it was worth it to bend this trajectory upwards I would not be doing it.
