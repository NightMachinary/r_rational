It's possible that people sometimes, instead of wanting "that is the person I would be", rather want "I may be in a bad way, but at least I'm not in as much trouble as /that/ guy".

People look at Superman, or Sherlock Holmes, and say "I'll never be that good. I'm inadequate." Or they look at a story about some guy solving his problems, and they feel inadequate because they have not solved their problems.

And then they turn to a story of a miserable guy getting steadily more miserable and say "At least I'm better off than /that/ guy." And this leaves them feeling good about their situation, despite the problems they haven't solved.
