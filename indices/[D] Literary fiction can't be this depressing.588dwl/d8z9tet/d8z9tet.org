  ‘literary' stories about broken people becoming even more broken are not fun to read
#+end_quote

I think there are ways to do this well. To switch mediums for a moment, I would describe both /BoJack Horseman/ and /Jessica Jones/ as stories about broken people becoming even more broken, and I loved them a lot.

(If the claim is in some way specific to novels in particular, then examples are springing less to mind at the moment, but perhaps /The World According to Garp/ would qualify, or the first /Magicians/ novel before reading the sequels.)

Yes, /Anna Karenina/ and /Antigone/ are miserable, but I don't think we can blame the entire concept of fiction about broken people become more broken for that.

My #3fictionalcharacters are Linus from /Peanuts/ × Mindy Park from /The Martian/ × Cent from /Exo/ (of the /Jumper/ series).
