The way TV Tropes frames this argument on their page about how to write characters, is that characters are defined by their Virtues and Flaws. Virtues make us say "I want to be this character", while Flaws make us say "I am this character". Success is meant to inspire us to conquer our own obstacles, while failure is meant to create empathy for a situation we can relate to. That doesn't make me like them, though.

I hate depressing stories and love heroism. I didn't even finish Worm because I couldn't take Armsmaster's dickishness, Leviathan, Taylor being set back to square one, the Slaughterhouse 9, the Protectorate screwing up, and a malicious conspiracy in rapid succession without any levity or successes beyond surviving. It was just so much that I was starting to see Taylor's determination as foolhardy instead of admirable.

For what character I relate to, I was going to say Ender if he had a lot more internal obstacles to face, but the one I identify with the most is the protagonist of [[https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/3pyg3h/wp_a_day_before_the_earth_is_destroyed_by_a/][this story]]. I can't think of a better metaphor for my experiences with autism than a man trapped inside his own head, alive but cut off from everyone, and having to solve an intellectual problem with no clear answer to escape.
