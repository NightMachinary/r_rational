Worm doesn't really have role models - that's part of what makes it such a good story. The characters do cool things, decent things, but not because they are role-model-level perfect.

I don't want unrealistic characters or easy successes. In a tragedy, I want to be able to think it could have ended well - in the opposite, that it could have ended in failure.

That said, there are virtuous/heroic characters in shakespeare too - Macbeth is ostensibly a tragedy, but the result is good for the kingdom, and the person who becomes king is somewhat shown to deserve the role.
