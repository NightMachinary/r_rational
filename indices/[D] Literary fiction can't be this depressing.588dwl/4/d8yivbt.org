It's a little rude completely dismissing romance stories like that, I think the mere fact that some people enjoy them is a strong justification for their existence. It's hard to write it well, but relationships are very important and deserve to be written about.

I'm a mix between Pearl from Steven Universe and Pinkie Pie from MLP. I have a desperate cloying need for approval from others and fluctuate between shoving myself into the spotlight and hiding from everything, not to mention my laundry list of neuroses.
