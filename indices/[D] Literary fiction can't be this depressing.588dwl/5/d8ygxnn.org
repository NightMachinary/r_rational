DayStarEld pointed it out before in your other thread, but it bears reiterating: you have all the skills of a youtube star/personality. Your titles are engaging, you grab attention, and you flow well from generally agreeable points to extremely in-your-face opinions delivered colloquially and in a surprisingly cogent fashion (another comment from the other thread). You end it with a call to action for audience engagement.

I'm not sure if you're doing it on purpose, but if you're not, what you wrote is basically the transcript of a youtube video. You should make that video, make others like it regularly, and share your videos to fora/communities/blogs that would like your content.

You seem to love sharing strongly held and well reasoned opinions. People love to hear strongly held and well reasoned opinions shared in an engaging fashion. Your apparent default means of mass communication is engaging and highly effective at grabbing and building an audience.

Why not make a profit off that?
