Seems like it could be good for diagnostic purposes (at least if the "one layer" for a human isn't just a single layer of the epidermis, though even then that could be good for skin cancer), but there's a limit to how many people you could diagnose even if you had medical training and a steady supply of patients.

How does it interact with transparency and reflection? You might be able to use it to get a look at the interior of stars or other planets in the solar system, though how deep "one layer" goes there would be highly ambiguous.

You could become personally rich by cheating at poker or blackjack, though if somebody ever thought to check your glasses you'd be screwed. Win too much too quickly and you'd be very likely to find yourself down one pair of magical glasses.

That actually brings up another point; is the x-ray effect only one-way, or can everyone else see the inside of my eyeballs? You'd assume it functioned as normal glass the other direction, but you never know.

Also, do you /have/ to see through one layer of everything? That'd make it potentially very difficult to navigate. You'd need to be constantly removing the glasses to find your way, and get used to seeing people's musculature all the time (or whatever constitutes "one layer").

There's probably a research use for it, but it seems like using your eyes would generally be inferior to other imaging techniques in a research environment.
