A contraption of mirrors can send the same ray of light through the glasses multiple times. Might this strip away additional layers?

A model that might describe how this works is that each photon that hits a barrier is replaced with an x-photon which has no effect on matter except xray glasses, which turn them back into photons (from which energy? perpetuum mobile?). The only problem with that is that [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/ph/can_you_prove_two_particles_are_identical/][quantum physics gives us a way to tell whether two states of the universe are equal]], even if they might only differ in the direction an otherwise undetectable x-photon might fly into.
