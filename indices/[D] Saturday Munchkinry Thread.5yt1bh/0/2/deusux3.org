Other than trying to trying to use this ability to influence the world (I would probably use this power on someone else in order to get them to come up with a plan for how to best use it for influencing people) the best application would seem to be for coercion.\\
Sure you may have limited time when it comes to someone with very valuable time, but other people don't know that. So just use this ability for several hours a day on Warren Buffett, being as unbearably annoying as you can possible manage until you can convince him to pay you a substantial amount of money to /not/ use this ability on him. Rinse and repeat with other billionaires until you are yourself extremely wealthy.\\
Then I guess work with some experts on figuring out the best ways of using your ability to convince influential people. For instance if you could keep yourself level headed in the face of madness and avoid disagreeing with him too much you might be able to substantially influence Trump (hell Thiel seems like he may have figured this out).
