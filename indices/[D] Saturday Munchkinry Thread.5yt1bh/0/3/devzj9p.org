If I use some sum of dollar-hours out of the budget, does the person I'm spending it on get the money, or does that dollar figure just get subtracted from the one trillion dollars? If they receive the money, you could get a group of your friends, talk them into giving you a cut of the earnings, and give yourselves full time jobs playing a Wizard of Oz campaign in DnD or some such tabletop rpg.
