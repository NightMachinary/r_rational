You've been given access to one trillion USD-hours to dispense with as you wish. This is a unit representing the product of a person's anticipated lifetime earnings (in 2017-equivalent USD, and without removing expenditures, and using a relatively generous interpretation of "earnings" -- if some religious leader has taken a vow of poverty and refused income, their lack of explicit earnings doesn't grant you access to arbitrarily large amounts of their time) and a measure of time representing their undivided attention. This is to say that you can hold any number of people's attention for some amount of time, with a total budget of one trillion USD-hours. For example, you could use this to have a nice, short chat with Bill Gates and Warren Buffet, or advertise Pepsiâ„¢ products ad nauseum to the entire population of some poor, small country, or give a series of short lectures to the Pope, or anything in between.

No living person is off limits -- you can choose world leaders, Nobel prize winners, titans of industry, etc., but the "power" has no /magical/ component -- you can't designate someone through definite description alone ("the person or people who will give me the most money, in expectation"), nor find persons whose location is currently not known to you, nor use it to see the future by predicting people's lifetime earnings -- it's a rough, but usually quite good extrapolation that could well be wrong, nor pull someone from the brink of death, nor interrupt anything important (the attention would be given through the standard channels, which would just happen to work out very seamlessly, so no using it in small bursts to, say, sabotage professional athletes' performance and make bank betting on sports games). Their "undivided" attention is still subject to their own, normal limits, and doesn't bestow on them extraordinary concentration or anything. Otherwise, you can talk to them about or present to them any information you want and have available or ask them any questions you want, and they'll listen attentively for the required time, but they still might react negatively or refuse to answer you. You can't use this power to do anything otherwise illegal, or I suppose you can, but it would still be illegal and you'd still face the normal repercussions. Your safety is ensured fairly well, though, if you want to chat with someone especially dangerous.

You can divvy up your trillion USD-hours however you want, to as many people you want, for as many times for a given person as you want, with one additional limitation -- you can't "hold someone's attention" for a period of time less than one minute and greater than eight hours for any given day, so no significantly hampering people with repetitive microbursts of required attention (see the "standard channels" condition above).

Who do you talk to, and about what?
