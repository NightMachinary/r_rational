Can you expand a little on the challenge?

Some journalists have PGP public-keys on their [[https://www.theguardian.com/profile/julianborger][author bio pages]]. You can use [[https://sela.io/pgp/][online tools]] to create an encrypted message from that.

Drop the output into Pastebin, and you just need to give the other guy a super short link.

Even if you're spotted passing the other guy the link, the opposition won't be able to read it.

--------------

If you want to get really fancy about it, put your disk data into the [[https://veracrypt.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Hidden%20Volume][Hidden volume]] of a VeraCrypt file.

Fill the public volume with something plausible, but not super-illegal. Like, make up a story about how your defense contractor boss is giving kickbacks to the government guys so he can embezzle money.

Then, your PGP-encrypted message is:

#+begin_quote
  The details about the embezzlement story I mentioned are here: [[https://dropbox.com/public/abcdef]] The password is the name of that song we both liked. Lower case. No punctuation.
#+end_quote

Then, when talking to the journalist, you give him the link, a song, and a second password that unlocks the hidden volume.

That setup should be extremely secure.

To get any actual content, the counter-intelligence guys would need to compel the journalist to give up the link AND his private PGP key AND disclose the song you'd talked about.

Even then, they'd only see the fake story you guys made up.
