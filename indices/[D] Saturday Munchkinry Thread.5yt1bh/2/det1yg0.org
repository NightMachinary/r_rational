You are an Edward-Snowden-style character at an informal dinner party with a number of journalists, government employees, and counterintelligence agents. You have six floppy disks, encrypted, and a piece of paper containing the encryption key for the disks. You need to make sure that the information on the floppy disks gets to a reputable journalist.

Assume that the party is held in a standard 2br apartment, and is equipped with all the stuff you would expect to find in a young professional's apartment.

How do you safely and secretly convey the floppies and encryption key to the journalists that you have decided are reputable?
