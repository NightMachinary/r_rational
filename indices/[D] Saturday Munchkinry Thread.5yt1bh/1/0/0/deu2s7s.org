Hypnosis is strictly short-term.

  Is it 2017? (How does the masquerade survive dashcams/CCTV?)
#+end_quote

Yes, it's 2017.

The masquerade has only survived this far because it's really easy to just go up to someone's house and kick the door in, so there's little motivation to attack people in public (and a person being beaten up using superhuman strength is hard to visually distinguish from a person being beaten up using merely exceptional strength and skill.) There are occasional slips where e.g. someone is photographed not casting a reflection.

  Is the lethal drain magical? Natural scientific inquiries are whether they can drain chimps, whether a fetus per month might be enough, and whether they might be able to survive on donated blood.
#+end_quote

Yup, it's magical. Chimps don't count, neither do partial drains, stored blood, or predeceased victims.

... I'm going to rule out infants, simply because it inevitably produces boring and unethical ideas. The cutoff for counting as a valid victim is seven years.

  Or maybe it isn't that strong, if garlic bullets only produce a 5-7/1-2-ratio.
#+end_quote

Yup.
