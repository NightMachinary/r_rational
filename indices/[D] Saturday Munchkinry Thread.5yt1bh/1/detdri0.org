1. Vampires need to lethally drain at least one human per month to survive.
2. They have hypnosis and superhuman strength sufficient to easily overpower and drain even small groups of humans without difficulty.
3. All vampires are sociopaths. Most are sadists. They retain the original human's knowledge, skills and intelligence.
4. Vampires can choose to have their victims rise from the dead as a vampire within a 24-hour period. They're not compelled to co-operate beyond natural self-interest, but they're not compelled /not/ to cooperate beyond natural self-interest.
5. The usual vampire weaknesses (mirrors, garlic, sunlight etc.) are sufficient to unerringly identify vampires. Weaponized and used tactically, they're effective enough that 5-7 trained, armed professionals can put down 1-2 vampires in a fight.

Vampires are /currently/ rare enough that the masquerade has remained shakily intact up to this point, but there's at least one group of vampires planning to use their exponential growth and superpowers to take over the world.

What do you do

1. as a vampire?
2. as a random human?
3. as the (human) President of the United States?
