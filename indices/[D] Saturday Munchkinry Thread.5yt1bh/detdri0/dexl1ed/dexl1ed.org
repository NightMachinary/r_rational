As a vampire:

Try to stay far away from the Takeover Group. Plan in accordance with the principal that the masquerade will be broken (because it will) and vampires will be near-exterminated as soon as military forces figure it out and start issuing the right equipment (which it /will/).

Try to develop a good reputation as a philanthropist, and survive off people who are unlikely to be missed (and, if possible, who are nowhere near to my official address).

--------------

As a random human - continue as I do until I hear about the vampire invasion. Promptly panic, stock up on garlic, and eat a lot of garlic. Try to avoid vampires where possible, but be prepared to call in the police in case of suspected vampire activity.

--------------

As a human President - these humanoid creatures are a clear and present threat to the people of my country, and, furthermore, to my own life and sanity. Ensure first that the Secret Service is properly trained and equipped to deal with them.

Then ensure that the army and police are properly trained and equipped.

Then reassure my people that the problem of these terrifying humanoid abominations is well in hand. They're all clearly enemies of my country, and as such, any within my borders will be swiftly destroyed. (Other countries will no doubt manage their own security).
