This is an excellent response, and unfortunately entirely inapplicable to the situation for reasons I forgot to include in the initial prompt. Thanks for asking me to expand up on it.

Passing on the floppies is a character goal for a Snowden character in a murder mystery party, so for mechanics reasons it has to happen before the end of the night.

The Snowden could have encrypted it using one or more journalist's PGP keys if Snowden knew which journalists Snowden wanted to leak to. It's been kind of an impulsive decision to leak, so Snowden hasn't decided among the journalists available, and doesn't have foreknowledge of who's going to be at this party.
