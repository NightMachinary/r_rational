Really enjoying this story so far. You've chosen a lot of good hooks, and have executed them pretty well.

Hell, I get the impression that you consciously constructed this story to be as appealing to a certain type of reader as possible. There's:

- The incredibly underdog protagonist
- The well-defined but still mysterious magic system
- A promise of nearly infinite growth for our protagonist due to the existence of grit (which is extremely reminiscent of chakra exercises from Naruto or shaping exercises from MoL)

And all of this brought together with some good characterization and conflict (both of which are often executed poorly in stories like this).
