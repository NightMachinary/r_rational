My guess is he won't take the torch, because, well, he doesn't need it. That'll get him some points. Maybe even the golems are reliant on sight, so him being able to travel in total darkness would provide him some advantage.

Also, it's kind of suspicious that Faulkner managed to weave into their farewell the basic information about golems. From a storytelling point it's understandable (introducing the concept just before he first meets them), but I kind of think he knew what the test would be and wanted Seti to know the basics.
