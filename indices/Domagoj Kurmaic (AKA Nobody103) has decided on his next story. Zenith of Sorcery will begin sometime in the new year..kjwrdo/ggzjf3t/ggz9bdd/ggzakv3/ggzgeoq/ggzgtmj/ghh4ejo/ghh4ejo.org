Honestly if he's gonna do Zenith he would've just done a story focused on Zac or Zorian like 10 years later. Or even Kirielle like 30 years later starting with Zorian getting assassinated. Already have hints of the interdimensional plot line, multiple fairly developed continents, and established Archmage characters. Only major setting difference seems to be that he wants the gods to be ascended mortals (and more importantly, for everyone to KNOW that the gods are ascended mortals). Including all the Tolkien races is a change too I guess, though MOL already had multiple sentient and humanoid races, plus multiple continents and difficult enough travel to allow newly discovered continents.

Stories that start with a super strong protagonist often run into issues pretty quickly.
