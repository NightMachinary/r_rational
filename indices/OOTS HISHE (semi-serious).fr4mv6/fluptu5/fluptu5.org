Not sure I'd call this rational, but it's a fun rational-adjacent deconstruction/parody of the Order of the Stick (which is, itself, a parody).

Regarding teleportation and communication magic, I don't think they're very reliably available. Shoujo seems to have only one wizard who can cast teleport, since the Order had to wait for him to be resurrected after he was eaten by a roc. Not sure how many casters know sending, but there's almost certainly more demand than supply, so people who ride around carrying messages (like Miko did) are still necessary.

But getting the Order to Azure City would have been a top priority, so limited supply isn't a good reason not to use magic there. And your comic has a solution that sidesteps the Order entirely.
