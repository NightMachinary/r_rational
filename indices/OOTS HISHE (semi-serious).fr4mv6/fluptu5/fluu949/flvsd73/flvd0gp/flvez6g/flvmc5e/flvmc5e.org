Miko doesn't seem to be particularly difficult to manipulate. I bet they could make up reasons that sound good enough to convince her. Off the top of my head...

1. We can't use Sending because we need too many words - it would take all our castings combined to relay this 1000-word message, and our clerics have other Sendings to make.
2. We can't use Teleport or Wind Walk because the wizard and Sangwaan are off on another, equally important mission.
3. The journey is perilous and the recipient of this missive is a vital ally. That is why we entrust you, the strongest of us, with seeing it safely to its destination.

These don't need to be the real reasons, they just need to sound convincing enough to Miko (who was tricked by Belkar of all people). Heck, given how much power Shoujo has, he might be able to say "Mr. Scruffy said so" and Miko would do it.
