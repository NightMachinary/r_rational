A lot of this won't make particular sense to people who haven't read The Order of the Stick extensively (including prequel/bonus materials), but basically-

OOTSverse is, as you can probably gather, essentially a D&D parody universe where spells that allow instant transport and communication over long distances are, if not exactly commonplace, at least known generally to exist and pretty reliably available to high-level characters and central governments. One of the major early plot-points is a chapter where the titular protagonists wind up being dragged in chains to azure city so that Lord Shojo, the head of a major paladin organisation, can hire them to go on a secret McGuffin quest. Given the range of options at his disposal, Shojo's methods are inefficient to the point of verging on sabotage.

(This is not to say there aren't any number of irrational decisions on the part of the cast earlier on, but half the protagonists are legitimately characterised as not-very-bright, so it's mostly easier to overlook. Mostly.)
