I think it's more the Dark One's habit of trying to actively murder the other Gods and/or threaten them with death if they don't kowtow to his demands that might have pissed off the Twelve. (It's been suggested that Rat might be playing a different angle here, however, and there is the rather large question of why they don't strip their powers from Tsukiko, given all the crap she gets up to.)

I've toyed with the idea that Dorukan might have been researching alternative options for handling the Snarl, given that his Talisman apparently had dominion over all 2nd-edition creatures. (What 'edition' would the Snarl be, I wonder?)
