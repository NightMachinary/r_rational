Background plot point: the 'big celestial messenger' is actually Eugene Greenhilt, the main protagonist's deceased father, in disguise. (He's a seasoned illusionist and managed to [[https://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0292.html][hijack]] the summoning process.)

An /actual/ celestial messenger acting on behalf of the Twelve Gods might not want the Guard to go chasing after the Crimson Mantle, but... in that case he could just as easily explain the whole business with the quiddities and tell the paladins to take Redcloak alive instead.
