reasons why this is not a good plan, from the gods point of view: this way, you do not stop the snarl with help from the purple diety that redcloak represents, you just keep it in its cage for a while longer.

the meta of OOTS is really deep, you have a posthuman community of 'gods' who have been running millions of simulations in a row to get to this point. their mind-states are directly altered by the souls worshipping them. and the problem is all down to their buddies that got killed by the snarl way back when.

all the mortals? they dont matter. the gods will just make a new world. what does matter, is dealing with the snarl that is trying to kill them, that is imprisoned inside the world. and the snarl may have its own world inside that mess.
