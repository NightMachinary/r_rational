  Not sure how many casters know sending, but there's almost certainly more demand than supply, so people who ride around carrying messages (like Miko did) are still necessary.

I consider that to be another example of "nonsensical wasting of Miko's time", to be honest. Any message urgent enough to warrant the attentions of a 16th-level paladin is urgent enough to just use Sending/Teleport for.

The number of people who can cast Sending and Teleport are doubtless limited, but who exactly is going to pull rank on or outbid Shojo in terms of getting first pick on the service? Even if the teleporting wizard he lent to Roy was unavailable for some reason, Sangwaan is also sufficiently high-level to learn the spell and he has clerics who can cast Wind Walk (a 6th-level spell, same as the Planar Ally they would have had to cast to summon angels.) That's without reaching out to, e.g, elven allies or wizardly acquaintances of Eugene or Julia. Or making a trip to [[https://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0989.html][magic walmart]]. This is a universe where it's basically implausible that the Guard could /not/ have worked out some rapid long-distance transport options.
