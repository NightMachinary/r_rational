  We can't use Sending because we need too many words - it would take all our castings combined to relay this 1000-word message, and our clerics have other Sendings to make.

This makes no sense if the journey takes days or weeks, as would be necessary to keep Miko busy. It's easier to just wait until the next day for the clerics/wizards to refresh their spells. (If the message is long, you just use Teleport instead.) A journey being perilous is also /more/ of a reason to use Sending/Teleport- i.e., circumvent the journey entirely. (Unless Miko particularly enjoys random encounters I suppose.)

The other problem with coming up with these various cover-stories is that it basically requires all the other paladins/clerics to be more-or-less continuously lying through their teeth to a superior officer, which is not a very paladin-ish thing to do. I mean... it's entertaining to imagine the mental effort of Sangwaan et al extemporising various excuses for comedic effect, but it's not something that could realistically be sustained very long, and... we're presupposing this is rationalist fiction. It's better to just concede that any job important enough to involve Miko will probably involve her getting Teleported to her destination.
