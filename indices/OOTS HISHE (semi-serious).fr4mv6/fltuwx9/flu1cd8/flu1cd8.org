  all the mortals? they dont matter.

The mortals in question, who are making all of the decisions shown in this comic, disagree with that position.

Although I do agree, there are absolutely gods who don't want this outcome. There are probably gods that do, because the OOTS gods are super divided on basically every topic. But still, getting the Dark One on board with stopping the snarl is their only win condition.

Actually, do you think that the Northern and Western gods are super mad at the southern gods? They insist on antagonizing the only hope for a lasting existence that anyone has seen in a very, very long time. I mean, yes, the Dark One is Evil, but substantially less so than some of the gods that the various pantheons put up with willingly.
