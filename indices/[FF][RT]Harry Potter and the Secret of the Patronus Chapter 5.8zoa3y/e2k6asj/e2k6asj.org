I reached chapter 5, and I'm honestly curious about this subreddit's thoughts on this story. I contemplated which chapter to post, and I chose the most potentially controversial one I've written so far, because that makes sense, right?

It's a sequel to HPMOR, but I'm not sure that it's rational fiction, per se. It's a character driven mystery plot with humor and romance. However, I read the side bar, and I think it complies with the bullet points for [RT]. So...maybe I'm in the right place?

Either way, I thought you guys might at least be curious enough to take a look. :)

Let me know what you think of it so far, I love honest feedback!
