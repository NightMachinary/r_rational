The introduction was a bit hard for me to get my head around. I think the problem is that the pieces were presented a bit out of chronological order. From what I can tell, the time periods are:

#+begin_quote
  [End Of HPMOR + 1 month] "Are you ... absolutely sure?"

  [EO HPMOR + 3 years] Harry bounced on his feet

  [EO HPMOR - 1 year] If Harry had heard that account in his first year

  [EO HPMOR + 3 years] Harry glanced down at his present

  [EO HPMOR + 6 months] On the summer after his first year in Hogwarts

  [EO HPMOR + 3 years] Someone was forcefully rubbing his hair.

I might suggest re-ordering the introduction a bit so there aren't as many flashbacks. In this case, the story seems to start when Harry loses his memory. Open there.

My next question is how long it took before finding the letter. Was there a while where Harry knew that someone had tampered with his head, but didn't know why? If so, how did he react?

Alternately, did he wake up next to the letter? If that happened, did he take any steps to verify that he was the one who wrote it? What sort of arguments did he use to explain that "going to space" made more sense than trying to recreate his original discovery? He has notes, right?
