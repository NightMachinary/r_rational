So, I talked to my friend about this. His reply:

  I also noticed that chapter while reading and thought it sounded a bit funny on first glance. However, it is entirely accurate when talking about vessels for humans. Since in order to support life you'll need a big ship, and will therefore need a ton of fuel, none of which we have. This might be the article you found during your research.

He then proceeds to rediscover the research I lost earlier. :P

  And then there's the issue of fuel. It would take at least the current energy output of the entire world to send a probe to the nearest star, according to Brice N. Cassenti, an associate professor with the Department of Engineering and Science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. That's a generous figure: More likely, Cassenti says, it would be as much as 100 times that. "We just can't extract the resources from the Earth," Cassenti said during his presentation. "They just don't exist. We would need to mine the outer planets."

The article is about a decade old, but considering this story takes place in 1995, that's not really an issue.

The whole bit about an unmanned mission with a floating corpse was just Harry brainstorming, he wouldn't actually do that. :) If anything, he would want a manned mission, a complete human caravan to start a colony. So now he has the fuel problem, in addition to keeping everyone alive. It's a tall order, but who knows, maybe the Boy-Who-Lived will munchkin his way out of it.

Thanks for your feedback, it's keeping me on my toes. :)
