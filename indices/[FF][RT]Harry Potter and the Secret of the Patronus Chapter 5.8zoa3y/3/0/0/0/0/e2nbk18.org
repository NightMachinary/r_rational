There's a bigger issue there in that there is no such thing as naturally existing plutonium. You can't mine plutonium because it doesn't exist in the Earth crust. Plutonium is created as a result of nuclear reactions. It has a short half-life, and decays into non plutonium elements.

Also regardless of that there are many designs for ships that would be perfectly capable at getting humans to and from Alpha Centauri. Fuel is not nearly as much of an issue as you think it is, because in space nothing slows you down except gravity. The only actual need for fuel is to start your journey and to slow down when you get there.
