I can see your point, but keep in mind that these are common arguments against pursuing immortality. Whether or not you or I agree with them, they exist, and plenty of people believe them. In this story, Harry is dubious about them as well, as fits his character.

This work of fiction is not didactic. I'm not trying to teach anyone or sway anyone to an ideology. There were a couple reasons I went the Obliviation route, but one of them is, it's really hard to write a humorous, relatable coming of age story when the character is god-level overpowered compared to his peers. The other reasons are plot related, and will be revealed in later chapters. :)
