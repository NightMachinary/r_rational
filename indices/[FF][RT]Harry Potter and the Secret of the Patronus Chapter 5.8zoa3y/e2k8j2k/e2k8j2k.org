I just reached the list in the first chapter and I don't like those arguments.

1. As people live longer and have "better life", they tend to get less children. Also they have magic to terraform the universe with and they can learn all the secrets of magic without losing a ton as they don't die.

2. Wtf? Would Harry have given immortality to everyone else than blood purists? They can start a war anyway, but Harry would have a chance to make his side overpowered before that.

3. Remake what? If it means the earlier fabric, meh. Society has gone through changes before and this would be a good change. Things changing doesn't mean that society would be broken until personally fixed.

4. Harry already has shit like the invisibility cloak, which is definitely assassination worthy for many. With controlling dementors and all the other stuff he already has a ton of such secrets. Losing information like this would be idiocy.
