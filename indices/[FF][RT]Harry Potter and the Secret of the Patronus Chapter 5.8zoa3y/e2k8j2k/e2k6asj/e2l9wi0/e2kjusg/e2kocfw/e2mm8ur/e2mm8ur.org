Yeah, I think it was the energy line I had the most problems with. We've launched, for example, New Horizons (400kg) with enough velocity to escape the solar system, so sending a few 75kg humans to the Centauri system shouldn't be an issue, energy-wise. Would they survive the journey, given current technology? Of course not. Sending them with enough resources (food, water, air, electricity) to survive the journey, not to mention radiation shielding, would probably subject them to something similar to the tyranny of the rocket equation, where the higher mass would reduce the possible acceleration (and therefore the average travel velocity) and therefore extend the duration of the journey, which would require more food, which would slow them down, and make the journey longer and require more food, etc. Even if we could make an engine powerful enough to get the journey to Centauri down within a single lifetime, the amount of food alone we'd need to include would be ridiculous. But that's more a "how do we keep them alive" issue rather than "how do we get them there" issue.

If we want to send a corpse to Centauri, arriving in 80,000 years, we certainly have the technology to do that now, because that's about how fast New Horizons is going. The issue we have is getting someone there /quickly/, and getting them there /alive/.
