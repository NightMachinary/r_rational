Some detailed questions here. :) Lemmie go look up all my data...lol.

The DADA professor remark was made by a student in a eulogy, not a professor or a representative at the school. My interpretation of that event is that the students would continue to teach each other battle magic (which explains the resurgence of dueling at the school), but the headmasters would continue to hire a professor for the DADA position. And honestly, it might seem silly but...I just love Tonks being a Defence professor.

A lot of the information from the paragraph in Chapter 3 is related to information from this article. [[https://www.wired.com/2016/02/space-is-cold-vast-and-deadly-humans-will-explore-it-anyway/]]

Basically, it's not /entirely/ impossible, it's just /currently/ impossible. There are solutions that might work, but most are theoretical. As for the line about energy consumption, I do remember reading about this, but it's possible I made a mistake. I'll have to do some research and double check with a friend who knows about rocket science.

What do you mean by sustaining transfiguration? Are we talking about Quirrell in Harry's ring? As for that, err...spoilers.

Yes, the indoctrination thing will be cleared up later. I disagree with their philosophy, and you're right, it's a bit extreme. However, institutionalized hazing is a thing that exists, even if we should know better by now. Besides, if I made things easy for these characters, there would be no story. :)

Thanks for your feedback, and I hope this helped!
