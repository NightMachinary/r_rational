I notice that I am confused about a few things.

First, why do they have DADA professors? At Quirrel's funeral, they made a resolution that older students would teach younger students Battle Magic from then on, rather than have DADA professors who might get cursed.

Second, what exactly do you mean by this (Chapter 3):

  The problem was distance. The closest star system was several light years away. Even if humans mined all the plutonium on Earth and created a rocket ship that ran on cold fusion, there simply wouldn't be enough available energy to travel that far. It was also currently impossible to build a rocket that could navigate deep space, communicate with Earth, sustain life for long periods of time, and keep the astronauts from killing each other out of boredom.

...Other than "sustain life" (especially over the duration that such a journey would take), none of that seems anywhere /near/ impossible, and I have no idea where you're getting the energy levels you're talking about.

Third: How is the transfiguration being sustained? Philosopher's Stone is not an option, as that would be the same as killing the person-who-is-a-stone.

Fourth: The harsh treatment being inflicted upon Hermione by Madam Bones seems like military indoctrination, which isn't there to make you stronger. It's intended to make you /weaker,/ to break down your will, so that you'll readily accept hierarchy and new norms uncritically. Which does kind of match up with the description of the Auror tests, but... the characters keep saying that it's to make her stronger. Are the characters just wrong about what the effects of this kind of indoctrination are supposed to be, and this is going to be cleared up later?
