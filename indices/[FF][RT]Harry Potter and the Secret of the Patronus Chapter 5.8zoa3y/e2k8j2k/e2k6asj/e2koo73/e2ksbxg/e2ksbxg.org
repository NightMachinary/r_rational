Uggh, yes...flashbacks are rarely a good way to go, most often it's better to write linear. So, in theory, I totally agree with you. The first chapter was a struggle, because while it's important to jump into the story, as a sequel fic, readers will need to get caught up on past events.

I debated trying out your suggestion, but there's a reason it would be difficult to implement. Starting with a letter will probably slow down the story for new readers. Not everyone reading my fic has read HPMOR, some of them just like the AU setting. For them, reading through a chapter of Harry finding the letter, authenticating it, talking to Hermione, etc., would be even more confusing than flashbacks. It would probably also be really boring (for them), and set the wrong tone for the beginning of the story.

(Also, there may or may not be a plot reason why there are no scenes of them reading the letters.)

As for your questions: I'd say anywhere from a week to a month later is when Harry receives his letter. He doesn't know his mind is tampered with until he receives it. Then he has to decide if he's going to believe this letter is true, and not a prank or worse.

He does not remember anything about discovering immortality, and wouldn't even know the first steps in trying to recreate it. It's likely he would have tried anyway, realized that was going nowhere and kept working on his space exploration plan...while still keeping his original goal (immortality research) on the back burner.

As to how the letters were received, his arguments, the decision to go to space, etc., that all gets explained later in the story.

I think I underestimated how many people would want more explanation as to why Harry would allow Obliviation. Maybe if I think this over I can add a few lines to explain it better. Thanks for the feedback. :)
