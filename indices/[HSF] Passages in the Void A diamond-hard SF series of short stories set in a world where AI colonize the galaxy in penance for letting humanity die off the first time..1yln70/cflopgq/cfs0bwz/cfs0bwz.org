Well everyone is going to have an opinion and Passages has been a lot less controversial than MoPI, but I have to say your reaction is exactly the opposite of nearly everyone else who has ever posted or bothered to contact me about Passages; almost everyone thinks Mortal Passage was the height of the series and Rite the nadir, largely because Rite did not maintain the epic scope, and most people found Bringer and its quest compelling -- if anything, the oddity (corrected by Mortal Passage) being its inexplicably doglike loyalty to the biological human form.

Anyway, sorry you didn't like it; no hard feelings, better luck next time etc. And yeah, Charlie Stross is pretty good, but what was with the cats at the end of Accelerando?
