I thought that the AIs weren't very godlike in intellect, just in raw power. The had the ability to control the weather, but not the understanding necessary to predict the outcome or the wisdom to realize have better fallback options when things started going south. That seems entirely plausible if our only AI is the massively scaled up intellect of one dude, an AI which lacked the capacity to understand itself very well.

In any case, I loved this story and devoured it raptly, thanks for posting it OP!
