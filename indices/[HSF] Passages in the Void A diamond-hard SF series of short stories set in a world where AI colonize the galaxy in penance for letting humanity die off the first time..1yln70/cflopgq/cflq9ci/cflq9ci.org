Minor point of order: Saturn's children was published in 2008, the Passages stories were written between 2002 and 2007.

I agree though, Saturn's children is basically the first, second, and fourth stories, written much better. Charles Stross is one of those few authors I love enough to auto-buy everything he writes.

It's not the best story, it reads like a dry history for all but Rite of Passage (which is a standalone story set with a human POV, and honestly the only real story of the series that stuck with me) and Revelation passage (which suffers from Fast Forward syndrome, skipping over a whole new chunk of worldbuilding).

But still, it was an honest attempt at a hard sci-fi setting, even if doing so cost a lot of readability points.
