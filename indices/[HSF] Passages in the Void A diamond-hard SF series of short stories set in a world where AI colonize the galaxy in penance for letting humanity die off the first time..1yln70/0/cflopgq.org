Alright, I tried reading the first two stories. Stuff I noticed:

1) The AIs are extraordinarily incompetent at everything. Like, really badly so. It's quite remarkable, that they are simultaneously portrayed as godlike in some ways and totally useless a lot of the rest of the time. It breaks suspension of disbelief. I think that the author needed to come up with a better plan for causing human extinction than everyone in the setting being super incompetent at everything.

2) The AIs are also boring. Not necessarily the concept, but the way they are written to be devoid of personality sucks to read. The author referenced Iain Banks' culture, and one thing he ought to have noticed - but apparantly didn't - is that in those books to make AI characters interesting they are quite simply given as much emotion and personality as the humans. The Sleeper Service, the Grey Area, and in fact most of the ships and drones who got any time in the Culture books had more personality than the entire cast, humans included, of these stories. Skaffen-Amtiskaw by himself had more than twice as much personality as the sum total of all the characters in these stories. It's just a bad writing decision. People remember robots with a shtick, a personality, etc. We remember the Terminators and the SHODANs, the Datas and the C3POs and the Marvins. These robots, not so much.

3) I've read the whole humans disappeared from the solar system by extinction leaving our robots behind before; that was the premise of Charles Stross's Saturn's Children, which had a lot of really cool ideas and interesting writing, a couple really bad ideas, and the misfortune to attract the worst cover-art that it possibly could have had. Go read that instead, it's way more interesting and better than this - even the modes and methods of his failures are way more interesting than the rather mundane and boring mode of failure Williams achieved here.
