You should totally rules cheese! Rationalist D&D players are all about abusing grapple, peasant canons, and super genre-savviness!

But in seriousness, it's a great idea. I'd go with either a smart, grumpy character who can usually solve the problems before him but sometimes rubs people the wrong way (kind of like HJPEV) or a smart, charismatic character (perhaps bard) who convinces others to join them by explaining how it's in their best interests to do so.
