Peasant canons shouldn't work. "Velocity" of a picked up item doesn't give a any attack or damage bonuses to the person making the ranged attack. Either you use real world physics in which case you cant just hand each other anything at the speed of sound or you use D&D rules where a mundane thrown weapon always only takes into consideration its own properties (speak range increment) and your strength, dexterity, BAB and potential feats.
