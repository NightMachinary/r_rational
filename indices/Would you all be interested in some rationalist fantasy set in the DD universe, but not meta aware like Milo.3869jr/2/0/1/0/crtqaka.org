See, I think that "Pokemon meets lost Roman legion" could actually be interesting. I once did a series of articles called Genre Splash, where I'd create stuff out of whatever random ideas people squashed together for me.

But I don't think that Total Possible /Good/ Idea Space is exactly as large as Total Possible Idea Space.

Unless, again, we're using different definitions, which I'm totally fine with.
