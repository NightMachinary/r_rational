I probably wouldn't go so far as "any", but there are some truly stupid ideas that an author can get away with if they're well-written. Generating "bad ideas" is actually surprisingly difficult, because there are stories buried everywhere, and if you have skill with characterization and prose you can bring them to life. (The set of all stories is large enough that there are some truly terrible ideas though; ones that you could never make good.)
