I may be missing something, but Cat now has:

Persian horse archers, Roman Imperial heavy armored legions, Medieval French heavy horse with magic resistance, and mage lines trained by the most skilled living mage bar none (whether Masego is the most powerful is up for debate, but with Warlock dead the text seems pretty confident that Masego and Akua are the most skilled/knowledgeable).

And that's just her conventional military!

She has the patronage of goddesses of theft and destruction, close relationships with the two foremost living heroes of the age, a close relationship with the longtime companion of the greatest mortal evil, and the worshipful service of an entire race of magic stealthkill boogeymen.

And a reputation as a breaker, that leads people to just not even bother to fight when it's JUST HER.
