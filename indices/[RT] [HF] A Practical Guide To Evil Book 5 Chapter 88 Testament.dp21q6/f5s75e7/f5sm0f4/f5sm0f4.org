Nicae seems to have a dichotomy in the highest office of power between a Basileus from its royal line and a Strategos (more prominent and independent than a normal general, since Nicae is stuck between Ashur strangling their trade in the Samite gulf and Helike being Helike). Considering the origins of both those titles, Nicae is basically a mostly irrelevant Constantinople to Helike's early imperial Rome.

Penthes is a trade city on the eastern branch of Wasaliti. Between the first Hierarch hailing from there and their rulers calling themselves Exarchs (literally the greek word for a province's governor under the Byzanthine empire), either their legitimacy is the one closest tied to the power structures of the League as a whole, or the Exarch is just a leftover title from the occupation of Malificent II that the nobles of the city now fight over. The city itself, however, seems to be removed from the others culturally: they ostensibly worship Gods Above, and Myrmidon was born there, but the Exarch was said to have chased her away; their language is obscure enough that between the heroes only Myrmidon and Rogue Sorcerer speak it. Overall, it seems that Anaxares was right to call Penthes "a knock-off Mercantis".
