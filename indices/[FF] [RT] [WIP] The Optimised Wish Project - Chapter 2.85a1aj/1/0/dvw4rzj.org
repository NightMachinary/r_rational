Haha, thanks XD. I guess you risk losing a couple of jokes here and there if you don't know Dragon Ball, but shouldn't be anything game-breaking.

As a personal advice however I'd suggest you try reading the original Dragon Ball manga. Even if you don't like the epic planet-shattering throwdowns of what we know as Dragon Ball Z (the manga is all a single thing, that's an anime denomination), early Dragon Ball is just a delight. The art and composing are amazing and the story is a fun and lighthearted adventure that slowly grows into a darker battle manga. But until aliens and stuff are introduced it stays a rather down-to-Earth story, more of a homage to Hong Kong kung-fu movies than a sci-fi epic, and the conflicts feel more grounded with more realistic stakes because Goku is /not/ the strongest around yet. Battles are decided by tricks and small details, not by who has the newest transformation or screams the loudest.
