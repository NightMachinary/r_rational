I literally know the bare minimum about Dragon Ball Z, and yet I still love this story. I especially like how you're managing to portray all the main characters as unique in their own way. I've seen too many 'rational' stories decide that all their characters have to act exactly the same way because they seem to think intelligence correlates with one, and only one, personality type. This story is delightful. I especially like the part where Turtle just straight up told the Old Guy not to play; games are always rigged :)
