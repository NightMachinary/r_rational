I was delighted by this little bonmot: (emphasis added) “On second thought, realised Bulma, a big tree trunk crashed right in the middle of the *road* as if to purposefully stop any vehicles passing by should have rung all sort of alarms in her head. She realised she really ought to do some work on her *street* smarts.”

That being said I have to wonder: there're a few things that make me think you're a non-native speaker. Word choice (“Lineaments” in particular is a word I'd rarely use in English, but would think of much more readily in my native tongue), turns of phrase (“Lunchtime had come, and passed” instead of “Lunchtime had come and gone”), and the way you insist on /yadda yadda.” said X/, employing the full stop in direct speech even though so [[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/punctuation/punctuation-in-direct-speech][many]] [[http://www.grammaring.com/punctuation-in-direct-speech][style]] [[http://writingwithaesop.blogspot.de/2011/01/punctuation-quoted-speech.html][guides]] handle it differently I'm fairly sure it's an actual rule.
