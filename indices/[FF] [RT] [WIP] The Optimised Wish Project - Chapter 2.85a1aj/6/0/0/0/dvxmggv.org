I mean... yeah, I considered it as an option, but I found it a bit iffy to have Bulma be so squeamish about herself, and then basically pimp out other women. She's not the most morally solid character, and it's not like any of that would be technically illegal or unethical as long as the women are paid and consenting (and Roshi keeps his hands to himself), but I guess I imagined her more as wanting to give Roshi a lesson by leaving him with nothing at all. Ultimately, I may have let the Rule of Fun take the precedence there.
