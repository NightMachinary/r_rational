I actually write the stuff down in Typora, using markdown, then export to plain HTML and upload to FF.net. Works like a charm, but for some reason I must have confused my files, probably didn't re-export after fixing the typos or something. Now I tried to fix it on FF.net but they don't update immediately anyway so I need to wait.
