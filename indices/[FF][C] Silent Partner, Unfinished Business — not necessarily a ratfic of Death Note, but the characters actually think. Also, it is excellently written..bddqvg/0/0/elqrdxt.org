I just finished the fic and I really enjoyed it. It was very well written and you did a great job with both presenting a coherent world but also allowing some really great mindfuck moments by shifting perspective around through various parties so you couldn't always tell what was going to happen but there was always a Checkov's Gun. Loved it.

186k words flew by and I wish there was a sequel.
