Oh, I'll have to read this one, it sounds like an amazing premise!

BTW reminds me that I once wrote (in Italian) a fanfic about Naomi Misora's last hours, and her method of suicide of choice. Perhaps I should translate that and post it, you could say it was rational as it focused on her using her intellect to find the best way to follow Light's instructions, and why her body ended up never being found again.
