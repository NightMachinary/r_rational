There's ways to tell yourself information like how many times you've looped that isn't very difficult.

The easiest example when it comes to knowing the number of loops would be to regularly write "1" in a ledger. However if you get deja-vu from that then write 2 instead, if /that/ gives you deja-vu go to 3 and so on until you've written the number of loops. Then you can know when to stop if the number you write down reaches a certain limit.
