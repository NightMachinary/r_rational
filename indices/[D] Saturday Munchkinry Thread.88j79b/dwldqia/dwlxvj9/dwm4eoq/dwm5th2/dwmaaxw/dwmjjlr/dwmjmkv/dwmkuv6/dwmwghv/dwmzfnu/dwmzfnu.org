  If we see a bad number drawn, we go back ten seconds

I understand you completely but as you illustrate here, you're missing the fact that /you can't buy lottery tickets during the actual drawing/.

So if a bad number comes up, well the only option is going back to before the drawing began in which case you don't know any of the number are going to be the same the second time around due to the inherent randomness I mentioned before.
