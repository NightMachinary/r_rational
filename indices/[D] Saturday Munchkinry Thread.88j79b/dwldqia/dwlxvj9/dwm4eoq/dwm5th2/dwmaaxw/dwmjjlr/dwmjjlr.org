The issue is that there's a delay between the last time you can buy tickets and the lottery drawing itself.

Which is an issue because there's reasons to expect random quantum effects on things like brownian motion to impact highly delicate systems like most lottery drawings. Meaning knowledge of how the lottery came up in the previous timeline may grant you no predictive power in this one.
