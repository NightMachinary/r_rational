No you don't get it, *you can't buy tickets (and thus change numbers) /during the actual drawing/*.

You have to buy your tickets /in advance of the drawing/, which means if even one number is not what you want it to be you have to go back to before the lottery drawing in order to change which ticket(s) you bought.

The sketch you drew up clearly shows you think you can change your tickets or buy new one's while the drawing is happening, as in between them drawing numbers. Which is of course false because the period during which you can buy tickets ends before the drawing begins.
