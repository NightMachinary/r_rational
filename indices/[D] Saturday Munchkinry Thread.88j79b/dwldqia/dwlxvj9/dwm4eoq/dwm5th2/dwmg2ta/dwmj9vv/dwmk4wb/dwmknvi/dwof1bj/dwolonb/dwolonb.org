  I expect the end result of a well-utilized outcome pump is FAI, so I expect any minor cost to average utility paid upfront ends up worth it.

I'm really not sure what exactly your point is, but if I had to guess it might be that spending many subjective years doing unpleasant work would be worth it if you got FAI at the end of it all.

That would be something I would agree with however I don't think spending centuries buying lottery tickets would be involved in any plans to use the outcome pump/deja-vu antitelephone to create FAI as fast as possible (well as fast as possible while reaching some desired expectation of safety).

Plus to play devil's advocate there is a hedonistic objection you could make to that reasoning as well: That it's not really worth trying to get FAI earlier unless the amount of time you spend in time loops is less than you expect to have spent waiting for FAI ordinarily.\\
Actually there's an altruistic version of this argument as well, that the utility of other people in the other timelines still counts, so there's not necessarily any motivation to get FAI much earlier if you're still effectively extending the amount of time people spend experiencing the pre-singularity world.\\
Plus there's the extra point that if you're opposed to wireheading then the extra utility you get from getting FAI earlier is also not /that/ drastic, particularly if you're already well off and only really care about your own utility.

And now I've actually convinced myself.. So /now/ I think the best strategy is to use the outcome pump to gain as much money/power as possible and try to develop FAI completely under your own control (so your researchers are the only people working on it and you have zero competition). Basically I think trying to get a FAI with the closest approximation of your own utility function (as well as maximizing safety generally) is probably the more important part of the speed/safety development tradeoff (or rather that considering the alternate timelines maximizing speed is extremely hard).
