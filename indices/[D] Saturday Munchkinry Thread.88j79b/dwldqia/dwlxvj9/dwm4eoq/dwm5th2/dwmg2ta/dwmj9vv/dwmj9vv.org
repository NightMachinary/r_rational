Except you /are/ spending time, the fact you lose memory of the other timelines doesn't mean they didn't happen. In the lottery scenario for the reasons I outlined you're likely to be spending a /lot/ of subjective time buying tickets that you don't remember.

However as others have pointed out for sufficiently unlikely events like this you're likely to randomly get killed before you buy a winning ticket so the situation is actually much worse.
