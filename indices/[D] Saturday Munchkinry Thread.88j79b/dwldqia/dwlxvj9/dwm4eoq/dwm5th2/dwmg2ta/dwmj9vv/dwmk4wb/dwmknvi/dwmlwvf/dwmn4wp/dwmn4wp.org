  The way the question is posed implies that physical changes don't carry over, so it's not like you would age.

Sure but we still know that you do still experience those events even if your memory of them is reduced to the absolute minimum level. That becomes important because it means when considering hedonistic utility you need to consider these timelines even if you know you won't remember any of them but one.

For instance it means that if you plan on utilizing plans that involve spending centuries doing unpleasant tasks that leave you extremely unhappy in order to leave yourself better off in the final timeline iteration, well it's probably not worth it. So the lack of long term side effects from previous timeline iterations doesn't change the fact that it's not worth it to have the majority of your life be unpleasant, even if you what you actually remember is all pretty pleasant.
