You did respond. Reddit is just broken. This is the comment chain.

    once you have FAI you're immortal and still have an exponentiation operator on your experiences

  I'm not really sure what you mean here, once you have FSAI then what point is there to using your time travel? I mean [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_demon][I can think of some ways you could use the antitelephone/probability pump component as a free energy/negentropy generator]] however that almost certainly won't be worthwhile for trillions of years.

  Given you still experience the same amount of experiences for a given amount of subjective time what good exactly is your time travel once you have FSAI but prior to the heat death of the universe being a major concern? I mean if you (like me) have something of an aversion to having your memory wiped then it would seem like you would want to avoid using the time travel once you no longer had a strong incentive to do so.

  The point is to move the heat death of the universe exponentially far out.

  I'm not really sure why you say move it exponentially far out, why not just move it out indefinitely?

  Anyway I'm imagining in addition to doing that trick to get free negentropy, at some point once you've decided to ascend to full superintelligence level you could always just merge all other minds so they're connected enough to count as part of you for the purposes of the power. Then one could simply travel into the past, and by then you would have long since bootstrapped the crude anti-telephone into a system you could use to transmit massive amounts of information like all the memories you and the other members of your hivemind had gotten in the previous timeline.

  Because determinism; you need to experience a diverging decision point before looping else you end up destroying the universe.
