Well lots of people have mentioned lotteries, however due to being extremely susceptible to butterfly effects I don't think that would work so you would just end up repeating the lottery until you had tried every number or you won by sheer luck.

Instead I would invest in high risk stocks, if I fail I would revert back. So I would invest in a high risk stock extremely briefly, if I got deja vu I would change stocks if not I would keep invested. If at any point the stock stopped profiting (they may not be profitable indefinitely) then I would go back to exactly when they stopped giving returns and the sense of deja-vu I got from everything I did would be a signal to me to change which stock I was invested in.\\
I would also revert back if something bad happened to me, so my more general goal strategy would be to basically not do any action that triggered deja-vu.

Eventually as others have already pointed out I could bootstrap this into an extremely slow binary anti-telephone, at which point I would progress from becoming a billionaire to using my power to send information like science back in time. I would also use my power as a probability pump in order to impact global events significantly (for instance replaying extremely close elections or other events until the desired candidate won).
