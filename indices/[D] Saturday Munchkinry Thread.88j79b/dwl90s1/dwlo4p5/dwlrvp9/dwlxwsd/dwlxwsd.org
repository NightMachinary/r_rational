It does, but somebody with this ability could conceivably do so with higher efficiency and lower cost. It depends on a large part whether the eyes keep their angular resolution when they change frequencies.

Directional radio antenna need to be very big, because radio waves are so large. When tracking down pirate radio, the sensors typically measure the strength of the radio waves, but not their direction. You can walk in the direction of the stronger signal, but with magic eyes that can see the radio waves, you could point right to them.

Geiger counters are rather indiscriminate in what they detect. With an appropriate sensor, they can detect gamma rays, but they detect only that a gamma ray was present. The energy and direction of the gamma ray are not recorded at all. In order to measure the energy, you need to step up either to using [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scintillator#Gamma_rays][scintillators]] such as Caesium Iodide, or [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor_detector#Germanium_detector][high-purity Germanium]]. That lets you determine whether a shipping container contains U-235 (oh no), or K-40 (probably a shipment of bananas). However, you still don't get position information.

If the eyes could see gamma rays, restricted to a narrow energy range, and could detect angular information, it would let the person scan more containers, faster, and to identify where the contraband material is located.
