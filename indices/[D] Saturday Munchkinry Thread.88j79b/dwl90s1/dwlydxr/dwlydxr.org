Well as has already been pointed out technology can already do basically everything this power can. However there might still be a few niche uses here, for instance seeing radio waves so extremely low frequency that they're difficult or impossible to detect with normal tech. Plus there may be some uses to being able to perfectly filter out all EM outside an extremely narrow spectrum and cranking up your sensitivity to max, so you could maybe look at some "noisy" EM objects and see them in greater detail.

However ultimately the primary use of a power like this would just be to exploit the fame that comes with being the only known human with superpowers.
