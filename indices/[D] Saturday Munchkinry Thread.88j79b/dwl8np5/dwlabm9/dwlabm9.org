If I'm reading this right, you're not stealing the power from someone, just copying it? Then you should try to become a staff member at wherever the largest super team is, and get in the habit of patting people on the back, shaking hands, and things like that. So long as the powers don't have an obvious physical component, you could fairly quickly get the power of everyone who works there and anyone who comes in often enough. If you worked in handling the super prisoners or entrance security, a quick weapons check would give enough contact to copy that person's power.

If possible, you could also request to move to different locations so that you can copy the powers of other teams. It would be a long term thing though.

Avoiding the guy who can tell at a glance that you have ulterior motives would be a matter of gathering good intel, but if you don't act as anything other than a regular employee then no one should have cause to turn their attention/information gathering powers on you.
