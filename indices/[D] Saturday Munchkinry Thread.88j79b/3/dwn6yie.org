Rule of three: You have magic. More or less wicca - you can do a great many things, all of them via rituals in prepared spaces.

Rule: Anything that can be done and that you know how to do in sufficient detail can be done with magic. You could, for example, make gpus out of sand if you have the full mask of the chip and understand how it works.

Rule 2: Anything which cannot be done without magic cannot be done with it.

Rule 3: Becoming magic makes you subject to forces "muggles" are not. The rule of three is in full force - For you, karma is not an abstract idea, but a very rapid and vindictive law of nature. And it does not cancel out - if you punch one person and heal another, you will first get hurt three times as badly as person a was, and then rapidly heal even in the absence of further action on your part. This will kill you if you are ever responsible for sufficient harm coming to someone.

What do you do with this?
