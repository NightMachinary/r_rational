The obvious answer is to maximize your own karma. A pair of mages should be able to boost eachothers' karma massively by granting eachother healing, buffs (you can get stronger/smarter by exercising/studying, so you should be able to do that with magic right?), donating the positive results of one's work to eachother, etc.
