You can make a person fall in love with you, but you can only do that to one person a time. Their sanity is not affected and some might not put up with abuse but still keep their feelings.

You also can't make me fall in love with you and change the rules. :P

Idiot mode: You make yourself fall in love with yourself.

Easy mode: no restrictions. The love they have for you will be your idea of love.

Normal mode: If you switch to a different person, the previous person you used it on will irrevocably hate you.

Hard mode: The love will be their idea of love, so you might get yourself a crazy stalker situation. Normal mode included.

Harder mode: You can't use it on the same person twice. Hard mode included.
