I suspect there are speed limits, so no finger guns. Otherwise the stomp is just /too/ easy.

For shooting things, if we're in post-gun times you should just carry a gun. If we're in pre-gun times some kind of custom bow makes sense. You can use absurd draw forces with effectively zero effort, so you should be able to shoot pretty rapidly at very deadly speeds.

For protecting against fireballs, he should be able to just block them by holding the air in front of him still. Blocking lightning is harder without BS like controlling the electrons, and even with it you'd need absurd reaction speeds. Regardless, there's very little reason for him not to move around combat zones in some kind of flying ball of armour, so none of these really pose a threat when prepared for battle.
