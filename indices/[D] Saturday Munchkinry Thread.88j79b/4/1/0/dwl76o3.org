How much is enough to barely survive in a fight against mages flinging Fireballs, Lightning Lances and other things?

Let's say it starts at around the level of punching trucks. Though I don't know if that would apply for speed since forcing limbs to move fast can damage the muscles, and I doubt the human brain has enough computational power to constantly move the body through 1cm of space in a loop while concentrating on a fight.

Edit: 1cm above his skin, but it applies to his whole body, not just 1cm under the skin.
