I couldn't come up with anything interesting, but I did have a few stunningly boring ideas.

- Help the FCC track down pirate radio stations. Watch for radio frequency light that is brighter than it should be.

- Work at a dock, scanning shipping containers for radioactive material. By narrowing the sensitivity of your eyes to particular gamma-ray transitions, you could identify radioactive material being smuggled.
