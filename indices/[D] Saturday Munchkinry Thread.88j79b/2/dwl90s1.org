You have the ability to change the spectrum that your eyes are sensitive to. The new spectrum must be contiguous, so you can't view UV and infra-red without visible as well. As part of this ability you can also change the sensitivity of your eyes to photons, which stops you getting blinded with large spectra and allows you to see single photons at high sensitivities. What interesting uses are there of this ability?
