  how do you break this power
#+end_quote

Lots of ways that may or may not work depending on how skilled he is at his telekinesis. Burn him, freeze him, poison him, drain the air from the room so he suffocates, use radioactive materials to gamma ray him to death, other energy beams, teleport attacks past his skin, attack him in his sleep, use more physical force than he can push away with his telekinesis, attack faster than he can deflect, use massive sound blasts, attack the body parts that aren't covered by skin (his eyeballs, nostrils, mouth, etc.) or just keep food/water away from him until he dies from thirst/hunger.

  how to make a way for his range to increase with time without power-creep, or making him OP too fast?
#+end_quote

The simple way for him to increase his range is simply to grow more skin. It can't get OP too fast, because growing skin takes time. He can slowly increase the total amount of skin he has by grafting skins from one part of his body to another, or using genetic treatments to grow extra appendages. We already have the technology to do this, as shown [[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/2e/Vacanti_mouse.jpg][here]]. The extra appendages the MC grows probably won't be functional, but he can control them with his telekinesis anyway since they are covered by his skin. Eventually he will become a telekinetic tentacle monster. Heh.

  Also what would be some possible interactions with inanimate matter i.e dark matter, spiritual energy, conceptual power?
#+end_quote

- No reaction: strange matter bypasses his telekinesis, so people can harm him by throwing stuff made of strange matter at him.
- Anti-reaction: matter moves in precisely the opposite direction that he wants them to. Would result in him being horribly weak against it at first, but quickly learning to reverse telekinetic directions when using strange matter.

By the way, this power sounds a lot like Accelerator from [[https://myanimelist.net/anime/4654/Toaru_Majutsu_no_Index][A Certain Magical Index]], who has the power to change the vector of anything that touches his skin. [[https://i.imgur.com/silNqJd.gif][Here]] he flies by creating winds on his back and punches people really far by changing their vectors on contact. [[https://i.imgur.com/jfjGlLs.gif][Here]] he gets beaten up by a power nullifier. The story is full of ideas for what the power can be used for, how to strengthen it, and how to break it, so you may want to check it out if you haven't.
