Work equals force times distance. We know the distance is 1 cm. We can see check common levels of energy from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muzzle_energy][various guns]]. So for the lightest caliber and muzzle velocity of firearm we need to exert 140 J in 1 cm, thus requiring 140/.01 14,000 Newton of force. For heavy firearms you need more .44 magnum you need 1150/.01 115,000 Newton of Force. Note how much more force you need for higher caliber and muzzle velocity.

What does this mean intuitively? We can translate these forces into weight (since our Main Character will likely also be using this power to throw stuff around). Just to quickly get an intuition for it: [[http://www.kylesconverter.com/force/newtons-to-pounds--force][here is a converter to force pounds]]. 14,000 Newtons is 314 pounds, 115,000 Newtons is 2585.3 pounds.

If your setting is medieval, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_longbow][for reference]]:

#+begin_quote
  The quarrel-like 102 gram arrow from a yew 'self bow' (with a draw weight of 144lbs at 32 inches) while travelling at 47.23 metres per second yielded 113.76 joules, more kinetic energy than the lighter broad-heads while achieving 90% of the range. The short, heavy quarrel-form bodkin could penetrate a replica brigandine at up to 40° from perpendicular.

So about as much KE as a lighter firearm

Of course, as they author, you can finagle things either way if you want your MC to have more durability and less strength or vice versa. If you want more durability and less strength, you could mention that your MC's power acts instinctively and much more powerfully against threats versus raw strength. Or you could mention that your MC's power works better in small intense burst (thus allowing more force against stopping bullets and less for lifting weights). Conversely, if you want your MC to be throwing around boulders but barely able to stop an arrow from killing them, you could mention their power works better with more surface area or time to focus. Either way, you could make up a factor of added efficiency and this can account for difference.

For electricity... it's a bit trickery but you have even more discretion as the author. Let's start with the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroshock_weapon][wikipedia page for stun weapons]]

  Output voltage is claimed to be in the range of 100 V up to 6 kV; current intensity output is claimed to be in the range of 100 to 500 mA; individual impulse duration is claimed to be in the range of 10 to 100 µs (microseconds); frequency of impulse is claimed to be in the range of 2 to 40 Hz; electrical charge delivered is claimed to be in the range of 15 to 500 µC (microcoulombs); energy delivered is claimed to be in the range of 0.9 to 10 J.[8] [9] The output current upon contact with the target will depend on various factors such as target's resistance, skin type, moisture, bodily salinity, clothing, the electroshock weapon's internal circuitry, discharge waveform, and battery conditions.

On the other hand, an actual naturally occurring lightning bolt had around a billion joules of electricity. No way the MC can directly survive it with brute force and still not be OP otherwise.

So if your MC can apply their TK power to the movement of electrons with anywhere near the efficiency they can apply it to physical objects, the can easily stop nonlethal shocks. Of course as the author you can BS anything you want about how magical electrical attacks works. Maybe the magic forces the electrons along a path so the conventional calculations of the energies involved don't work and the MC's TK defense doesn't work very well. Maybe your MC's power is ineffective against electricity because the electrons are too small or some conceptual limit.

For blocking fireballs, the trick isn't to stop the heat (which would be a lot of [[https://www.quora.com/How-many-joules-does-a-Bunsen-burner-on-a-medium-flame-500-degrees-Celsius-output-per-second][joules of energy to block]], enough to make our MC require ridiculous amount of energy dissipation, at least compared to blocking bullets and electric shocks). Instead they should push the fireball itself away and minimize the contact with the flammable material (as is done in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firewalking#Explanation][firewalking]] for instance). Firewalking works because the coals have low thermal conductivity, as the author you can set the fireball material to whatever you want to make them more or less dangerous. For this, F=MA and the above Work=force times distance will let you estimate how good they are at keeping the fireballs off.

For exotic effects (magic, exotic particles, etc.), I can help but really you can kind of make anything plausible.

Edit: One more note... I assumed you were set on the 1cm range, but note that increasing it proportionality increases the total kinetic energy it can deflect with a given level of force. I.E. increasing range to 5cm is 5 times the KE it can handle with the same amount of force, or decreasing to .2 cm is 5 times less KE. Not sure how set you are on the 1 cm range.
