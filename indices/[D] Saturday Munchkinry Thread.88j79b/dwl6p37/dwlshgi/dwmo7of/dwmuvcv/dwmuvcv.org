Well, I was thinking of blocking projectiles, not launching them... your post reminded of the fact that if the TK is uniform (i.e. exerts the same fore stopping an object or accelerating an object) in the forces it generates, then blocking a projectile means that they could equivalently launch the projectile.

  very little reason for him not to move around combat zones in some kind of flying ball of armour,

Oh yeah... any kind of TK strength that is enough to stop an arrow is enough to wear heavy armor on the order of hundreds of pounds.. So I guess if the main character is minmaxing effectively raw power matters a lot less than carrying the right gear.
