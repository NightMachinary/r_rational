I wish I saw this post yesterday, because I've made a really good response to a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/536z7p/saturday_munchkinry_thread/d7qqzlx/][similar post]] before.

The only difference is that in the other version of the question, you know for sure if you have reset the timeline while with this question it's uncertain. So you ask a friend to print out a desired number of visually striking/memorable images and put them in a folder with a number attached to each image starting from #0 without letting you seen any of the images. Then whenever you reset and want to know how many times you made a reset, you pull out the images until you reach the first image you /don't/ feel a deja vu. Whatever number that image has is the number of times you've reset. First image means you have reset 0 times. Second image means you have reset 1 time. Third image means you have reset 2 times, and so on...

For better use of this power, don't do the image thing to figure out the number of resets you have done. Instead, plan out what you want to reset the timeline for and write a list of options/actions you will try for each reset. Then iterate through the list as you go through the images to know which option you are going to act on for the current timeline.
