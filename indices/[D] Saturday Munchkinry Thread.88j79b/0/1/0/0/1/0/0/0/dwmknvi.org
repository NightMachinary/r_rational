  What definition of happen are you using? What determines whether some "happened" or not? Further, why is that distinction important in this case?
#+end_quote

I'm using the definition of "happen" that is the literal one that everyone uses ordinarily. This is explicitly stated to be a time travel power with the extra caveat of near total amnesia. So you still subjectively experience every timeline regardless of whether you remember it, which means you have to consider the utility you had experienced in a given timeline when calculating total utility.

  Getting killed isn't nearly as subject to starting conditions as winning the lottery.

This is actually a very good point, however I would still worry that if you're spending such an absurd number of years buying tickets it seems like something is likely to break that loop that's more likely than getting the winning ticket, though this is something of a meta-level modesty argument.

However the more important issue is whether it's really worth spending the vast majority of your subjective life buying lottery tickets even if you may not remember most of it after the fact. Certainly it would seem like that would make the expected utility payout very low compared to something like the stock manipulation I mentioned.
