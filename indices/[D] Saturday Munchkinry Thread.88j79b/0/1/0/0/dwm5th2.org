Well the main issue here would be, is it really worth spending literally decades of your life just buying lottery tickets and then forgetting about it in order to get the winnings?

From a cost benefit perspective, strategies that require massive amounts of time be spent to collect your reward are less desirable, particularly if you already consider losing memories (in this case the majority of your life, because yes that's how long you would be spending buying tickets) as undesirable.
