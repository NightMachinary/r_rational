You can't really do that because of the delay between the when you can no longer buy tickets and the lottery drawing. So for instance if you see your number lost you have to go back in time to before the drawing started.

I also mentioned how lotteries are highly delicate random systems because it means that knowledge of how the drawing went in one timeline don't let you predict their outcome once you go back in time.
