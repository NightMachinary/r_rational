I agree that I have to buy my tickets in advance of the drawing. Assume that I do not contradict that concession. In fact, I only buy one ticket. I agree that I have to go back to before the lottery drawing if I want to change which ticket I bought. I do not want to change which ticket I bought.

My sketch means to imply I do not leave the chair at any time during my subjective experience represented by the winding time arrow.

What changes between resets is not my ticket, but one number on TV, and the expression on my face, and whether my hand is on the metaphorical button.
