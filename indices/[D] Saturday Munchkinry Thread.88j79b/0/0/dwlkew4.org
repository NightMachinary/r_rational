Even without the deja vu feeling, you have a manual outcome pump, and could spend many bits of anonymity to double your money by going to a casino and putting all on black.

Depending on what counts as an idea, you could establish communication between timelines. To write "Hello" to variable "welcome", you would consider the idea "Use Captain's Log Protocol v1.0 to set the first bit under the welcome heading to 0", and corresponding ideas for the remaining 39 bits of Hello. To read the contents of "welcome", you would consider all ideas one might use to write things under the welcome heading. If you receive a message from this, proceed to rewrite the message under headings welcome_l and welcome_r. If all ideas were previously considered, use a trusted random number generator to choose from welcome_l and welcome_r and recurse.

This would be the point where I go into messages from the distant future and AI boxing but we've been through that.
