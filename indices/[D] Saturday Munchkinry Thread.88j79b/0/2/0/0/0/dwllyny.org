So you're saying break down the lotto numbers into parts, and determine each part one by one? That doesn't quite work because I will be riddled with false positives: an entire lotto number is a fairly unique pattern, if I see it and get deja vu, I can be sure I saw it as a lotto number before. And if I don't play the lottery normally (which I don't), then that means it must be from the previous timeline.

A part of a lotto number is a number with around 2 digits. It won't trigger deja vu for the same reason eating your favorite food doesn't trigger deja vu: it happened too many times. I see small numbers all the time. And even if it does trigger deja vu, I can't tell whether the deja vu is because I saw the number on the previous timeline, or simply saw the number in the past.

Although, that gives me an idea. I need an accomplice for this plan though. What needs to happen is, first my accomplice gathers a bunch of very distinct images that I have never seen before (preferably newly drawn). My accomplice then assigns each image a number, and first shows me image 0. If I experience deja vu, I'm in the second timeline. If I don't, I'm in the first.

If I'm in the first timeline, then we wait for the next lotto. When the winning numbers are shown, my accomplice will show me the images that match each of the numbers. My accomplice then destroys all the images to ensure I never see the others. I now time travel back.

If I'm in the second timeline, my accomplice shows me all the images. The ones that trigger deja vu are the winning lotto numbers. The rest won't trigger deja vu because I didn't see them in the first timeline.

YES! This will work! Now I just need to find a good lottery and an accomplice. (I don't know how to time travel, but I have delusions of grandeur and empty hopes that I might have already done so and simply forgotten about it because the time travel doesn't keep memories.)
