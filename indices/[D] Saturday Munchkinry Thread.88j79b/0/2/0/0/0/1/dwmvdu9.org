[[/u/blasted0glass]]'s approach works even in situations where you don't have an after-the-fact way of finding out the answer, such as when guessing passwords. All you need to do is a recursive search.

Here's another way of doing it that you might find less objectionable. Break each part down into a stream that you can easily reason about. Let's go with a binary stream. First test {0}. If you get deja vu, choose 1, else choose 0 (call this x). Then continue, and test {x0}. If you get deja vu, choose 1, else choose 0. Then continue with {xy0}, etc. You can get around the fact that the early numbers won't be triggering deja vu by prefixing them with some random string.

If you get to the end, try the value. If it fails, jump back to just before the most recent zero.
