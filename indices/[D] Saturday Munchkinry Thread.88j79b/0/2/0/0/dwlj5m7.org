Arrange slips of paper with numbers written on them around you, in a circle. Slowly rotate with your hand above each slip. If you get deja-vu, write that number down and wait an hour to get the next number. If you don't experience deja-vu, wait until the numbers are determined, learn the next number in the sequence, and go back to when your hand was over that number. Repeat until you have all the numbers after several sessions of future telling, an hour separated.

If numbers determined with this method prove to be wrong, quit going back--your forecasting is affecting the outcome. Also, freak out: your forecast having an effect is much more likely if others have time travel powers.
