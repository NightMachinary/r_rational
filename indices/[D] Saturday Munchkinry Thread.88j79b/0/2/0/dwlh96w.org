  The best way to do it would be to read this post, go to buy a lottery ticket, and see what number pops out at you. If nothing, wait a day, learn the winning number, memorise it, and go back to when you read this post.

The ability works the same way as ordinary deja vu: it doesn't tell you what happens next, it just tells you when you have repeated a situation. So in this case, in order for me to find out the winning lotto numbers, I would have to spend time thinking of every single possible lotto number, one by one, until the deja vu effect triggers. And I can't speedcount through them, I have to give each one a good long think to see if the deja vu triggers. So it will take forever =(.
