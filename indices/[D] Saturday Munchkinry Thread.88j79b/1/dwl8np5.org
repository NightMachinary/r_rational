Suppose you had the ability of gaining a supers power(gaining, not replacing) in a world with classic hero-villains. Villains control various gangs, there's both vigilantee and organized heroes and such. You need to touch a super 6 times before getting the full power although the gains are incremental.

There's a single hero in town whose power is to gain innate understanding of other's powers, and a few who can learn about your power in a roundabout way(reading your past but only he's watching you, getting extra knowledge when watching an event, temporarily making copies of you).

How would you go about accumulating as much power as possible while staying off the grid for as long as possible?
