Stand on the street, with a free hugs sign.

Not quite literal, but something silly like being a clown and while giving free balloons slightly touching the skin of people.

Join a gang, pretend you're blind and profit? The argumentation for joining a gang is no one would suspect a blind person of being a drug dealer.

It also depends on the power, does it have to be the act of touching a live, conscious being or just having access to a part of their body? In that case hire someone to get you a sample of their DNA (hair, spit, skin follicle) touch it and profit.
