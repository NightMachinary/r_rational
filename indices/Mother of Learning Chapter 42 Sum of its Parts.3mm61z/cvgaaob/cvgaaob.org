Typo thread.

#+begin_quote
  Zorian horridly strengthened his mind shield
#+end_quote

Pretty sure that was meant to be "hurriedly".

#+begin_quote
  They didn't bother with no flimsy 'monster attack' setup this time
#+end_quote

Was the double negative intentional?

Also, while it's not strictly a typo:

#+begin_quote
  she scarfed down her meal in half an hour flat
#+end_quote

Was her meal supposed to be much bigger than I was imagining it as? If not, I suspect this was supposed to be half a /minute/, rather than half an hour.
