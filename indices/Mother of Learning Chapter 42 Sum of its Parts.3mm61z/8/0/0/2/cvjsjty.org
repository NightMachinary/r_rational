I think the method he's using lately is kind of cheating- he's supposed to be using his ability to sense the mana in the marbles. He was kind of good at it, in terms of being able to dodge marbles thrown directly at him.

Using the "mana cloud" method to sense the physical object moving through the air (rather than the mana within the object) is not the same thing at all and doesn't help train his mana sense.

Xvim had caught on to this in the restart where he started doing it, by trying to get him to list the marbles by how much mana was in them.
