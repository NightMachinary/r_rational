My understanding is that his "teaching style" places much more focus on "learn through experimentation how to do something you've not done before". If he tells you how to dodge the pebble, you've learned the shaping exercise, but you haven't learned how to find novel solutions to new problems.

Maybe another student's solution would be to try to reach the bucket of pebbles and "tag" each one to see with detect magic, rather than the mana bubble head. He might be okay with either solution, but is more interested in teaching "how to solve the problem" (in excessively hardass manner, but still) than "how to perform basic shaping exercise".
