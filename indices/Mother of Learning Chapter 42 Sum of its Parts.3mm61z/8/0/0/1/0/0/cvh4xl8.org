That's a perfectly valid point, but to me it mostly is a criticism of the "hardass" aspect of him, not the "lack of teaching them how to do shaping" aspect.

Generally I would agree with your assessment of him as "teaches reluctantly", but I would assume that when he does teach, he thinks his method is the "right" one in terms of having the best outcome if they can survive it. For those who can't, however, he has provided no value at all, so it's still definitely an inferior outcome unless you think (as I'd assume Xvim does) that anything less than a "completely optimal" mage is worse than no magic at all.
