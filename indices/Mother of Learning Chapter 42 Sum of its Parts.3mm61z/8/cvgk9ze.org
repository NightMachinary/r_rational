Some observations from someone who just finished reading up to this point mostly in one go (over two days, a week ago). I have advantages and disadvantages in analyzing where this is going. I've just read it so it's fresher in my mind, but I've also not had nearly enough time to think about it and I'm sure some of you have read most of the early chapters multiple times. No mater, here's some of my thoughts:

- Damien probably maters, but not necessarily. Especially given it seems doubtful he's in the loop.

- Most likely originator for the loop seems like it would be some sort of ancient machinery. A loot of noise was made out of some kind of magical doors which seems like they might be a possible trigger. In a related note a portal from the same people who apparently made or used these doors exists under the city. Zorain has been given a map of something under the city. This is probably not coincidence. Also why in the world do you have the exit node for your teleportation system deep under ground in a dangerous area.

- Why did all the spiders dye?

  - Probably they didn't. If I was faced by this I certainly would not put all my eggs in one basket. Why not spread out a bit. Red Robes is no good at mind magic and divination can be perfectly defeated so there's almost no chance he actually tracked down and killed all of them. Why she did not tell Zorain this (unless this is what the message was supposed to be about, but I doubt that) I'm not sure, probably she was worried that he'd draw any potential fire back to them.

- Xvim What's his game?

  - Zorain is a pretty competent mage at this point certainly for his supposed age and yet Xvim is always discouraging almost to a cartoonist extent.
  - Xvim may just be a bad teacher, but he's shown himself to be talented and probably on the whole write about the things he is trying to teach.
  - At the same time it's clear that he's an abject failure at his goals. He doesn't explain how to make progress on any of his exercises and it seems that he would be happy to use the entire year on silliness. Is this some sort of trick or is he in some way probing for a reaction.

- Why rebellion.

  - Don't get me wrong but the motivation hasn't really ever been explained. Is it just a power thing? Is the island becoming overcrowded? Why not sooner. What's changed?

- How many loopers are there?

  - At least two
  - Signs seem to point to 3 at one time
  - Red Robes wasn't physical
  - Why? He had no reason to think he was going to be attacked.
  - It can't be easy projecting yourself like that. It seems like it would require some complicated bit of soul magic.
  - Zorain is tagging along because the targeting mechanism for the spell got messed up but why is Red Robes?
  - Two possibilities. He has his own valid soul identifier, but he seemed unreasonably reluctant to hurt Zach also the loop always restarts for Zorain when Zach dies.
  - Could Redrobes be hitching onto Zach in a similar (probably soul magic based) way as the spiders were with Zorain. AKA he isn't actually looping physically, but his soul is being pulled along.

- Why/how did Zach start the loop.

  - He's rich, but doesn't actually seem powerful. He has guardians that control him. If anything their interests run counter to him, they have no reason to turn him into a super mage.
  - Resolutions:

    - He didn't: He too got sucked into somebody else's loop.
    - It was an accident. He was going where he shouldn't have gone and he got sucked in
    - Possibly the soul marker is inherited? Last of his line so he's the only one left with the marker.

      - might also explain Red Robes Did any of his family turn them selves into some kind of an immortal with soul magic? Not why red robe's afraid though

- gods:

  - I have to think gods and their disappearance are relevant somehow. How much power would this who looping exercise take? On the order of the total entropy that was expounded planet wide during that semester. How does it keep it up for literary 100 years. Where is a 100 years of the planets output of magic coming from? The gods maybe in some strange way? Channeled and controlled by some machine?

- What is Red Robes doing?

  - Red Robes is apparently no longer helping the evaders.
  - Reasons:
  - Red Robes is no more. Something has done him in.
  - Direct confrontation with Zach has finally made him realize there is another looper and he is trying to deal with the problem in some way.
  - Red Robes is devising a counter to the Zorain development/ possibly the spiders.

What I would do if I was Zorain

- Put as much of what I've put above to the test as possible.
- Track down Zach. You're a competent mind mage, he probably isn't at least talk to him and confirm the marker you've been tracking isn't red robes. Do it through a proxy if necessary to assure red robes doesn't gain this knowledge
- Travel. Confirm the loop extends across the planet. This is potentially dangerous as behavior when exiting the looping zone would probably be bad, but probably OK.
- Figure out more about the motivations of the rebellion.
- Start keeping an eye out for being out of the loop. Ask the priests during the start of each loop if they are in contact with angels. If so you can be pretty sure your out of the loop.
- Try to figure out if anyone in the invaders forces are disappearing every time at the start of the loop. Red Robes can't control where he is at the start so that's how you catch him
- Consider knocking Zach out of the loop if possible even if it means killing him.

  - Red Robes probably has not had enough time to come up with a perfect battle plan against the spider less city.\\
  - The more time you give him looping the more time he has to do so, at least as soon as he starts helping again.
  - With some practice you probably can beat invasion - super human knowledge.
