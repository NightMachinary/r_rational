Just putting this theory here in the unprobable case it turns true so that I can boast in future. I think Zach is a shifter, and was the first supposed sacrifice for the primordial. The time loop spell was created by the primordial itself, possibly to avoid the sacrifice in the first place. The primordial just wanted to take a small multimillenial nap and now it has to wake up and bring destruction to the mortal plane. It's annoyed as hell.
