I would hardly call half an hour to eat a meal "wolfing" it down, especially considering they apparently sat in complete silence for over that length, the reason meals take so long to eat is because you talk during them... Also big dialogue paragraphs with single line interruptions always breaks me out of being immersed. It reads so awkwardly and lacks the constant feedback that a normal conversation would hold (nodding along, saying uh huh, etc). I don't know how you'd text something like that though.
