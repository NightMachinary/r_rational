Riight. I don't tend to do this kind of meta analysis on fanfiction too much, because... a lot of fanfiction is kinda written as it comes? I agree Xvim will probably be important. I'm not sure if this requires him to be a time traveller. With his abilities clearly established he could just be a strong companion if Z ever comes clean with him.
