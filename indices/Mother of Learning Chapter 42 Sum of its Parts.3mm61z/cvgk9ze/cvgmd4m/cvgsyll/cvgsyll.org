I think Xvim is just a horrible teacher. Sure, he knows his stuff, but he doesn't intuitively understand that what's obvious to him is not obvious to people he's mentoring. And he doesn't think about that.

Thus 'now close your eyes and dodge the pebble', rather than 'now extend your mana around your head and watch disruptions to detect the pebble' because the way to do that is /obvious/ to Xvim.
