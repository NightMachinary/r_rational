Even then, if you want to teach someone problem solving, you don't do what he does. First you explain how problem solving works, then you give them problems to do, and then if they can't solve them you give guidance.

I think he learned by this method, so he teaches by it regardless. It 'worked' for him and he presumably ended up feeling superior to most other mages so therefore it must be a good method as far as he's concerned. When kids fail out they're just showing that mages today are too soft and not that his teaching methods are sub-optimal, which reinforces his bias.
