  What if, as Zach suspects, each time the loop ends you hop into a parallel universe and time continues on as usual. Then your mindrapees may be mentally disabled for the rest of their lives due to you. Like that time travel vid on this sub a while back with the button.

It is certainly a concern. Once he has mastered mindrape to the point that it is not mentally destructive it will be less of one, but even then this being a parallel universe thing has some rather far reaching implications. One of them being that it becomes incumbent on Zorian to figure out what list of instructions and knowledge he can give to select people in order to maximise good in the many universes while still leaving him time to practice stuff.

  The more obvious answer, and one zorian prefers, is to steal their spellbooks or a pass for the parts of the library that have secrets in them. Much less risk of retaliation there and its all in an easy to read format.

Ah, I was operating under the unspoken assumption that these were non-sharing type mages where the most powerful spells were jealously guarded and passed down only in family lines, word of mouth and coded spellbooks ect ect. Under those circumstances minds would hold the most useful knowledge. Depends on if this is a scientific type culture or an alchemist type culture at the highest levels of power. The lower levels are clearly scientific, but as you climb the totem pole I suspect that incentives shift.
