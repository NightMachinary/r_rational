  If I were him the very first thing I'd do once learning about a looping mind mage would be to make a conditional suicide object that would mulch me the second my mind got invaded.

Why? He resisted the mind magic. I mean, he may well get a mind shield spell item and more mental resilience training/ rituals/ wards but suicide is an exceptional step.

And he's fighting along side a Lich with soul magic. If he killed himself the lich might just grab his soul, nope him going to the afterlife, and ruin it.

A triggered death on mental invasion means that someone can easily kill him.
