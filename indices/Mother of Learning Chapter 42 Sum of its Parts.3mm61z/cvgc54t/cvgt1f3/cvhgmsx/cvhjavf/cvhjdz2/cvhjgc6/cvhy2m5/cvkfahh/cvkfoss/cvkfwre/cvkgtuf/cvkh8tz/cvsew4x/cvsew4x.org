I think I'll take a shot at this morality discussion.

1) I agree that positive actions don't cancel negative actions and make negative actions positive. 2) I agree that causing other people harm, even temporary, even in a time loop, is still causing harm. That's a bad thing.

HOWEVER.

1) I consider lasting harm more damaging than temporary harm. The shorter it lasts, the less important it is. So, while committing atrocities in the loop is still bad, it is nowhere near as bad as committing atrocities outside the loop.

2) I thing weighting harm is too narrow a perspective. It misses a lot of important details. To avoid missing important details I propose to use state of the world to evaluate actions.

A simple thought experiment. There is some problem approaching (plague, war, doesn't matter). You can prevent the catastrophe by causing harm and doing atrocious things to some people. If you don't prevent the catastrophe, it will cause much greater harm to much larger population.

- If you commit the atrocities, you will steer the world towards the future where you killed a bunch of people, but catastrophe was averted.

- If you refuse to take action, your inaction will steer the future into state where catastrophe strikes and millions die.

I personally would choose to overt the catastrophe. It is obvious for me which choice minimizes suffering. HOWEVER. The utility calculation should not be flattened. It is an important fact that catastrophe-aversion plan includes atrocities. If while searching for the solution I would find an option that averts the catastrophe without the need for atrocities, this option would be superior to both previously discussed ones. This third future would be best.

But if I searched and still see only to options, then too bad. Catastrophe must be averted, and some will suffer for the greater good.

All that said, Zorian is not a consistent consequentialist as outlined above. This irks me a little.
