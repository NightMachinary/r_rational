I mostly agree with you.

However, there are two important additions.

First, I think Zorian may be outlevelled by Red Robe, and Red Robe may be levelling faster than him. This is a reasonable guess considering Red Robe has more freedom of action than Zorian and seems to bee in a loop for longer time. This situation, if true, is a very pressing and dire concern. Zorian needs to focus on getting stronger, and increasing speed of getting stronger. While your concerns about stealth still have weight in this case, squeamishness and moral high ground don't. As [[/u/EliezerYudkowsky]] said,

Second, loop is an unique opportunity to do things that are high-risk high-cost high-reward with greatly reduced or nullified risk and cost. Plague vaccines research, volatile spell and alchemy experiments, everything that is too risky or expensive (or horrible).

I consider, say, infecting all the humanity within the loop with 100% deadly plague ten times an acceptable price for producing a cure that will eliminate the plague forever.

The plague cure research is just one example. A person ready to pay the price could use the loops to greatly improve human condition. Cures, improvements, transplants, miscellaneous transhumanism... The list goes on.

What's needed is 1) neutralize other loopers and 2) be able to see the possibilities.

I actually have great hopes for later arcs of the story. I like to read about world optimization.
