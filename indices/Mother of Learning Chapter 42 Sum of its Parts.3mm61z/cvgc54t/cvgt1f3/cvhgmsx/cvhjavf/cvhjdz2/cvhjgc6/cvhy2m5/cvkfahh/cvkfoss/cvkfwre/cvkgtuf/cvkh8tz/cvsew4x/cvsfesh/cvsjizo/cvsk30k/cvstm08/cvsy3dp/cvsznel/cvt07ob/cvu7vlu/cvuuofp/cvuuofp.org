  First, I think Zorian may be outlevelled by Red Robe, and Red Robe may be levelling faster than him.
#+end_quote

He is indeed outlevelled by Red Robe, so what he needs to do is to improve skills that allow him to lessen those advantages- he needs deep scanning to find memories so he can ambush Red Robe without defences, he needs better mental attacks to hurt him more, he needs better guns to surprise him with, he needs illusions and such to avoid his attacks as he did with invisibility, he needs alchemy potions to give himself more of a kick despite his low mana reserves.

And of course, he is doing all of those.

Being outlevelled? Unlikely. Red Robe already has gate, the top level transportation spell. He probably has most of the best magic. He can't steal much more. Zorian, by virtue of starting at a much lower level, is much more able to steal his way to increased power. Red Robe has also likely reached the plateau in his mana reserves as well.

Of course, he'll no doubt have a few extra powerful tricks.

Zorian also has access to the Cyoria library, a resource Red Robe lacks, and all the mages of the Cyoria academy, a big advantage- Red Robe's resources are likely more spread out and harder to acquire.

So it's not clear yet that it's a pressing concern. It's somewhere off in the future. Dire, yes.

  While your concerns about stealth still have weight in this case, squeamishness and moral high ground don't.
#+end_quote

Squeamishness and moral high ground have the advantages of producing better sanity, lower risks, easier allegiance with sane people and a lower risk of later being unnecessarily immoral. Morality isn't just a silly barrier to progress.

  In Worm that level of niceness would get you killed or worse.
#+end_quote

That was incorrect. Worm is heavily about awkward allegiances and treaties between heroes and villains. Not being nice frequently has a cost to people, as with Colin Wallis' attempt to kill Leviathan, being nice is often beneficial to people, as with Taylor's attempt to ally with the protectorate.

  Second, loop is an unique opportunity to do things that are high-risk high-cost high-reward with greatly reduced or nullified risk and cost. Plague vaccines research, volatile spell and alchemy experiments, everything that is too risky or expensive (or horrible).
#+end_quote

And now we go from solving sort of imminent problems to solving socioeconomic problems with immorality.

#+begin_quote
  I consider, say, infecting all the humanity within the loop with 100% deadly plague ten times an acceptable price for producing a cure that will eliminate the plague forever.
#+end_quote

How would you feel after doing that if you later found out that each world was real, and as Zach supposed you were hopping between alternate realities?

Or if mistakes meant you Zorian were permanently infected, and accidentally managed to take an enhanced strain outside the time loop due to soul shenanigans? This is an incredibly high risk strategy.

#+begin_quote
  The plague cure research is just one example. A person ready to pay the price could use the loops to greatly improve human condition. Cures, improvements, transplants, miscellaneous transhumanism... The list goes on.
#+end_quote

Possibly, although liches have been experimenting on these things for a while. Undead are the common way to do transhumanism.

He could certainly steal a lot of useful magic and spread it to the masses.

Alchemy seems like the obvious route to general improvement of society, alchemy and mana crystals powering industry. He could work to get potions of youth out to the masses, stuff like that.

The message from the Aranea implied that the loop was degrading. Those sound like rather slow routes to power, rather than stealing magic, and are a bit risky.
