  Thankfully, there seems to be no idiot ball in the story so far. However, one thing Zorian doesn't prioritize as much as he probably should is learning to learn.

In story, there have been two ways mentioned to improve intellect.

1. Is to soul bond with a more intelligent being. You become a smarter, servile copy of their personality.

2. Is to form a hive mind as the rats do.

There may be other methods, but we've seen no evidence of those. As such, the obvious thing to do is to work on his mental powers and work on an enhancement ritual to give people empathy. If he can form a hive mind with all the alchemy experts in the world he can get a lot done.

On memory spells, he is trying to get better access to that part of the library. Mind magic is forbidden.

It would be good to protect K more, yeah.
