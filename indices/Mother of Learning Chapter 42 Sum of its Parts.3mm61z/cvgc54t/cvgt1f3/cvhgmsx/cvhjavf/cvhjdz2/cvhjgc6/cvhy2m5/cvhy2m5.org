And that is an unambiguously bad thing. The resurrection of an elder demon thing is very much a worse thing many times over because of multiplication. As such, I'd call most things that Zorian can do in a time loop justified so long as it stops the elder demon thing.

Now, this doesn't mean that any given action is necessarily the best thing to do, because justifiable is different from optimal. At the very least some attempt should be made to do it the non-invasive way first.
