The invasion of privacy remains, and any death or pain he causes still happened, even if the person doesn't remember it.

Just like if you rape a person then kill them we still regard it as immoral to rape them, even though you ended their memories. In this situation it's mind rape and time loop shenanigans, but the immorality is still there.

Even if people forget about what you did, it still happened and still caused pain. The person was hurt by you. The world isn't required to be hurt.
