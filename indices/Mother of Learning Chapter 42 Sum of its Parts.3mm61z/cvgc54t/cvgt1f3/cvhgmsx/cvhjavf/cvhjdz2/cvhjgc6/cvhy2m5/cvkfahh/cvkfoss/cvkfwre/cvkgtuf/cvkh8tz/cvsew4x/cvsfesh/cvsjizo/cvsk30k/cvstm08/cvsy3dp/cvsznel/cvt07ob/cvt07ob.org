  Failing that, I would say that "resurrection" of a primordial is a pressing issue. Failing even that, I would say that perspective of being soulkilled by the Red Robe is a pressing issue. However you look at it, Zorian's situation doesn't look good. IMHO, it warrants a lot more drastic measures that Zorian implements now. Also, let's not forget the plague that killed like half the humanity some years ago. It happened once, it could happen again. Time loop would be the perfect opportunity to develop the panacea safely and responsibly (after neutralizing other loopers, of course)

As you noted, there are threats that are in the future, and because of those drastic action is necessary.

He doesn't actually know the plans of the invaders or the primordial so he can't plan to stop them very easily, although he is slaughtering his way through them. For Red Robe he's practicing making a superior gun and improving his mind magic, the two things that hurt him before.

The algorithm isn't biased towards extremes, and as I noted is ok on its own. The lack of any data means the algorithm is likely to be filled with your biases, in this case, drastic action.

His current threats are nebulous and uncertain, and not immediate threats to him. There's no clear drastic solution to them, so it's much to early to start seeing this as a crisis requiring drastic measures.

I earlier noted the sort of situation where drastic action is needed- what you noted, where a nuke may be necessary. If inaction means lots of people die, and you have a weapon that can end the conflict it's rational to use it.

Inaction for him means more time to grind.
