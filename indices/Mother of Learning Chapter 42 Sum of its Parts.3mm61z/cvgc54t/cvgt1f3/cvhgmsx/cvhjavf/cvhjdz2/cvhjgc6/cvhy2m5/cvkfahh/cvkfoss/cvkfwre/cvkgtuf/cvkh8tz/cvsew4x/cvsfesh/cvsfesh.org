  A simple thought experiment. There is some problem approaching (plague, war, doesn't matter). You can prevent the catastrophe by causing harm and doing atrocious things to some people. If you don't prevent the catastrophe, it will cause much greater harm to much larger population.

This is the standard way dictators get into power. They claim it's a crisis, invoke emergency powers, and then do whatever they want. Those powers start to become normalized and are used to solve socioeconomic problems often, which leads to a lot of atrocities.

So there's a third option. You take a measured and intelligent approach to minimize the harm. You gather likeminded people, build up your powers with a mixture of ethical and slightly unethical activities, and you only do especially immoral things if you have a very strong reason to do them.

Lots of people have managed to deal with wars and plagues without being evil. They're not some special problem that you should routinely handle with atrocities. You need a really absurd and contrived scenario for routine evil to be the only option.
