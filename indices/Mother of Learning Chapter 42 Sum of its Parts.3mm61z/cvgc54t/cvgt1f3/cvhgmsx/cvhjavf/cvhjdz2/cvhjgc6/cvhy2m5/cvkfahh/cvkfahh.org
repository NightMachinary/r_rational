  The resurrection of an elder demon thing is very much a worse thing many times over because of multiplication.

And he is willing to compromise his morality to attack the elder demon thing's cultists. He's not willing to attack a random teacher who may know some cool stuff just because.

Ideally, he'll be able to stop the elder demon and preserve his morality, by his reasoning. Morality isn't a mathematical sum, if he hurts or injures people and saves the world the hurt and injured people don't go away. If he had good reason to suspect that attacking Xvim would help him kill the primordial, sure, he'd probably do it, but as it is?
