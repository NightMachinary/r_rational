He's noted this issue with himself too.

  Kael seemed amused that Zorian cared more about his safety than his own, considering that Kael would be restored to normal once the loop restarted and Zorian might not be, but Zorian's moral sense had yet to adapt to the implications of the time loop and he was horribly bothered by the idea of leading Kael to his death in the tunnels and leaving his daughter all alone in the world... even if it was only for a week or so.

  but he had to admit he knew of no other way to deal with the third time traveler. The only other way involved destroying his soul, and that was arguably even more morally reprehensible. Plus he didn't actually know how to destroy someone's soul. And hopefully never would.

  And that was without even considering the moral dimension of the whole thing. Picking on innocent people for the sake of personal training was not the road he wanted to go on, and dismissing their plight as irrelevant due to the time loop striked him as an unhealthy attitude to have. He might have justified the whole thing to himself if it was just a matter of tapping into their senses, since that was mostly harmless, but the Luminous Advocates made it clear this wasn't the only skill he would have to practice on his fellow humans to get right.

He doesn't want to have a morality license. He's worried about going down bad roads and becoming an immoral person.

  In other words, he needed to develop his mind magic, ethics be damned. He didn't think he could do this on his own, so he would have to seek out other aranea webs for this.

He is however willing to do a great deal of immoral things for the right cause.

Capturing Xvim and interrogating him, while interesting, isn't an action of key importance. Xvim's knowledge doesn't seem to be anything that unique, just exceptionally well practised and skilled. Besides which, eventually Xvim will surely have to admit Zorian's skill eventually, Zorian can just keep improving his shaping skills forever.

Xvim is also a dangerous target to attack due to his skill. It could go very wrong. As he has no reason yet to suspect Xvim as Xvim hasn't yet done anything too radical why would he? We as readers can suspect him, but as far as Zorian knows he's just a very skilled and powerful mage that seriously annoys him. There are no shortage of strong mages around. If Xvim was some sort of super thing, if he'd mastered empathy as well as Zorian with pure shaping skills it's not like Zorian could contradict him. Xvim surely knows more about how shaping works than he does.
