I burst out laughing when Xvim said mental magic shaping exercises. Of fucking course. At any rate, I hope Zorian begins to learn how to do all his magic unstructured, it seems to be more versatile and mana efficient (although requiring years of practice).

I predict he's gonna leave Cyoria once he is able to idnetifiy the entire cult and plundered the Aranea nest (and perhaps investigated his classmates a bit more and become more socially adept). He'll probably start really exploring the continent now, maybe even finish up Silverlake's request.

Silverlake may even have that soul potion he needs for soul sight. I don't think Zorian will care too much about necromancy (except maybe to enhance his golem), but he'll probably get some good defensive spells to ward off a lich attack.

Furthermore, I still stand behind my prediction that he's gonna become a shifter, perhaps a wolf or something with muscles. I doubt he needs to ability to fly, as he can morph into other animals for that. But being a wolf shifter should give him a good boost to his physical abilities, something I think he sorely needs.
