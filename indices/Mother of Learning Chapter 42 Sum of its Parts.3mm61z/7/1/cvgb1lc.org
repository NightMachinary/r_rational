Yeah. And he's definitely not one of the villains. I think it took me way too long to be certain of that. He's clearly very significant though. I wonder HOW he managed to find out about the time loop.

Wait, I wonder...does the time loop really encompass everyone in the area? What if it's just Zach's, Zorian's and Redrobe's souls going back in time, and no one else's?

And then they interfere with the timeline, so that every time there's a reset the next loop ends up a little different. Also, we haven't heard anything about zach for months and months. Has he been captured? Is he dead? Is he being mind controlled? Is he redrobe? I vaguely remember that last one being disproven, but don't remember how.

And considering that so many people have said that time magic is impossible, I wonder if maybe they're not really time travelling. In the Yugioh Millenium world manga, it at first seems like yugi and his friends have travelled back in time to ancient egypt, when in fact they're all still in the Domino City museum, and they're inside a tabletop mmorpg that simulates ancient egypt, and and since it's a magical shadow game, the events in that game are somehow able to influence the past, overwriting it with the events of the game.

Maybe the Arranea's real bodies were killed, removing them from the simulation.

So, to recap, all of the expert magical researchers think that time travel is absolutely impossible. And only Zorian, Zach and maybe Redrobe or perhaps someone else retain their memories through each reset/loop. Zorian only became part of the time loop because of some sort of accidental soul connection with Zach.

Hmm, this still seems clunky. I suppose maybe everyone could be in the magical dream/simulation, and only a few people retain their memories, although then that leaves the question of why does anyone retain their memories, and why those people specifically?

Any other ways to fake time travel for 2 or 3 people that you guys can come up with?
