My theory is that the cultists were being used. Someone helped them summon a primordial, but let them take the brunt of the costs and then step in to hook the primordial to create the time loop. I'm gonna assume that the universe isn't very large (Ptolemaic model+heavenly spheres), so what the primordial is doing is reversing entropy over the span of existence. It can only rewind for upto a month, and will eventually run out of energy (that's why the loop is deteriorating).

The loopers in this case are exempt from this because their souls are the only thing that isn't being looped.
