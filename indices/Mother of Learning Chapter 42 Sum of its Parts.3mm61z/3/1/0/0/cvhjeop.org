I dunno, given that Xvim's mindstate is presumably very similar across time loops (and memories pre-timeloop are exactly the same), compromising his mental privacy doesn't 'stay' within the loop. Privacy of the post-loop Xvim is just as compromised (unless Z manages to purge his memories before the last loop ends / early on in post-loop).

So, I can imagine extreme circumstances where this could be warranted (Xvim refuses to cooperate, Z playing each loop as if it was the last one, Xvim's knowledge likely relevant to the event)... But just doing it because Xvim is mysterios I detest.
