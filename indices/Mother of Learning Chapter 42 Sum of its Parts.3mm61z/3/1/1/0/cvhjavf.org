I mean, mind rape is horrible even if it's painless and the victim never notices? Mental privacy is important. You can't treat someone who can know your inner workings as an equal, it completely changes the calculus of how likely is it that the other person is playing/exploiting you...

I don't really see why Zorian can't just come clean with Xvim in one loop, ask him for some kind of self-signal that he could give him in the next loop to prove it, and then gain his cooperation and presumably answers to any specific questions he might have. Having maintained consensual partnership will mean he doesn't have to hide his knowledge post-time loop, doesn't get desentivised by his actions within the time loop to a degree that it would impact his post-timeloop life, etc.

It's just fucking wrong and he's nowhere near the situation where he would have to do it.
