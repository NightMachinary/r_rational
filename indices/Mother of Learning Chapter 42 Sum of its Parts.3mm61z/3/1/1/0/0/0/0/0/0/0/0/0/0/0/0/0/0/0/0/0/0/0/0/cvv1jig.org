  Squeamishness and moral high ground have the advantages of producing better sanity, lower risks, easier allegiance with sane people and a lower risk of later being unnecessarily immoral. Morality isn't just a silly barrier to progress.
#+end_quote

Morality is not /just/ a silly barrier to progress, but it is a barrier non the less. And often it is a silly barrier (see stem cell research debate, or Jehovah's witnesses' views on blood transfusions). I don't advocate abandoning morality. I advocate examining morality for silliness, attempting to make morality more consistent, using it in cost-benefit calculations, and following it to its logical conclusions.

All the benefits you described are just a part of cost-benefit analysis anyway.

  And now we go from solving sort of imminent problems to solving socioeconomic problems with immorality.
#+end_quote

I would rather solve them with /immortality/, of course.

Jokes aside, this is my most vehement disagreement with you, right here. For some reason, you don't consider many extremely large, catastrophic, *fixable* problems worthy of attention. Diseases, old age, mortality, world hunger, etc. It seems for me that loopers are in a uniquely good position to try solving all this, after they sort out their disagreements one way or another.

  How would you feel after doing that if you later found out that each world was real, and as Zach supposed you were hopping between alternate realities?
#+end_quote

- If plague cure experiments fail catastrophically: everyone is dead.
- If no experiments happen: primordial kills everyone after a month, anyway.

So, I would feel saddened and distraught, but not greatly. Amount of destruction caused by primordial would bother me much more, and therefore primordial eradication would greatly raise in priority.

  Or if mistakes meant you Zorian were permanently infected, and accidentally managed to take an enhanced strain outside the time loop due to soul shenanigans? This is an incredibly high risk strategy.
#+end_quote

Risk of getting infected by soul-borne plague from plague curing experiments exists, yes. But it is about as probable as simply catching soul-borne plague while adventuring. If the risk is about the same either way, it shouldn't influence the decision.

Other than that, I mostly agree with your conclusions.
