  One of them being that it becomes incumbent on Zorian to figure out what list of instructions and knowledge he can give to select people in order to maximise good in the many universes while still leaving him time to practice stuff.

Yeah, with some more mind reading soon he can probably reliably stop the invasion and the primordial summoning. That's a pretty important one.

  Ah, I was operating under the unspoken assumption that these were non-sharing type mages where the most powerful spells were jealously guarded and passed down only in family lines, word of mouth and coded spellbooks ect ect.

There's limits to that, with more complex secrets. As Zorian noted, holding a spell formula in your head is tricky even with their memorization techniques. People will certainly have security measures, but those can be evaded.

Coded spell books are slow to read as well.

Also, a lot of secrets aren't important to people. Teleport, common spell, almost certainly in libraries. Still pretty useful for Zorian.
