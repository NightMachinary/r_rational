  Apparently, Nazis disagreed. They considered Jews, Gypsies, gays, etc subhumans whose genes poison and degrade the genetic pool of Aryan people. Therefore, they thought, genociding them all is a great good as it purifies the genetic pool and preserves Aryan race. From Nazi point of view, it was exactly the same harm avoidance as with blood transfusions.

As I noted below, the Nazis were not strong believers in morality. As with many fascists, they tended to have a awkward mishmash of 'what works' ideas favoring state control and glorification of nationalism and war and believed that the strong survived, and weren't strong believers in morality. They didn't necessarily think genociding jews and gyspies and such was a great good, they thought it would keep aryans strong and prevent the jews from backstabbing them, and that they would therefore win wars, unlike ww1 where the jews supposedly lost the war for them. Good and evil was a moot question, right and wrong irrelevant. Strength was what mattered.

  As I told before, my "suggestions" are illustrative edge cases that highlight difference of algorithms, not actual suggestions. I don't try to sway anybody to genocide. I'm trying to explain that Zorian's decision making algorithm is imperfect, and propose better alternative.

Unless those edge cases are true in story then his decision making algorithm isn't especially imperfect. It's not clear that infecting people with the plague would be a good idea. It's not clear how more aggressive methods would let him defeat red robe. It's not clear how mass murder would let him defeat the primordial faster.

Unless you can note a problem that he could safely and easily solve in story with immoral actions that's low risk and not more harmful than the problem, it's not an idiot ball.

Like how in Harry Potter strangling all Slytherins at birth would solve many issues.

  However, the dangers of plague cure research are also unknown. What I described is worst-case scenario. If we compare same-case scenarios (worst, best, most probable) for plague research failure and primordial summoning, the magnitude of disaster is about equal.
#+end_quote

More research is needed to check the magnitude. He really should research which primordial it is at the church and later can research the weeping plague to find it's nature.

  Agree wholeheartedly. Keeping cost-benefit calculations for the options, with pluses and minuses explicitly mentioned, also helps a little.
#+end_quote

I agree, and when you're not sure of the pluses and minuses that should be mentioned too. In a lot of these calculations there are a range of probabilities.

Yay for much agreement.
