The discussion you two had was more interesting and well-mannered than I expected. That's nice.

Nepene is saying here that despite teleport being a "secret" from students, it's still widely available in books, and useful. Just because he's reading someone's mind and finding out their "secrets" doesn't necessarily mean it's useful. And that there's sometimes more useful information already lying around in books which are easier and safer for Zorian to access. Also, I can't remember if teleportation is a secret from students or just assumed to be "too difficult for a student to learn." I think it might just be the latter, looking over chapter 23.

It does seem a bit off-topic from the whole "is in-depth mind reading of an innocent ever morally acceptable."(Making certain allowances in order to categorize Xvim as an innocent.)
