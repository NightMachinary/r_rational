  As Red Robe, I assume that my enemy is smart. Therefore, they will strengthen the thing they had that was able to harm me when everything else could not.

The gun hurt him. The mind magic didn't, and was a mild annoyance.

And, he can strengthen his mind magic in many ways.

I suggest you re-read the segment where Zorian kills himself again. He explicitly notes that it isn't enough killing yourself when facing a soul mage, you have to get rid of your body too, make it unreachable. Dying is a serious issue for someone who associates with necromancers and is in a time loop. Death is not the end.

  If my mind shield is broken around a mind mage then I've already lost and that someone can kill/break/enslave?/reformat?/wipe me anyway. All I'd be doing is ensuring that my loss was not crippling.

If his mind shield is broken he'll still have his mental resilience, and some tricks that he can activate while mind controlled.

If he dies, he likely assumes that his enemy will use his corpse and soul for bad things in many situations.
