Fair enough. You have convinced me that hurt itself does have moral weight in and of itself even in a time loop. I regard it as having significantly less weight than it normally would have, because the person doesn't have to live with it, but it is still there.

That said my inner munchkin demands I find a way to get around it. What if the mage in question were rendered unconscious instantly an hour before the loop would end, and the mind reading proceeded while they were in this unconscious state. Further, suppose that all nabbed memories not directly related to magic or that were otherwise private were then deleted.

What would you think of that? If you still think it's wrong do try to put a value on how wrong.
