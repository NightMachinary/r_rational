  Notice that decision making algorithm I proposed avoids this pitfall. It keeps track of the entire cost-benefit calculation, and when an option with less costs gets known, it is immediately apparent that it is superior to other, more drastic ones.

You don't have actual statistics or maths for your algorithm so it's innately not going to be of much use.

  I would say that an entire world being erased form existence and reverted to the state it had a month ago is a pressing issue.

And him delaying doesn't make it much worse. It's an eventual issue he has to handle but not pressing. He has time to delay and improve, as he is doing. A pressing issue is one that gets worse if you don't do something.

  IMHO, it warrants a lot more drastic measures that Zorian implements now.

#+begin_example
  To the best of your ability, generate a list of available drastic options.
  To the best of your ability, predict that drastic options will work best.
  Apply sanity checks (the more drastic the better)
  Choose the option that leads to the best drastic conclusion.
#+end_example

This is why the algorithm is useless. You're assuming drastic measures will solve your problems. Radical solutions are high risk. Many are a bad idea. Your problem solving shouldn't start by assuming there has to be a drastic solution.

He should be minimizing risk as much as is reasonable. The longer he survives the better off he is. Gambling means he may lose. At the moment he's privately seeking out new power.
