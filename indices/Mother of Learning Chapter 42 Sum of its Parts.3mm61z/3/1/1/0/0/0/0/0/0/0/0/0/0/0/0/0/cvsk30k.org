  You are talking about politics. The ways to sell your decisions to other people when it's made. I try to discuss the process of making decisions in the first place. Let's not mix them and limit our discussion to decision making for now.

You can sell a crisis to yourself as justifying any action just as easily.

In this case, the example was mind reading Xvim on the vague supposition that he might be a time traveller. People aren't generally proposing scenarios with a clear cause and effect relationship on actually solving the crisis.

  This is again more about politics. Democracy, checks, balances, etc. It is nice but beside the point. The point is: how to make decisions that steer the future in the direction you like? How to think, personally, inside your own head?

Logistics tends to win wars. Have more people on your side than the enemy and better organization and placement of troops. Ideally, you solve problems by being prepared. Extreme solutions are often necessary after a lack of planning.

  I do not advocate for adopting "evil" methods of problem solving here. I am advocating for doing cost-benefit calculations, searching for the best option, and choosing options based on the sum of their consequences.

I have no objection to that, and I doubt Zorian does.

  If the options with the best predicted outcome requires you to, say, nuke a city, you do it.

The japanese were killing 400k a month in occupied territories. Zorian doesn't have a similar pressing issue, or a similar simple solution.

In the extremely rare cases where an extreme option is the best option, sure, go for it, but that's not really a useful ethical system for most situations.
