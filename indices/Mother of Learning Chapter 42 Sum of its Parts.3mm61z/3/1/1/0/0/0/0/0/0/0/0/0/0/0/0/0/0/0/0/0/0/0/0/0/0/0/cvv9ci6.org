  This is a very romanticised view of morality. The actual process that shapes morals is more akin to emergence of fashion than to organized effort to set up reasonable rules that you describe. Morality, therefore, can and does contain arbitrary bits and inconsistencies.
#+end_quote

People who absorb random cultural floatsam do, yes, pick up silly moralities. People who set moral barriers though tend to do so due to experience or reading on the matter. Zorian has set up a personal barrier against murdering innocents. And as I noted, moral barriers tend to guard against bad action.

  Also, some Jehovah's witnesses do in fact think that refusing blood transfusions is more important than avoiding lots of deaths. I think these example are comparable.
#+end_quote

Blood transfusion improves health. Genocide worsens it. Not comparable. Moralities tend to focus on harm avoidance.

  Slavery, wars, conquests and genocides were all performed by people whose morals allowed, endorsed or even demanded all that.

  The Ten Commandments have lost their validity...Conscience is a Jewish invention. It is a blemish like circumcision...

  “The earth continues to go round, whether it's the man who kills the tiger or the tiger who eats the man. The stronger asserts his will, it's the law of nature. The world doesn't change; its laws are eternal.”
#+end_quote

Incorrect. Many, like Hitler above, weren't strong believers in morality and focused their beliefs around strength or some variant. Right or wrong, we are strong and will conquer all.

Or like Mao.

  "I do not agree with the view that to be moral, the motive of one's action has to be benefiting others. Morality does not have to be defined in relation to others... People like me want to ... satisfy our hearts to the full, and in doing so we automatically have the most valuable moral codes. Of course there are people and objects in the world, but they are all there only for me."
#+end_quote

They don't care about harm to others, only personal benefit.

#+begin_quote
  That's why I think morality shouldn't be blindly trusted. Instead it should be examined and maybe corrected, if flaws are found.
#+end_quote

And in examining this morality, I'm not seeing many flaws in the don't genocide multiple worlds to cure a plague plan.

As I've noted multiple times, these moralities seem fitting and excellent.

  Mass murder is a bad thing and carries large utility penalty. However, if after cost-benefit calculation the option involving mass murder seems the best one, this option should be implemented, even though mass murder is bad. A little article on the topic
#+end_quote

I've read the article. Your suggestions lack cost benefit analysis, and are dismissive of the massive suffering caused, so they aren't that swaying.

  Sure, primordial could be harmless or benevolent, but considering historical records it doesn't seem likely. You could probably make a case that all this evidence is not solid enough to justify the extreme plans I mentioned. But claiming there is no evidence is flat out wrong.
#+end_quote

They chose a landbound primordial, and are hoping just Eldemar will be destroyed. We don't know it's speed, destructiveness, precise intent, vulnerability to assault, lots of stuff. It could easily just kill 5-10% of the world's populace. We have evidence that it's hostile, but not that it's release is an extinction event. A plague that kills everyone is an extinction event.

#+begin_quote
  Once more: mass murder is not the desired outcome. The desired outcome is the world that fits my values more. If the way to reach this world is mass murder, then this is the path that should be taken. If there is way to this world not involving mass murder, this path should be taken instead.
#+end_quote

Humans have a tendency to remain fixated on an initial choice, even when better options come along and mass murder is a crime of immense suffering and cruelty that should be avoided. As such, mass murder should not be plan a and before making plans to do it multiple alternate plans should be made.

Prevention is better than cure with disease. Any cure would have to be propagated across society which is tricky. As such, if Zorian has the time to deal with the plague, he should be invading government stores of information and high ranking official's minds to see what they know. Ideally he'd find the cause and be able to shut that down- a precursor artifact, monster race, secret agents from the liches, whatever. If not, he can gather information about the plague and try to work out how it infects people. It's obviously some weird magical thing so it has some unusual mechanism, see if with enough information you can figure that out. If it appears unlikely to spread he could research a source of it, with the backing of several powerful mages who could nuke the area if anything went wrong. Carefully examine it, and relocate a sample to a remote island, minimizing physical contact using teleportation and mind controlled non time traveling agents. Test it on suitable test subjects, perhaps captured cultists. If anything goes wrong abort hard and do more research.

  "Searching for plague cure, even if there will be 10 containment breaches that cause global pandemics and humanity extinction in the loop, may still be worth it, because number of lives saved by the cure is very large "
#+end_quote

If there's any reasonable risk of global genocide don't do it. If you kill 10 world's worth of people to save 1 world's worth then that's bad helping.

In a hypothetical situation where killing 1 million will save 2 million, sure, you can do that, but you seem very fixated on solutions which involve killing lots when there are much easier solutions.

And killing 1 million is sad. First you should do research to see if there's a way to save them without killing 1 million.

  And, there is no evidence of existence of soul-afflicting plague. Now you are venturing into "no evidence" realm.
#+end_quote

We know there was something unusual about the plague and that it was resistant to priestly healing magic. We don't know what was unusual, and there's a certain probability that it infects some element other than the body, like the mind or the soul, something that carries on past the loop. Even if there's a 1/10 chance it does that, that's a high risk.
