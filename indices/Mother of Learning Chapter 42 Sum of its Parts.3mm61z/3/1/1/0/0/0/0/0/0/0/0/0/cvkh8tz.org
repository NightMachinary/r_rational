It's like- if you stab someone with a knife and then wipe their memories and heal them.

Even if you do that, you still stabbed them with a knife and wiped their memories. That harm still happened. If you, like many people, don't like people being stabbed and harmed you will prefer other options. Memories being altered or time magic doesn't change what happened.

If you believe it's ok or good for them to be stabbed, sure, you can do it, but it's not a favored option otherwise.
