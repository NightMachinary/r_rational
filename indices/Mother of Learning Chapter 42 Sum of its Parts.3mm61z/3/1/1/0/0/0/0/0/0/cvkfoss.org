  Morality isn't a mathematical sum

It is to me. Try expanding it outwards to multiple cases: a general policy of mind reading powerful wizards vs a general policy of not doing that. One strategy clearly has a much higher chance of learning the things necessary to stop said primordial. Obviously you don't want to attack wizards that are /too/ powerful in case they hit you back in a way that actually does lasting harm.

Would your more absolutist morality be mollified if he did the mind reading, then used mind magic on himself to delete any personal or private information gained thereof? That way the people who were hurt or injured people very much /do/ go away.
