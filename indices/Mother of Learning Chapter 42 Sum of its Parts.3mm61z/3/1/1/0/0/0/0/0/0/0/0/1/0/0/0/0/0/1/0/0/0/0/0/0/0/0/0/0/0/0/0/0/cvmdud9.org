No, remember Zorian had Kyron use torture spells on him to build up his mental resistance? And they've often mentioned how shaping skills gives general resistance due to ordered thoughts. In the most recent chapter Zorian no sold a knockout spell due to his training.

You have mind shield.

And you have mind shaping defences. Three layers of defences.
