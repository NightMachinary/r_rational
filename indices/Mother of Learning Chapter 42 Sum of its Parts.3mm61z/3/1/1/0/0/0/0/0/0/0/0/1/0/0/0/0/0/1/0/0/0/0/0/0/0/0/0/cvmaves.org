As Red Robe, I assume that my enemy is smart. Therefore, they will strengthen the thing they had that was able to harm me when everything else could not. Set the trigger to be 2 seconds after my mind shield being broken by mind magic: enough time to re-cast the spell if I'm able. If my mind shield is broken around a mind mage then I've already lost and that someone can kill/break/enslave?/reformat?/wipe me anyway. All I'd be doing is ensuring that my loss was not crippling.

This would possibly be a stopgap measure until I can go learn from whoever to become formidable at mind magic. I'd not show my face again until I was sure I had a far stronger defence. Which is possibly why he hasn't shown up for a while: he might have gone off to try and learn mind magic, then the teacher was so disgusted at the contents of his skull that he decided to make some... changes. Maybe a clean wipe and a compulsion to go find said teacher at the start of said loop and give her a memory packet.
