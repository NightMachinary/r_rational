  Try expanding it outwards to multiple cases: a general policy of mind reading powerful wizards vs a general policy of not doing that.

Seems risky. They might mind read him back. Powerful wizards are dangerous. I'd say that has a lower chance of success. Mages also may keep their best secrets and powers secret to use in super dangerous situations so it's hard to judge how dangerous they are. He also doesn't know for sure who is a cultist or not. If he attacks the wrong person he or she may alert red robes, who could then permamently kill his family.

Besides which, any harm he's done is still done. My point was more that any harm you have done remains harm, even if it's on net a greater good. 5 -ve morality and 100 +ve morality is still 5 -ve morality and 100 +ve morality.

  Would your more absolutist morality be mollified if he did the mind reading, then used mind magic on himself to delete any personal or private information gained thereof?

Please don't make up moralities for me. I'm not a moral absolutist.

That would make it slightly less harmful.
