  You can sell a crisis to yourself as justifying any action just as easily.

Notice that decision making algorithm I proposed avoids this pitfall. It keeps track of the entire cost-benefit calculation, and when an option with less costs gets known, it is immediately apparent that it is superior to other, more drastic ones.

  Logistics tends to win wars. Have more people on your side than the enemy and better organization and placement of troops. Ideally, you solve problems by being prepared. Extreme solutions are often necessary after a lack of planning.

I agree but I don't see how this relates to personal decision making algorithms.

  Zorian doesn't have a similar pressing issue, or a similar simple solution.

I would say that an entire world being erased form existence and reverted to the state it had a month ago is a pressing issue.

Failing that, I would say that "resurrection" of a primordial is a pressing issue.

Failing even that, I would say that perspective of being soulkilled by the Red Robe is a pressing issue.

However you look at it, Zorian's situation doesn't look good.

IMHO, it warrants a lot more drastic measures that Zorian implements now.

Also, let's not forget the plague that killed like half the humanity some years ago. It happened once, it could happen again. Time loop would be the perfect opportunity to develop the panacea safely and responsibly (after neutralizing other loopers, of course)
