  Morality is not just a silly barrier to progress, but it is a barrier non the less. And often it is a silly barrier (see stem cell research debate, or Jehovah's witnesses' views on blood transfusions). I don't advocate abandoning morality. I advocate examining morality for silliness, attempting to make morality more consistent, using it in cost-benefit calculations, and following it to its logical conclusions.
#+end_quote

People as a general matter set moral barriers because of predictable experience that while it's easy to rationalize doing something doing it actually commonly leads to negative results. Avoiding mass murder is not a comparable example to refusing blood transfusions or banning stem cells, as causing massive harm is against most moralities.

  For some reason, you don't consider many extremely large, catastrophic, fixable problems worthy of attention.

I do, and he is working on fixing them. He provided an alchemist with unlimited money, and he already invented a fever cure potion I believe.

  It seems for me that loopers are in a uniquely good position to try solving all this, after they sort out their disagreements one way or another.
#+end_quote

Possibly, depending on the loop length. They can try to solve it without mass murder.

  If plague cure experiments fail catastrophically: everyone is dead. If no experiments happen: primordial kills everyone after a month, anyway.
#+end_quote

You're assuming, with no evidence, that the primordial kills everyone?

It doesn't sound like you're using your algorithm in any rigorous manner. You're making an assumption to justify your desired outcome without considering obvious other possibilities, and aren't greatly saddened by the mass deaths of everyone.

This is part of why people have moralities like don't mass murder everyone. I've seen no real evidence here you're making any effort to minimize harm or seek out less destructive methods.

  Risk of getting infected by soul-borne plague from plague curing experiments exists, yes. But it is about as probable as simply catching soul-borne plague while adventuring. If the risk is about the same either way, it shouldn't influence the decision.
#+end_quote

Infecting everyone with a disease obviously increases the chance you get infected.
