Full agreement here.

  Blood transfusion improves health. Genocide worsens it. Not comparable. Moralities tend to focus on harm avoidance.
#+end_quote

Apparently, Nazis disagreed. They considered Jews, Gypsies, gays, etc subhumans whose genes poison and degrade the genetic pool of Aryan people. Therefore, they thought, genociding them all is a great good as it purifies the genetic pool and preserves Aryan race. From Nazi point of view, it was exactly the same harm avoidance as with blood transfusions.

Comparable.

  I've read the article. Your suggestions lack cost benefit analysis, and are dismissive of the massive suffering caused, so they aren't that swaying.
#+end_quote

As I told before, my "suggestions" are illustrative edge cases that highlight difference of algorithms, not actual suggestions. I don't try to sway anybody to genocide. I'm trying to explain that Zorian's decision making algorithm is imperfect, and propose better alternative.

  They chose a landbound primordial, and are hoping just Eldemar will be destroyed. We don't know it's speed, destructiveness, precise intent, vulnerability to assault, lots of stuff. It could easily just kill 5-10% of the world's populace. We have evidence that it's hostile, but not that it's release is an extinction event. A plague that kills everyone is an extinction event.
#+end_quote

I Agree about primordial.

However, the dangers of plague cure research are also unknown. What I described is worst-case scenario. If we compare same-case scenarios (worst, best, most probable) for plague research failure and primordial summoning, the magnitude of disaster is about equal.

  Humans have a tendency to remain fixated on an initial choice, even when better options come along and mass murder is a crime of immense suffering and cruelty that should be avoided. As such, mass murder should not be plan a and before making plans to do it multiple alternate plans should be made.
#+end_quote

Agree wholeheartedly. Keeping cost-benefit calculations for the options, with pluses and minuses explicitly mentioned, also helps a little.

#+begin_quote
  Prevention is better than cure with disease. Any cure would have to be propagated across society which is tricky. As such, if Zorian has the time to deal with the plague, he should be invading government stores of information and high ranking official's minds to see what they know. Ideally he'd find the cause and be able to shut that down- a precursor artifact, monster race, secret agents from the liches, whatever. If not, he can gather information about the plague and try to work out how it infects people. It's obviously some weird magical thing so it has some unusual mechanism, see if with enough information you can figure that out. If it appears unlikely to spread he could research a source of it, with the backing of several powerful mages who could nuke the area if anything went wrong. Carefully examine it, and relocate a sample to a remote island, minimizing physical contact using teleportation and mind controlled non time traveling agents. Test it on suitable test subjects, perhaps captured cultists. If anything goes wrong abort hard and do more research.
#+end_quote

Again, agree 100%.

#+begin_quote
  If there's any reasonable risk of global genocide don't do it. If you kill 10 world's worth of people to save 1 world's worth then that's bad helping. In a hypothetical situation where killing 1 million will save 2 million, sure, you can do that, but you seem very fixated on solutions which involve killing lots when there are much easier solutions. And killing 1 million is sad. First you should do research to see if there's a way to save them without killing 1 million.
#+end_quote

No objections here.

I see fixated on solutions which involve killing lots because they are illustrative. For solutions that don't involve killing lots, both decision making algorithms would give the same answer. Differences are better highlighted by edge cases, such as options with significant costs and benefits.

#+begin_quote
  We know there was something unusual about the plague and that it was resistant to priestly healing magic. We don't know what was unusual, and there's a certain probability that it infects some element other than the body, like the mind or the soul, something that carries on past the loop. Even if there's a 1/10 chance it does that, that's a high risk.
#+end_quote

Also agree.
