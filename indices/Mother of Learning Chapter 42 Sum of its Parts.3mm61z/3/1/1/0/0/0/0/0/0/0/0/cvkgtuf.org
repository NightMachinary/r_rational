  My point was more that any harm you have done remains harm, even if it's on net a greater good

Well the whole thing about time loops is that the harm doesn't remain done.

#+begin_quote
  That would make it slightly less harmful.

So... Where is the rest of the harm? So far as I can tell you consider things to still have normal moral weight even if they end up having never happened to the people the crimes were supposedly perpetrated against, the perpetrator has no memory of any personal information, and in general there is nothing to suggest that it ever happened at all. And you put the majority of the weight on these things that never properly happened? You'll have to forgive me, but that seems quite silly.

In what way is the world made worse by these actions?
