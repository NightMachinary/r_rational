  This is the standard way dictators get into power. They claim it's a crisis, invoke emergency powers, and then do whatever they want. Those powers start to become normalized and are used to solve socioeconomic problems often, which leads to a lot of atrocities.

You are talking about politics. The ways to sell your decisions to other people when it's made. I try to discuss the process of making decisions in the first place. Let's not mix them and limit our discussion to decision making for now.

  So there's a third option. You take a measured and intelligent approach to minimize the harm. You gather likeminded people, build up your powers with a mixture of ethical and slightly unethical activities, and you only do especially immoral things if you have a very strong reason to do them.

This is again more about politics. Democracy, checks, balances, etc. It is nice but beside the point. The point is: how to make decisions that steer the future in the direction you like? How to think, personally, inside your own head?

  Lots of people have managed to deal with wars and plagues without being evil. They're not some special problem that you should routinely handle with atrocities. You need a really absurd and contrived scenario for routine evil to be the only option.

I agree that people deal with wars and plagues all the time. But do they deal with them optimally? Or is there an "evil" way that lead to the world with significantly more survivors?

I do not advocate for adopting "evil" methods of problem solving here. I am advocating for doing cost-benefit calculations, searching for the best option, and choosing options based on the sum of their consequences.

- To the best of your ability, generate a list of available options.
- To the best of your ability, predict the outcome of implementing options.
- Apply sanity checks (you'd better have good, experimentally proven sanity checks, else this step will ruin your decision making)
- Choose the option that leads to the best consequences.
- Implement the option so chosen.

If the options with the best predicted outcome requires you to, say, nuke a city, you do it.

While initiating the launch sequence you keep seeking for the better option, the one that gets the benefits with less costs.

But if you don't find the better option and time to make a desision is now - you implement the best option available, regardless of how atrocious it is.
