I'm assuming that the universe has become closed off from the afterlife/higher planes due to the looping. Because of that, his soul can't move on and just sits there, in metaphysical space, until he can merge with his body again. The marker likely has something do with it, or there's a subroutine running in the looping software that deals with the handling of looper souls.
