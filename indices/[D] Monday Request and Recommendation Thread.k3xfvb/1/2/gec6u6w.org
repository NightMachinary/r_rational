If you're fine with visual novels, I'd recommend checking out [[https://store.steampowered.com/app/648100/Raging_Loop/][Raging Loop]]. I posted it in the weekly thread a couple months back after having a really good time with it. The protagonist starts out a bit wacky in an Ignatius Reilly type way, but when push comes to shove, he becomes very analytical. It makes for an interesting dynamic.

I will say that while it bills itself as a horror story, I personally didn't find it all that scary, but I tend to not find horror media scary in general so YMMV. It's also a bit expensive for a game with no gameplay, but I'm pretty sure the first quarter is up for free on YouTube.
