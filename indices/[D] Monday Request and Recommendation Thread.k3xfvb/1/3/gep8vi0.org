For movies, Oculus is really good. The movie starts with a character explaining the full set of powers of the antagonist, and exactly what precautions have been set up to counter each one. The only reason that the protagonists don't win in the first 15 minutes is because they have an additional goal of proving to the world that the antagonist exists.
