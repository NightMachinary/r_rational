I've asked this same question before and here are what people have said:

The Final Girls (2015 horror comedy film) The main character's mother has just died and in an effort to remember her, she goes to watch a classic horror slasher film that is a thin parody of Friday the 13th where her mother was the final girl. After a strange accident, she and her friends find themselves stuck in the movie. A funny deconstruction and logical chain of events follows as they try to survive the movie.

Eden Green by Fiona van Dahl - a rational horror novel where a character finds her friend has been infected by a strange parasite that that has made him immortal. Eden, the main character, is a self-styled rationalist, and her thought processes are shown in pain-staking detail. Whereas her friends treat everything as a big adventure or a true chance for ending death, Eden does her best (as an amateur) to apply scientific rationale to the symbiote and the strange monsters that are starting to show up. There is some body horror but most of the truly scary stuff is how it goes into exhaustive detail on how people's thought processes and consciousness change.

The promised neverland - a manga and later anime that is very rational and logical with intricate strategies and mental battles. The first season/story arc anyway as the rest of the story never comes close to the first arc in my opinion. The story takes place in an orphanage of love where the children are raised and tested constantly to improve their intelligence. All goes well until a small group discover a horrifying truth about their world that I won't spoil as they tell it to you at the end of the first episode and chapter. But now with the horrible truth revealed, the children must figure out a way to escape the orphanage.

Hell NO: The Sensible Horror Film - a short on youtube that opens with a group of teenagers arriving to spend the weekend at a creepy cabin in the woods. They promptly leave and drive to get wasted at the beach instead. The rest of the shorts of the film follow a similar theme. Short but funny.

The Thing (original not the remake)- the characters ARE intelligent and rational but it just doesn't matter much. The paranoia and lack of trust are what ultimately dooms them.

10 Cloverfield Lane - The main character is incredibly resourceful and intelligent in a very nasty situation.

You're Next - The Anti Slasher movie in that the last girl is arguably more dangerous than the slashers. She has trained for survival, hand to hand combat, and traps by her survivalist father. Something that she is initially mocked for and it also shows how normal people WOULD panic and make stupid decisions. In this movie, a slasher wearing a mask has trouble breathing through it and it throws off his peripheral vision.

Wait until Dark - It started as a play and there have been a few remakes, but I only saw the 60's movie with audrey hepburn. A drug dealer hid some heroin in a doll which came into possession of a blind woman. They kill her roommate and decide to trick the main character, who hasn't been blind for very long, into getting into the house and finding the doll. The main character is intelligent and finds some believable ways to suspect the conmen aren't real and figures out a way to turn the tables.

High Tension 2003 film- The main character is crafty and very smart to stay ahead of the killer. Up until the ending. Just ignore the last few minutes and twist ending.

Green Room - they make rational decisions but things are so against them that it really doesn't matter much.

Splinter - The character make smart choices and its really the only reason they survive.

Tremors - Not sure if it counts as horror to modern audiences but they carefully figure out how the monsters work and think of counter measures. Then the monsters get smarter and they need to one up them.

Train to Busan - Maybe. They are panicked and still have no idea how things work but they make believable decisions. Might be a culture thing, but in America the main "villain" probably would have been killed or thrown out for the potential trouble he would be in the future.
