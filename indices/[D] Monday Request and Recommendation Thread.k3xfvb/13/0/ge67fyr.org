[[https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B07J675X2C/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_d_asin_title_o09?ie=UTF8&psc=1][Into the Labyrinth]] might fit what you're looking for. I read it awhile back and enjoyed it. It was a bit short, but it's part of the Mage Errant series, which has several books that total over 1300 pages.

I have some other suggestions, but they're LitRPG's and I'm not sure that's what you're looking for.
