Anyone got a progression/fantasy of a crafter type stuff?

As for what I read this week wasn't exactly rational but [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/36950/borne-of-caution][Borne of Caution]] was a rather refreshing read? I did get a bit frustrated with the MC's thought process in some of the later chapters but it was a rather nice read.
