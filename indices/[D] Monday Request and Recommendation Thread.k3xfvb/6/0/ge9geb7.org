If you have a fandom in mind, tv tropes has reclists of varying usefulness - "has a solid tropes page" usually indicates a longish and well executed fic though.

Sorting complete fics by kudos on Archive of our Own (IMO the best fanfiction site) is also very useful - I usually really like about a quarter to a third of the high-ranked stuff and that's due to taste rather than quality. Filtering by date can mitigate the first-mover advantage and help uncover more recent gems.
