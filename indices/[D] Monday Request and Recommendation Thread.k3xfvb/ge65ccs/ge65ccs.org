I've been reading [[https://katalepsis.net/][Katalepsis]], which is kind of Gothic horror mixed with Lovecraftian horror. Or, as the author describes it, "urban fantasy story / lesbian supernatural soap opera, with a little bit of a horror coating."

The premise is a young woman's sister goes missing while they're kids. Afterwards, no one can remember her, so people think she's crazy. Also she can suddenly see demons/Eldritch horrors all around her, which doesn't help. The story starts when (as you might guess) she figures out she's not crazy, hooks up with some quasi-demon hunters, and tries to get her sister back.

I enjoyed the development of both story and characters. They're both well fleshed out and draw you in. The characters are well described, with their own personalities, strengths, faults, goals, and fears.

The story largely takes place on Earth, in a small university town called Sharrowford. It's well described and built up as a small sleepy town where nothing much happens, until you get to the cults and whatnot. It's actually not described that much, rather the places the MC visits are. You get a feel for the relevant parts, but most of Sharrowford exists on the periphery of the story. Aside form the MC, her friends, enemies and allies, I don't think we ever meet another named character.

The writing is quite well done. It's got a good flow and not too flowery or overly verbose (unless it's describing a demon or cosmic horror). I don't remember any obvious problems, or even minor grammatical errors.
