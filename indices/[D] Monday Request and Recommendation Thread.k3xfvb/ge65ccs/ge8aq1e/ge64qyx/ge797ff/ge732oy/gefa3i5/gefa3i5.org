Soft dissent - I read like the first 30+ chapters of this and got overwhelmed by Gary Stu vibes. Which kinda make sense in the setting for reasons I don't want to spoiler, but it bothered me I guess because from the intro themes I expected the MC to struggle more.

There were some very nice bits though so I might come back to this someday and see if there's an alternate reading.
