Ar'Kendrythist is a bit like that, although there's an element of individualistic power fantasy as well. Later on in the story Eric really works on his relations with other countries and figures of power, because even though he's an archmage he can still be killed instantly if caught unprepared. To alleviate this he not only develops his local community (sometimes to its detriment) but also exchanges favors and services with other countries/archmages/gods. It gets to the point that I'd say Eric's connections with powerful people is as impressive as his repertoire of magic.
