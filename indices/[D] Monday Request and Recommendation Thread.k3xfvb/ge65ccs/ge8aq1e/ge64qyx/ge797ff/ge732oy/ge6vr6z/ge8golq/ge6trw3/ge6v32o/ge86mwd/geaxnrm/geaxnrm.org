/How to Defeat a Demon King in Ten Easy Steps/ pokes gentle fun at and subverts high fantasy cliches, similar to the way [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bored_of_the_Rings][Bored of the Rings]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Lord_of_Derkholm][Dark Lord of Derkholm]] did it earlier.

For what it's worth, this contribution to the sub-genre didn't work for me, but then neither did its author's popular progression fantasy /Sufficiently Advanced Magic/, so I may not be the best person to ask. I think it's primarily the characterization that I have a problem with -- his characters always feel off in various ways.
