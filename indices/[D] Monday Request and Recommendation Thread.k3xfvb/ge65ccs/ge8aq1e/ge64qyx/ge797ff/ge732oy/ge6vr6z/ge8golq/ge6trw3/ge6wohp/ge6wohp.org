Delve has it's issues (which are frequently discussed in the delve posts, although I think it is much more enjoyable read in large chunks, rather than reading it every week), but it also has some bright spots, as you point out.

But the main thing I have taken away from it in recent weeks is I really miss the feeling I got back in the day playing WoW and other MMORPGs when I got into a good dungeon group where everyone was doing a great job at their role. I have zero interest in dedicating the time it takes to play those games anymore, but man did I enjoy playing healer in a competent group back then.
