[[http://www.gregegan.net/OCEANIC/Complete/Oceanic.html][/Oceanic/, by Greg Egan]] is... hard to describe (like most of his work), but it's the first thing I thought of and highly recommended.

For non-fiction, [[https://acoup.blog/category/collections/practical-polytheism/][*Practical Polytheism]] is an engaging and very readable short blog series about religion in the ancient world - not much like the stereotypes!

And while only dubiously rational (it's a nice fantasy setting...), David Eddings' /Elenium/ trilogy features Church knights as protagonists, with considerable religious intrigue. I remember that abuse of the proceedure for determining the voting threshold for motions in church meetings was a plot point... More fun than that makes it sound.
