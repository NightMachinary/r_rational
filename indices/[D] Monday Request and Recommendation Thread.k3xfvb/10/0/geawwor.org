[[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-sins-of-cinnamon.7774/reader]] Unfinished quest, by author "Question Dragon". On permanent hiatus until the worldbuilding same universe quest "days of Thyme" , which is also on permanent hiatus.

The author also has started a warhammer 40k/dungeon keeper series, pretty short but active. [[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/blood-thirsty-dungeon-keeper-in-space.12569/page-2#post-3629685]]

Of these three, only "days of Thyme" has no smut. Prose is very good.

EDIT: I got that from [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/ary2zx/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/egrjn87/][this link from last year]], of which I've also enjoyed Conduit.
