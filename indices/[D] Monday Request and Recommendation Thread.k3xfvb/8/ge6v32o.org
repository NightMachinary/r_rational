Any good Monster Hunter fanfiction ? I've been looking at the lore a bit and it's COOL. (Most of this will be my Headcannon but still)..

​

Human civilization collapses, a colony in an alien planet gets stranded. To try to reconnect or escape they do some heavy bioengineering on the native fauna, and on humans themselves, eventually a highly intelligent group animals unite and destroy their civilization. They lose their tech and their history.

​

Thanks to the planets lower gravity and the genetic augmentations some humans who descend from soldiers display incredible feats like improved healing and superhuman strength. Others who descend from scholars and leaders form a different species that's longer lived and more intelligent than average humans.

​

Together they fight for survival in this alien world full of dragons and giant monsters. The only memory of their past as a space faring civilization is what they call the Sapphire Star, which is actually an abandoned space station orbiting the planet..

​

Anyone knows any good fanfiction for it ? The setting potential is quite high, with a decent plot it'd be incredible.
