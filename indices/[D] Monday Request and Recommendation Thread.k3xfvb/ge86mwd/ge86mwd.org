I'm trying to remember the title of a story, which might have been a serial and might not. Character embarks on the great Hero's Journey quest to defeat the demon lord or whatever, but they are in fact /not/ the great Hero, and are just a regular person tired of waiting for the great Hero to show up.

(Also, opinions on the story in question, if you know what it is, would be welcome!)
