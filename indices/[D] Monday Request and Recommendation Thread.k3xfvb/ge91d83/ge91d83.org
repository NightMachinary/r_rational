Giving a cautious recommendation to [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/36075/shotgun-fantasy][Shotgun Fantasy]], which was recommended by its author in this thread a few weeks ago, iirc.

Basics of the setting is a standard fantasy world in which humans are a magicless, colonized underclass of elves, but the recent invention of firearms by humans now threatens this.

Like many web serials, the start of the novel is particularly rough, with very functional writing and characters that lack any kind of distinctive voice or personality. Fortunately the writing quality has slowly improved as the author has written; there's still plenty of room for improvement, hence the "cautious" recommendation, but between the incline in quality and the uniqueness of the setting, it could be a good pickup. As rational fiction it is okay, characters are not stupid but not highly rational either, worldbuilding approaches realism but has some flaws.
