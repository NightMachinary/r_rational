I'm looking for some game recommendations for a young child (around 4 years old) who's new to video games but really not good at them. The only game that they've had any success playing so far is "Donut County" and even then only the earlier levels. As a frame of reference, they found 'The Untitled Goose Game' too difficult to play, and that's one of the most commonly suggested games for young kids

In terms of requirements:

1. The game has to be forgiving of inaccurate and slow input accuracy. They struggle when they need to make accurate inputs quickly
2. Preferably, the game would not be story based, as they can't read yet.
3. Ideally, the game would be fun too. Donut County is good because eating things with holes is fun regardless of how easy it is

The only other game that I've found that meets this criteria is Katamari Damacy, but I haven't tried it out yet.

I've tried searching for lists of these types of games, but I haven't found much success. Those types of lists tend to be geared towards kids of older ages. I've seen some people say that kids that young shouldn't be playing video games, and should basically be doing anything else. That's fair, but not really helpful in this case. This video game session happens when the kids can't go out, and this kids siblings love playing Terraria, a game that they can't join in because it's too hard for them. Having a video game that they can play goes a long way towards making them feel included, and that's not something that they get often.

Coop games that have the second player play a much easier role than the first player are okay too
