Multi-days-late reply: I have a now 6-year-old; Katamari Damacy itself isn't a great choice because of the time limits in levels, which can be frustrating to a 4-year-old, though I had a lot of success with Katamari Forever (PS3), which (if you've beaten a level yourself well enough) has "eternal" mode in levels with no time limit and he loved it.

On mobile/tablet, I'd highly highly recommend the (free) PBS Kids app, which has about a hundred small games that swap out over time, all themed after PBS shows and appropriate for 4-6 year olds in both content and pacing.

I had the most success at that age with mobile games, honestly, though the problem is that most "kids" games a) need reading, b) are a little too hard, or c) the big one, shove ads in your face. The games that worked for us from ages 4-5 were:

- Toca Nature (small terraforming/play with animals game)
- Loopimal (loop-based music creator)
- Crazy Gears (puzzles)
- Frost (puzzle game)

As he got closer to 6, he loved Love You To Bits, Bring You Home (puzzle adventure games), Shine (adventure), and Sky (adventure, though I don't think when he started that he knew what the heck was going on).

But mostly PBS Kids.
