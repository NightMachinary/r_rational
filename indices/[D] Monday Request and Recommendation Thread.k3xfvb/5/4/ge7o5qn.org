Minecraft might work. All the items have names, but you generally don't need to be able to read them to figure out how they work.

You might need to show them how to work the recipe book, tell them what tools work on what blocks, and you'll probably want to set the difficulty to "peaceful" to prevent any monsters from spawning.

It's basically Legos on steroids. One of the most popular kids games out there.
