My own experience with childhood games was one of a lot of frustration; My father pretty much only played default Windows games, and he didn't buy me that many games. The games he did buy were mostly random (though I assume he asked the store clerk). I also did not know English, and nobody who knew some English translated for me, so I went into games terra incognita. This made many games unplayable, and I also frequently got stuck in various points in the games I could play. I don't remember things very well, but I think the early games that I ever finished took me years. (My computer time was limited to around two hours per week by my mother.) I also played the games (pretty much all single-player games) with my cousins in the rare times we were together (we lived not in the same cities), and we shared our “discoveries” about the games. (Sharing the games themselves was easy because they were all sold pirated and DRM-free here in Iran.) The whole experience of it was very exhilarating; Everything felt more more like a real-life mystery, and the immersion was more unbroken. It also felt somewhat exotic, perhaps in the way the Orient feels to the Westerners. Anyways, they definitely utilized my grit and curiosity more than anything else in my childhood, and perhaps even ever. There was, e.g., a non-intended jump you do to skip a whole room's intended gameplay (in the first level of Toy Story 2) and reach the final prize platform, and I remember doing that weekly because I did not know how to save the game and also did not know the proper way to reach the prize. I tried that some years ago, and could not do the non-standard jump even once; I think it required a lot of trial-and-error ...

I suggest you try Flash games to find casual games 4-years-olds can play. They run the whole spectrum of complexity, but there are a lot of simple games children can play in there. I could even play some without knowing any English or a guiding adult with me (though I wasn't four). You can use BlueMaxima's Flashpoint to play flash games easily. (It's really nice! A catalogue of hundreds of games that you can play for free, dowloaded on demand.) Another good thing about this strategy is that as the child grows older, you can just let them try games themselves and find stuff they like.

Casual mobile games such as Angry Birds, Fruit Ninja, Cut the Rope, etc will also probably work. (These are somewhat similar to Flash games.)

The games that I enjoyed the most from my childhood (and can remember their names), but the child needs to be older: - Pink Panther - The Neighbor from Hell 1, 2 (there is an HD remake on Steam) - Toy Story 2, 3 - Hercules - Harry Potter games if the child likes the franchise (games two and three were better done IMHO, and later games that required mouse-casting are awkward even for adults.)

PS: My path to currently being a tech savvy CS graduate started from installing and troubleshooting games, and then administering the computer (reinstalling Windows , backuping game save files, etc).

PPS: I spent a lot of my childhood having nothing to do, and I think it's necessary. I am even thinking of adding this to my current life as quasi-meditation sessions. Having time with nothing to do let's you think, fantasize, and cherish life ...
