I've been reading this for a while now, and it's thoroughly mediocre, but I guess I've kept on reading it at least. It does have a lot of various quirks to the worldbuilding and the powers and stuff, but doesn't go into much depth. There's a wide range of characters, but it reaches the point where there's way too many to actually give any one character any real development past their introduction/main arc. Even if the translation is reasonable quality, it still holds a few of the generic terrible tropes of Japanese web novels, even if moderated (gender binary/roles are obvious in the world, but are somewhat broken with strong companions. Protag is treated like a harem protagonist by his followers, but he got reincarnated from scratch and physically doesn't "take advantage" of this. There's a lot of generic litrpg power levels, but unique abilities kinda do a lot of heavy lifting. Etc)
