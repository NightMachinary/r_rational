[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/36983/tower-of-somnus][Tower of Somnus]]. It sounds like it will be finished pretty soon, since it's being written for National Novel Writing Month.

The same [[https://www.royalroad.com/profile/138217/fictions][author]] is writing [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/33020/blessed-time][Blessed Time]], which has been recommended here a few times.

Neither of these strike me as being about upleveling other people the way Rain is in Delve, but you may enjoy them all the same.
