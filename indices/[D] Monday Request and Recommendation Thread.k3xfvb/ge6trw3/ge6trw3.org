Accidentally posted this in the week-old thread:

One of the things I've really enjoyed about *Delve* is the protagonist's recent decision to focus on building up his group and community and not just developing his own power.

Am looking for more recommendations (rational or not) that get beyond the traditional individualistic power fantasy and focus on mutual aid and community building.

There's something primally appealing about protagonists powering up, but am finding it doesn't really fit in with my politics of how a society ought to be, so am curious to see what else is out there.
