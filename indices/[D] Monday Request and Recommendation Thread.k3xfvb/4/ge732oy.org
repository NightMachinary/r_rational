I've been reading an ongoing web serial, [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/32123/just-a-bystander][Just A Bystander]], the past couple days, and it was about 93% composed of everything I love in fantasy. It plays with inverting and subverting the chosen hero prophecy tropes in a way I've never seen done before.

It's a fantasy in a techmagic world whose magic system that's simultaneously very hard/math-y and also very soft, so I don't even know how to describe it. I just know I loved it, and it gave me a similar feeling as a lot of what I love about rational fiction so I figured it might fit over here.
