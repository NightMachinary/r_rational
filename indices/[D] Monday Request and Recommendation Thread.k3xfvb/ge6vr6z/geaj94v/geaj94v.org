I have a four year old who is able to navigate peaceful Minecraft more or less on his own.

The first PC game that I had him learn was Fatty Bear's Birthday Surprise, which is one of Humongous Entertainment's suite of point-and-click adventure titles from the mid-90's. Some enterprising soul has acquired the rights to them and gotten an emulator to work with modern Windows and sells them on steam for like $5 a pop. There's at least two dozen titles to choose from; I just happen to know Fatty Bear like the back of my hand so I chose that one as the introduction (I acquired the entire set on sale for like $25 several years ago in anticipation of this very application).

As a point-and-click, there's no action or twitch reflexes required, and being that it targets kids, each room is full of wacky and zany things to click on, giving him an incentive to explore while slowly learning how to use a mouse. There's no text, and the game presents the player with goals through full voice acting.

It took a few months of semiregular play for him to get it. I put him on my lap and guided the mouse while he clicked, eventually graduating to having him control the mouse and sitting in the chair on his own. I started around when he was 2, so it's possible yours might pick it up faster.

From there we tried minecraft, again with him on my lap controlling the mouse while I worked the left hand keyboard controls. Eventually he had the hang of it enough to be able to move forward (I tell him the W is for Walk), open the inventory, and throw things on the ground. I have it set to peaceful as he takes his time getting around and would likely get stomped by AI at this point.

Before we ever went on the PC, however, we got him a cheap android tablet and loaded it up with a number of apps. Most of them try to be somewhat educational (I have letter and number apps, a handwriting app, math bingo, and a proto-programming game that he has just in the last year managed to grok), but there's also some games just for fun as well, including puzzle apps, random activity apps, a piano app, and things like a Lego building app.

He devours these at any rate I'll feed them to him, and I place full credit for his ability to read and write at the feet of some of these apps. If you want I can get a full list of what we use.

Besides those, I also have a couple of games on my phone that I permit him to play with limited time, such as Angry Birds and Hero Rescue, tho these are more because of ads and such that I don't trust him unsupervised time with lest I end up with a gutted wallet.

All told I think I'm satisfied with his progress; in a number of ways he's ahead of the curve. His 2 year old sister has made similar progress, tho we shan't see if it paid off so well until she grasps it all. She can read off the alphabet if nothing else, so the potential is there.
