I mostly played the original Legend Of Zelda at that age. Took me a whole year. Even though it's a lot harder than later Zelda games, it meets your criteria better, as things don't move very quickly, the plot is irrelevant, and you can generally progress by going somewhere at random and hitting your head against it. I think crucially there was no real expectation that I should be any better at it than I was; having other kids able to step in and help might make it feel more daunting.

I'd also consider Mario games (though I found them frustrating until I was five). The older ones are fine with an infinite lives cheat. The newer 2D ones are probably okay, but I don't know first hand. Mario Galaxy has your requested much easier player two role, which I've seen kids get a kick out of.

More recent games, which I don't have experience playing as or with a kid:

- Celeste has an extensive accessibility/assistance mode that might actually work well for kids, the same way my Game Genie did when I was a kid.

- Maybe Goat Simulator? The controls are complicated, but you can just do whatever and that is, indeed, the point. It's not very wholesome though.

- Zen Bound 2 is a puzzle game about 3D reasoning that uses no words or numbers.

- Incredipede (on normal) is a puzzle game about figuring out how to move as a poorly designed physics creature. It has very easy controls. If it gets harder, I got bored before it did. But it's cute, I'd look into it as a kids game.
