I suggest Minecraft. While I have no firsthand experience with little children playing it, I have seen other parents mentioning that their 4/5 year old plays it.

Minecraft doesn't need a good accuracy for normal gameplay, it is not story-based and it is a lot of fun - see huge long term success over all age groups.

I would recommend to start out with creative mode, so the child can play around a bit and learn the control mechanics. Then maybe switch to survival on peaceful difficulty. Look for a mod which locks peaceful difficulty, I'm sure there exists one. I would also recommend one which lets you keep your inventory if your player character dies (from falling, drowning, lava in peaceful mode).

Minecraft is great to learn exploring, trying out things you imagine and being creative. I also see no problems with violence as long as it is in peaceful mode - the above mentioned modes of dying aren't depicted in a horrifying fashion for a 4 year old, but that is just a guess. Check out Youtube videos if in doubt.

Minecraft can also be played in (local) multiplayer. And there is an education version somewhere out there, I think, although I haven't checked and don't now what it entails. I recommend the Java version as it is the most versatile one (mods, ...).

I have personally only played computer games from 7 years on. But for the latter age group I would recommend games like Anno, The Settlers, zoo simulations.
