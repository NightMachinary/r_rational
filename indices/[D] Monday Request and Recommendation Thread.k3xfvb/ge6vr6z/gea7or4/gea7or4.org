There is Journey mode, which should make the game significantly easier. If Terraria's Journey mode is too hard, you can install a mod that allows God Mode (prevents the character from dying)---"HERO's Mod - Terraria Creative Mode", "Cheat Sheet", etc. That should be enough to make the game easy for anyone.
