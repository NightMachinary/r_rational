I would think twice recommending Baba Is You to tweens, let alone small children. It gets /brutally/ difficult a few hours in, and if a person has little patience (which is a trait extremely common in kids), they are going to get frustrated extremely fast.

I recommend Baba wholeheartedly, but it's definitely not for the younger audiences.
