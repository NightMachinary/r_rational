Well, it's a bit of work and you'll need a sewing machine, a (duplex) laser printer, and a shop capable of slicing thick stacks of paper, but here's the process I used:

1. Download/rip/copypaste text into a Word document and do formatting. Add things like dynamic TOC, page numbers, cover page, etc. Also, add blank pages to ensure new chapters start on odd (or even) pages so it looks good. Make sure font size is good.

2. Print as booklets. This part is a bit tricky and you'll either need a duplex-capable printer or the discipline to do it on a one-sided printer. I printed four-sheet booklets meaning that each booklet contained 16 pages

3. Assemble booklets. Fold each batch of four sheets in half and nest them so the page numbers are in the proper order. Then, using a sewing machine and thread color of choice, sew down the middle of the fold in each booklet. Make sure to do some tests first so you can dial in the thread tension.

4. Bind the booklets together. Stack and align all the folded and sewed booklets, then clamp them flat under pressure in a vice or between sheets of wood. Find a ribbon or other piece of cloth to glue onto the binding. I used hot glue--you want a glue that stays flexible when dry.

5. Get the pages trimmed to size. Now that you have a book, all the pages will be slightly different sizes. I took mine to a Copyshop and had them use their thick stack paper slicer to cut the non-bound edges to perfectly flat.

6. Add a cover. This is a bit tricky because you need to make sure that the book can still open. If you're going for hardcover, it's easiest if the spine is flexible, maybe cloth.

7. Enjoy your book!
