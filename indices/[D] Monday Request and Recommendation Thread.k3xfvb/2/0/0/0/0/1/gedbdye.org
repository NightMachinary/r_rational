I've got a laser cutter capable of doing some nice stuff with leather. I've often though about doing small runs of leather bound books based of stuff in this subreddit. It would have to be pretty expensive though, easily $100 a book after the printing and binding. Maybe just sell covers?

If anyone is interested in getting some book covers laser cut out of leather I'd give them a deal, and help out a bit with basic design work.
