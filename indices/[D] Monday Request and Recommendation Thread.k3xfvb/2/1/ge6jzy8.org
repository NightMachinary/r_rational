[[https://www.goodreads.com/series/40519-the-prince-of-nothing][Prince of Nothing Trilogy]] is centered around a holy war, and deals closely with religion and faith from the protagonist's very cynical perspective.

The sequel series [*major spoilers*] is set decades after the protagonist from the first trilogy has been declared a prophet of the religion he was exploiting. He has unlimited control of the entire world and turns the entirety of human civilization to another holy war, this time against extra-dimensional aliens who want to destroy the entire universe because they found out that hell is actually real. It's some wild shit.

They're both intensely rational works, written by a rather pedantic philosophy PhD. I loved the shit out of both of them.
