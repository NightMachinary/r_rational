Yeah, except I would upgrade that to a hard de-rec. It has some of the flavor of things this sub likes, but it fails utterly on substance. I just gave up on it at somewhat farther along than you did. The main character (and all the characters, really) get major power ups for essentially no effort, they seem to be entirely reacting to the plot with no proactiveness at all, and I just don't really understand why I, or the characters, should care about anything in the plot at all.

Major spoilers: We aren't given a very good reason for any of the characters to have a problem with the Fateweavers, or the prophecy more broadly, since it's hinted that the culture more generally views the fateweavers and prophecy to be tools of their society's success and power. The fact that it seems to end badly for them individually doesn't seem like enough for /all/ of them to, without much thought, decide to act against the prophecy It would be like having a squad of soldiers told that a mission integral to the success of a war is likely to result in their death. That one or two of them would object, sure...but all of them? None of these people thinks it's worth dying to continue the success of their country? And furthermore, when and how the prophecy is able to force/prevent action is completely unexplained and reeks of the worst sort of "because the plot needed it to work that way in this situation". The story as a whole has a veneer of "hard fantasy" but it's just that: a veneer. Underneath the surface it is just as handwave-y and soft as any other fantasy series since the "rules" are unexplained and so complicated that it's not possible for a reader to get any idea of what is or is not possible.
