It has an OP MC who doesn't take unrealistic actions, does a multitude of cool things including making an organization to benefit the whole world with enough realism that it doesn't make me cringe and the way pokemon are described and connected to their trainers are really nice. <- This is like 90% of my subjective favorites in a story so it would be Awesome to me.

The negatives would be its not too rational, I feel everyone agrees too easily with the MC a little but this may be completely realistic if you take into account that Aura users can't lie. (Would authoritarianism work if all the top leadership can't lie and have been proven to have good intentions? Not sure, and the way most people just goes with it feels a little weird to me.) The world is just explained enough that it doesn't brake emersion (such as Jenny's and Joy's are explained as a "clan", like psychics or aura users) but I feel getting rid of them would be more realistic. Its very "sappy" with lots of brooding but mostly loads of "I love you"'s. Some of the pokemon's affection I feel is a little forced but not enough to turn me off. The battles would be cool but I don't care about action so I just skip those usually. I just like the "crushes everyone and interacts with crowd after" and "does X heroic things and see people's reactions" scenes which there are plenty off.

Edit: Also, it looks dead but it ends on a decent place with the first meeting with ash, so I don't feel unsatisfied actually which is very rare for me and unfinished stories.
