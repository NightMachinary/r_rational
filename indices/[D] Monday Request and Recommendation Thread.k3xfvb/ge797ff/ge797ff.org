So I stumbled onto [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/36950/borne-of-caution][Borne of caution]] on RR and realized I need some decent Pok√©mon self-inserts. From my search so far I have only found [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13202202/1/Dreaming-of-Family]] (Which is awesome!) but wondering if there is any you guys enjoyed and recommend? The one request/requirement, is I don't like the cannon anime plot much and already read origin of species (so am tired of red/Garry etc) so don't want any which just re-hash cannon, but change it significantly ideally from a characters perspective outside the direct plot.

Thanks!
