It isn't a self-insert story, but I remember [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4871317/1/Pedestal][Pedestal]] being pretty good. My last read through was something like eight years ago, so I may be misremembering, but I think it had a similar-ish feel to Borne of Caution. And it for sure didn't borrow much from the canon story.
