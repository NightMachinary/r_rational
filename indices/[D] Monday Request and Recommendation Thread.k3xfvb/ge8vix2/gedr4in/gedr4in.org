If you're willing to try games, [[https://the-last-sovereign.blogspot.com/][The Last Sovereign]] is pretty good.

I made [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/ismlth/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/g5q7i6b/][a longer post]] a couple months ago that covers it in some detail, but in short it's a smutty rpg about a jaded veteran who gains a sex based power from the same source as the evil overlord who is plaguing his Homeland.

There's a pretty strong emphasis on sensible decision-making and a use of "soft power" like economics and diplomacy that I've not seen in /any/ rpg, adult or otherwise. The setting is explicitly non rational, but the response to it from the main characters is exactly what anyone from this subreddit might hope for.
