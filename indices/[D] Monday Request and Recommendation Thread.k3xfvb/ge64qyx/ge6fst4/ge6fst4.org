This isn't exactly what you're looking for, but [[http://unsongbook.com/prologue-2/][/Unsong/]] by Scott Alexander (of Slate Star Codex) is one of my all-time favorite stories. The premise is that Kabbalistic Judaism and some form of Gnostic Christianity are true. Humanity discovers this in the late 1960s. The story is set in the present day, and explores how society has changed because of the discovery.
