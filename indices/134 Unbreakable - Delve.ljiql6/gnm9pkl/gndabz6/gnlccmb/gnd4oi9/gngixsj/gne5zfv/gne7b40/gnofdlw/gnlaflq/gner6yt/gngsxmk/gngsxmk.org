Very slight spoilers for future chapters, but I think you might want to see it:

There is a reason for his pathetic struggling that makes some sense.

A very slightly more spoilery continuation of the above point:

During the fight, Rain pumped up Focus using his ring beyond the point of soulstrain. This caused him to have extreme tunnel-vision during the fight with the goal of "defeat the enemy" which led to him not being able to really think of anything more tactical than "just keep attacking even when I'm out of mana." It isn't meant to be heroic or noble, it's Rain making a mistake.
