Meh, this was where I stopped my patreon subscription. It's not that this chapter is so bad, per se. Something did indeed happen. But when there's endless chapters building to action with ungodly amounts of planning and policy writing and general filler, and then the actual actions turns out to be a forced error based on a predictable yet unplanned-for event, it just loses my interest. I don't read for months to have this be the payout for listening to Rain's idiotic thoughts on establishing Democracy and organizing a company,

But whatever, if this is worth it you, then go for it.
