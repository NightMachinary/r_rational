Ah, I get the title now. At first I thought it referred to Rain's wrists, but they definitely broke.

Dozer is unbreakable because you can't break a slime!

Glad Brovose is alive. For now.Though really, I'm more worried for the Ascension crew. Tallheart should have killed Brovose, before going after Anton. Maybe he just assumed that Rain, Ameliah and Brovose were all dead. Sloppy.\\
If mere sleeping makes Brovose strong, then being knocked unconscious he's more dangerous than ever.\\
Though he'll probably wake up, take Hegar's accolades, explain to the healers how to best deal with the Bleeders to fix Ameliah for some goodwill (and tell them that she started it), stare at them intimidatingly and run in the other direction from Tallheart.\\
That's what I would do and he seems sensible enough to act like me.

Wonder if his Torpor advantage gets ruined if he drinks coffee.
