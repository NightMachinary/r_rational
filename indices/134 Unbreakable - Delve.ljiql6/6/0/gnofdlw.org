I feel the entire fight was too far fetched. Why Ameliah got apeshit crazy when she didn't have a build for pvp? Why not delay the confrontation a couple of days? Some would say that she didn't know they were so powerfull and her silver rank should have been enough. But consider this: Rain ring give more stats than all the accolades of those 3 guys. Good equipment would be enough to bridge the "silver gap". And Ameliah didn't know what kind of equipment they had. She took a stupid risk and she is supposely an expirienced adventurer. Why they fight AWAY of a fucking fortified position? The answer is because the author needed to have Ameliah and Rain trashed. It is bad writing to a main plot development.
