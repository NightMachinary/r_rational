Yeah I don't know what it is, but there was something so cringe about him getting his ass kicked over and over again, and continuing to struggle. It just seems like the story grows thin here, and its somehow some fantasy created by someone who was bullied a lot. I'm definitely projecting, but it just comes across as pathetic, this deep into the narrative, not heroic or noble. Especially the whole event is sort of the product of a fuckup.
