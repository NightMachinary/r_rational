There's issues with trying to massively reduce the amount of certain materials selectively.\\
For one silicon is /super/ common and thus that will exacerbate the general problem that to get certain unrealistic planetary compositions will require significant rather arbitrary changes to the backstory of the setting. The composition of nebulas that form planetary systems just isn't random and so if you want the right elements to not require you to work on devising a whole complex alien biology which doesn't require certain elements (or exists on gas giants) or in some cases a magnetic field, then you're pretty limited in what you can change.

But then again that's not so much of an issue in fantasy settings. In those I usually stop tech development by having the world basically exist in the minds of the gods, which can explain the world acting in a way more reminiscent of human intuition than natural laws. However in the latter case you probably also want to change quite a lot from our own world since any world that doesn't work exactly the same as our own (or isn't designed as a simulation of it) won't realistically be without major alien features.

P.S. Depending on whether you want the setting to make sense you also need to deal with the fact that humans and many other systems bear really obvious signs of having originated via natural selection in a universe like our own. So if you want to have humanlike creatures and many other things from our world you're going to need to have /some/ sort of connection with a world like our own to explain that.\\
A solution I've used for that is having the setting have previously been like our own world in many ways, but having undergone some magitech catastrophe that led to it ending up as a magical simulations in the minds of gods. This also serves to explain why the culture isn't /completely/ alien, since I didn't want to have to build a totally new culture from the ground up that may well result in pretty much everyone in the setting having values that people from liberal western countries would find horrifying.
