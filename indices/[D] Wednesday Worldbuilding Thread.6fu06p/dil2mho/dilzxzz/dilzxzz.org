Well, if you accept radio waves being banned because of aliens detecting them, the same can be done for steam.

Have your humans live underground, with the surface taken over by giant human-eating creatures with infrared vision. Anything to do with heat/fire is outlawed in fear that the surface creatures will notice the heat coming from the underground settlements and break in. So steam engines are no go, since they produce lots of heat.
