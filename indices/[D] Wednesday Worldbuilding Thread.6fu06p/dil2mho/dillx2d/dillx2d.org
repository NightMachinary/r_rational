What if you turned off QM superstates in metals?

The valence electrons in metals collapse into a superstate. If I remember correctly, this helps make metals ductile. Remove the effect and their structures would look more crystalline.

This breaks high-efficiency steam turbines, since the slightly-more-crystalline steel would tend to shatter under tension from high-pressure steam. You could still do Carnot engines for some sorts of work, but they move to slowly for vehicles.

This would also make metals less conductive. We could imagine that they'd still conduct some electricity. So you could have a doorbell or something. But the resistance could be high enough that a long-distance electric telegraph would be too expensive to be feasible.

Science would look pretty much unchanged through at least 1911 or so, except that metallurgy would be slightly worse.
