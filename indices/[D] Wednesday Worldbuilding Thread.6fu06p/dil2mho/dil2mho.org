Forcing a setting to abide by arbitrary rules can lead to interesting technological innovations. In most circumstances, actually following such rules is not rational (e.g., the complex automations used by certain religious groups in order to avoid doing "work" on holy days). In other settings, however, the rules may be backed up with easily-tested penalties (e.g., the /Safehold/ series' orbital kinetic-bombardment installations that will destroy any evidence of radio-wave emission on the planet's surface upon detection).

The question, of course, is: What limitations make sense? In the aforementioned /Safehold/ series, radio waves cannot be emitted because they would draw the attention of off-planet aliens bent on destroying all other civilizations. On what basis could (for example) steam turbines be forbidden, in order for reciprocating steam engines to reach their limits of efficiency (e.g., sextuple-expansion engines)? Does there exist any mechanism whereby transistors and vacuum tubes could rationally be shunned in favor of clockwork? What physical rules could preclude the development of the electric telegraph and leave the field open for its optical predecessor to remain unchallenged? (Etc.)

And, obviously, a peculiarity forced upon a setting in order to preserve one particular technology must also have effects on other technologies.
