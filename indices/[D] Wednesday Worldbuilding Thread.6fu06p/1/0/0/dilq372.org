I hadn't thought about antagonists, though it's so simple yet brilliant I can't believe I hadn't thought of it before. I had actually planned on taking this in one of two different directions, which I hadn't explained very well. Either people are putting their children into a simulation as a way of raising them and eventually bring them back to the real world, or it's the new World of Warcraft that builds worlds and stories for the customers.

I like the setting for Perfect State, but I'm not a big fan of the story since I found the conflict predictable and the resolution ultimately pointless. Maybe that was intentional so you'd feel what the protagonist did, but that's not what I enjoy reading. Instead, I want to use the same idea as a framing device for either Sliders-esque adventures or roleplaying as professional Game Masters who have to entertain their customers.
