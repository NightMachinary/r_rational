This is sort of the mentality of Black Knight from The Practical Guide to Evil. Villains can /do well/, but heroes /always/ stumble ass backwards over the villain's weakness, or a long-forgotten magic sword, or some awesomely powerful spell at just the most critical juncture. He wants to pull out a final victory just /once/, so that in a thousand years five-man-bands of heroes will sit around their campfires before their dramatic infiltration of the Evil Fortress, and they'll /remember/, and they'll know that they might actually lose.
