What if you make them professional antagonists?

I'm the God Emeperor from the perfect state. I've hit the age where the maintainers tell me that I'm in a simulation. They have to tell me. But it creates some predictable psychological problems. How can I feel rage at a computer opponent who has been created to lose? And am I "heroic" if I know that the computer-generated suffering only existed so I could beat it?

Enter your characters.

Their job is to play the defeatable villains for despairing God Emperors.

A "standard" op is that they're invited in to the God Emperor's world. Supposedly, they're coming in for some kind of morally-neutral challenge. "Sail to the End of the World" or "Conquer the Lost Continent or something."

In reality, the challenge is [[http://planetsave.com/2013/12/23/a-rigged-game-of-monopoly-reveals-how-feeling-wealthy-changes-our-behavior-ted-video/][rigged]] in favor of the God Emperor. And the characters are told to turn themselves into [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heel_(professional_wrestling)][heels]] who will be really satisfying to defeat.

The maintainers have found that this setup helps jaded God Emperors feel a renewed connection to their world.

Only, in this mission, for whatever reason, the characters decide that they're tired of losing. Maybe the God Emperor is such a boorish jerk that they decide they'll pull out a victory. Or maybe [[#s][spoiler]]

So, your characters -- each a veteran of dozens of villainous campaigns -- decide to pull out the stops and use their genre-savvy to crush the Empire of the Light and win one for the downtrodden orcs.
