I find the premise of Brandon Sanderson's novella [[https://brandonsanderson.com/perfect-state/][Perfect State]] very interesting and want to use it for something. The basic idea is that people are raised in a simulated reality from birth, wherein their life ends up becoming the story of a hero changing their world for the better and earning basically everything they want. Don't worry, they're eventually told the truth.

The reason for this is because the simulation is supposed to optimize the person's happiness, so it creates challenges befitting their skills for them to surmount in order to satisfy their desires. In practice, it tends to encourage narcissistic tendencies and the protagonist has conflicting feelings about much of his life now that he's become genre savvy.

I kind of want to use this as the basis of a quest in a RPG campaign, say Eclipse Phase. The obvious hook is that the players would have to enter the simulations and uncover some sinister purpose behind it all. An idea I think is cool is that the players are professional NPCs for a more Westworld-style service and help the simulation satisfy the users.
