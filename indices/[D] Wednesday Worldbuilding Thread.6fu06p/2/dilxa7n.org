So, among a number of other malformed ideas, I've been thinking of running a pokemon RP. The premise would be that in an alternate universe, pokemon Go came out as the game we all wanted it to be-- with every pokemon, trading, battling, more granular regional distributions, etcetera. And in an alternate universe to that alternate universe, when you caught a pokemon on screen, you'd recieve it in real life, caught in a pokeball.

Why? Well, that's not really important; it's a setting conceit in the same way as "magic exists" is harry potter's setting conceit.

But anyways, the idea of the RP would be that aside from the actual in-rp interaction, there would also be some mechanic to encourage players to take their in-RP teams and fight with each other on pokemon showdown.

That's where I run into some problems, and that's why I'm here in the worldbuilding thread.

- what mechanics can I use to encourage players actually battling over pokemon showdown?
- how shluld I handle in-rp geographical distribution of pokemon
- how should I handle players aquiring new pokemon, especially with considering their in-game location?
- how should I handle mechanics like IVs/EVs/levels/Shinyness?
- how do I handle items?

My current idea is to have xp as a currency, with it distributed for making posts and fighting battles, and spent on leveling pokemon/training them/aquiring new pokemon.

I have no idea how to handle geographical distribution of pokemon though.
