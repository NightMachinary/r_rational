There be spoilers below!

For realz.

OK.

I'm still into themes of consciousness, specifically as discussed in [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/][Meditions on Moloch]] and Peter Watts's [[http://www.rifters.com/real/Blindsight.htm][Blindsight]]. I find them deliciously frightening. But what I really like about 3BM is that it makes me really freakin' worried about myself.

Take [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/5f/bayesians_vs_barbarians/][Bayesians vs Barbarians]] which makes the case that, if an /actual/ Rational Society was attacked by fanatics, the Rational survival action is to delegate the amount of people and resources necessary to defeat the fanatics and convert them to war-making purposes until victory is assured. People would likely be selected based on some combination of effective fight ability and lottery. This would include whatever self-modification is necessary in order to WIN as efficiently as possible.

I completely agree. I would hope such a lottery wouldn't choose me, but if it did I would submit to warrior-modification for the good of my society. This IS what I want.

Which sounds suspiciously like the horror-punch of 3BM.

Which also leads me to realize that any time I give up any immediate pleasure for the promise of future utility (saving money to invest rather than spending on hedons; working on podcast or writing rather than going out with friends; etc) I am in effect saying "This is fine. This is what I want." And it really is! A life of pure in-the-moment hedonism would suck, I /want/ to make things that last, and to have future financial security! But, well, how far am I willing to push that before I become Mitanni-esque? Before I'm not really working for me anymore, I'm just benefitting "the system" and deluding myself that it's for me?

Basically, anytime my core values are convincingly attacked like this, I feel really creepy and shivery, and I like that feeling.
