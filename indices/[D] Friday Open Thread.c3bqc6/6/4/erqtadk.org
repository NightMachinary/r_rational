*If* you can stand the genre, Forty Millenniums of Cultivation. One of my favourite pieces of writing, extremely badass, good quantity of character development later on, generally all around rational/ist. Certainly your weekends won't be too long for this, there are >1000 translated chapters, and it's still going strong.
