Well, recently my life has been even more busy than usual. Electrical issues with the household current on my truck. Working towards a Continuation-in-Part of the patent, etc.

On top of that, I recently had an idea based on something that popped into my head a couple weeks ago, and won't let go.

Recently, I have been reading some LitRPG, and enjoying some of it (while being grumpy about how some of it was terribly written.)

Then, one day, I remembered [[https://media.wizards.com/2014/downloads/dnd/TuckersKobolds.pdf]['Tucker's Kobolds.']]

As soon as I combined the two concepts in my mind, all sorts of connections started to form. A lot of them felt quite rational.

It also feels as if I could write this in much smaller bites, with a great deal of action.

So, is there any interest in reading a Rational LitRPG story based on a human mind being transferred into a kobold in a D&D-like setting?

I can't say how quickly this would progress. I am considering posting it to Wattpad. Anyone have experience with them?
