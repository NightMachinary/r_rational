If you're inspired partially by D&D/a D&D sourcebook setting, that would be enough to qualify as a fanwork.

(Unnecessary side details: Depending on the edition of D&D, there are various official settings that are assumed to be the 'base' setting of the core rulebooks. Some of them are pretty much specific to D&D, like Greyhawk, whereas others have more content for them, such as the Forgotten Realms. Despite this, pretty much all D&D core rulebooks have the same flavour of setting, so 'D&D' is a valid setting in its own right in the sense that it denotes a widely-recognised set of tropes, creatures, spells etc. that form a cohesive framework for a fantasy world.)
