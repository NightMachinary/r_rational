Sorry, I don't think I was particularly clear on re-reading my comment. D&D is basically a set of rules for simulating worlds and characters. The world being modelled is fair game as a fan work even if you don't ever directly use the simulating techniques (which means it doesn't need to sound like a Gamer fic with levels/classes/feats/etc.)
