Yes, the writing gets better. It never gets to a true native speaker baseline, but the constant typos and worst of the awkward phrasing pretty much goes away. This is in large due to getting different, paid translators. However, this is a long story; if you can't handle a hundred chapters of jank writing, especially given the rational/ist parts only start later, you'll struggle with it.

I think it's worth it, but it's not for everyone.
