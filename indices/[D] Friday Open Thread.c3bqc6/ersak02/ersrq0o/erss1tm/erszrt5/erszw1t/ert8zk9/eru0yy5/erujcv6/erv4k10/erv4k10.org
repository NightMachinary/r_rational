Here's some of the concepts:

Imagine that a mage experiments with creating a new breed of hunting animals for a hunt-mad noble. The noble wants something tougher and smarter than dogs, but without too much intelligence.

The mage experiments with extremely high level spells like wishes, in order to force a mutation of mostly dog with just a touch of dragon.

The mage ends up with 'dragon-dogs.' The dd's are smarter than dogs, but not quite sapient, as far as the mage can determine. They are patchwork scaled, have a very unreliable magic resistance, basic opposable thumbs, and just enough flame breath to cook their meat before they eat it. They can also stand and walk reasonably on their two back legs, but travel quickly on all four.

What the mage does not realize is that the dd's are near-human intelligence. When he tried to communicate with them by spell, they clearly understood some of what he said, but did not speak back to him.

The mage did not realize that they speak in high pitched tones outside human hearing ranges.

They are intelligent enough, that after many generations, they spontaneously generate a new God for themselves.

They also have ancestral memory, but limited problem solving and other cortex-related skills.

Their God eventually comes to understand that its followers are lacking ... something.

The God pokes around and consults a dragon, who humors him and offers advice.

The advice is to find the soul of a being who has the traits he wants in his people, and transplant that soul into one of his followers.

This soul transfer is only possible because dd minds can handle ancestral memory.

So, the dd God tries to get a soul from humans, dwarves, elves, etc., but all the races in the home dimension are guarded over by gods, very jealousy.

So, the God goes farther afield, and finds himself in our dimension, where some souls are guarded jealously, but others are not.

He finds our protagonist as an old, old man with an enormous family of many generations. When that man dies, naturally, the protagonist's story begins.
