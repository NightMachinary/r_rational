One obvious suggestion is to stop reading depressing news, no point in feeling bad about things you can do nothing about, it only impedes your ability to change things you do have control over.

Unsubscribe from depressing stuff and subscribe to educational or funny stuff.

For educational stuff just read hacker news and listen to YC podcast, or Tim Ferris, or Artificial Intelligence by Lex Fridman, or Indie Hackers, or 2 minute papers youtube channel.

For comedy I love Harmontown podcast(by the creator of Community and Rick and Morty, it's best to listen to it from the beginning). Aside from that - there's too many youtube channels or tv shows to list, and I don't know if that's what you're looking for, so I'll stop at that.
