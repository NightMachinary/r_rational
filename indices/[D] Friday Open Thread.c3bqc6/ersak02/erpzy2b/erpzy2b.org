Climate change news tends to be awful and depressing, and it's difficult for me to properly calibrate how I should feel because I have depression /anyway/.

Most of the feeds that I'm subscribed to are 9 stories about how bad things are for every 1 story about concrete progress that's being made. I already /know/ that things are kind of shitty, though, and I don't need regular reminders on that while searching for information on what's actually being done.

Anyone have recommendations for places to look / feeds to subscribe to?
