I'm sure there are real stories on it that are worth reading, and that it would be a shame if they were lost.

But from the admittedly non-random sample of "works I've personally looked at on AO3," it seems like there's a higher percentage of trash there than there is on FF dot net. Possibly because I haven't watched TV since the last episode of season 6 of House MD nine years ago (that's a little bit of an exaggeration, I sign up for Netflix and/or Hulu at least once a year for a few specific shows), so I wouldn't consider myself up to date on what fandoms are popular, so maybe some IP that I don't even know exists has a great fandom full of talented writers, but, y'know, /oh well/. They should have put their work on FF dot net instead of the website where 99% of the stories are porn.
