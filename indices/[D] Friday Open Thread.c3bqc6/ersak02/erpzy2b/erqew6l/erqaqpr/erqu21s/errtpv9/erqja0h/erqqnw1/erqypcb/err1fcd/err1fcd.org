AO3 is a cultural treasure.

The tag system allows you to browse the vast sea of creative works without having to slog through endless trash, and it permits the site as a whole to be very anti-censorship about everything without drowning in endless complaints - it enforces a rule of "Tag your shit, yo", and after that, if you read something, and it was correctly tagged, that is your problem, not the authors problem. Seriously, learn to use the tag system to search with, particularly the "Exclude" function.
