Yes, I agree that's probably a big factor.

edit: That probably ties into the "self-insertion" factor actually, in the sense that it allows you to put yourself in someone else's shoes and think about what you would have done differently. Worm has a lot of these "crossroads moments", like when Taylor chooses to infiltrate the undersiders instead of just joining the Wards, and so on. Moments where the story would be massively different depending on which path is taken. HP and Naruto has that too, for that matter.
