FFnet is poorly-managed, far from user-friendly, and displays little to no communication when e.g. somebody wrongly flags your story as violating the rules and it gets taken down.

OTOH, as [[/u/Izeinwinter]] said, Ao3 is easier to search. It's also more user-friendly, and the format is far more flexible: embedded links, artwork, audio files, alternate font styles and colors, and more are all possible on Ao3.

We also can't ignore that Ao3 is the final resting place of countless fan archives that might have otherwise vanished from off the face of the web.

Whatever the standard one applies to it, I struggle to find a way in which FFnet measures favorably against Ao3. Maybe the lack of PMs in Ao3. That can get annoying sometimes.
