why do you say that half of the are almost exclusively appealing to girls?

I count twilight and Glee. I don't know anything about Supernatural, Hetalia, Inuyasha, bleach, or Once Upon a Time, but that's still at most 7.

(Granted, if it turns out that all the ones I was unfamiliar with turn out to be "exclusively appealing to girls", well, I suppose that's to be expected.)
