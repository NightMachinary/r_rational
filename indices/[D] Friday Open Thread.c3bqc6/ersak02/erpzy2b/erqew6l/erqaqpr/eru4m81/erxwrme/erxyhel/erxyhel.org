Thank you for the response/explanation! This will be helpful. The protocol I thought up during the session was pretty simplistic, and it lacked the second response, which I will be incorporating in future iterations. Going:

Call: A proper noun that the party has encountered.

Response: Any noun starting with the last letter of the previous word.

Which makes it pretty susceptible to attack. I'm hoping to increase the sophistication of the protocol and incorporate the second response without increasing latency too much. As you said, there are plenty of methods of attack. A mitigating factor here is my DM, who has essentially stated that many forms of mind-reading, domination, etc. do not give the attacker full or clear access to memories.

So I'm hoping that a protocol which relies on in-party knowledge will be helpful at least in increasing the scope of the defensive test.
