So I'm trying to establish some sort of infohazard/cognitohazard/other form of being compromised protocol for my DnD party, and they're generally into the idea. However, I'm struggling to come up with a concept that is practically feasible in the tabletop setting. Was thinking about using the "keyring" protocol from worth the candle, but I couldn't find a good description of how it actually worked, and I don't remember the first chapter it was introduced.

Anyone have an idea if that would work for my party/any other good schema to use?

Also, any general protocols to follow for that sort of thing would be helpful, since we don't yet have a great set of infohazard policies.
