There's (unsurprisingly) an [[https://www.xkcd.com/1968/][xkcd]] that describes my opinions perfectly. I think there's far less risk of AI rebelling or trying to take over and a far greater risk of AI enabling perfect, unchangeable totalitarianism or horrific income inequality of the type that drives of back into feudalism, but without the implicit understanding that the rich need the poor. In recent History, the greatest problem for tyrannical regimes is when soldiers switch sides and join the protesters. Facial recognition software available on phones right now tied to guns would effectively take away the last resort of the people at the bottom of a failing society.

​

Even rudimentary AI has and will continue to allow massive control over discourse, surveillance of dissidents, and siloed perception of current events. That's with relatively little intelligence driving it; a truly advanced AI could warp society into whatever its controller wanted. Considering that human beings as a species are fantastically bad at foresight, human-controlled AI does not fill me with hope.

​

Because of the Delong article, and other examples of cooperation / mass action being more efficient, I'm actually hoping AI will eventually be able to sideline its human controllers, because I think there's a better chance AI - controlled AI *would* lead us into utopia than human controlled AI *wouldn't* lead us into dystopia.
