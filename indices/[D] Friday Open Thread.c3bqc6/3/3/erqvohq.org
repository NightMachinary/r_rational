What makes a setting fanfic bait is that it is popular, extensible, and annoying. It has to be easy to set new stories in while having a lot of established world-building done which people will be familiar with. That is the "Extensible and popular" part, and something about the official stories set in the setting needs to be at least somewhat annoying to the reader/viewer in a way that can be fixed by adding on to them. Which is why star wars did not get a huge fanfic community until the prequels annoyed the heck out of the fanbase.
