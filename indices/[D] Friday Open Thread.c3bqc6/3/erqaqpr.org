What determines if a particular work is "fanfic worthy" for fans? I used to think it was a combination of a work being popular, long running(or at least having enduring popularity), having a relatable protagonist, and having a multitude of distinct side characters with some degree of agency. After observing my little sister get into the whole thing for the past few years( she's 16 atm) I've revised my opinion. It's actually very interesting as she lives in Brazil and fanfiction and amateur fiction is exploding in the past five years or so because of smartphones. It's like watching a fandom ecosystem develop from nothing.

I now think what makes a work fertile ground for the first, initial wave of fanfiction writers is the capacity for the reader to insert oneself into the character or the setting. And crucially, it has to provide that for /teenage girls/. For that to happen, in addition to the above points, there have to be 1. one or more high status female characters in the story, 2. a romance subplot (or at least romantic tension), and 3. a multitude of potential romantic partners.

Here are the top 20 fandoms on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] by number of stories:

2.  Naruto (428K) Anime\\
3.  Twilight (220K) Book/Movie\\
4.  Supernatural (124K) TV\\
5.  Hetalia - Axis Powers (121K) Anime\\
6.  Inuyasha (119K) Anime\\
7.  Glee (108K) TV\\
8.  Pok√©mon (97.1K) Video Game/TV\\
9.  Bleach (85K) Anime\\
10. Percy Jackson and the Olympians (76.1K) Book/Movie\\
11. Doctor Who (75.5K) TV\\
12. Kingdom Hearts (74.2K) Video Game\\
13. Yu-Gi-Oh (67.9K) Anime\\
14. Fairy Tail (66.5K) Anime\\
15. Sherlock (60.2K) TV\\
16. Lord of the Rings (57.2K) Book/Movie\\
17. Dragon Ball Z (52.7K) Anime\\
18. Once Upon a Time (51.5K) TV\\
19. Star Wars (51.0K) Movie\\
20. Fullmetal Alchemist (49.4K) Anime\\

Right away you can see that half of them are almost exclusively appealing to girls. The only exceptions to point 1 is when males are partnered with other males, as in Supernatural and Sherlock (and Hetalia possibly, IDk). Only one story appears to have an exclusive male appeal, DBZ. Lord of the Rings and FMA are edge cases, I can't tell much from a cursory look.

As an aside, are people aware how much the readership is skewed female when it comes to fanfiction? Probably more than fiction in general, even, which has around 70% of novels being bought by women? I have no idea, it's not something that I've ever really talked about.

Anyway, an example that kinda proves my thesis is the Star Wars section, which used to be pretty small considering its cultural impact-- until the new movies that is, whereupon it exploded in popularity. The new trilogy features 1. a high status female character, 2. some romantic tension, and 3. a variety of possible romantic partners(Finn, Poe, Kylo and even Han apparently, if you're a thirsty teen), which none of the previous trilogies did, if you consider that Luke is Leia's sibling and that Padme HAS to end up with Anakin since it's a prequel.
