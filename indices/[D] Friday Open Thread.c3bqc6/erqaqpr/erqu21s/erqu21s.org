[[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MostFanficWritersAreGirls][Most fanfiction writers are girls.]] This is basically indisputable - only in the rare case where communities are overwhelmingly male to begin with, does the gender ratio start to balance out. (See: Spacebattles and Sufficient Velocity)

Note, even in the dark corners of the internet where the authors are fully grown, functional adults, fanfiction is still 90% garbage.
