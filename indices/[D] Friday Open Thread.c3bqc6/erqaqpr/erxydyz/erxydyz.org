I actually have an unfinished blog post about this. In short, the biggest thing you can do, if you want to optimize for making things ficcable for whatever reason, are:

1. Be really, really popular and universally seen by an audience who writes a lot of fanfic, i.e. young people in their formative years, mostly female.
2. Have defined Stations of the Canon that fanfic authors can riff on.
3. Have compelling characters who aren't fully explored in the work itself, especially including side characters who leave an impression but don't feature in the story all that much. Being able to have X/Y matchups with combinatoric explosion helps.
4. Have a universe with extensible, toybox rules, especially weak ones that allow a lot of leeway and interpretation.
5. Have in-universe categorization and analysis schemes that allow people to slot themselves into the world and thereby say something about themselves, or about the characters that they're writing.
