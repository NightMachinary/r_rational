Not sure about that. As a counterpoint, Worm is considered to have an incredibly satisfying ending but has a massive fanfic community. The original prequel trilogy was popular and annoying as fuck but feature no fanfics of it.

I think that potential for "self-insertion" counts for a lot, as do the other parts I mentioned.
