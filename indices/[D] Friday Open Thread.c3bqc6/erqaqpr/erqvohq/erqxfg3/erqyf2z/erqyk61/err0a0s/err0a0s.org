Star Wars has that a lot more in recent films. The feeling of inevitability is gone; the tension is not in what will happen but how the characters will do the thing that happens. In the original films, the narration seemed to me to be such that characters were predictable, but the outcomes weren't necessarily predictable. (This may be the result of growing from a new canon to a lived-in canon.)
