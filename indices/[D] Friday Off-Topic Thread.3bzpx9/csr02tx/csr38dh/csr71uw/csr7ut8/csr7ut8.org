It doesn't seem so to /me,/ at least--I don't think /v/FatPeopleHate has even gotten to the front page in several days. However, I may not be the most well-informed--as a frequenter of [[/r/KotakuInAction]], I don't really bother to read the comments in /v/KotakuInAction or /v/MeanwhileOnReddit, since it's all the same information.
