Looks like reddit screwed up the handoff between their previous community liason and whoever the current one is. It's a mistake, but it's the kind of mistake companies make all the time. I've seen big sales fall through because a sales person (who gave two weeks notice!) who left wasn't asked the right questions or wasn't given a good procedure for handing off potential clients, or because someone was fired but the company wasn't smart enough about figuring out what the person was doing and wiped their computer or something and therefore lost contracts.

Seems like a major mistake since this person was basically providing the support to keep a few subreddits running. Doesn't impact me in the slightest so I don't care.
