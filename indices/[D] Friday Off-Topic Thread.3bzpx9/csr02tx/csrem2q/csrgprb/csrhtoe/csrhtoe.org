Wow, that's pretty awful. Yeah, I could see how this shows there's an underlying problem with how reddit interacts with the users. I assume the way reddit makes money is by showing ads, which means that the "product" is reddit's userbase. You curate that product by making sure you meet the community's needs.

If you're gonna fire the person responsible for coordinating AMAs and not have someone ready to go, or a good transition in place, then the ensuing shitshow is pretty much predictable.

Edit: Again, yeah it doesn't impact me but it's a bad sign in general. I like reddit and hope they don't go out of business or go "dark" or something due to people leaving.
