The main complaint is that the admins aren't communicating properly with the mod teams. A legitimate concern for the default mods (/especially/ [[/r/IAmA]], since it's the main subreddit that's known outside Reddit and the one that the admins should be taking responsibility for). But the mods of a small subreddit like [[/r/rational]] don't expect the admins to keep them informed anyway, and they're not in a position to judge whether they're doing a good job.

The rest is internal politics of a company that doesn't matter to us either.
