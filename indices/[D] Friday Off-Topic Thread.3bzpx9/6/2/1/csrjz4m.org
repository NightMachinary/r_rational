I was fine with Fall of Doc Future, but when the AI in Skybreaker's Call magically turned out to be an attractive female humanoid (with humanoid sexuality, really?) who wanted to join the menage I couldn't read another paragraph. The dual mutually-obsessive relationship was masturbatory enough.

I've only read Time Braid twice, but the looping Naruto and their weird-ass relationship is definitely the worst part of it. I also enjoyed the Yggdrasil setting details much more before I found out it was an A!MG crossover.

Edit: I forgot that in Time Braid, the characters are all twelve or so, which makes the weird sex stuff even weirder. Like, seriously creepy.
