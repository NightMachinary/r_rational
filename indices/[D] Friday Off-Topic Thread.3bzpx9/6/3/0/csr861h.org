Every time I read the book again, I'm amazed anew at how awesome it is! Sakura vs. Sasuke in the Forest of Death--Sakura vs. Akatsuki at the City of the Gods--Sakura writing seals on her own soul--Sakura inventing lava-based ninjutsu--there's just no end to how much I love this story!

(Also, I tend to read books in general several times--I've read /The Three Musketeers/, /Robinson Crusoe/, and /Methods of Rationality/* four times each, for example.)

*Though three of those read-throughs were executed when the story wasn't yet complete, so I guess they don't count...
