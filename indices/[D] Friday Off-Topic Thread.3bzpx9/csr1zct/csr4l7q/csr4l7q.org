  how many chances we had... but failed.

There's a really good point made in [[https://intelligence.org/files/CognitiveBiases.pdf][this MIRI paper]]:

#+begin_quote
  Viewing history through the lens of hindsight, we vastly underestimate the cost of preventing catastrophe. In 1986, the space shuttle Challenger exploded for reasons eventually traced to an O-ring losing flexibility at low temperature (Rogers et al. 1986). There were warning signs of a problem with the O-rings. But preventing the Challenger disaster would have required, not attending to the problem with the O-rings, but attending to /every/ warning sign which seemed as severe as the O-ring problem, /without benefit of hindsight./

In hindsight, the warning signs that the 9/11 attack was coming seem perfectly obvious. However, without hindsight, you have to sift through /every possible warning sign/, distinguishing signal from an enormous amount of noise.

As far as the efficacy of secret police, I point to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celine's_laws#Celine.27s_First_Law][Celine's First Law.]] As any proponent of open source technology can tell you, the "security through obscurity" model is inherently flawed and hopelessly brittle.
