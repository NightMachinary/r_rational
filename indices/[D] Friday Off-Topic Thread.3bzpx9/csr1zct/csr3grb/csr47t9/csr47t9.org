President Roosevelt created it when ge needed an arm which could reach from Washington to a bunch of real-estate and mining moguls who were "raping the west". It's definitely true that sometimes the normal police are inadequate, and also true that a big nation /must/ have some form of counter-spy operations.

But a lot of the problems with the FBI are fixable-fundamental, not unfixable-fundamental, such as the highly localized organization of the regional offices or the shared hatred between them and the CIA. This before you get into incentives like "The intelligence agency never says the threat is over, because then their budget will be cut."

There has to be /a/ solution, some robust system or layout which keeps the agency on track with fredom to do its job.
