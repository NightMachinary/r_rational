It helps me to get my butt in gear when I need something done.

I've used rationalist thinking (I hope it qualifies as rationalist) to plan out what I needed done and to use some Cognitive Science tricks to think of novel solutions and to properly discriminate between my options on their advantages and disadvantages. It's helped me to decide on what I actually want to do with my life (Cog Sci research since that's something easy for me that's actually worthwhile to do with a strong helping of Comp Sci as a secondary options if things fall through) and to improve myself (signing up for Cryo, exercising for better health, and being better at socializing).

I made having a good life my goal and used the rationality I've learned from here and other sources to achieve it.
