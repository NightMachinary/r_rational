personally, there have been a lot of times when i've repeated some-or-another mantra and acted differently in some minor way. for example, there have been many occasions where i've considered bringing one or another small object on a trip, but don't want to have to go through the trouble of finding it; reminding myself of my own time discounting has paid off more than a few times. the litany of gendlin has been useful in fixing several personality flaws, and i think i am generally a much better person now because of it. and so on.

probably more dramatically: i suffered from depression for about half a year, and i'd say that "rationality" -- or in general, the ability to think through consequences relatively dispassionately -- made it significantly easier to resist thoughts of suicide/self-harm. additionally it was various forms of algorithmic introspection that helped me realize that i /was/ depressed, and seek appropriate medication.

i've flitted between online communities before, fairly frequently, and this is the only one that i've felt any sort of real belonging with. it might not be as concrete as "rationality helped me in x way", but i do think that the social consequences are a part of this that's just as important/beneficial as the actual real-world effects. the enjoyment i gain from reading this sub, ssc, lw, and so on is non-trivial.
