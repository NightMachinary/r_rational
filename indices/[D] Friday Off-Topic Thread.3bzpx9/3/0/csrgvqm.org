I've been playing quite a bit of Hearthstone lately (switching between Holy Wrath Giants, Malygos Warlock, and Malygos Freeze Mage). It's a nice, relaxing card game that sometimes feels like a more casual version of Magic: The Gathering (but online, obviously). Europa Universalis is my other go-to computer game, but I haven't touched it in a while. And I bought a season pass for Life is Strange when it came out, but haven't gotten around to playing the most recent episodes yet.

Something like Portal ... you're probably better off looking at indie games, which is where most of the cool, cerebral stuff is happening. Portal had the benefit of having a wicked cool concept, extremely high production values, and good writing, all assembled into a single game. There's not much that matches it, in my opinion. Braid is a wildly different game, but I would suggest it as being similar in the sense that it scratches the same itch.
