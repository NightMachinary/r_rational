My top favorite puzzle games are [[http://polytroncorporation.com/][Fez]], [[http://braid-game.com/][Braid]], and [[http://www.antichamber-game.com/][Antichamber]].

I'm impatiently waiting for [[http://the-witness.net/news/][The Witness]] to come out in a month or two and for [[http://miegakure.com/][Miegakure]] to come out in a few years.

My computer is really slow right now, so I'm sorry I can't summarize what they're about, but the wikipedia articles and game links should be through enough. I recommend getting them on Steam or Humble Bundle.
