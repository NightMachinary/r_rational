I've been reading about the history of the FBI and was shocked at how many chances we had to prevent 9/11 but failed due to incompetence and shortsightedness.

What further struck me is that the organization was morally bankrupt within a few years of its inception. The question I posit to you people, then, is: How do you control a secret police to keep them accountable for their actions and mistakes and actually productively protecting the nation? Clearly, the USA can't do it at all.
