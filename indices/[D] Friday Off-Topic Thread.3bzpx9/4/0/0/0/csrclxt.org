  My big question is if the first step is really necessary. Do you really need above-the-law methods to counter terrorism and spies?

I would say that the answer is no, and that this is the point Celine's First Law was intended to illustrate: as soon as you subvert the principles of a system-- even with the intention of preserving that same system-- everything following from that subversion will also be inherently harmful to the system. Exceptions set precedents, cease to be exceptions, and become policy.

Secrecy is highly conducive to misbehavior. Secret misbehavior will lead to more misbehavior.
