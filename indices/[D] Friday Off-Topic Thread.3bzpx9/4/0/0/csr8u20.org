Let me see, if I understand Celine's First Law correctly: 1. We want "national security", which means a defense against terrorism and foreign spies. 2. We create a secret police, which can use above-the-law methods to counter terrorists and spies. 3. This secret police naturally becomes the primary target of its enemies and quickly corrupt. 4. We need another secret police to police the first one. 5. Reductio ad paranoia.

My big question is if the first step is really necessary. Do you really need above-the-law methods to counter terrorism and spies? You could use a pure intelligence service, which only collects and analyses information but has no right to arrest anybody. The arresting and violent stuff can be left to the normal police. This is pretty much the situation in Germany, but we are in an "unnatural" position due to the second world war.
