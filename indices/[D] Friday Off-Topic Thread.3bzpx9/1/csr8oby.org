I was thinking to grow the readership of [[/r/rational]] it might make sense to cross-post our stories to other places. The author (if they so choose) can link to [[/r/rational]] as a place where the author will engage in discussions. I've spent a little bit of time finding sites that might work and found out there are a huge amount of places to post. I have no idea what the quality of those places is like (though they often assure me they are the largest and best sites heh). Also, having to post to all those different sites would be a massive hassle (especially if you like to edit things after you post). So it might be necessary to develop a simple tool that could upload/edit on all these sites for us (may have to make sure that doesn't violate a EULA or something) in order to reasonably expect authors to go this route. If we go for a truly huge amount of sites, it might even be necessary to have some kind of automated sign up system. Also there may be annoyances involving character limitations.

Anyway here is a list (in no particular order) of places I've found after some searching:

[[https://www.fictionpress.com]]\\
[[http://figment.com/]]\\
[[http://fictionhub.io/]]\\
[[http://www.fanstory.com]]\\
[[http://www.mibba.com/]]\\
[[http://www.protagonize.com/]]\\
[[https://www.scribd.com/]]\\
[[http://www.storiesspace.com/]]\\
[[http://storymash.com/]]\\
[[http://www.textnovel.com/home.php]]\\
[[https://www.wattpad.com/signup]]\\
[[http://www.webook.com/]]\\
[[http://writers-network.com/]]\\
[[http://www.writerscafe.org/]]\\
[[https://www.writersky.com/]]\\
[[http://www.writing.com/?i=1]]\\
[[https://www.bookonlive.com/]]\\
[[http://www.booksie.com/]]\\
[[https://www.authonomy.com/]]

If any of you know much about the quality of any of the listed sites and how useful they would be to us, please reply! Also if anyone has a decent guess of how effective this would actually be, that would be nice to know too haha! I /might/ try my hand at creating a tool if its deemed worthwhile.

edit: also cross-posting to other subreddits might work, does anyone know of some potentially compatible subreddits?

edit: if anyone's comment-shy they can PM me too!

edit: Based on 19283123's suggestions the following subreddits can work depending on the genre of the story:

[[/r/printsf]]\\
[[/r/futurology]]\\
[[/r/YAlit]]\\
[[/r/fantasy]]
