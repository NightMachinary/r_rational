I've posted a few stories and articles to [[/r/printsf]] and there's generally been a good response. Unlike the name says you can post all kind of sci-fi there, and they seem to like the same kind of mature sci-fi [[/r/rational]] does. If the stories are even slightly future related you can post them to [[/r/futurology]]. [[/r/YAlit]] might be a possibility. So is [[/r/fantasy]].
