If you want to level up your imaginary /DEX/ stat in life, I recommend [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mDjFdetU28][/Super Hexagon/]]. There's a free open-source clone called /Open Hexagon/, but due to better level design and the music I prefer Super Hexagon. Where SH is challenging in good way, OH's difficulty goes from /insane/ to /epilepsy hell/.

If you like longer games that aren't just about colorful moving shapes, I recommend /Life is Strange/. Great story about time manipulation.
