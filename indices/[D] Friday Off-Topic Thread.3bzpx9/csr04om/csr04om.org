Rationality in real life.

I know a lot of us here know at least a little bit about rationality and themes associated with it. What I want to know is, beyond discussions and spitballing, can you guys give me some examples of where you've been able to use rationalist (and generally intelligent) methods in life to actually accomplish something, whether that's a Quirrellmort-esque manipulation of someone or figuring your way into your car after locking your keys inside with only a paperclip and 3 rubber bands.

So, anyone have any cool examples of when you've used these sorts of methods to actually accomplish something impressive? Something the layman may have not been able to, because they weren't armed with your way of thinking?

(also, unrelated question for [[/u/alexanderwales]], this isn't really the inaugural post anymore, right? :P)
