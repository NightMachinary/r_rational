The argument is that this very poorly handled transition is a symptom of a larger problem, which is that reddit doesn't seem to care that much about the thousands of moderators that do the bulk of the work involved in running the site, and in general handle communication with the community (their primary commodity) in an asinine way.

But I agree, it still doesn't impact you in the slightest.
