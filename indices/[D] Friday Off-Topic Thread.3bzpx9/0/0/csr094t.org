First, for anyone who is out of the loop, see [[https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/3bw39q/why_has_riama_been_set_to_private/][this post]] and [[https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/3bxduw/why_was_riama_along_with_a_number_of_other_large/][this post]].

I think the mods are generally justified in thinking that reddit as a company has gotten pretty awful about interacting with the community that makes up the lifeblood of this website.

The mods are engaging in a sort of brinksmanship with the admins, trying to get their demands met, but it's impossible to know whether this is going to work, because though the admins have responded, it was the same response that they give every time they fuck something up, which is part of the problem; lots of empty words and promises of vague action.

I think the average user doesn't care, except to the extent that it interferes with their ability to consume content or participate in discussion. It totally doesn't affect this subreddit, which has a low enough traffic volume that the concerns of the default mods are basically moot.
