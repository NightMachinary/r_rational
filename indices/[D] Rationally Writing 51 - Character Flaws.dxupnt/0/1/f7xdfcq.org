You could rape for continuation of species, genetic code, or bloodline. Material gain.

Or you could rape to establish a relationship with someone, which would be a material thing. Like if you beat someone 1v1 (maybe it's wrestling with the goal to penetrate first) you rape them to be dominant sounds like dolphins would do that or maybe some monkeys.

You could rape someone for demoralising which is another material gain. If you're not allowed to kill or (outwardly) physically harm someone then rape can be a good torture technique that has different mental consequences compared to waterboarding

Or if there's some weird magic. You can justify anything with magic.

That's all off the top of my head so I'm sure I missed stuff, but saying all this I'm not sure how often any of these are used to justify a rapist character

Edit : also I'm not sure it indicates complete disregard considering the prevalence of marital rape. Not like people would say all the vows to someone and all the rest and not value them at all. That sounds like making rapists so evil that they aren't real. Like with holocaust practitioners. Reality is a lot of people are would be rapists and murders and they should be aware of it. Just because you value a person doesn't mens you are immune to them saying no.
