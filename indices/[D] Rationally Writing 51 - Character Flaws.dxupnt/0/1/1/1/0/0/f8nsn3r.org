I like the post about conversational norms. So I suppose the question is how much does a conversation about rape need to be contextualized. In my opinion, it requires more than most topics out there, because there's a lot of baggage that comes with the subject, and we can't just pretend it doesn't exist. Even for only the span of a thought experiment.
