Not one of the downvoters, but my take on this is that the comment triggered people's sense of normalization or justification of rape, particularly with regards to the comment about marital rape. In the other examples I don't think RMcD94 meant to do that, they seem to be just listing situations they believe fit the criteria of "times people might rape for material gain," but since the /context/ is acts that can be excused/redeemed from, and most people would not find characters who do those things redeemable, it's getting bucketed.

I'm also aware of a vague signalling concern, as many communities find it valuable to make it clear that certain ideas are not widely accepted in that community, and I can see people downvoting in this circumstance for that reason too. It's at -2 now by my view, which compared to my +12 at least means most people who felt strongly enough to upvote the response refrained from downvoting his, whereas for melmonella's much more assertive claim the downvote ratio is much higher.
