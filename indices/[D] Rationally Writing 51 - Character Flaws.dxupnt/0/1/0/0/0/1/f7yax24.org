  Murder, yes, but rape? I can't think of a single one, outside of someone holding a gun to your head and saying "rape that person or you die," which I would call an absurdly rare circumstance, particularly in the modern day.

Sent to prison, need to show your dominance to the other inmates so they don't fuck with you (and possibly kill you), so you beat up and rape the strongest looking dude around?

Rape is kinda necessary here specifically because it depersonifies the victim.

Alternative is killing them, which seems worse.
