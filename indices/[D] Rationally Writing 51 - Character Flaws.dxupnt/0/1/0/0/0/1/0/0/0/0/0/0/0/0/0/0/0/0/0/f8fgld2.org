Then I don't see how you are arguing my justification rather than my stance? Saying that something "may be true but you're not justified in believing it" requires you to point to something wrong with the reasoning or evidence. To me, bringing up things we don't know does not invalidate anything. It should serve to soften overconfidence, but it is not an actual counter-argument.
