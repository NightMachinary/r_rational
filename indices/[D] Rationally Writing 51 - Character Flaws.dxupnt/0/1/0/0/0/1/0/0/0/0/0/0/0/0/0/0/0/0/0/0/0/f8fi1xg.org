But we're NOT taking that as a given. Or at least I'm not. Again, this conversation's context is fiction, not-specified-but-implied to be largely consumed by a Western audience.

I already acknowledged that it's possible for someone to put a gun to someone's head and say to rape someone or die. This is not a hard thought to have, or a novel one, and I don't find it meaningfully changes with added layers of complexity. Someone could be raised in a family where rape is commonplace. Maybe they're a prince and they're commanded to impregnate a rival kingdom's princess for peace in the realm. Their own safety doesn't even have to come up as a consideration before these decisions might be complex moral conundrums.

But this one, rape-or-be-raped in prison, is not to me persuasive at all. Him claiming that it's necessary, and that murder seems worse, without constructing the scenario more than he did puts the burden on him to justify its necessity, not on me to refrain from expressing my disagreeing view.
