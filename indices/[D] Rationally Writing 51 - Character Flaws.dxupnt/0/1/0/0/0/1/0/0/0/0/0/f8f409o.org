To be clear, the normative statement is this one:

#+begin_quote
  Rape is kinda necessary here
#+end_quote

I'm not objecting out of moral outrage, I'm saying this just isn't true. It's no different than if someone said "If someone kills your crew, you gotta kill them back. Murder is kinda necessary here." I get the perspective that makes this seem true to them, but I don't think it is. I believe there are in fact other options that could achieve the same goals.
