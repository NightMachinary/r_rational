  Right but our bar for murder isn't that they had to do it.
#+end_quote

It sort of is? I'm having trouble thinking of a hero or sympathetic protagonist that murders when they had other choices, given a "realistic enough" setting (so not like a cartoon where there is magically always a safe and risk-free non-killing option) and values that we understand to generally justify "murder" in a martial setting (armies). [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPRlHwwVIug][The closest thing I can think of is something like this,]] which I would argue is reasonably interpreted as self-defense, even if it's not maximally "virtuous."

I don't think the equivocation between murder and rape actually works the way you're describing, especially not for material gain. Murder-for-material-gain is not actually easy to walk back from in fiction. You can murder in self-defense, or to stop someone "evil," but there are not actually many protagonists, even anti-heroes, that are explicitly just murdering for money that are meant to be redeemed. "Sympathetic" is a hard emotion to pin down, but redeemed is much more clear cut, by narrative focus.

  You can absolutely and do absolutely have a choice between rape and death so I won't say rape is a absolute moral wrong. Plenty of historical circumstances in life where someone has to murder or rape to avoid being killed.

Murder, yes, but rape? I can't think of a single one, outside of someone holding a gun to your head and saying "rape that person or you die," which I would call an absurdly rare circumstance, particularly in the modern day.

  You might say that's her choice but if you tell her that and she consents you're pretty much still a rapist.
#+end_quote

If you are the person threatening to kill her, yes, you're still a rapist and no one is going to think that was a moral choice. It may be different if you are both in a circumstance where she recognizes that if she does not get pregnant she'll be killed.
