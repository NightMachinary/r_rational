This thread can go in some weird directions that I don't really want to get into a full discussion about, but I will note that none of the contexts you listed would make me go "Oh okay, I guess they had to rape them, that makes sense."

You're right to bring up non-human animals, as rape is totally commonplace in nature, and it's not a sure bet that any other animal that gains sapience would agree that it's immoral (there are plenty of humans that don't, after all). But those values, generally considered core to what it means to be a civilized and "non-evil" person, are what the hypothetical fictional character is going to be judged by. They might be viewed as solutions by the character in the moment, but in reality they would likely not actually be real solutions, or would not be the ONLY solutions, which immediately removes any potential justification...

...and of course the values that are supposed to justify the behavior have to align too. Most people would not excuse heinous acts for the sake of things like "continuation of bloodline." Some villains get traction out of this, like Cersei Lannister, but she's still undeniably a villain. People who /actually/ do the whole "I don't care how many people die if it means my children are better off" are just regular-ol-monsters, in reality. Practically every dictator could use that justification, and generally would not be "forgiven" for it.

  Or if there's some weird magic. You can justify anything with magic.

This is the only thing that actually might do it, yeah. Magic allows the story to just flat say "If you don't rape this girl she's going to get taken over by some intergalactic monster that destroys the planet," and suddenly it doesn't matter how horrified or sickened the character is, they either bite the bullet or let everyone die. Sad as it sometimes is to not have magic in reality, thankfully things like that can't actually happen and we can say "rape is always wrong" as a fairly solid absolute moral position.
