I'm sort of uncomfortable with the fact that this comment is downvoted into negative territory (by a net four people at time of my reply)? It seems to indicate something like "RMcD94 /shouldn't have talked about rape so blithely/" as opposed to something like "this comment lacks useful information or perspective, or breaks important rules of discourse."

In my culture, the disagreement below still would have happened, but the comment itself would be upvoted (in appreciation for its contribution of counterintuitive perspective) or left alone (if you didn't like it, because it isn't /punish/-worthy).
