I didn't downvote, but I personally feel really uncomfortable reading that conversation. Trying to brainstorm situations where rape might be okay narratively is just...tough.

Rape and murder are not on the same level for a variety of reasons. Think about a comedy skit, like Monty Python. They can joke about killing people and it's funny. Kids shows even have characters attempting murder as a running bit, like Road Runner and Wiley Coyote.

But rape? You can't even jokingly talk about that with a friend. Sexual offenses trigger the "disgust" and "danger" reflexes in most people's brains, and for good reason. Most people won't accidently commit murder just by talking about it. But rape? Make it socially acceptable, or even just joke about it, and some people will do it. Many people /have/ done so for as little provocation as drinking too much alcohol. Rape is also extremely common and there are a lot of victims who might be reading your responses so yeah just...be careful, guys.
