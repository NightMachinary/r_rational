I'd say it's murder, but reading through the section again I can see why you'd remark on the similarity to the Firefly clip you gave. The main difference to me is that in Firefly the threat was "I'll hunt you down and kill you" while in Stormlight it was "I'll take political power", which murder is a significantly greater escalation from.
