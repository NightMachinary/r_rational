Well my step-brother's been in prison for a few years, and is fairly descriptive about it. I won't claim that he knows /all/ prison culture, or that he must share /every/ part of what he knows, but to me the idea that rape might be necessary to survive in prison feels like a stereotype, and a bad one. From what I understand it can be pretty hellish, and absurd, and scary, and dangerous, but it's not a savage free-for-all where you might need to rape-or-get-raped.

Is it /possible/ that someone goes to prison and is forced by circumstance to rape someone to get everyone else to back off? Sure, anything's /possible./ Do I think it's a /probable/ circumstance to worry about finding oneself in, even pre-selecting for people-in-prison? No, not remotely. And if someone were to construct a circumstance where this occurs, do I think that makes the act excusable? I'm not sure. From my privileged non-prisoner-position, I think I'd rather get raped, personally, because I don't think I could go through with it myself and believe I'd be able to recover from the experience better than most others if my alternative methods of retaliation for some reason fail to convince people not to mess with me. Others are free to make their own decision, and I can judge them on that by my own moral standards.

Meanwhile I feel fairly confident standing by the position that, in general, protagonists that rape are very very hard to redeem, in a unique way that protagonists that commit other acts of violence are not.

As for this:

  Also, you're kinda strawmanning away the use of the word "kinda" in the normative statement. Like, the word "kinda" is in there for a reason, and you're objecting to a more absolutist position than anyone was making.

I don't believe I'm strawmanning it at all. The entire comment is pointing to this as an absolute conclusion. The comment doesn't even make sense to me if he's waffling on how necessary it is... the followup sentence "Alternative is killing them, which seems worse" further cements this read of it, to me. "Kinda" here reads as a rhetorical flourish, a way to soften the delivery but not the conclusion. [[/u/melmonella]] can clarify this if they'd like, but otherwise I don't find your read of the words-as-written justified.
