Right but our bar for murder isn't that they had to do it.

Almost everything solved with murder in most stories could be resolved by other means. But we don't think they're bad people.

Indeed "had" can be as lenient as to avoid prison. While we don't decry soldiers as evil those that engage in rape and desolation at the orders of their commanders as part of pillaging are usually seen far worse.

As you say with Cersei the character doesn't have to be good, just for people to be able to empathise with them ever after. Ton of villainous immoral characters we enjoy to empathise with or even root for but never rapists. I was spit balling from the guy who suggested material gain might seem to justify it. I suspect no list like this would work for murder either excluding defence (and yes I think raping someone to stop them raping you would probably get a justice porn type pass if such an unlikely circumstance came about).

You'd need to build up the character, build up the environment, then downplay the event like we usually do for other villainous people we're meant to at least like to read or watch.

You can absolutely and do absolutely have a choice between rape and death so I won't say rape is a absolute moral wrong.

Plenty of historical circumstances in life where someone has to murder or rape to avoid being killed. Similarly if you don't get the Queen pregnant then perhaps she'll be killed. You might say that's her choice but if you tell her that and she consents you're pretty much still a rapist. Telling someone they'll die if they don't have sex with you is rape I'd say even if they consent to it

Wait I just remembered I think the kid from Prince of thorns is a rapist. Though few people like that protagonist.
