Somewhat interesting that AW says that being a thief is such a rare flaw when in WtC, Fenn is a minor kleptomaniac, and Pallida is a major one. Fenn explicitly shoplifts a bunch, and the only real conversation about it was about how useful it is to have so much stuff handy. Pallida hasn't had much chance to show her ability as a thief, but she's obviously proud of it, and she's explicitly rich enough that she doesn't really need to steal much (although her current wealth was probably stolen to begin with...). Again, not really characterized as a flaw by the people around her.

Murder is easier to redeem than rape, because for a lot of reasons that people murder others, the audience can at least sympathize with why someone would be forced into killing someone else, which just isn't true of rape. If someone needs money/resources to survive, or they're seeking revenge, the audience can at least understand what drives someone to murder. But for rape, it isn't done for any material gain, or as comeuppance for a past grievance. It indicates just a complete disregard for the personhood of others, which would be an extreme challenge for any author to attempt to fix, and even harder to do well.
