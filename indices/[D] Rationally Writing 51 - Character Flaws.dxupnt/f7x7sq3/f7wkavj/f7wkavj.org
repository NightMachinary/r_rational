Hey everyone, sorry for the massive delay: it was a pretty crazy summer. Also just an FYI, our Soundcloud account is deactivated, so the podcast is being hosted entirely on Anchor now other than a couple episodes that are allowed for free accounts.

This hopefully does not break anything but direct links to Soundcloud and that rss. Here is the new one:

Enjoy!
