What was the point of bringing up "prison culture?" What did you hope I would consider anew by just pointing out that people in prison are subject to different pressures than those outside it? What /kind of person/ do you expect that argument to persuade?

  You gave LIP SERVICE to the idea that the anecdata not being fully generalizable should undercut your argument, and then proceeded with your argument anyway as if it was not at all undercut.

Because it's not. I was responding to a specific scenario and assertion. You are bringing new considerations into it and insisting that my arguments are failing to account for evidence or circumstances that were not presented.
