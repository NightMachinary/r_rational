Lisbeth Salander from Girl With the Dragon Tattoo does this directly (without the prison or hiring someone else part) and I think most people find her sympathetic, even outright heroic. I think the distinguishing aspect is that "revenge" is a very different motive, and critically, neither circumstance includes the women actually getting pleasure from the rapes: Salander uses a dildo. For most people this removes the possible hidden motive of "they're actually a sadist who just wants an excuse to rape someone," which is a big part of why so many other attempted justifications for rape fall flat.
