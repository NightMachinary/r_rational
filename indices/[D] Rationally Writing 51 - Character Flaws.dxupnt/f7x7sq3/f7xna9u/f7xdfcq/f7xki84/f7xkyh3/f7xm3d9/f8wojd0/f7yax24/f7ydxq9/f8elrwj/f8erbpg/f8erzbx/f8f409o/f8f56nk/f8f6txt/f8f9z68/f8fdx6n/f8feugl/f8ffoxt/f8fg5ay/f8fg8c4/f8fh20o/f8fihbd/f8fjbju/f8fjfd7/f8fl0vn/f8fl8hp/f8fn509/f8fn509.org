Would it help if I just went spread eagle on the floor for an hour to express how /utterly baffled I am/ by what you want from me here, then? I don't see how you can keep insisting that I have a blind spot that I'm not considering thoroughly enough, and when I claim to hold my position despite considering it, insist that you're not arguing my position but my reasoning when you continue to say I'm overconfident.

It just feels like I'm not allowed to reject the example he gave in the confident manner I did, and if it's the confidence you're objecting to then what makes you think I'd be just as confident in different circumstances? From my perspective you keep broadening the circumstances and then ignoring me when I keep pointing to the circumstance I am trying to keep my response restrained to.
