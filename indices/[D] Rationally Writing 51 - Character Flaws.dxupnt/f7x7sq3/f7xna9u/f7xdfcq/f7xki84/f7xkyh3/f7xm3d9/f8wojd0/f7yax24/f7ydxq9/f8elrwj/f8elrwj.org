I feel like you're confusing "I don't believe I would ever see this as necessary" with "there is no reasonable culture or perspective from which someone might justifiably think this is necessary." Or, similarly, "I believe I would always be able to find an alternative, and would absolutely prefer that alternative" with "other people would always be able to find an alternative, and must prefer that alternative."
