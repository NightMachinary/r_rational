I feel like you're ignoring the one part of cultural relativism that's /actually true./ Like, you're looking in from the outside and saying "there are always other options" as if the fact that that's physically true can overwhelm the Orwellian factors that make it genuinely a forced move under some cultural circumstances.

Like, yeah, you're right about other options being /technically/ available, but that's a vacuous point. It's trivially true in /all/ circumstances that other options are possible, no matter /what/ potential actions are under discussion. But in practical reality, the local cultural norms and expectations /matter,/ often so strongly that people literally can't conceive of taking a different path, and also often so strongly that even if they /can/ conceive of it, it's impossible for them to take it.

This is not a point about rape in particular; this is me objecting to the general argument that you're using to refute the point they were making about rape in particular.

Also, you're kinda strawmanning away the use of the word "kinda" in the normative statement. Like, the word "kinda" is in there for a reason, and you're objecting to a more absolutist position than anyone was making.
