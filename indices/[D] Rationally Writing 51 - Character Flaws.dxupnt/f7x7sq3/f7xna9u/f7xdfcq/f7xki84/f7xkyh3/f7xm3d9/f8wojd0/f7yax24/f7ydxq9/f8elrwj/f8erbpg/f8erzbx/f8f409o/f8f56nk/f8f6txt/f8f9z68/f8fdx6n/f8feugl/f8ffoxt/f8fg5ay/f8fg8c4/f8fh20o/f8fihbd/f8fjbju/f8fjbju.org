Am I allowed to not find raping someone in prison to get other rapists to back off irredeemable? Not just allowed in the token sense, I mean if I were to hypothetically hold that position as an absolute, do you think that's a defensible moral position for me to hold, or would I just be failing to properly empathize with someone who has to face hard choices?
