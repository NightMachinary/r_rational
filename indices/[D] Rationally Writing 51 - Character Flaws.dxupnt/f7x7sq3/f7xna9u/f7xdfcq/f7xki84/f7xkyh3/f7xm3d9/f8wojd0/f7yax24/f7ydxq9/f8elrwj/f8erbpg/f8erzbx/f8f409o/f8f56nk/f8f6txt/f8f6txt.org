To be clear again, I'm taking this entire conversation /within the context/ of whether someone's actions are considered redeemable. Maybe our actual disagreement is how much we'll forgive someone for being stuck in localized cultures and expectations, but I would argue that it actually matter that we ARE talking about rape in particular here.

My ideal would be for you to trust that I would not judge someone as irredeemable for murder if they were raised in a culture that made this seem like the only viable option to achieve their goals, while still acknowledging that what was said was in fact said about rape in our society, particularly in our prisons. I don't believe we live in a culture where this is at all "necessary," by any definition.

If you disagree with that, great, we can have that discussion. But really, I do actually understand that this is not a generalized statement about any act, which might be judged less harshly based on the perspective of the person who is in that situation. I pinky promise.
