In general people who make use of the voting system without commenting are useless, especially in discussions and even more so with such a small number of commenter that any functional value of sorting is absent. Who knows why they downvoted but most likely because they saw someone else did it too. Studying how upvotes cause upvotes and downvotes cause downvotes is another way of demonstrating the biases we all struggle to overcome.

Forums would be superior for things like this, usually lacking such things as up votes (though these days a lot have likes as substitutes). But the reddit tree format is better imo.

I'm not sure why someone in the rational subreddit would downvote for blithelyness. At no point did I make any normative statement. It would seem strange to me to feel challenged (offended?) that you'd need to downvote it. But then I don't downvote anyone so what do I know?
