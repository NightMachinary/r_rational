Hmm, I'm not sure that's it. Personally, I think it's partly desensitization and partly on-screen-time. Murder is a lot more common in (American) media than rape. This means we're more used to it -- when the villain threatens to rape the heroine, it's a shock, because it doesn't happen as often. Murder happens in pretty much every action PG-13 movie; rape doesn't even happen in every action R movie.

Secondly, I think rape has a longer lasting effect in terms of screen time. If Bob gets murdered, we might get a funeral scene, depending on when it happens, but a lot of times it happens and then the plot moves on. Rape, however, tends to linger. We show the characters dealing with the trauma and the aftermath. This is partly because rape happens more commonly to main characters (movies rarely kill a main character, unless it's a wise old mentor or something along those lines), which adds to the feeling of irredeemability -- you didn't harm Bob, who we knew for a scene or two, you harmed Jane, who we've followed for half the movie.
