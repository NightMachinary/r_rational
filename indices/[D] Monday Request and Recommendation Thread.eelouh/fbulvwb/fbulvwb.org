League of Legends(LoL) have an interesting lore in that the planet that the whole setting revolves around was created by one divine group(Celestials) to produce living weapons to fight another divine group(Watchers). The planet features a slew of different cultures and magics in addition to bio-punk and magi-tech which suggests to me that the celestials are just trying a bunch of stuff and seeing what sticks. The Watchers seem to have no creativity to create new beings but are adept of analyzing and copying which creates an interesting arms race. I am looking for recommendations of either LoL fanfic that explores this or other fiction that explores how psychology/culture/magic would turn out if mortals were created as weapons.
