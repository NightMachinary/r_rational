i'm not on the sub frequently, but has [[/r/rational]] made a recommendation thread specifically for TV/anime/movies?

at the moment i'm going through star trek: TNG and trying to look past its stiffness and technobabble to see the spirit underneath, but mostly i'm noticing all the wasted opportunities to dig deeper into lore and weirder sci-fi concepts. they also tell way more than they show, and have that bland 90s lighting and camera framing.

i'm not really looking for sci-fi or a star trek replacement, just more rational characters and expectation for the audience to put in some effort (i know i'm talking about TV, a famously low-effort medium, but that's why i wanted to ask [[/r/rational]])
