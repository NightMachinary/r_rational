The prudishness mostly struck me when Hermione was working on the ritual to remove Harry's horcrux. Harry and Ginny are at that point in a relationship for years, they've been on the run in the wilderness. It goes something like Hermione considering that she needs a reverse symbol to the killing elements of the horcrux ritual, mentions sex (as act of childmaking) in a roundabout fashion, then decides that even if it was correct it would be too big a price to ask of Ginny.

Later on Harry and Ginny are soullinked and are said to sleep together... only holding hands of course.

>Especially when most lethal magic has mental effects, and so even if yours doesn't, everyone will assume it does - which does in fact come up on one of the few times Hermione breaks out her lethal arsenal.

It never comes up in a relevant fashion. Especially at the point where the existing power structures are already lost anyway so any supposed reputational damage is irrelevant. They end up killing most of the recurring bad guys (like Bellatrix or that evil research guy) later anyway.

Also Hermione is personally involved in many actions that make no sense, like the warning of muggle-born wizard children. They know she's the only chance to solve their big problems, but she's still exposed in situations that any other muggleborn wizard could handle - much more safely and inconspicuously.

I guess what mainly struck me as the self-hobbling was that in what Hermione herself describes as a war, they take no action that would possibly improve their war situation until Hermione and others are on the run and she starts working on the unhorcruxing ritual. Why did that start so late? But they still get involved in a bunch of risky initiatives of dubious value, Hermione refuses to use any of her advantages to remove Death Eaters, they get in a bunch of fights and lose a bunch of people without even a prospect of achieving anything significant.
