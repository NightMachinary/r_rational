Eh. I read the first two books of The Arithmancer (which cover the canon plot, there's apparently a third one now), and while it's entertaining it feels like it bends over backwards to have the same 'big picture' plot as canon.

I'd say the first book of the series is in general pretty good, even though Hermione is a bit Mary Sue-ish - but at least it's presented in an interesting fashion with the magical research and math stuff.

But the second book just falls apart halfway when the full war erupts. The characters hobble themselves in incredible ways to balance out the fact that Hermione is OP as fuck, and this leaves them acting in silly and unbelieveable ways. Like, Hermione builds up a ridiculous arsenal, they're on the run, and they still proceed to fight nonlethally against opponents going for the kill.

The book is also ridiculously prudish in a way that becomes plot relevant at one point - but maybe that's just hosting requirements on ff.net
