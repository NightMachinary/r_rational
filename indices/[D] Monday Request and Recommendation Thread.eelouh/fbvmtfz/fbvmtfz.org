I read The Arithmancer and its sequels, based on a rec from here, and really enjoyed them. One thing I liked was that it felt like /Harry Potter, but with consistent worldbuilding and intelligent, interesting characters/. (I actually liked both Ginny and Ron and found Harry/Ginny believable in them, which was a huge surprise.) Contrast with MoR, which for all its virtues is a crack fic. Are there other good fics in this vein? Enormous bonus points if someone has done this for any of Garth Nix's series.

To try to give more examples; Naruto fics. This is harder to articulate since I haven't read/watched most of canon, but Time Braid is pure crack, Waves Arisen is on the crackier end, and Chiaroscuro and Team Anko are on the opposite, "played straight" end.
