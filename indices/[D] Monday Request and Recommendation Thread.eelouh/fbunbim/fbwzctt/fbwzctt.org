[[http://neorice.com/hoh_noah_222][Hero Oh Hero]] is a comic about three protagonists in the same world: Burk, Noah, and Tobi. This link takes you to only exploring the Noah story, but the author does intend you to read [[http://neorice.com/hoh_1][all three perspectives.]]

Noah is a highly apathetic protagonist. His friends tell him to try. His superiors force him to try. His superpower encourages him to try. But he still only does the bare minimum.

The comic deals with social fallout from his apathy (as well as neurodivergent traits, probably aspergers and prosopagnosia)

This is an outside POV comic, so it doesn't narrate the character's thoughts, but we can still know his value system: wholesome but defeatist.
