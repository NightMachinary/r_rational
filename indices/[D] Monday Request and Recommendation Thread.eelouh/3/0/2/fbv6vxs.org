As [[/u/redrach]] says that have been incoorporated in the new lore. Watchers are being that existed in the void before the Celestials' Reality existed and convinced Lissandra to let them enter Reality because appearently mortal consent from one person is enough to let them invade Reality? I am kind of suspicious about the whole 'corruption' thing because it's really vague what it means.

In general I feel that there's a lot of weirdness happening that I would like explained.
