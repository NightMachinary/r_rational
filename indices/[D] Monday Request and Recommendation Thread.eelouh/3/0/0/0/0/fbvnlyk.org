The Watchers want to completrly annihilate all of reality and return to their eternal slumber in the Void. The Celestials would probably be satisfied with sealing all the Void breaches and ensuring the Watchers can never find a way back.

It's interesting how both sides are using each others' actions to gain a foothold in the conflict - the Watchers created the Voidborn by modifying Runeterran creatures and then champions like Kai'sa and Kassadin use Void energies to fight back. Those are probably the Celestial's best hope after the failure of the Darkin.
