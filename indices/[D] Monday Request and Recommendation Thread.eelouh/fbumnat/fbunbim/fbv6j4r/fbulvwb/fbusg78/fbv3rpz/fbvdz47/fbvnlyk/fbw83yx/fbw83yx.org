What I meant was that it's unclear to me how either side could win, not what they want. If the Celestials want powerful weapons Lissandra can already beat multiple Watchers so why don't they just clone her and send an army of those into the void to fight? Or something like it.

I do think that the Watcher motivation is a little flimsy. If they got woken up by a sudden window into Reality, why can't they just close the window and go back to sleep? Instead they continually poke holes into Reality. I feel you could strongman them in interesting ways like maybe they are morally opposed by the number of death in Reality or maybe Reality existing somehow is painful to them/threatens their lives.
