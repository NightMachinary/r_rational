All that is still in the lore. I found this useful to get a quick overview of the current lore [[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=X4gKkYZ7rIA]]

The main difference between the new lore and the old is that they've removed the concept of the games being a representation of a proxy war fought between various factions via the Institue of War. They've replaced that with the eternal war between the Celestials and the Watchers as the new overarching storyline.
