"Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" has a free website, so your money might be better spent elsewhere: [[https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter1/]]

Also if you have the mental muscle I'd recommend a more traditional computer science book, Automate is more vague about concepts and definitions than standard.

Edit: I got the Automate book and quickly realized that to follow along well you need to be on a computer at the same time anyway, so you might as well just split screen the book with your editor as opposed to having it open next to your keyboard.

Here's also some interesting interactive python lessons I've seen recommended but haven't tried out: [[https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-Jupyter-Notebooks]]
