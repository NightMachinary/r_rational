Here's a weird one. I got some amazon credit for Christmas and I'm looking for textbook recommendations! Do any of you out there have recommendations for me in the fields of (big ones) ecology, molecular biology, evolutionary biology, chemistry, physics, linguistics, and (small ones) paleontology, phylogenetic systematics, comparative anatomy. Or any other science of which you think I am too ignorant!
