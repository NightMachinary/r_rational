I'd like to recommend something a little different: the books of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Smullyan][Raymond Smullyan]]. Wikipedia calls him a "American mathematician, magician, concert pianist, logician, Taoist, and philosopher," which sounds about right.

The two books I'd try out are [[http://www.cronksite.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/SmullyanGC.pdf][The Tao is Silent]] and [[https://archive.org/details/WhatIsTheNameOfThisBook/page/n1][What is the Name of This Book?]]. The former is a light but worthwhile take on eastern philosophy and specifically Taoism. The second is a book of riddles, mostly focused on logic games.

I'd also like to suggest that, if you have an interest or inclination, and if you're looking for something somewhat productive to do over the holiday, consider starting to learn programming. I know this is common advice these days, but I'd recommend starting out by exploring the space at your own pace than by making some big choice to learn it and get a job in the field. Programming is an amazing professional skill, but it's also a satisfying discipline suited to those who think logically and systematically but who also care about meaning and expression. Like writing and speaking, it's a flexible skill that can be applied in many professional and personal situations, and like speaking and writing, the things you do with programming tend to be able to scale. It can also be a lot of fun.

Python is an increasingly popular and highly readable language that is extensively used in both data science and creating apps for the web. Years ago I started out by working through a book, /Learn Python the Hard Way. I'd recommend buying */Learn Python 3 the Hard Way**, since Python 2 just got retired. After starting out with Python, I also got into Lisp and the Emacs text editor, but maybe I'll recommend those in more detail another week.
