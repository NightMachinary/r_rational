I am looking for an apathetic protagonist and was wondering what would happen if you mix rationality with apathy.

/Can you be rational whilst being apathetic?/

/Will this character try at all costs to "cure" his apathy and would want to feel emotions? Or will he rationalize that it is quite impossible? Does he even want to feel emotions or create bonds with people/

If you know of any piece of fiction that explores apathy, do recommend.

Thanks :)
