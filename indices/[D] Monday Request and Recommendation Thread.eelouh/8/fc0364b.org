Is there anything similar to [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28396/beastborne][Beastborne]] where the protagonist:

- doesn't pick a fight with /every/ enemy he sees and easily wins
- actually treats monsters like people, if they behave like people

I'm looking for a rational fantasy where the world is dangerous, and the protagonist can't roll through every encounter as if they're synced perfectly to his level. I want some real obstacles. And preferably, I want the world to have some depth, where monsters aren't always bloodthirsty and 100% evil.
