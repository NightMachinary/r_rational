Has anyone read the John Wayne Cleaver series, by Dan Wells? Not because it is particularly "rational", but precisely because it isn't---when I finished the second-to-last book, I was really sharply struck by something that a rational protagonist would never do, and that I thought was actually really /wrong/ and a bad idea. I have an idea of what might happen instead, but I've never written...anything really, fiction or non-, fan- or otherwise...so I can't write it myself. (More accurately, I don't care /nearly/ enough about seeing it written to do the years of necessary work to become skilled enough to do it justice.) So I thought I'd post the idea here, no strings attached, in case anyone wanted to take it and run with it. If this isn't the right place (would the Wednesday thread be better?), I can repost it somewhere else.

Massive spoilers follow, obviously:

So at the end of /Over Your Dead Body/, John goes to take Brooke back home so she can enter therapy. And like, yeah, she's in a bad state, and being on the road is not good for her, and John is not skilled enough to really take care of her. But despite all that, the first thing that went through my head is, "Marci is going to be /piiiiiiiiiiisssssed/ when she wakes up." And I kept waiting for that to come up all throughout the last book, and it just...didn't, and I was really disappointed.

Because the thing is, John /outright admits/ that Brooke going through therapy is probably going to /have as a goal/ the integration and/or suppression of the personalities from Nobody's memories, meaning that if it succeeds, Marci will be gone forever. John forces himself to believe that she's already dead, and the right thing to do is let go and move on---but I don't think so. Nobody's weird magic seems to have created pretty damn high-fidelity copies of all the people she inhabited over her life---high-fidelity enough that I would come down on the side of "getting rid of them without trying to see if there's a way to save them is more-or-less murder".

So the fic I'm imagining runs in parallel with /Nothing Left to Lose/, with /Marci/ (and secondarily Brooke/Nobody/etc.) as the protagonist. The opening scene is probably the aforementioned Marci-waking-up-and-being-pissed---the first time her personality comes to the fore back in Clayton, and she finds out what John did. And the thing is, based on evidence in the book, she's _smart_---as smart as John, just with different strengths. So the core point of divergence for the fic is that Marci is, while not a card-carrying transhumanist, familiar with some of those ideas---leading to my conclusion, above, that "curing" Brooke means killing morally-relevant entities, including herself. But of course none of the people around her agree, and she's not in any kind of state to make things happen the way she wants.

Obstacles:

- She's under involuntary psychiatric care by people who consider her presence a disease, and consider her mentally ill and not a valid source of information. (They don't realize/are unwilling to admit that "her" is the wrong pronoun---it should be plural-they, and while Brooke and Nobody legit are mentally ill, Marci is entirely stable as far as we know in canon.)

- Also, she's under constant observation, so "passing notes" to communicate with the other personalities without being seen isn't going to be possible, nor is keeping notes of thoughts/plans.

- Some of the other personalities don't share her views---Brooke could probably be persuaded around if it weren't driving /her/ insane, Nobody might go with it for the lulz but is also super unstable, and most of the other personalities are from a long time ago and just don't have the relevant ideas.

- She doesn't have control of their body all or even most of the time, or even when she wants to---though she /does/ seem to have the ability to hold onto control for longer than any of the others, and it's been hinted that she can be /given/ control if they're in a situation that one of the others is scared of.

- The FBI might be able to help in various ways, but they're pretty goddamn incompetent and resistant to listening to "kids" in the first four books, and now they're also pissed at John, and what Marci wants is going to look like something John might want too...

So, Arc 1 is finding a way to not have her psych doctors trying to "cure" Brooke in a conventional sense and actually /talk/ to her. She needs to, in some order:

- Find a clever way to communicate with the other personalities and get some of them on board. (I'd love to see the Regina personality again, the scene with her and John talking /about/ Marci was really powerful.)

- Gain a sympathetic ear among her treaters---probably unofficially at first, a new therapist or aide, someone not in charge, who says something that suggests they might listen and she goes for it and they do.

- Leverage that into some kind of in with the FBI and get them to lay things out more clearly to the doctors that this is /not/ conventional DID.

- Also get the FBI actually thinking about the implications of the Withered even being /possible/.

But at this point things still suck, because we still have a whole bunch of personalities at various levels of stability and completeness stuck in one body. Arc 2 is figuring out how to fix /that/, and here is where things get real hazy.

More or less the only thing that comes to mind is to wonder how the ritual that made the Withered works, because dude, if actual fucking magic is possible, there are some serious unexplored possibilities. Two problems, though:

1. The books clearly don't intend for it to make sense---the rules are explicitly super fuzzy and don't seem to be part of any larger system or structure---so coming up with a believable explanation is a lot of work.

2. That ritual in particular is pretty much a deal with the Devil and more or less guaranteed to screw over the caster---using it directly, while tempting, is extremely stupid.

But first, how do we get there? One possibility is that Marci /almost/ has the FBI convinced that they should be trying to find a way to save her/Regina/etc. when they get the call that they've cornered Rain (at the end of /Nothing Left to Lose/). They make the call that they have to put an end to this, Marci freaks out and almost despairs but decides to sneak along with them somehow (maybe the abovementioned sympathetic ear?)...and then the ending scene there happens, exactly as it does in canon, except that when Rain agrees to try to do better and John agrees to help her, Marci gets to walk in and be like, "actually, you might be able to fix some of what you did---not all, but the part where a few hundred women are stuck in my body anyway".

Or, it could be that Marci isn't far enough along to even know about the thing with Rain when it happens, but she finds out, I dunno, a few weeks to a couple months later and is like "holy shit they dodged a bullet there"---and when in canon the FBI agent just tells John that Brooke is doing well, instead she's /with/ him with more or less the same proposal as above.

In either case, maybe it would be best if the story just ended there, without exploring /how/ that's going to happen, because of the abovementioned issue of having to come up with the entire theory of magic. But I can also imagine being dissatisfied with that, because, well, unexplained thing, right?

I dunno, I think that's all I've got right now. If anybody cares enough to want to do something with it, I'd be happy to bounce ideas back and forth.
