I'd recommend the anime Hyouka. It's the story of an apathetic teenage boy who's sole goal is to exert the least amount of "energy" and effort possible. His apathy/lust for laziness is only really affected when outside forces cause him to be convinced that doing work is easier than fighting the outside forces.

The anime falls under the slice of life/mystery genre. It's created by KyotoAni so the visuals are absolutely gorgeous.
