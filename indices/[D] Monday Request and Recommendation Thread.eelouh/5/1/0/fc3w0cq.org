It's not prima facie irrational to fight nonlethally. Especially when most lethal magic has mental effects, and so even if yours doesn't, everyone will assume it does - which does in fact come up on one of the few times Hermione breaks out her lethal arsenal.

What's an example of hobbling other than that one?

(Also, I read it on Ao3 and didn't particularly notice the prudishness you mention.)
