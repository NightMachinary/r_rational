It only took three-ish months and about five different rewrites, but Chapter 4 is finally done. Hopefully my work on Orders of Magnitude gives credibility when I say that I have the full story written out in my head, and it will be finished within the year.

Oh, by the way, spoiler alert: Twilight Sparkle dies.
