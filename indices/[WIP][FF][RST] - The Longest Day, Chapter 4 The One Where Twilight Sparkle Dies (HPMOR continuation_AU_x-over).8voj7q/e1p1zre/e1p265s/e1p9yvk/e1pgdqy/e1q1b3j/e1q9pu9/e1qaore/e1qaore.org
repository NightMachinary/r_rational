It's a fair point about Dumbledore's characterization. I felt like the HPMOR-version of Dumbledore was played a bit too clueless for my liking, so in this universe, he's more savvy than Harry initially gives him credit for.

Also a fair criticism re: the lower stakes. Part of that was by necessity: there was suspense in the original HPMOR because you weren't actually sure if Harry would be able to bring back Hermione. But the canon ending explicitly introduces an afterlife into the universe. So any continuation/AU-fic either has to do some pretty serious ret-conning, or has to work within those limitations.

From a literary perspective, I'm hoping to build suspense via HOW Hermione gets resurrected, rather than WHETHER she gets resurrected. Whether I'll succeed at that, well, that's up to you as the reader.

That said, I did want to address two minor points directly:

1. The limitation of the Stone was taken directly from the ending of HPMOR.
2. If you do happen to stick around and read the work in its entirety, hopefully it will convince you that it is quite decidedly NOT pro-death.
