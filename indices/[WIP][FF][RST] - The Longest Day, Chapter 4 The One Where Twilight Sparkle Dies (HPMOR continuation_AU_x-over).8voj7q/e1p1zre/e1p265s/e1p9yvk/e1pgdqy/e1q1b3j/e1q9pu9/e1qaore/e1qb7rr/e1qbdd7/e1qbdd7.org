Double checking the math real quick... In Ch 119 it says, "/Experiment had showed that the Stone made one Transfiguration permanent every three minutes and fifty-four seconds/". 3 minutes, 54 seconds = One use of the stone per 234 seconds. One day = 86,400 seconds. 86,000 / 234 ~= 367 uses of the stone per day.
