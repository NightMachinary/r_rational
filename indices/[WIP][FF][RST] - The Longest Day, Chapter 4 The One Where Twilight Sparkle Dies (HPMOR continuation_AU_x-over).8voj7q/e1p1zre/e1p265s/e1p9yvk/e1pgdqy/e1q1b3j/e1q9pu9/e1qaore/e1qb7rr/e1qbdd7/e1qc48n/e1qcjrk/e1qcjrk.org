There already WAS a concrete mechanism for it. Hermione's brain was preserved by the cooling charm, and the human mind/soul is one of the main functions of the human brain. It just needed to be defrosted and given life energy from Harry's patronus charm.

When Harry says he doesn't believe in souls, what that basically amounts to is that he doesn't believe in an afterlife or in peope being just some supernatural "essence" or "spark". But let's not forget that what laypeople know as the heart/soul and the mind, neuroscience just refers to as system 1 (automatic system) and system 2 (intentional system). They use the word mind to describe the whole thing, and that is very misleading to a layperson.
