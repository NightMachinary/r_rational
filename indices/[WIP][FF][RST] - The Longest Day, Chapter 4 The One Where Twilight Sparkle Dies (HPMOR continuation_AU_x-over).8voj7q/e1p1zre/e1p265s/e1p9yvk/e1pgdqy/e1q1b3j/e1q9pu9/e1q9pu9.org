Dumbledore felt a bit ooc in this chapter. It felt kind of forced. The limitation on the philosopher's stone felt like it was pulled out of thin air. If the philosopher's stone embodies all of transfiguration then there is no good reason for it to be limited to less than a few hundred transformations per day. It would make more sense if all transfigurations everywhere drew from the power of the stone, and whatever unused power is leftover would be from worlds with a very small or inefficient population of magic users. The available power should vary depending on how much magic is being used for transfiguration at any given time. And that should still leave a hell of a lot of power left. More than enough to grant immortality to everyone on Earth including muggles.

The explanation of "the stone is a threat to statute of secrecy" is good enough. Why not just go with that and leave out all the extra unnecessary stuff? Instead of constructing this unbelievably complicated hypothetical dystopian future in order to justify an unrealistically fair and just status quo. Also, your portraying someone like Dumbledore in this way doesn't make sense at all. It's flat out denying the cultural divide between wizards and muggles and between Harry and Dumbledore which was brought up in "Pretending to be Wise part 2". In doing so you've also eliminated at least a couple of Dumbledore's main character flaws/blind spots.

Your explanation should basically just boil down to "a muggleborn will break statute of secrecy by revealing the stone 's existence to muggles => a muggleborn will try to transfigure a bunch of subatomic particles. The end."

Combined with the existence of an afterlife in this story, the stakes are much lower than they were in the original HPMOR. it's much harder to care as much about whether Hermione is brought back to life or not because she's STILL ALIVE and has been this entire time, just transported to an an alternate plane of existence.

Sorry, but this story reads a LOT like pro-death apologism and social modesty trying to masquerade as transhumanism and rationality.

Your writing is good quality, but I think you might be trying to appeal to the wrong audience.
