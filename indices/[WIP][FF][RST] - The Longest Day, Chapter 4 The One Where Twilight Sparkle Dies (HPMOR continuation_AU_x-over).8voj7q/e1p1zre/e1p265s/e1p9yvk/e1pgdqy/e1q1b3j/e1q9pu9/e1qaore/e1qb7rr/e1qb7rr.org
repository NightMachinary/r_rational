Okay so maybe I'm just getting a bit confused about the math involved here. I thought the limitation in canon HPMOR was higher because Harry explicitly states that it could be used for all muggles too as well as all sentient magical creatures. The canon reason he doesn't do this is not because the stone isn't capable of it, it's because it would require breaking the statute of secrecy, and then some muggleborn tries to transfigure subatomic particles and destroys the universe.

Also, Dumbledore wasn't unrealistically clueless, he had very particular realistic blindspots due to his upbringing. There are many MANY instances in real life of geniuses as brilliant as Dumbledore making exactly that kind of moronic mistake in reasoning, especially outside their area of expertise.

Canon HPMOR DID NOT have an afterlife. What are you talking about?
