I agree that Dumbledore wasn't /unrealistically/ clueless. The cluelessness perfectly fit his characterization in HPMOR. With this story, I'm trying to explore a much darker side of Dumbledore, the side of Dumbledore who almost took over the world with Grindelwald for the "greater good", which has necessitated reframing some of Dumbledore's flaws from the original canon. Rather than being blissfully ignorant, he's painfully aware but chooses to act otherwise.

As for an afterlife in the original canon, maybe that's not the best word for it. But Hermione died, then she came back to life. Part of what I'm aiming to do with this story is provide a concrete mechanism for that resurrection.

Hopefully I'll achieve those aims, but I'll let you be the judge of that!
