Incidentally, this is a passage from the most recent chapter that ended up on the cutting room floor during the editing process.

/It all came back to these Elements, whatever they may have been, and the two battling figures who now took the form of two wolves, one black, and one white./

/The black one spoke, wistfully. 'It's almost poetic. One hundred billion lives lost, one hundred billion stars."/

/The white wolf tore at the black, to no avail. "The rules, damnit. Remember the rules! Rule 34: There are gates you do not open, there are seals you do not breach!"/

/The black wolf deflected the blow. "You should know me better than that. Since when have I ever truly followed the rules? This is simply..."/

/The black wolf snapped its jaws shut, and the neverending chorus of a multitude of stars going nova at once rang across the blackness./

/"Technique," it finished./

/The Professor broke eye contact with her, and was breathing faster now. "Are the elements absolutely necessary? Do I need them to stop this darkness?"/
