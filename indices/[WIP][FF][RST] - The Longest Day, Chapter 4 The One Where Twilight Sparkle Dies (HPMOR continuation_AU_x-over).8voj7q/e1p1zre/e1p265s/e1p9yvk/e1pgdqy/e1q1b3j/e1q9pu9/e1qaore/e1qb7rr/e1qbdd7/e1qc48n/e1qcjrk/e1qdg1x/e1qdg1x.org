I actually like this Dumbledore a lot more than the Dumbledore presented in HPMOR canon. However, as [[/u/Sailor_Vulcan]] says, HPMOR sufficiently explains Hermione's resurrection without requiring a soul. It's consistent with a soul existing, but you don't need that assumption.

Now, it seems to me that MLP canon (e.g. dreamwalking, the Realm of Ascension) points much more toward ponies having souls, so you probably made the best choice for this crossover. Still, this'll be a huge shock to Harry when he finds out!
