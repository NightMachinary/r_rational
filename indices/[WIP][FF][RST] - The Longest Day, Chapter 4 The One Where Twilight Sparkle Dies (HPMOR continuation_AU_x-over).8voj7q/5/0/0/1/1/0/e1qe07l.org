    It's consistent with a soul existing, but you don't need that assumption.

Agreed. I mentioned this in a reply to [[/u/Sailor_Vulcan]] but a better way to say what I'm trying to do is /exploring/ the mechanism of revival, moreso that /creating a new one/.

As for the question of "souls", I don't want to spoil things, but I'll say this: Hermione's memory isn't /perfect/, and Godel Escher Bach is a reaaaaaaly long book.
