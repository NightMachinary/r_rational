I think Cat explained this last chapter. Not only has she been stealing powers from her enemies for a long time, both through *Take* as the Squire and later as the Sovereign of Moonless Nights, but she has also had Akua's tutelage (a Wasteland master of the profane arts), and now she is the High Priestess of a religion who's central tenets involve killing and stealing from enemies, not a mention a direct connection to the Goddesses of that religion who have been skilled in it for a millennium and set this whole thing up to begin with.

So yeah, taking from your enemies is one of the core mechanics of the Night, so it's no big surprise Cat can do it as well.

As for the Thief thing I've got no clue. Could very well be a trap, we'll see.
