So how does Cat steal Name abilities again? She had /Take/ when she was still the Squire, but it's been mentioned more than once that she no longer has a Name. Is she simulating it using the Night, seeing how they're both quite similar in nature? Or is it part of her overall legend considering how her cloak of souls is her most famous artifact.

And is Thief of Star's missing aspect a clue or a red herring? Maybe the crowns are the obvious bait, and what the trap is the aspects that Cat is taking. From two Revanents, she only had the two choices from Thief of Stars, the escape one and the rarity one. The escape aspect seems like a trap, since it'll likely take her out of a jam straight into somewhere Plot relevant, because that's how stories work.
