If Nessie is correct, and Cat really does have a bad case of immortality, she might have gotten theft powers of her own independent of Night. Her associations and tutelage wouldn't hurt to make it easier/possible, though. It just all coalesces into whatever she is now.

The old Goblin warcry of 'stab the kidney, loot the corpse' doesn't really lend itself to a Name, but it's pretty much been one of the central themes of her story. Some sort of mugging ability for Aspects or other's power (fae, god, whatever) might remain even if she were completely stripped of Night and connection to Sve Noc.
