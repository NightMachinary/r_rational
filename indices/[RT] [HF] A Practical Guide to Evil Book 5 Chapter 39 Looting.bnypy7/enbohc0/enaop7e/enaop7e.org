This AND a new MoL? What a night!

Lots of stuff being set up here for later. Hopefully we get to see Tyrant vs Rogue Sorcerer next chapter.

But by far one of the best things is the explicit return to Name-abilities. This was one of my favorite parts of the earlier story, and I'm glad that Cat is returning to it!
