Thank you for answering this.

I was thinking Procer was behind the ritual since they were the only ones that could influence the caravan routes thereby creating the blood spill in the required locations. If this was indeed Tyrant's work, how did he accomplish the changing caravan routes? The caravans were sent from Procer to Nicae.

Also I have another post about doubt in pgte. Would appreciate if you could have a look at it.
