Thoughts on 1., the height: for myself at the moment (also remembering poorly) I'm unsure what the height-related ritual should have done, and whether it itself was a smokescreen to blind the Black Knight to the real intention (the story effect of Captain being the one carrying out the killings). However, whether the ritual itself was relevant or not, here was the relevance of height as I understood it:

Normally there might be a handful of deaths or diggings or actions that make no sense to you, but then you get to see it all from a bird's-eye view (on a map or on a flying carpet or similar) and you realise "Ah! It all makes a crucial pattern!".

Here, it's a spell formula: normally, if you have these things taking place at the right points relative to each other in reality as seen when projecting them on a 2D plane with the z-axis (height) flattened, their relative positionings allow a certain effect to be had (even if one position is higher than another). The twist here is that instead of flattening the height direction, you're flattening a different direction, so that if you look at the points from the right position to the side (far away) you can see how they make a certain pattern that you would normally expect to see from a bird's-eye view. Think of how constellations can look very different from a different star's planet, if far away enough from the star's planet you're comparing the view to.
