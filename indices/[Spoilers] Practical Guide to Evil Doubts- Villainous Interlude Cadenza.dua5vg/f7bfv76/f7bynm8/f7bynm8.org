This chapter doesn't talk about story as a weapon except /briefly/ mentioning narrative structure as one of Bard's potential restrictions.

It is possible that the idea of tricking your opponents into a story that ends with their death was introduced later in the serial; Black doesn't explicitly consider narrative based attacks here, though.
