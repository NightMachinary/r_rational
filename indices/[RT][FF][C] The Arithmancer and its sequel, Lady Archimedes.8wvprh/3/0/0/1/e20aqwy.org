Hermione tried exploiting the Taboo a couple times when Hermione bound her tongue. They got a few Death Eaters, but - like you said - they knew it wouldn't keep working.

And once you can't summon enemy troops to your location by the Taboo, a whole lot of your other ideas also fail.

I won't say Hermione was flawless - she should never have been in the raid on Malfoy Manor, and at the very least she shouldn't have brought her notes with her - but that isn't a problem.
