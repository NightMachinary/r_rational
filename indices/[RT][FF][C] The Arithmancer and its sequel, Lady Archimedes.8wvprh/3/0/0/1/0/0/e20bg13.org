The Imperius plan evidently wouldn't work, because if it did then someone else - like Voldemort - would've exploited it already.

Carbon monoxide (or some other poisonous gas) is an interesting idea; Hermione [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11463030/31/Lady-Archimedes][did try a variant on it after Fifth Year]]. I'm not sure why she didn't try it again, but perhaps she thought they'd have precautions, or - more likely - they might, and the damage caused by failure if they did would be too large?
