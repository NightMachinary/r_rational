  The Imperius plan evidently wouldn't work, because if it did then someone else - like Voldemort - would've exploited it already.

Ah, of course. If no one notices something that could work, then clearly it must not work, because that's totally not the definition of a plot hole.

  Carbon monoxide (or some other poisonous gas) is an interesting idea; Hermione did try a variant on it after Fifth Year. I'm not sure why she didn't try it again, but perhaps she thought they'd have precautions, or - more likely - they might, and the damage caused by failure if they did would be too large?

And if someone does something that works, never doing it again also makes perfect sense. Especially if she (I think) uses it in combat the first time, doing it in a controlled environment is definitely less safe. Especially if it's never mentioned again.

I'm not saying this a horrible story. I'm saying it's not rational and does not belong on this subreddit.
