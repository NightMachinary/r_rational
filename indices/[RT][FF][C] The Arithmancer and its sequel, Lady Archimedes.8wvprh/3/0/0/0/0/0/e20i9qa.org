The death eaters aren't idiots in this series. Sure, Voldemort has gone mad from all the horcruxes he made, but he still retains a reasonable facsimile of his once great intellect. There are also death eaters that are shown to be genuinely competent, and even smart. Such as Barty Crouch Jr., Rookwood, and Bellatrix (although she is probably even more crazy than Riddle.)

Hermione did use gas at least once, as far as I can remember. Anyway, she does have gas canisters, or even transfiguration as an option, but as with every other tool, it has limitations. It can be swept away with wind, or maybe just force manipulation. Countered with a bubble head charm, or similar. And they rarely fight in an enclosed room anyway. And getting time to prepare is a luxury they have only gotten a couple of times.

And they're not trying to murder all their enemies. They're trying to murder Voldemort, everyone else is just in the way. Killing Voldie would take a lot more than just a grenade or a sniper rifle (which they actually tried at one point, the guy who used it got his hands ruined by a preset curse, and Voldie was unharmed.)

They try multiple ways of killing him, but the ritual is the thing that does him in. They had other plans for if that didn't work. But it seemed like it was their best option.

The taboo is still a threat. It breaks through any conventional wards, and pinpoint your location. If the first couple gets taken out, they can just send in more from farther away and be more cautious, and the dark side outnumber the light by a massive margin.

So no, it isn't easy to topple an immortal dark overlord.
