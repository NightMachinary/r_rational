God, the first book was okay but the second one jacked her off so bad I'm surprised she can still walk straight. Seriously, she became such an incredible Mary Sue I couldn't take it any longer and stopped in the late 60's I think?. I mean, fucking barbed wire = WOW SHE'S SUCH A COOL SCARY GENIUS SHE'S SO AWESOME FOR USING A BASIC PIECE OF MILITARY EQUIPMENT AND APPLYING IT

Not to mention the plot holes you could drive a truck through in regards to her fucking up the war effort (by ignoring all viable solutions) in a way that would make HJPEV cringe.
