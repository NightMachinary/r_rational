yep, she announced a spin-off, but the 7 years are finished, and the plot was summed up nicely. There are definitely pacing problems, but without professional editing, that is probably just to be expected. Fortunately, I stumbled upon it like 2 months ago, so I binged up to the last battle, then waited for updates.
