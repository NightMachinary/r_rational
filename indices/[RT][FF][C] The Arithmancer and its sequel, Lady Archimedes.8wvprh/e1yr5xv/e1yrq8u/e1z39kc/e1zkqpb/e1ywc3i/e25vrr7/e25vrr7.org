I tried reading another work of this author's, the Accidental Animagus, up until the reveal in book 4 that yes there is an afterlife, none of the characters ever really died! It doesn't matter anymore what will happen to the characters because their perfect happy ending is already spoiled! It sucked the dramatic tension right out of the story and I couldn't keep reading.

Does the same thing happen in the Arithmancer? Please tell me it doesn't.
