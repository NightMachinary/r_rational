Ending the war in half an hour? Sniper rifles, imperious, the fucking taboo is a 100% guaranteed way of getting enemy soldiers where you want them. Get them into a landmine infested hellscape with anti-apparition wards out the wazoo with toxic gas and flash bangs and all manner of traps to make sure they're not getting out again. Hell, get yourself a hazmat suit, fill a room with mustard gas and /then/ see how they like sending troops to your location. Then say the taboo again and again and again to decimate their forces in mere minutes.

All of which she didn't use because.... apparently she wanted to fight fair or something retarded like that.
