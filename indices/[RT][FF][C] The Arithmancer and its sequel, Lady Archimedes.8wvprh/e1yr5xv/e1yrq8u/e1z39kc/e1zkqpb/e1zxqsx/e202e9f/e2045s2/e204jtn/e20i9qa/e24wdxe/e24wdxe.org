I gave up on this fiction when she got captured in Malfoy manor (like in canon). If the death eaters aren't stupid, that's game over.

I tried to start again yesterday there, but they were still using stunner spells in this situation. A stunned enemy is one enervate from killing you away. This isn't how one wins any fights where one doesn't have massive superiority. So she (presumably) only wins the fight because of author fiat.
