Okay. Follow me on this bit of idiocy. She can transfigure things like crazy right? Huge amounts of whatever so long as it's not too complex?

Take Harry's invisibility cloak. Walk into the ministry. Either A. Imperious everyone who walks by and end the war in an hour or B. Wear a gas mask and transfigure huge amounts of carbon monoxide. Everyone passes out, you can headshot the obvious death eaters and traitors, stun everyone else, then imperious/veritaserum them one at a time to see who's working for who. You win the war in an afternoon.

*Think for 5 minutes*. Remember the founding story of this subreddit. 5 fucking minutes of thought over how she could win the war, and there are just so many goddamn options that she decided not to use because she's either an idiot or insane it drives me nuts when people defend this story.

It's not rational! It's not smart! It's the author warping the world around her precious protagonist so no one notices the gaping stupidity! And she didn't even *try* to use the taboo to kill them. She used the taboo because she needed some ritual or some stupid crap and didn't do it in a room full of mustard gas because she's an idiot!
