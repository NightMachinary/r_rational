The taboo abuse would only get a couple of low level goons, at substantial risk to themselves. The death eaters aren't total idiots. After the first couple didn't report back, they would know something is up. Also, if you break the taboo, the national rune network would destroy your wards (unless you were Hogwarts). They even discussed the idea at one point (regarding the preparations for the tongue locking ritual), then dismissed it. They aren't fighting NPCs here.
