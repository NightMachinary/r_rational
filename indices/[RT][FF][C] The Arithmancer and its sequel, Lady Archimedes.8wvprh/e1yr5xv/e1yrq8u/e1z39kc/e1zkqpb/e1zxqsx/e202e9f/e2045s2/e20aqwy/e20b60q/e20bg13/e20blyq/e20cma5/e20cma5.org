The story definitely could have been more rational; say, by explicitly talking about those things. But... I guess this goes back to the "Definition of RatFic" discussion running in another thread, but I think rationality in stories is on a continuum. This has enough of the traits of rationalfic that I'm still willing to say it belongs here.
