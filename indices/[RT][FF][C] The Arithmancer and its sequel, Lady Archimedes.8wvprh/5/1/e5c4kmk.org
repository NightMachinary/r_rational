I mean, it was up in the air in HPMoR because it was an AU from the get-go, but by definition a single-point-of-departure story like most /Harry Potter/ fanfiction /will/ take place in a universe with a proven afterlife.

But just because the afterlife exists doesn't mean there's no possibility of dramatic tension. In my own /HP/ fanfiction I've run with it: death is /bad/ (because the afterlife is like an eternal vacation where the main hobby you have is looking back on your life, /Pensieve/-style, or looking in at currently living people's life; so to have your life cut short is still kind of irreparable; an immense wealth of wasted opportunities. not to mention being separated from all your loved ones, possibly for a very long time), but rational people don't think of it as the number-one threat. Number one threats are things like Cruciatus Curse users, and rogue Dementors who /can/ induce oblivion.

Again, remember: in the /Harry Potter/ world, it is /impossible/ to return from the Afterlife. If you told me there's a generally pleasant (but not ideal) Heaven like that, but I can never ever go back to Earth after I get there, I would still do my best not to get killed early, thank you very much.
