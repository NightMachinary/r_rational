These stories follow Hermione Granger's perspective through the 7 HP Books with significant changes. The largest change is that Hermione is a math genius by muggle standards, and also a genius in arithmancy once she is introduced to the world of magic. Many of the plot points throughout the series are solved purely through mathematics, or through the mathematical invention of new spells. The 7 books are just over 1.1 million words all told.
