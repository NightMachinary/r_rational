I think there is not going to be much immediate effect, actually. If we take a look at a person with no access to magic, they observe 'magic-like' things frequently, but this is ignored by the cultural belief that 'magic does not exist'. If we see someone on TV performing 'healing', it doesn't matter if we cannot explain the healing, we know it to be fake. So there is little reason to believe that the average person is going to believe in magic immediately if it does exist.

Some people on the fringes might organise information about magic, but they are also not going to be able to distinguish between true magic and false magic, because they believe false magic is true magic in the first place. Unreliable information about magic and the general lack of credibility on the fringes is going to further the delay of any realisation that magic is real.

Those are the considerations for people with no access to magic. What about the people with access to magic? This depends on what exactly your magic is. If your magic does things like bring back the dead, then maybe it'll take a year or two for the majority to believe in magic. If your magic is to create a lighter fire from your finger, or requires development and expertise to use well, that is not immediately advantageous, then it might be two decades before the majority agrees.

Gradually, more and more people are going to believe magic exists as more and more evidence appears. But it's not going to immediate, and that is the key. 'Is it real?' allows the thinking sort to hypothesise structures and organisation, possibilities and danger. 'Is it real?' also prevents the government from acting, or it'll look stupid if it isn't. So it's never going to be a complete surprise with all the overreaction and coverups that suggests.

Sorry that this doesn't really directly answer your question. I would like to see a story about a society that gradually learns the truth from multiple different limited perspectives though, sort of like World War Z the book.
