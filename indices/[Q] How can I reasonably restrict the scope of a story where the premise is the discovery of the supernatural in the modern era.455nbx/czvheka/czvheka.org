Say little about societal outcomes, and let readers work out something consistent from hints in your characters lives.

There are basically two approaches, both of which largely avoid looking at a national scale.

1. Before blowing the secret wide open. Reflect on the absence of known magic - either it's new, or there's some filter you don't know about. What's the appropriate level of paranoia to defeat a thus-far-perfect conspiracy? (story ends at go-time, unclear if it worked)

2. A decade or two after; in the style of /Snow Crash/ or similar. Mostly character-driven in a weird setting.
