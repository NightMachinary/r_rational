Profit motive might help you here. The discoverer of this power might want to keep the existence of the power secret until they had a patent on a profitable application of it. That also introduces some nice patent/competition drama. An instructive historical example would be the invention of the telephone, which happened nearly simultaneously among around six different people, but Alexander Graham Bell managed to get the US Patent before anyone else and consequently made boatloads of money and is remembered as "The inventor of the Telephone".
