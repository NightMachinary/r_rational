This is where research comes in.

Choose something very small -- perhaps the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amundsen%E2%80%93Scott_South_Pole_Station][Amundsen-Scott station at the South Pole]], which is about 50 people in the winter. That's a manageable number. Read up on it, find some biographies of people who worked there, research the Pole -- what lives there, temperatures, etc.

If you want something even smaller, try a research mission in the back woods somewhere, with just half a dozen people. Again, find similar examples in real life and read up.

You don't need to be a world-class expert. Your audience isn't going to know anything about the A-S Station, so as long as what you write sounds plausible you'll be fine. (You still need to do the research, though, or you won't sound plausible.)

When I wrote Baby Blues I did an insane amount of research -- tide tables and current maps for the East River, crime statistics / demographics / income levels in the Bronx and Queens, etc. For everything I've written set in "the real world" (including Baby Blues) I've spent a ton of time on Google Street Maps and Google Earth looking at what's in the location I'm writing about.

For Induction, I needed a location that would have certain elements, one of which was a marina with boats large enough for several dozen people. A lot of digging on GSV and GE led me to Vermillion, Ohio.

The good news is that the research is fun all unto itself, so give it a chance.

One more thing: Don't ever say "I'm not the sort of author who could write that" -- that's just a lazy copout. You can write anything you can dream up, you simply need to do the work to develop the necessary skills and knowledge.
