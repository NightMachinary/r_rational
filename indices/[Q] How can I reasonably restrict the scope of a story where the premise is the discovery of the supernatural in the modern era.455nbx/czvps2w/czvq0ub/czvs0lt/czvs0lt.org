Ah. Then make your character selfish, perhaps even a dialed-down version of the protagonist from Emerald Ashes' "Seventh Horcrux". He won't care about the societal implications or economic effects, so we won't see them. However, there are strong arguments to be made for societal collapse of institutions too prominent to go unnoticed by even the most unobservant or uncaring rational character.

I don't quite understand just what aspect the discovery you wish to explore. Any suggestions on scope limitation will also limit your choice of plot; tell us what interests you about the premise, the specific concept you want to write about, the story you want to tell, so we can more precisely define your story's scope.
