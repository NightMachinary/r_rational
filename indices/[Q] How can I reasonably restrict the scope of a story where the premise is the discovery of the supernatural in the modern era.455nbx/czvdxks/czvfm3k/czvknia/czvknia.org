"Richard Leviss, 45, was arrested Tuesday on murder charges. Prior to his death, he orchestrated a number of hoaxes centered around his aparent ability to conjure and throw spears of blue flame. These culminated in an altercation with police forces, in which Richard set a bystander on fire and burned him to death before being shot by police. Upon examination, his ability was in fact the product of a home-made flamethrower he hid beneath his clothes, a design several experts have commended for being "horrifically effective". Richard is currently in hospital with non-critical wounds."
