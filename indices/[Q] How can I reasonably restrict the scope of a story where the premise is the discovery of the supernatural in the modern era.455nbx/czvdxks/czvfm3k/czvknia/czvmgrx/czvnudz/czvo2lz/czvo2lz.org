  defection profitable before perfect competition kicks in.

It's not hard to make an immediate, short-term profit, however. If you become known as "they guy who revealed magic" you're basically guaranteed book deals, talk show appearances, and, as I said, money from prizes like the Randi Foundation seeking to disprove the supernatural. If it took a long time to make a profit, colluding would of course be beneficial, since the cabal could easily punish defectors, but as it stands, it doesn't. Indeed, the sheer number of ways to convert magic into cash kind of implies that there is no secret organization trying to block the propagation of magic. And of course, you're likely to get the kind of people who have strong personal beliefs regarding the freedom of information as a matter of statistics, of people who already are part of large organizations that would likely defend them.
