And then what? The government, or the freemasons, or the Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants just hides this incredibly useful magic without using it themselves? Either magic is useful enough to, you know, get used, in which case it's going to get out one way or another anyways (it only takes one defector) or it's useless and thus there's no need to suppress it.

Of course, I can see an /irrational/ agency or group trying to keep stuff secret just because, but writing dumb villains isn't appealing.

It's like the moon landings. The knowledge that the moon landings are fake would be so compelling that it would be impossible to keep hidden, because each and every person could stand to gain something from revealing it, even if they're not outright antagonistic to the US.
