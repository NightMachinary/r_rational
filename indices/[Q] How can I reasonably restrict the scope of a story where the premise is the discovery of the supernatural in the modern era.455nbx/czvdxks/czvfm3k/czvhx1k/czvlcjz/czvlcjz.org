I'd think about it like this.

Assuming I discovered magic, while I'd like to believe I'm above average, I'm nowhere near exceptional enough that I could reasonably believe I'm the only person who could have discovered it. But given that the magic would be something axiomatically only possible in the modern age (that is, I'd construct the magic system so that would be an obvious conclusion) it would be reasonable to expect that either I got to the discovery first by luck, or that other people got the discovery but where then silenced.

In the second case, I'm basically guaranteed to be boned regardless, so I might as well make it public and try to profit. In the first case, however, I have a strong incentive to go to the media, because someone else will probably discover the magic eventually, thus removing my advantage, so I might as well try to capitalize early. Of course, the "cooperate" option would be for any individual who got magic to stay silent, and thus get an advantage before the rest of the world at large catches on, but you only need one person to say "screw it, I'm going to be famous" and everyone else is thrown under a bus. It's like the prisoner's dilemma, but with no chance for coordination.

Though writing this has given me an idea, actually. Maybe I could make a magic system where all magicians become immediately aware of new magicians, and are aware that they become aware. Then there's an obvious reason to keep silent (don't get sensory overload from new magicians) and an easy way to coordinate. This bears further investigation.
