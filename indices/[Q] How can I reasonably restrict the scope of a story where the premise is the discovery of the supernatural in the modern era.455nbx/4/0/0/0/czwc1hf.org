That's a specific case of a different problem: why is the protagonist the first person to discover it? If there's a serious threat of other people discovering it in the future, there's also the possibility that other people have already discovered it in the past and the protagonist is just a latecomer to the whole thing.

(Unless there's some reason why it was only discovered /now/--you need a specific level of computer tech to do it, the Earth just passed into a region of space that supports the supernatural, etc.)
