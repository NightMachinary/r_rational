If magic depends on secrecy/mystery to work properly then it makes sense to hide it in order to preserve its power. To this end there are multiple different magic rules/systems that may make this work. Here are some examples:

The more people know/use a spell, the weaker it is, its power is divided among people. (See Nasuverse, the setting Fate/Stay Night for an example of this in the backstory)

Magi is limited by belief (Like in the Old World of Darkness setting). Using magic in public forces the user to disguise it as something mundane or not use it at all.

Magic is easily/automatically disrupted by people observing it/examining it (Like the mad science in Genius the Transgression fan expansion for New World of Darkness)

Magic fundamentally tries to hide itself and karmically punishes people who expose it (See Wildbow's Pact for an example of this)

Mix and match these types of limitations as fits with your magic system. You can have the main characters accept magic's limits as a given after minimal experimentation, or make it a running plot point where they try to find a way around these limitations to make magic known to the world and/or accomplish whatever other goals they have driving the plot arc.
