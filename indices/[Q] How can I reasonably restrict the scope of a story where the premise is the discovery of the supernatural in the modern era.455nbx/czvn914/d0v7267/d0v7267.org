The Curie effect: Unless practised /extremely/ carefully and at low levels, magic causes damage to the practitioner (physical, medical, mental, emotional, spiritual etc), as in the Laundryverse, amongst others. Which also has the problem that anyone at all sufficiently educated/smart enough to explore certain areas of mathematics can tap into magical effects and accidentally blow up themselves and the town they're in.

Then there's "raw magic without protection attracts the notice of Things. There are more/worse Things out there than even a planetful of trained human mages could handle. Chicxulub was not an accident."
