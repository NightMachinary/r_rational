The movie /Chronicle/ (2012) might offer you some inspiration; watch it without knowing anything beforehand, don't read about it.

My suggestion: Have the discoverers be researchers in an outpost in Antarctica, or villagers of an Alaskan, Greenlander, Siberian town with limited contact with the outside world. Limit your timeframe to changes to the town over a predefined span of time, perhaps the time between supply missions, or during a month-long night (the vampire movie /30 Days of Night/ did this). Have the town cut off internet access, and you have your sandbox.

The story's end could be an epilogue written in the style of a traveler's tale of one sent to discover why the town or outpost went off-grid.
