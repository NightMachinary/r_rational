Played with this for an abandoned rpg campaign, so feel free to steal: Magic is limited by mana. Not by talent, because the ability to use magic reached 100% saturation in the human population over 100000 years ago. The problem is, that mana is only generated by nuclear reactions, and for various reasons only an absurdly small fragment of what the sun generates ever hits the surface of the earth, so as population grew, magic weakened because it got shared by ever more people, until it effectively vanished all together. Until the atomic age. A single large reactor - by itself - leaks more mana into the world than ever reached the planet from the sun. Noone noticed this for quite a long time because with billions of people, every drop of mana got absorbed and promptly spent on, oh, teenagers mysteriously having clear skin or winning dice games ever so slightly more often. Until, that is, the nuclear dash the french carried out during the oil crisis. Because enough reactors to power a nation is also enough reactors to power the ley lines back up. At which point history took a sharp turn to the weird.

I mostly liked this idea because imagine the cognitive dissonance of a seventies flower child who is having astounding levels of success enchanting crystals, painstakingly building a set of instruments for dowsing and then trying to locate the leylines.. and then noticing they are all pointing at power plants. Atomic power plants.
