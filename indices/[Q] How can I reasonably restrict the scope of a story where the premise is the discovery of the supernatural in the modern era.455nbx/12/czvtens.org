I was thinking an inherent property of the magic system itself that makes it either unwise or sub-optimal to share it.

One version of a system unwise to share is where any adept can very quickly learn to kill people undetectably, but it takes high levels of skill and/or power to defend from such attacks. Popularizing it would be catastrophic for society, and anyone sane would avoid it at all costs, making it plausible that people discovered it in the past, but it was never popularized then, either.

Nasu-verse has an example of a system where it's sub-optimal to share it - the more people know the mysteries, the less powerful the mysteries are. Assume there's a spell that creates one kilogram of gold for one unit of mana spent. If you teach this spell to another person, suddenly it starts creating only half a kilogram for one unit of mana (is my rough understanding, I'm sure it's more nuanced). Obviously if you want to get anything done with such a system, you don't let everyone know about it, or how to use it.
