If the shadowy government conspiracy holds a monopoly on current tech, AND magic is superior, AND one defector is sufficient to promulgate a full magitech revolution, then there is /still/ a motivation to collude. Since one defector is sufficient to break the monopoly then we may conclude that the new method (magic) lacks the barriers to entry of the old (tech). Thus no defector can hold on to the advantage of defecting long enough to make defection profitable before perfect competition kicks in.

This equilibrium becomes more sustainable as probability of detection of new users goes up.
