This is simply not true in the very short term. A billionaire today might have access to those services, but a lottery winner often flails around and wastes hundreds of thousands (or millions) of dollars before ever coming close to a competent lawyer or contractor. Acquisition of security services is unlikely to scale quickly with money to the degree it would need in order to survive the cabal. If an otherwise completely unknown person approached Haliburton there is a high chance of being turned away at the door. (Averting this might be an interesting narrative!)
