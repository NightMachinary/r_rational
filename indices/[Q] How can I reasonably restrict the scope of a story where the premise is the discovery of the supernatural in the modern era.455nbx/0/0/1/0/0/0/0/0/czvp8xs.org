  You seem to have a very particular idea of what magic exists, what incentives exist for the surrounding world, and so on.

As far as incentives, I'm just taking into account the things that exist to reward someone of revealing /any/ kind of magic, even without taking account the benefit they'd get for the whole "hey guys, magic is real" part. As far as an idea of what magic exists, that basically only goes as far as assuming that magic wouldn't incentivize cabal forming, unless I specifically design it that way, because I know people smarter than me will likely figure out how to munchkin it hard in a short timeframe, and the existence of a cabal begs the question of why someone in the cabal wouldn't have already done so (seeing as there are evidently enough people to make a shadowy cabal that know magic). If I keep a limited scope of non-collaborators, it's believable that they just wouldn't figure it out in the duration of the story.

Though I will admit that I do immediately think of magic as mostly an egalitarian mental exercise, where no amount of "training" will raise your powerlevel, and everyone has the same potential capabilities. If I make it into something that needs to be practiced, and thus forces people to spend time before they can effectively use it... hmm.

  As long as the conspiracy plays a sufficiently odious punishment with high probability of detection, I'm inclined to think that arbitrarily high amounts of money don't translate into positive net utility.

The more money you have, however, the better you can defend yourself. Private contractors, exotic weaponry, etc. Putting together an adequate defense plan might be difficult, but the simple solution is to just constantly take flights on large airliners where any action taken against you would lead to serious backlash against any cabal until you have something figured out. Or heck, just hang out in DC near the white house. Of course, there would probably be magical solutions from the POV of the cabal, but that falls into "constructing the magic system" and isn't something I could just assume beforehand.
