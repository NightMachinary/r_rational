There are still plenty of ways to leverage wealth in order to make attacking you unfeasible or counterproductive for a cabal. Off the top of my head, donating to charity, taking a trip to a military base, joining scientology, buying a building and barricading yourself in it, etc. They're not necessarily /efficient/ uses of the money, but any character would have much more time to think about this stuff than me.
