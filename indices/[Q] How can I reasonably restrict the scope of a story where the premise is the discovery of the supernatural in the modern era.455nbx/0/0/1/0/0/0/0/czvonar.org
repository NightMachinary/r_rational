Not if the conspiracy is playing an immediate and maximal punishment. Say revealing magic to the public nets an instantaneous 5 billion dollars. If the conspiracy captures you within the business week, then that gives you a billion dollars to spend each day. Maybe you can spend that much, but I doubt I'd be able to. And I certainly wouldn't be able to put together an adequate (active) defense against a shadowy conspiracy within 5 days, for any amount of money.

As long as the conspiracy plays a sufficiently odious punishment with high probability of detection, I'm inclined to think that arbitrarily high amounts of money don't translate into positive net utility.

You seem to have a very particular idea of what magic exists, what incentives exist for the surrounding world, and so on. Why not just write the discovery scene (for your main character) and see what consequences feel most natural?
