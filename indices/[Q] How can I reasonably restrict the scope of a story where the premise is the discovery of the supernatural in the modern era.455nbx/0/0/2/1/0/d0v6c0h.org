Particularly as if there's only one of you, the information which might be able to be gained from dissecting you will make you an instant and permanent kidnap-or-kill target for any government which doesn't already have you under lock and key. Plus religious nutters, billionaires who just want to control you, and so on.

Better hope you have a superpower which enables you to survive everything from nuclear-grade assassination attempts to mental/emotional/social manipulation. "Hello, Ultraperson. If you do not comply with these demands, we will nuke a major city in your country. And our rivals demand you do the complete opposite and they have kidnapped your family and will kill them if you comply with us. And a third party has raised an army of fanatics to try and attack everything associated with you, 24/7, with no regard for their own safety."
