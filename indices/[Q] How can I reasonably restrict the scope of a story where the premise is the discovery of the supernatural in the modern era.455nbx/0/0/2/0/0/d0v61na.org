Having you die in a /completely normal/ accident wouldn't necessarily convince people that there was something to hide.

Even if you'd presented as paranoid and told friends and authorities over the past week that you were being hunted by a shadowy government agency and thought you were going to be killed, that doesn't necessarily mean anyone would necessarily follow up if you fell into traffic the next day. And even if they did, what if they found nothing?

And what if the shadowy government agency didn't kill you, but instead gave you a stack of memory-fuzzing and hallucinogenic drugs, staged a local gas leak with an actual hallucinogenic gas, and had everyone 'affected' advised to spend some time in hospital, with some people having to stay longer than others (but eventually being given a clean bill of health)? If you showed up at the hospital and followed doctors' orders, you'd have a 'really bad reaction' to the 'gas leak' and slowly descend into brain-crippling madness for a few years before dying in an unrelated incident. If you didn't do what the doctors said, then obviously you were affected badly by the gas and were paranoid and seeing things, becoming more and more erratic before you disappeared, with a trail indicating you'd caught a bus to the nearest ocean and walked into it.

Better make sure you can evade the agency until you can prove that magic/superpowers/whatever exist in a non-refutable way on mass media, preferably live and coast to coast during a prime timeslot.
