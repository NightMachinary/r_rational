It was my immediate first thought as well; if I stumbled upon some massive secret of the universe, completely by accident, I would /not/ take for granted that I was the first to do so.

I don't know that I would go so far as to directly assume "government conspiracy," myself. It's just that if a such simple but far-reaching truth exists, but is not widely known, there may be any number of reasons it remains a secret which are less immediately obvious than the direct ramifications of the power itself.

Additionally, if I /am/ the only current holder of the secret, I'm in no rush to claim any Randi-esque prizes, and should focus on R&D until I know what advantages I could get by keeping it secret, if any. If I'm /not/ actually the sole user, claiming the prize carries risks of unknown magnitude, and I would be better off focusing on R&D until I know what advantages I could maintain in the event it /does/ go public.

Finally, if there isn't really a conspiracy of any kind in place to limit /my/ knowledge and use of the secret, then there's a narrative void I might as well fill, right? Maybe get some friends together, start my own agency, hopefully have fun with it!

tl;dr CONSTANT VIGILANCE
