Strauss' Laundry series had a sort of answer to why one would want to keep it secret. Magic is caused by certain classes of computations, which open gateways into other universes containing entities which would like to eat or possess. . . everything (though not all of them to force the point if you take sufficient precautions), and some are willing to take orders in return for food/bodies. Failure to take sufficient precautions results in everyone everywhere dying, and also possibly all the energy being sucked out of our universe.

Good luck making your setting last very long, though. The rational choice would be to use magic to try to eliminate all computers and the urge or ability to ever build one from the planet.
