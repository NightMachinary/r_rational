Have a number of limitations that minimize the risk.

1. Randi prize is a supernatural body chop shot. Lots of supernatural beings do go to it, and get cut up and sold on the magic black market or sold into slavery to the military and businesses.

2. Magic gives off electromagnetic fields which tends to make electronic cameras fail around it. This can be dealt with, but makes observing magic trickier.

3. There are open (not secret) government schemes to stamp out belief in magic [[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-17006924]] ostensibly to stop child abuse.

4. [[http://www.gallup.com/poll/19558/paranormal-beliefs-come-supernaturally-some.aspx]] Around 10-20% of the populace believes in magic, perhaps due to a personal encounter.

5. [[http://www.spellsofmagic.com/tips.html]] There are, online, a number of accurate and detailed guides as to how to do magic, as well as a number of tv shows devoted to showing off magic.

6. In places where the government isn't working as hard to stamp out belief in witchcraft, like Africa [[http://www.livescience.com/8515-belief-witchcraft-widespread-africa.html]] belief in magic is widespread.

7. [[http://www.safechildafrica.org/]] There are a number of charities designed to protect witches from abuse in africa and stamp out belief in magic.

8. [[http://www.thirdsector.co.uk/witches-guinea-pigs-dilemma-censorship/management/article/1289813]] there are active attempts to censor media involving magic, heavily led by the churches. This prevents too many obvious magic things getting onto youtube. Magic organizations likewise use their pull with the media, governments to minimize mass media exposure.
