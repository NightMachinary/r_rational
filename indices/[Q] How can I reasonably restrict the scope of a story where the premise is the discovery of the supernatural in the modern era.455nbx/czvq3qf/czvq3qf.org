There would not be a reason to tell Randi, if you could make money easily without.

Magic could be given by demons or some intelligent party, who would take it away if revealed. This is why you can't demonstrate magic.

Maybe magic actually would not work around sceptics? It would depend on intent, and trying to prove it works just is not a good mindset of casting a spell?
