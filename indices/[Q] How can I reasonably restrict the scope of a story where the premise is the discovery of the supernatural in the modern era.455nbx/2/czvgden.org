What if it was previously a scam, but a small change made it into actual magic? The two things I can think up for this are homeopathy actually creating magical potions (with precisely the right procedures) and psychics/mediums/dowsers having high (but imperfect) accuracy.

As for keeping the scope small, the practitioners wouldn't spread their knowledge for a combination of two reasons: They are drowned out by all of the scams (which they incorrectly assume are the real thing), and because they aren't that good at marketing or that business-oriented.
