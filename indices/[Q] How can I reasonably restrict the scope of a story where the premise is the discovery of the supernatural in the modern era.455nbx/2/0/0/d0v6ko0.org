It'd actually fit in well with the whole "magic was once prevalent and has died down with the advent of the scientific age" standard trope. It's not that science itself has crippled magic, but that given the enormous amount of fraudsters, people have stopped believing in real magic and therefore don't tend to either recognize it when they experience it, or pass on accurate information to others about it.
