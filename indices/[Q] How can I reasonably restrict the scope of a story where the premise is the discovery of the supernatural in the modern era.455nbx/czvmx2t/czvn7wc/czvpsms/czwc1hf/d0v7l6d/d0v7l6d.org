Magic requires a minimal computational base equating to approximately seven billion human minds within eight thousand miles of each other.

Magic requires a minimal level of /sleeping/ human minds within a certain proximity, meaning its results vary with the time of day, day of the week, geographic distribution of humanity, and can be disrupted to a degree by things like cultural holidays/events.

Magic in the Earth-Moon system operates significantly better when something has a direct line of sight to the magical field/systems on the Moon - perhaps one or more fixed geographic points, or a certain number of people, or a sufficient number of whales. It may or may not be also affected by the Sun's position to the Moon for any number of reasons.

Magic is affected by how many human minds are thinking about the same thing at the same time, and is thus affected by things like global product releases, celebrity news, international tragedies, and so on.
