For those as confused as I was, no, this sub definitely isn't 11 years old :) Or rather, it existed 11 years ago but was basically empty. You can use this site to look at a sub's history, and I was able to find the sub in its current form's /actual/ brthday, which is actually not far off-month wise... December 3rd, 2013, making us about 7 years old.
