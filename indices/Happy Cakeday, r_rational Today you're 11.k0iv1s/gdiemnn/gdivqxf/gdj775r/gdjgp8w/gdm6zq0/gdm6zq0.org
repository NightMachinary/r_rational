[[https://alexanderwales.com/the-dark-wizard-of-donkerk-chapter-1/]] All of Wales's writing is great and very much in the spirit of this sub and this is one of my faves of his. Very compelling characters, very coherent and thought-provoking worldbuilding. I found the romantic subplot pretty entertaining, which is rare for me.

[[http://unsongbook.com/]] Unsong is one of my favorite books, although it skips many common ratfic tropes. Something like an urban fantasy setting built from jewish/abrahamic mysticism, it's a good work all around, and if you like puns you'll likely find it hilarious as well.

[[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/]] Worm is a wonderful deconstruction of the "superhero" genre, and despite predating most of the rationalist canon is very much in the same spirit. It has a bit of a slow start but imo hits its swing by chapter 4. Notable for being one of the longest pieces of popular webfiction, worm spans ~7,000 pages. Admittedly this one is nowhere near "lighthearted" but it's definitely a formative work in the genre.

[[https://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/82363551272/fall-of-doc-future-contents/amp]] Fall of Doc Future is another in the "super" genre, with a good helping of hard sci-fi. This is book 1 of a trilogy, the third book of which is incomplete (not sure if it's still in limbo or if it's been dropped but hasn't updated in quite a while). Lighthearted and a lot of fun with a cast of some my favorite characters in fiction. This is another work where I find the romantic plotlines quite compelling.
