My personal favorites:

- *[[http://daystareld.com/pokemon-1/][Pokemon: Origin of Species]]*: A (really awesome) attempt to make a more internally consistent pokemon universe. Relatively lighthearted in some parts, but can get really tense as well. Takes a bit of time to get going, but if you can get through the early chapters it gets really, really good.

- *[[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning][Mother of Learning]]*: Main character in a very high magic system gets stuck in a groundhog day-style timeloop and has to redo the same month over and over again trying to avert a major disaster while munchkinning the crap out of the time loop and the magic system. Didn't originate on this subreddit, but is really popular around here. The story is also finished now, so no risk of it getting abandoned.

- *[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12863641/][The Optimized Wish Project]]*: Dragonball fanfic where Goku isn't an idiot and Bulma is trying to figure out how all the nonsense magic and superpowers in the dragonball universe works. Probably the most lighthearted of this list.

- *[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11090259/1/r-Animorphs-The-Reckoning][Animorphs: The reckoning]]*: Animorphs fanfic that is very much *not* lighthearted. It's tense and scary, up to the point where it is a borderline horror story (which is exactly the correct atmosphere for animorphs). I stopped reading this until it is finished as I felt the slow update schedule was messing with my enjoyment of the story and it might have been abandoned in the mean time (last update was from July 20th), so fair warning. It is really good though.

- *[[http://www.hpmor.com/chapter/1][Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality]]*: The story that started the genre. An amazing take on the HP universe with Harry, Hermione, Voldemort, Dumbledore and a bunch of others all being substantially smarter than their canon counterparts. My feelings on the story fluctuate a bit. It definitely has aspects that I don't like (Harry is kind of a pretentious ass in some places and there are a few unnecessary jabs at canon HP that felt a little mean spirited), but if you can get past those the interplay between smart!Harry and smart!everyone else is well worth it.

People here also really like Worth the Candle (as you can see from this post), but I never read that story so I can't comment there.
