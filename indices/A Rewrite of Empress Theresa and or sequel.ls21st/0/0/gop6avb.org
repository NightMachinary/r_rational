My fanfic fluff is that a rag team of anti-Theresa agents infiltrate the inner circle and try to kill Theresa in a direct or indirect way. They'll learn that Theresa quite literally lives inside an echo chamber. Where everything she sees is manipulated or covered so she can live in delusion because of either Blare and or HAL.
