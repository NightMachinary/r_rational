Sounds a bit like the Youjo Senki fanfic [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-young-womans-political-record-youjo-senki-saga-of-tanya-the-evil.660569/][A Young Girls Political Record]], about a reincarnation from our world unwittingly(and competently) politically dominating a weimar Germany analogue.

First half is an excellent farce type story, but the second half stretches the protagonist's central conceit of "unwitting competency" too far and the story loses a lot of its charm, IMO. Still pretty good.
