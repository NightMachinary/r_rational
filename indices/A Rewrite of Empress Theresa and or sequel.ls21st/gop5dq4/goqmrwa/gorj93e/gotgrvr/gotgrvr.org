I'd completely dissagree; I don't actually think that its "unwitting competency" later on, she is very purposeful in what she does, the unwitting part is more from the perspective not the actual policies put forward. My main example is her reaction to the first cheep car export of not-Germany: She is all for and pushes for investment into a cheep car. She thinks the car that comes out of it is fugly and "who the hell would want to buy this?" but its still her policy of investing into the endeavor that made it successful.
