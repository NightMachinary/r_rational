So much of the plot depends on the general public worshipping Theresa, it would need a /major/ rewrite.\\
From reviews I first thought that Theresa was brainwashing everyone, but reading the first page made it very clear Norman was just writing a self-insert power-wank fantasy.\\
Perhaps the brainwashing route, with Theresa being the antagonist and an unreliable narrator, could work.
