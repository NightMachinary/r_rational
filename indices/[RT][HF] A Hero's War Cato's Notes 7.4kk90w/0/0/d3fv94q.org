I'd like to blame the gnomes. You know, the ones that steal your socks, but only one of every pair? The ones that tangle your earbuds while in your pockets? The ones that steal something you're looking for, only to put it back as soon as you ask someone for help, making you look stupid?

Man, fuck gnomes.
