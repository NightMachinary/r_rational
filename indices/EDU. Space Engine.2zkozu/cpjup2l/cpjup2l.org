Love this concept, but there's no linux version. :(

One of the best uses that seems suggested (especially by the name) but sadly nobody seems to have done yet, is to have this as the background/basis/seed chooser for what is pretty much any unrelated game taking place on a single planet in real time, redoing entirely the modeling and rendering of that one planet but using the generated heightmap and geology and such as the starting point, and using it for a spectacular skybox and controlling light conditions and calendar and such.
