Thanks, glad you enjoyed it. Copied from an earlier response;

In 'Ascent' the numbered conurbations are a specific kind of highly self-sufficient city. Not quite like an arcology or a regular town, Conurbations are built around incredibly high density subsistence farming ('protein farms') - most residents grow heavily modified seaweeds or staple crops in high density square meter plots, a little like the ancient Inca method of farming. Conurbations are built to minimise public spaces and opportunities for meeting and congregation. They are designed to be nearly self sufficient in food, water and basic goods, with heavy recycling and printing facilties. Energy is provided by extensive solar power farms, the only method of energy generation that does not add to total planetary waste heat. The only things that need be imported are high-tech goods like medicines and some electronics. There is little need for travel. All in all, the Earth's total population at the time the story is set exceeds 20 billion, with demographics resembling a present day middle income country.

Unfortunately I couldn't tell you, as I photo-shopped it and didn't keep a copy of the original image. As for what it symbolises in-story... well that would be a spoiler.
