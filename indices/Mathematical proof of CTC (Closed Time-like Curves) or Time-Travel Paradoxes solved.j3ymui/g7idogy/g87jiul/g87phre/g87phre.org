This is an interesting idea. It's not what people generally mean when they talk about using MWI with time travel; usually they mean that the timeline branches when someone uses time travel to change the past. They conflate quantum mechanical interactions that cause branching with things like decisions or coin tosses.

 

The situation you've described is actually the EPR paradox, but you missed the key component. The thing about the EPR paradox is that quantum mechanical interactions are very explicitly /not/ bound by the luminal speed limit of relativity. As soon as you measure one box, the other one is instantly determined, no matter how far apart they are. According to MWI, the whole universe branches when the first particle is measured.

 

I think you're overcomplicating the problem by adding entanglement and the EPR paradox in. Any simple binary quantum phenomena would work for this idea, but I'll stick with "up" and "down" (we could also go with the old Schr√∂dinger's Cat "Alive"/"Dead"). Basically, the idea is to take an isolated indeterminate particle back in time through a CTC/wormhole, /then/ measure it in the past, thus branching the timeline. That means, when it's time to put the particle in the CTC, you have two possible contradictory pasts with equal likelihood: in one universe it exited with an up spin, in the other with a down spin. What if you check the result before sending the particle in? Could you decide whether or not to send it based on its measurement?

 

There are a few possible resolutions to this paradox:

1. Single-Timeline. Since the CTCs do not allow for changes to the past, the behavior of the particle is deterministic. In this case, the particle will always have the same spin. There's no way to change the past. This bypasses the inherent randomness of quantum mechanics in the same way that a CTC bypasses our notions of causality.

2. Chross-compatibility. Measuring the particle in the past branches the universe. However, since CTCs form in a continuous spacetime, the particle must have been sent back in time in /both/ resulting timelines. (For this interpretation, imagine you're in the past and watching the particle in the CTC as it comes from the future. If you follow it from past to future, you will eventually see someone place the particle in the CTC. If this weren't the case, it would mean that it simply blinked out of existence at the point of branching).

3. Legitimate branching. We decide if the particle reads "up", we'll send it back in time, and if it reads "down", we won't. In one universe, it reads "down", which means it /was/ sent back in time by one universe (in that universe, it read "up"). This solution would mean that the quantum mechanical ability to split timelines is stronger than relativity's ability to maintain them.

 

It's all conjecture, but if I had to guess, I'd put the solution as #2, but in such a way that it would look like #1. As in, technically, MWI would branch the timeline, but the CTC would keep it intact enough that we wouldn't be able to tell the difference. Like maybe we fumble the particle when it exists, or we don't record it. I attribute this to needing to change our conception of "causality" when we start using CTCs.

 

This isn't a trivial problem. Most models of CTCs require a lot of negative energy or quantum interactions. A lot of scientific conjecture nowadays is whether or not reconciling quantum mechanics with gravity is going to show that CTCs can't exist at all.
