The paper proves that it's possible to time travel using CTCs without causing a Grand Farther Paradox.

It also proves that you'll be able to have freedom of choice in two scenarios as long as all other scenarios are kept consistent, i.e.. you can only have two scenarios that can be influenced by what happens in the other scenarios.

It seems to more have the "you can't change the past" as a parameter and a process called W will happen to bring the past in line with the expected future.

As for the many-worlds interpretation this has little to no influence. It only talks about time travel within the same timeline. Nothing is mentioned when changing between different timelines.
