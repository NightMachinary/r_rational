  The Many-Worlds Interpretation is a completely different phenomena (and not at all related to time travel or coin flips or the like, but that's a different topic).

Doesn't MWI have consequences for relativity-compatible time travel such as wormholes?

If you take two entangled particles, one up & one down, and take them a lightyear apart, and measure which you have it'll reveal you're in the world where the other particle is the opposite. But that information of which world you're in can only propagate at lightspeed, so if you step through you're wormhole to the other particle a lightyear away then the world on the otherside is still indeterminate and you could step into the other world where the particles have resolved the other way round when measured.

In fact, since natural entanglement happen all the time, wouldn't all wormholes lead to other worlds in the MWI sense?
