  The thing about the EPR paradox is that quantum mechanical interactions are very explicitly not bound by the luminal speed limit of relativity.

Isn't one of the strengths of MWI that it obeys the principle of locality, which is to say it obeys the speed of light limit? How can you be superluminal and not non-local?

  the whole universe branches when the first particle is measured

I thought the whole universe, entailed the whole "observable" universe (parts of the universe can observe the event rather than reverse to whatever extent those aren't equivalent) which propagates out from the event at the speed of light (+inflation effects at scale).

Having the whole infinite universe determined instantly after a quantum event resolves begs an absolute framework for location.\\
As per general relativity the rest of the universe only has a place and a time relative to other events.\\
This can't be established until observation occurs.

The way I've always conceptualised MWI, is one infinite repeating universe where every place is just one of an infinite number of places with the same set of identical events.\\
And as per relativity your location is only determinate down to being in one of these places with identical events, because your location in space & time is defined relative to those events you observe.\\
Similar to how quantum location is constrained by observation.\\
In the case of a quantum event, observe the outcome just resolves whether you're in the infinite set of location that resolves up or down, and until that event observation propagates to you, your location is undetermined between the two sets.

Isn't that how the criticism of MWI creating worlds from nothing is resolved? MWI doesn't creates worlds during a branch, it's just the existing set of infinite worlds diverges into two sets of infinite worlds.
