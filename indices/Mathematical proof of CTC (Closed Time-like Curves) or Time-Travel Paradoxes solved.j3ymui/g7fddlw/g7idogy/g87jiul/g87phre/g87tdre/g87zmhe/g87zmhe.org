  Isn't one of the strengths of MWI that it obeys the principle of locality, which is to say it obeys the speed of light limit? How can you be superluminal and not non-local?
#+end_quote

Huh. I'd never done much research into MWI to see changes propagate at light speed. It still seems like you can't use wormholes to circumvent EPR though, because the wormhole itself shortens the distance between the two particles. Since the whole idea of a wormhole in this example is that it's traversable, that would mean that it should allow passage of the light cone from each entangled particle. You'd just end up with a wormhole connected 2 points in one universe and a wormhole connecting 2 points in another universe.

  Having the whole infinite universe determined instantly after a quantum event resolves begs an absolute framework for location.

Yeah, I was kind of hoping you'd gloss that part because simultaneity is a bit of a nuisance in quantum.

  Isn't that how the criticism of MWI creating worlds from nothing is resolved? MWI doesn't creates worlds during a branch, it's just the existing set of infinite worlds diverges into two sets of infinite worlds.

This one I actually have read about. The idea is that new branches aren't created from nothing, it's all just part of the larger Universal wavefunction. To drastically oversimplify it, basically the multiverse has x amount of energy, which gets divided amongst all the branching universe based on the overall "probability" of that universe forming.
