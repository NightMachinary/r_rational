First off: This is a terrible paper to use as a basis for generalizations about CTCs. It talks about very specific dynamic processes that aren't really applicable to most circumstances. Maybe start with something by [[https://www.its.caltech.edu/%7Ekip/index.html/PubScans/II-121.pdf][Kip Thorne]] if you want something technical. Or just the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_timelike_curve][wikipedia article on CTCs]].

Second: Yes, CTCs are solutions to general relativity equations that allow for time travel--specifically of the "you can't change the past" variety. That isn't to say, necessarily, that the past cannot be changed (ie, that you can't create multiple timelines). It means that you can't change the past with a CTC. CTCs take you to the past of the current timeline, where you cannot change things.

The Many-Worlds Interpretation is a completely different phenomena (and not at all related to time travel or coin flips or the like, but that's a different topic).
