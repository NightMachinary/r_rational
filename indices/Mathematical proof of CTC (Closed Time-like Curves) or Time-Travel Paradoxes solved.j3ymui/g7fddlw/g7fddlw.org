The paper says that after a change in the timeline is made, a vague process labelled "w" occurs that changes it back. There is no indication of how or why that would happen though. It just says "if time is consistent and everyone at any time has free will, then if it wasn't consistent, something would happen to make it consistent." Nowhere does it disprove the many worlds version of time travel, as w would be unnecessary if you were now in a new universe.
