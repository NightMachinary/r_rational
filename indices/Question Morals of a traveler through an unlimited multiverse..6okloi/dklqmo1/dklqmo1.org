  But there should be infinite variations of each one of these universes, created when some schmuck decides to tie her left shoe first instead of her right, when some other random person scratches their nose or doesn't, when a swallow beats its wings 7 times or 8 during a landing...and every other possible variation brought about by quite literally anything.

Did the author of this work stated anywhere that the setting of his fanfic adheres to Everett's many-worlds interpretation? Because if not, then it doesn't have to be the case. And it's just a theory after all, not a scientifically proven fact.

  So anyways, I have a lot of problems with is implementation, but this led me to the following moral question: In a multiverse where you can easily and quickly jump to the next universe over literally any time you want at zero cost, to what extent are the current set of human morals still relevant? In one universe, a woman crosses the street and is hit by a bus. Would a hypothetical traveler be morally obligated to perform a jump and save her in the next 'verse over?

Assuming that MWI is true, it would be pointless, because there will be nearly infinite amount of similar scenarios and the multiversal voyager wont be able to save all such people by himself. Also he wouldn't really save anyone, but just cause another branching of the universe into one where he saved the woman and one where he didn't.
