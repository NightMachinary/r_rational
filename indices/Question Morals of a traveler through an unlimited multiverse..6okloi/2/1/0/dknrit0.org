  Whether you choose to inflict suffering or not on a given timeline, the same amount of suffering occurs.

I disagree. I don't share the common opinion that all the copies of you are "you." Suffering doesn't aggregate, it doesn't matter if 10,000 different individuals get a spec of dust in their eyes and experience 0.1 units of suffering each, you can't collect all of their suffering into a collection plate and offer it up as 1,000 units of suffering because suffering is an experience and no one experienced 1,000 units of suffering in that scenario.

If I were to crawl through the screen you're currently looking at like the girl from The Ring and then inflict 1,000 units of suffering upon you, the consequence of that would be that you experienced 1,000 units of suffering that you would not otherwise have experienced. If we're taking this seriously, then I /did/ crawl through your screen in a nearby universe (except that's humanizing it, I crawled through your screen in an infinite number of universes). How, exactly, are infinite copies of "me" and infinite copies of "you" relevant to the "me" and the "you" who are currently communicating with each other? They aren't.

If I stab you in the neck then I've stabbed you in the neck, and that's the thatness of it.
