  You can't jump in front of an infinite number of buses, but that doesn't mean that any pain/suffering you inflict is morally acceptable just because a copy of the suffering person is alive and well in a neighboring universe.

It does, though, as long as we're working in a consequentialist framework. Whether you choose to inflict suffering or not on a given timeline, the same amount of suffering occurs. All actions are morally neutral, since every course of action produces the same consequences.

You've really got to adopt some form of virtue ethics or deontological system if you want morality in an infinite multiverse.
