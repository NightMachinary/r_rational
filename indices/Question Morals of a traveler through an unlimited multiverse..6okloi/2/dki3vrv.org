  But there should be infinite variations of each one of these universes, created when some schmuck decides to tie her left shoe first instead of her right, when some other random person scratches their nose or doesn't, when a swallow beats its wings 7 times or 8 during a landing... and every other possible variation brought about by quite literally anything.

I think you might enjoy the second half of Harry Potter and the Irrational Odyssey (specifically an arc which starts somewhere between Ch. 25 and Ch. 30 (I'm not sure because they haven't been written yet, and there are three arcs before that which might end up getting "tightened up" and losing a chapter or two each)).

EDIT:

As far as your moral dilemma, I think each "instance" of a person is separate. There's an infinite number of "me" typing these exact words, but they're all discrete entities. If the girl from The Ring crawled through my computer screen as I was L:Ksdj;lakfsjgasfklbvgaskjvg

Just kidding, universes like that are exceedingly rare, but if I /did/ get killed to death, I would take no solace in my dying moments from the thought that an exact replica of me in a nearby universe was still alive and happy. You can't jump in front of an infinite number of buses, but that doesn't mean that any pain/suffering you inflict is morally acceptable just because a copy of the suffering person is alive and well in a neighboring universe.
