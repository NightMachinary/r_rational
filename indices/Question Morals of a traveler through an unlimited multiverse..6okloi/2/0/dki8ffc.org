I agree with your point, and accept your conclusion vis a vis inflicted harm, but the question still remains - to what length does a reasonable expectation of moral interference extend to when the person in question has access to extraordinary means?

Now that I'm thinking about it more, I realize that the fantastical details of "universe hopping" and "infinite realities" aren't really relevant. The question is essentially the same for any individual in real life that has access to means for creating well-being far beyond that of an ordinary individual. Say, someone who has access to the cure for every form of cancer.

  I think you might enjoy the second half of Harry Potter and the Irrational Odyssey (specifically an arc which starts somewhere between Ch. 25 and Ch. 30 (I'm not sure because they haven't been written yet, and there are three arcs before that which might end up getting "tightened up" and losing a chapter or two each)).

I look forward to that vaguely implied point in spacetime when that becomes available for viewing, then.
