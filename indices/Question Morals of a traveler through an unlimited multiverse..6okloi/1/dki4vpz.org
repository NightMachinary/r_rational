  Thing is, it's specified by the author many times that his device has access to everything. Every possible universe ever. All of them. And this bothered me, because I am convinced he didn't think of the implications. His Empire only ever accesses one iteration of these universes, and if he messes up contact, oh well, on to the next fiction.

No it isn't. Alex is limited to fictional worlds he knows about that had mass appeal before he got the trans-dimensional technology. Visiting a particular world also prevents him from accessing other worlds that are too similar.

  So anyways, I have a lot of problems with is implementation, but this led me to the following moral question: In a multiverse where you can easily and quickly jump to the next universe over literally any time you want at zero cost, to what extent are the current set of human morals still relevant? In one universe, a woman crosses the street and is hit by a bus. Would a hypothetical traveler be morally obligated to perform a jump and save her in the next 'verse over?

How do you distinguish between a travel method that takes you to already existing worlds or generates them on demand? You can't and each have diametrically opposed moral imperatives. One wants you to travel to utopian universes and avoid bad ones, the other tells you to try and fix as many hell universes as you can.
