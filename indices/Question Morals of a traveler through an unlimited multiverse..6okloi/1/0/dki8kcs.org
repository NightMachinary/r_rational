You are correct. I misremembered the details of the story. I suppose I would edit my question to a hypothetical scenario that fits the details I described. (I still don't think he uses his abilities efficiently, though.)

The question, though, assumes as given the principle that these worlds all exist already. It's a hypothetical, since that cannot actually be proven.\\
In that instance, is he really obligated to fix as much as he can? Any more than us creatures stuck on the "default world" setting are obligated to ease the suffering of others? Or does his superior ability imply superior responsibility?
