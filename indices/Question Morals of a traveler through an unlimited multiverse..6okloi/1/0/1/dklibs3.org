I would question the assumption that humans on the "default world" are obliged to reduce the suffering of others. I might be convinced that we are obliged to reduce the suffering of others when it would not be too inconvenient for us, but I won't accept that we need to reduce suffering as much as we can.

If I came upon a man drowning in a lake, I would save him. If, however, I came upon a few million men drowning in lakes (under circumstances where I could save them one at a time), I would stop saving them at some point, because the cumulative inconvenience to me was too large. The fact that the men gain more utility from being saved than I lose by spending the rest of my life saving them doesn't put any obligation on me to spend the rest of my life saving them.

I don't actually need to travel to alternative universes to be in such a situation; I can save a lot of Africans from malaria if I use my entire wealth to do so, and I refuse, even though each individual African wouldn't cost much to save.
