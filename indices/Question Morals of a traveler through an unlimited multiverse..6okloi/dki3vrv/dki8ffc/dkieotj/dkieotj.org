  to what length does a reasonable expectation of moral interference extend to when the person in question has access to extraordinary means?

That's just the thing, innit? You're looking at a screen right now. There's a universe nearby where I crawled out of that screen like the girl from The Ring and you never got to finish reading this sentence because I killed you to death. The Ring girl is my go-to, because that's exceptionally implausible and also ridiculous; I can think of many more graphic and gruesome things that could be said here, but it feels very wrong to say them. The point is that Infinity means there's a version of you travelling through the multiverse doing things you would never do. There's a "me" in a universe that /exactly/ resembles this universe who stood up and left this comment unfinished and got in "my" car and got on the nearest highway and drove for 12 hours straight then veered into oncoming traffic at high speed causing 12 fatalities and 37 serious injuries. Infinity is terrifying. But the question was "In a multiverse where *you* can easily and quickly jump to the next universe over literally any time you want at zero cost, to what extent are the current set of human morals still relevant?" If I could snap my fingers and land in Narnia, I wouldn't immediately strangle Mr. and Mrs. Beaver just because there's an infinite number of identical Mr. and Mrs. Beavers in an infinite number of identical Narnias. The current set of human morals are relevant to the extent that you yourself are a moral person.

That wasn't as polished as it could've been. Eh. Point was made.

  I look forward to that vaguely implied point in spacetime when that becomes available for viewing, then.

A draft of a portion of the first chapter exists right now. The first four chapters might drop on Halloween or Thanksgiving (if I can manage to hold on to them that long), but if not then the first 10 chapters will all release on Christmas of this year. I assume the vaguely implied point in spacetime will occur some time after /next/ Christmas.
