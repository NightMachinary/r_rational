I was tempted to say, for a moment, that a battle between a Friendly AI and a Paperclip AI would probably resolve very quickly, multiversal or not. But then I realized that if there's the slightest chance they could reach stalemate, there are an infinite number of universes where a Friendly AI and a Paperclip AI are warring against each other and have reached a stalemate.

Interestingly, there would also be an infinite number of such conflicts in which a single human can break the balance and bring victory for the Friendly AI. It's highly unlikely, but that term is less than meaningless here.
