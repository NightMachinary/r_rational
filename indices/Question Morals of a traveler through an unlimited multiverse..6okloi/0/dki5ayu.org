A particular universe in such a multiverse would be defined by its complete history. Given that travel between universes is possible and that every possible universe exists, it follows that universes with every possible intervention (including none) at every possible moment of time already exist.

The woman is going to be saved in various universes by every possible combination of people, and pushed in front of the bus to begin with by every possible combination of people, and you will and won't decide to save her anyway.

In short, no such obligation exists unless you feel it does. Do whatever you think is in your enlightened self interest however you define that, which is really what we try to do anyway.
