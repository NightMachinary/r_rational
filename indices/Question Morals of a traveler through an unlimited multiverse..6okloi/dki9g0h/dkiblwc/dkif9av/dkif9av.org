I'm assuming the MC is the only multiverse traveller here, so he can give the friendly AIs an extra edge. For example, consider a universe where it just so happens that some basic resource X is incredibly useful, yet very scarce and cannot be produced. The MC could ferry over resource X from other universes and give it to the friendly AI in this universe, allowing it to construct more technologies that competing AIs do not have the resources to construct.
