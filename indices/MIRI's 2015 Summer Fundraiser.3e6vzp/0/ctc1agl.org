I thought about posting this here, but decided against it because it's not fictional. A fun fact: this is the first time for quite some time that [[https://intelligence.org/2015/07/01/grants-fundraisers/][MIRI is not doing donation matching.]] Apparently they want to instead put focus on exciting projects they could run with sufficient funding.

I personally feel very excited of how well MIRI's mission is going at the moment, they seem to have a lot of momentum. They also seem to be getting better and better at doing research that's possible to take seriously. Nate Soare's article [[https://intelligence.org/2015/07/16/an-astounding-year/][An Astounding Year]] made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside. Maybe we do have some hope.
