Qidian is a fairly new development for the online translation market, and a very unpopular one as well.

There are already enormous hordes of translators working at varying levels of consistency, quality and speed. There are already huge sites where readers can suggest new stories or vote for them. There are also large communities that translate movies, and most big youtube videos also have translated subtitles.

I really don't see where your idea can add to that. You propose to make a contest for every work you want translated. This requires finding several translators for every single work, which seems a difficult task. Even then, you effectively have to gather enough money that all the translators are interested for a mere chance of getting the money. For that much money, you could probably just straight up pay for the translation of several works, instead of forcing translators to gamble on a single one, with most of them leaving empty-handed.

Lastly, I don't see how this post fits the [[/r/rational]] subreddit.
