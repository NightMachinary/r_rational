  Qidian is a fairly new development for the online translation market, and a very unpopular one as well.

I'm not a big fan of it either but I am a big fan of FMMC which is only actively translated by Qidian. This idea came as a solution to my hunger for more frequent chapters.

  There are already enormous hordes of translators working
#+end_quote

They're not working on FMMC though and I have no way to incentivise them to do that. One problem is that they can not legally do it because Qidian owns the rights, the other problem is that they might not know / care about the story... but they might care about money.

  Even then, you effectively have to gather enough money that all the translators are interested for a mere chance of getting the money
#+end_quote

The translation quality of FMMC seems poor enough that I think it's safe to assume most 16-20 year olds could translate at that quality, say we were 1000 readers pooling 100$ per chapter, does that seem like a lot of money to the readers? Do you think Qidian is paying more than 100? I don't know the answer to these questions but I intend to find out
