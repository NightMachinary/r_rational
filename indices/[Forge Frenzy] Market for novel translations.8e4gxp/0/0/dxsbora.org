  You also seem to be advocating for a very different structure than is usual for crowdfunding projects;

Right, seems more appropriate a structure for this type of thing don't you think?

  it may be difficult to keep out people who just do a machine translation and then briefly edit the raw. Trying to ensure translation quality under those circumstances seems challenging...
#+end_quote

If I as a reader find the translation acceptable that's good enough, also the proof readers are invested in this since they payed money for the work, if they're not satisfied with any translation then no translators will get the money, this is the trust issue I mentioned

  Also, quite frankly, given that your business plan starts with trying to get money from poor people in poor countries, you might want to realistically consider whether that's enough of a market to be worth your time, or to fund the kind of translation that you want to read.

I don't plan to target only poor people, I just pointed out a market segment probably unfamiliar to most people from the west. I can remember clearly sites that payed you fractions of a cent to click on ads and working in a sort of pyramid structure to "make money online"; captcha resolving sites are similar. Another untapped market is children in non english speaking countries who know english well enough and wish to work in their spare time but no one will hire them.

What I love about this is that it gives people the opportunity to earn money whenever they want based solely on the merit of their work and it's free market shaped so I have no idea how much money the market will agree on for translations in general, might be higher than we can imagine.
