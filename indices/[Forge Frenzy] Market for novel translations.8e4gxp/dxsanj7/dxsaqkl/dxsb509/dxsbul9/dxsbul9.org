You mean this sort of thing is done for free as in the translations are already done for free right?

I got this idea reading [[https://www.webnovel.com/book/6838665402001705]] . While it is free the translation speed is not as fast as one might wish, not to mention there were periods when the translation was abandonded and got like one chapter per month. While these may be "free" for us Qidian pays for it and is making money from ads, I'm looking for a better monetization strategy
