Yeah, the point of bringing it up was that it's a setting conceit that's meant to make the world cooler, meant to be accepted and not thought about, as you say. Kind of like sound in space battles, but a bit more acceptable since it can be handwaved as "magic tech" rather than simply changing how reality works.

To look at an example, a lot of tension and action is communicated in Star Trek by people running through hallways, or falling over as the bridge rocks from explosions. People slowly navigating their way through a spaceship by kicking off things and delicately adjusting themselves into chairs isn't nearly as visually engaging in most circumstances.

Of course, part of this is just the result of realistic budget constraints when filming. But a lot of subtle "coolness" in spaceship stories comes from being able to ignore the lack of gravity in ships.
