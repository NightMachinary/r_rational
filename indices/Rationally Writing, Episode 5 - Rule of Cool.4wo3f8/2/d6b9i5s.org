I don't think something like artificial gravity in spaceships is rule of cool at all. It's not there to be cool. In fact, it's not even there to be noticed--it's there to be ignored. /Lack of/ artificial gravity, even though more realistic, would be noticed.

The episode even mentions scene-setting, which artificial gravity is closer to.
