In my opinion it's not necessary to have a rational premise, just to rationally explore all the implications of the premise.

In HPMOR magic doesn't make sense, in The Metropolitan Man or Worm superpowers don't make sense, in Frozen creating a sentient snowman doesn't make sense. To me lightsabers are the same sort of thing, there's no need for them to have a scientific explanation.

When you come up with a story, I think you can say that some things just are, even if they are ridiculous. Then you just gotta explore everything that happens from that point on.

I kinda think that this is the whole point of scifi, rational or not. To ask a cool "What if?" question("What if we could travel faster than light?", "What if we could have lightsabers?"), and then figure out how the world would look like.

The perfect example of this is [[http://what-if.xkcd.com][What if?]] by xkcd. He starts with something absolutely silly([[http://what-if.xkcd.com/1/][throwing a baseball at 90% of the speed of light]], [[http://what-if.xkcd.com/4/][a planet made out of moles]], etc), and from there rationality and science take over.
