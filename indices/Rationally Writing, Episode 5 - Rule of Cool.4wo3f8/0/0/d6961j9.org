That was covered in the podcast. Even if it's implausible, you can make it rational by elaborating on the idea.

So for example in The Metropolitan Man (written by one of the hosts of this podcast), Superman is a fundamentally impossible entity. However, assuming that he /is/ possible, what would you expect the world to look like?

Well, for starters people would freak the hell out about privacy. Superman can literally see through every material except lead; it's an order of magnitude more personal than government spying, both because it's physical (seeing you rather than data you leave behind) and because it's one person.

So in the story, people start lining their houses with lead, encouraged by Lex Luthor. This greatly diminishes the value of the ability, because lead linings no longer map one-to-one with criminal activity. This in an instance of both the public and Luthor reacting rationally.

By contrast in the canon settings everyone is more or less okay with an invulnerable demigod watching them so thoroughly that he can spot crimes before they happen. People don't react to the information the stories introduce, because the writers thought only as far as "Wouldn't it be cool if..." (and, to be fair to them, the majority of their readers don't care anyway and in fact prefer the "cool" factor).
