This means so much to me as your Superman story was absolutely amazing.

The thing is I might have his parents die during the Metropolis bombings that happened in Metropolitan Man. But if I set the story up like that then the story would take place sometime after or maybe during WWII because I could always age Bruce up and have him be a 14-15 year old spoiled brat that ends up being deeply scarred by his parents deaths.

The thing that I might do when portraying Bruce is to have him resemble a somewhat more well-minded Rorschach. But I'd love to make it as close and well fitted to the world that you made for Metropolitan Man.

I'd also like to tell that I have, in my own head cannon, Metropolis in Delaware, Gotham City in New Jersey, Bl√ºdhaven is also in New Jersey. Fawcett City is in Wisconsin, Central City is in Missouri, Keystone City and Smallville are in Kansas, Coast City is in California. This is the geography I wanted to set up and I'd like to know if it's rational.
