Well with the geography I had in mind that Metropolis was built upon a gold mine many years back and as time passed the city expanded into what it is today.

Metropolis in my eyes is still relatively old-fashioned compared to other cities in other states, so transportation is slowly integrating into society but not as quickly as other states have done in their cities.

For Gotham, I'll be honest I just figured that it being called Gotham City gave way for me to put it in some state rather than making it it's own state.
