Frank Miller said that Metropolis is New York City during the day, and Gotham City is New York City during the night. I think this makes a lot of symbolic sense, but doesn't make any /literal/ sense whatsoever.

Canonically, Metropolis is (usually) New York City, and Gotham City is (usually) across the river in New Jersey ... which doesn't actually make that much sense, but that's what /Batman v Superman/ went with.

For /Metropolitan Man/, I think that I had Gotham City as replacing Chicago, but if it was mentioned at all, it was only in passing, and I'm not sure enough information was given to infer that.

I think your geographical layout works. The thing you have to keep in mind if you're monkeying around with geography is that cities exist for a reason, and that reason is usually dictated by 1) distance from other cities and 2) access to transportation or 3) access to valuable raw materials. I'm one of those geographical determinist people who think that given a height map of a continent and a rough tracing of riverways, you could predict where all the most major cities would end up with good accuracy. The big thing is not having big cities too close together, unless they're twin cities (e.g. Minneapolis and St. Paul), or there's a good reason.

What origin you want Batman to have probably depends on what themes and ideas you want to write about for him, e.g. if you want to tackle systemic issues that give rise to crime, then you can have his parents be the victims of said systemic crime. If you want to examine organized crime, game theory, defection from society, etc., then you can tie their death into that (as the comics occasionally do). If you want a focus on moral philosophy, then having them be the victims of someone's answer to the trolley problem might work best. (Though I don't think, as a general writing thing, that it's always best to tie everything back to your central thesis.)
