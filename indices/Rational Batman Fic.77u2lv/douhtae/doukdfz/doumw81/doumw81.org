There is an Elseworlds story where that happens, but in the main continuity, there's an interesting reason he's not a Lantern; he has the Willpower, but too much Fear to be a Green Lantern. He also has the ability to instill Fear, but too much Willpower to be a Sinestro Lantern. Both rings rejected him for those reasons. Maybe you can explore that, and maybe at some point have him wield both rings at once?

I'd also make Superman a Blue Lantern if the Blue Lanterns weren't useless on their own. That's one thing I dislike about the Blue Lanterns; they can only use their powers in combination with a Green Lantern, because the Blue Lantern Corps was built specifically to aid the Green Lanterns. Bit strange. The Lantern corner of the DC Multiverse has so many inconsistencies. One that particularly bothers me is that the Green Lantern special ops that wear all black have magenta-colored constructs. Like what.
