I'd suggest you have it take place in the present where the Justice League are the old and established heroes. Yes they'll be a bit old but their experience puts them at the top of the line in terms of crime fighting. I'd prefer to have Batman as the first superhero, interestingly enough, with him as the first symbol to strike fear into the hearts of criminals, Superman will be inspired to do the exact opposite of that and be a symbol of hope.

I'd also have Superman crash land on earth in the mid to possibly late 70s maybe the 60s. Batman would be at his peak at forty three maybe 39 years old.

Wonder Woman can be reconstructed in a lot of ways. But those were just my ideas on what you could to do.
