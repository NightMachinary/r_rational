Raven and Wonder Woman share many similarities. Raven's mom was some drugged up teenager in Gotham who basically joined a cult that summoned the demon Trigon, who impregnated her. However, Raven's mom was contacted by the people of Azerath, a realm of mostly women who purged all negative emotions from themselves and lived in peace together (Trigon being the embodiment of all negative emotions of Azerath, and possibly the entire Multiverse iirc).

Functionally, Azerath and Themyscira are pretty similar. Main different being that Trigon usually destroys Azerath (where Raven grows up), which is why Raven lives on Earth with the Teen Titans anyway. And all the important Wonder Woman stuff you can witness in the movie. And the Olympian God stuff kinda ties into the New God stuff with Apokolips and New Genesis. The Shazam stuff is also kinda related. It's all interesting how it ties together.
