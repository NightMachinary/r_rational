That can work. That sounds a lot like the Young Justice show, too: the League is well established, so the focus is on the younger heroes. However, I really really like origin stories which is why I love things like Batman Begins and Smallville. To me, there's something epic about seeing an icon's beginning. Had the same feeling with Casino Royale, X-Men: First Class and even Straight Outta Compton. And Smallville season 10 (which I'm still watching by the way, but very slowly due to the demands of college) is absolutely beautiful, since it's the culmination of Clark's 10-year journey in discovering who he really is and becoming the world's greatest (or at least most iconic) flagship hero.

I might do a thing where Superman and Batman (and Wonder Woman, to complete out the Trinity) are the first heroes of the modern age, but that there were some covert heroics in the 30s to the 80s. Coincidentally it's all very similar to Watchmen, and the Incredibles to an extent. Before the Justice League is created, the flagship heroes learn about the Justice Society and whatever covert things they were up to, and they want to revive that organization (in the form of the League) to combat some impending threat. There will be a "status quo" of normalcy in the world, with coverups abound due to the work of Amanda Waller and the DEO, up until Superman reveals himself to the world. The Batman vigilante will have been around, sure, but street-scale urban legends are less likely to attract worldwide attention than a man in bright colors flying around and saving people in broad daylight.

Batman has to get involved with Superman because of something in Bruce's life that is hugely affected by the "Coming of the Superman" or of some threat that he knows is coming (kinda like the Justice League animated series where they meet up investigating an impending Martian invasion). Except of course I'll have Batman focused more or less on Gotham crime until some catalyst leads him to pay more attention to global threats (maybe some Gotham criminals lead him to some other places in the world, and I can have an international espionage type story). I'd like my Batman to slowly increase his focus range, and this will coincide with him realizing he can't do things alone, and this leads into the creation of the Batman Family. This is how he gets used to the idea of working with other people, which is super important when the League founding arc comes into play.

I want the Superman/Batman pre-League arc to be a major chapter in both of their lives, and it affects Dick Grayson's life too. Little known fact: the Nightwing is the name of a Kryptonian vigilante before Krypton's destruction. Nightwing and Flamebird was the duo, and I think there was a story arc during which Superman and Jimmy Olsen went to the shrunken bottle city of Kandor, Supes taking on the role of Nightwing and Jimmy being Flamebird, and I think Superman's acting as the Nightwing and his interactions with Jimmy's Flamebird was inspired by Batman and Robin. So however I have Superman mention to Batman and Robin the vigilantes Nightwing and Flamebird, this is what inspires Dick Grayson's Robin to take on the mantle of Nightwing, because that was the closest thing Krypton had to Batman himself (which he wants his Nightwing persona to be similar to, but distinct from enough at the same time). And then later on when Dick Grayson becomes the Nightwing, his relationship with Starfire leads to her calling herself the Flamebird. All these connections will truly remind the reader (or audience, if I decide to make this into an indie animated thing which I might do since that's my major) that there is a larger world here, and characters will be affected by the characters and events at the different "levels" of the DC Multiverse (whether it be the street level, international level, space level, myth level, etc.).

Also Composite Man is very similar to (the Dark Knight version of) Two-Face in a lot of ways. Guy named Joseph Meach, Superman trusted him enough to have him work for him at the Fortress of Solitude, so he probably starts out as a really good guy but he somehow turns evil when he gets the powers of the Legion of Super-Heroes' main Legionnaires, and he has that split-face appearance. Due to that design of looking half-Superman and half-Batman, he should first appear as a villain to both of them, probably because he knows or is a huge fan of the two heroes (the green skin will just be an effect of the lightning bolt that gave him his powers, and/or I can relate him to Brainiac in some way since I want Brainiac to be an immense villain in the story at some point). It'll be unconventional but Composite Man's appearance alone means he ought to be a villain for a Superman/Batman "World's Finest" teamup story.

Red Tornado will be the hardest one to explore, cuz I have to connect like 4 different characters into (his) story. There will be the first, Ma Hunkel Red Tornado on the JSA, who inspires TO Morrow's construction of the Red Tornado android, except that'll somehow also have to tie into Adam Strange's adventures on the Planet Rann and the Rannian "Red Tornado" wind elemental creature called Ulthoon. Hard to figure out which comes first in that regard, but at least maybe the android is a combination of Morrow's tech (possibly also funded by the military and oversaw by Sam Lane) and the Rannian wind spirit, which is how it has seemingly magical control over wind.

I also want to use characters made up for the DC movies and shows that didn't originate in the comics. Popularly known characters and concepts are Kryptonite (originated in the radio show rather than the comics), Harley Quinn (Batman TAS), Mercy Graves (Superman TAS), but I also wanna use characters and concepts made up in Smallville (Chloe Sullivan, Virgil Swann, the Teagues, the Veritas group, 33.1, Vordigan, Milton Fine, Lionel Luthor, Lillian Luthor, Lucas Luthor, Julian Luthor, Grant Gabriel, etc.), the CW shows (Harrison Wells, Tess Morgan, Eddie Thawne, Joe West, Alex Danvers, Time Wraiths, the way they did Savitar, etc.), the DCEU (June Finch, Calvin Swanwick, etc.), the Nolanverse (Rachel Dawes, John Robin Blake, etc.), even the Donnerverse (Richard and Jason White, Eve Teschmacher, Non, Ursa, Leonard Luthor, etc.).

A lot of research going into this. I just love the idea of creating a quintessential, [D]efinitive [C]hronicle of these characters and adventures.
