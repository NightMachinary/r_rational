Oh okay. You gonna do any Earth-2 stuff with this or JSA? Or are you just going to mention all the A-list heroes like Green Lantern (Hal Jordan and onwards, not Alan Scott), Aquaman, Flash (Barry Allen and onwards, not Jay Garrick), Wonder Woman?

I have a personal fondness for obscure heroes, probably because they give me a bit more creative freedom. Like who cares if I make the Challengers of the Unknown the discoverers of the Speed Force? Who even cares if I amalgamate the concept of the Speed Force with Hypertime for more rational self-consistency? Lol.
