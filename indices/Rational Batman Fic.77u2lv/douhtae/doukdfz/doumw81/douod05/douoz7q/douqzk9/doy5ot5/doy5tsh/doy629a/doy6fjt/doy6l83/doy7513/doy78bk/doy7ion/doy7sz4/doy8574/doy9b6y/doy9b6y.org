Yes, basically. And I haven't decided on whether or not to have Earth-2 at all. I like the idea of a historical JSA in the same continuity, but I'd also prefer having Superman be the "first" hero of the modern age, and all other heroes are inspired by him. Except, would Batman exist before (just in the shadows) or after? And I don't really want Superman's story to be a 30s period piece because I specifically want Superman's arc to near its end when he basically changes the world forever for the better, and humanity moves towards a more advanced age (kind like how the people of Star Trek have kinda eliminated racism, poverty and war), and the Legion of Super-Heroes is on the horizon.

I also grapple with if I should have a Smallville-esque mini version of the Justice League before Superman ever goes public, or if I should have a more epic gathering of the Justice League when the world needs it most (on the cusp of an invasion either by White Martians or Starro the Conqueror).

Also the show Young Justice serves as great inspiration because of how shockingly well it handles and integrates the DC lore, from having characters like Guardian and Sportsmaster appear, to even doing plot arcs revolving around Dr. Fate, Red Tornado, Adam Strange on the planet Rann, etc.

Also yes, I wanna make a grand unified DC universe, but the Multiverse is still an important part of DC lore, especially when dealing with the Flash and the various Crises, but that's for later on in the overall progression of the story. I've had to carefully look at how each hero's journey ends. For instance, I kinda like the Dark Knight Trilogy's end for Batman, being that being Batman is good for the city but ultimately self-destructive to the point where all his loved ones have left him, even Alfred. Basically I think it's Batman's destiny to retire and have a family, but leave behind a legacy (be it to John Blake, Terry McGuinnes, or whoever else). The Batman timeline will be confusing to figure out, since even the New 52 kinda flubbed up with how Batman has a 12 year old son even though his journeys as the Batman has only been some 5 years up to that point. But I like how huge the Batman Family is.

The Superman Family is actually a tad less difficult, cuz it's usually just Kara, Connor and maybe a Jon Kent the second. But then there's also the Superman Dynasty which is immense, and the Superman Dynasty's genealogies are all over the place. Also there are like 6 different Supergirls in the same continuity. There's the Matrix Supergirl, there's Kara Zor-El, there's a couple other weirder ones...

Now Superman and Batman I can at least understand. But Wonder Woman goes down a rabbit hole of Greek Mythology which kinda has to be modernized to an extent a tie into the New Gods. And there's the Green Lantern stuff which I would like to change up a bit, either to make the colors correspond to the actual spectrum of light (red, yellow, green, cyan, blue and magenta) which is more rational than the tradition-stuck ROYGBIV model. I'd make the Blue Lanterns not useless, the Indigo Tribe less dumb, and the White Lanterns not have the same powers as the Indigo Tribe. There's also the Phantom Lantern, and a better explanation for what the hell Alan Scott was since he isn't technically a member of the actual Lantern Corps...

Wonder Woman's invisible jet will be fun to figure out. The jet being a weird alien life form in some continuities seems fun but also reminds me of a TARDIS from Doctor Who.

My favorite villain is Reverse-Flash so imma have some interesting stories with him I'm sure. He's so fascinating to me. And weird ones like Composite Man, Mr. Mxyzptlk, Dabney Donovan... it'll all be neat.
