Well I am curious as to how the Justice League movie handles Lanterns cuz we haven't seen any Lanterns yet but we know they exist due to a line in one of the trailers. Usually GL is one of the founding members so his absence is interesting, and it can't solely be due to the unpopularity of his movie from 6 years ago. They've already done interesting and different stuff with Kryptonians and Amazons in the DCEU, so I wonder what of the Lanterns?

How do you tie the Justice Society into all this? I find it a bit of a challenge incorporating them in, although since this is the 30s, you can probably just have the first iteration of the League be the Justice Society, and introduce all the Golden Age heroes like Mr. Terrific, Hourman, Hawkman, Dr. Fate, etc. (or you can just relegate them to Earth-2 if you don't wanna use them of course). Interestingly enough, I think that Sandman (Wesley Dodds) is sorta like the JSA counterpart of Batman, since he's a masked vigilante who doesn't kill and instead knocks out his opponents with sleeping gas. That kind of ability and the fact he wears a gas mask would kinda make him a bit of a loner unless he expects all his teammates to wear gas masks too. Anyway off-topic.

My own DC fanfic is gonna try and incorporate as much obscure DC lore as I can, from the JSA to the Doom Patrol to the Legion of Super-Heroes to the Challengers of the Unknown. You don't have to, but there's interesting lore nuggets in there. For example, Hourman's pill which gave him super strength for an hour, Miraclo, is the chemical precursor to the Venom serum that Bane uses.
