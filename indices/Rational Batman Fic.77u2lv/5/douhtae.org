Sounds great! Though I should read Metropolitan Man. For years I've been considering doing a DC fanfiction, especially one about Superman, but I want to challenge myself (especially for the rationalist genre) by using some weird enemies like Composite Man and such. Shit, imagine that.

The DC multiverse is so crazy and expansive. Remember that, even for a Batman story. How many elements of the DC Multiverse are you putting into the story? Remember some of the newer stuff like the Court of Owls, cuz that could be neat to see in a rationalist fic.
