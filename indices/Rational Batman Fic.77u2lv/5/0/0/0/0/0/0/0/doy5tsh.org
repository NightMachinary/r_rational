Well Atlantis will be a discovery in my story which will radically change the world of my fanfic. But from Metropolitan Man Alexander said that he had two cliffhangers for mercy graves (Lex Luthor's assistant) he said that he'd either make her Raven or Wonder Woman or have some ties to Wonder Woman so if I use that as a stepping stone mercy could become an important character in my story too.
