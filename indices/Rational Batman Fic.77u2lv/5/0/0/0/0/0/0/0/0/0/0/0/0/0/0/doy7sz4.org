It's an ambitious project since I actually need to do research into a lot of comics for certain characters. By favorite DC hero is Superman so I want to make not a deconstruction like MM, but more of a quintessential Superman. Kinda like the All-Star Superman, but slightly more modernized and with some inspiration from Smallville. (I was a huge fan of Man of Steel for a couple years, then I watched Smallville and I see that as the definitive Clark Kent, though he is unfortunately isolated from the rest of the DC world since the show couldn't get the rights to Batman or Wonder Woman, and Green Lantern probably would've been too "weird" or expensive back then.) I want to make a version of Superman a bit more like the Reeve one in terms of personality, but rationalized a bit more so the camp isn't there. It can be done, just look at how the Marvel movies did Captain America! Hell, arguably the Supergirl show version of Superman is more in line with the original spirit of the character than in postmodern deconstructions that don't quite do the character /right/.
