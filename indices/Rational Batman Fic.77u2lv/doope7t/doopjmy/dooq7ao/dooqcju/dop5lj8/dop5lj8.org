One thing that can be simultaneously really easy and really hard is to write a stand-alone vignette that, in your mind, fits into a larger narrative. The key is not to over-plan the big story but to make the little piece really good. My expertise is in academic writing rather than fiction, but I find that no large outline remains unchanged after you flesh out a small piece of it.
