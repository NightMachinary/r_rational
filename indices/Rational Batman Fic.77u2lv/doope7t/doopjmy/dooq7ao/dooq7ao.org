Worldbuilding is all well and good, and you'll want plenty of that in place before you set out to do serious writing.

However, you should have some practice doing non-serious writing before you sit down to attempt serious writing... in much the same sense that you should have some practice running before you attempt a marathon.

Having ambitious goals is a /good/ thing, but if you want to achieve those goals, it's probably best to start with more modest goals and work up from there. That's not to say that NaNoWriMo is easy (50,000 words is a lot, and /will/ kick your ass if you take it lightly), but it's a more concrete goal than most writing goals tend to be, which makes it excellent as a practice target.
