  Why doesn't he just fund poverty reduction programs?
#+end_quote

Okay, I want to address that one criticism, because I see it every time someone talks about Batman, and it's empirically false.

In basically every single long-running Batman story, he does fund poverty reduction programs. He's both a vigilante /and/ a playboy philanthropist. You have stories with Bruce Wayne funding scholarships, museums, Gotham City police, shelters, Arkham Asylum, etc.

The idea that "Batman tries to solve crime through punching people in the face because he / the writers / the readers are too dumb to realize that it would make more sense to fund charities instead" strikes me as baseless smugness. There is no need to justify Batman not funding charities, because Batman does fund charities.
