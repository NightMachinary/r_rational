  Okay, I want to address that one criticism, because I see it every time someone talks about Batman, and it's empirically false.

  In basically every single long-running Batman story, he does fund poverty reduction programs. He's both a vigilante and a playboy philanthropist. You have stories with Bruce Wayne funding scholarships, museums, Gotham City police, shelters, Arkham Asylum, etc.

I think you're missing the point - Bruce Wayne spends huge amounts of money on his vigilante equipment, which could instead be spent on other programs. The /batman/ has a huge opportunity cost.
