One of the strengths of /good/ rational fics is that they enhance elements in the original even if making fun of them. Illogical wand movements in HPMOR, Superman being genuinely heroic in Metro Man, the vampires' characterizations in Luminosity - you don't write fanfic by removing core elements, although you can go into more detail about or twist them.

So the core of Batman is that he's crazy, that he's rich, that he's fighting a one-man war on crime. Have him do things smart people would do in that situation, and then think of an in-universe reason it /doesn't work/.

Why doesn't he just fund poverty reduction programs? Have Bruce try that, and then realize Gotham's corrupt as shit, murderous weirdos in costumes are still around, and in a world where supervillains are around superheroes are /actually/ useful.

Why doesn't he kill? Well, his Rogue's Gallery keeps coming back, right? Or maybe because he knows that if he goes unhinged, he'll stay unhinged. Explore that.

Why doesn't he use superpowers? Well... Maybe he decides to, after all? Maybe he seeks out magic or super-tech to be prepared, but wants to avoid escalation with supervillains?
