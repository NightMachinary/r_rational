My view of Batman, and DC in general, is that there is a heavily mythological element to them; that is to say, there are lots of different Batman stories, and Batman gets written through many different and conflicting lenses by authors who are trying to make different points about either the character, or their culture, or the role of the character within their culture.

Here are the ideas that I think are interesting about Batman:

1. Batman is at least partly responsible for the criminality problem in Gotham, in the same way that the American justice system's focus on prison-as-punishment and the militarization of police are partly responsible for the degradation of communities and the perpetuation of crime.
2. Batman is psychologically crippled by the deaths of his parents and channels that psychological dysfunction into his work /as/ Batman. You can go several different ways with this; he does it unknowingly but it's apparent to the people who know him, he does it knowingly because he thinks that the good he does as Batman means working on his problems would be to the detriment of society (in the same way an artist might want to stay an alcoholic because they think it allows them to produce better art), etc.
3. Batman is paranoid to a fault, unwilling to trust anyone, unwilling to put confidence in anyone that he does trust, with a penchant for surveillance and violations of privacy, and without a real respect for the rule of law. The parallels to post-9/11 America practically write themselves!
4. Batman inherently represents a class struggle. He's a billionaire with lots of fancy equipment and all the benefits of privilege, and his rogue's gallery consists largely of those who are trodden-down and/or mentally impaired.
5. Batman (usually) doesn't kill, but where Superman doesn't kill because he's an eternal optimist, Batman doesn't kill because ... well, you can fabricate your own answer. Maybe he thinks that death is the ultimate tragedy, and the idea of sending one more person into the abyss produces such a revulsion in him that he can't bring himself to do it. More commonly he thinks it would put him on the other side of the line of acceptable vigilantism. My personal take would be that he /really, really/ wants to kill, and the reason he doesn't kill is that he thinks his first murder would send him over the edge, in the same way that some people can look at heroin and know in their heart that they would be addicted from the first moment, because they understand their own personality that well.

There have been a /lot/ of Batman stories, and a lot of these things have been explored in depth, but I think there's plenty of room for doing a rational take on them.
