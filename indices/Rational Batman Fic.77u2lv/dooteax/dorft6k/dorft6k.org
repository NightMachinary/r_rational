Uh, that's interesting. The take on Batman you're describing is the exact opposite of the take on Batman that I follow.

I think [[http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=27397][Shamus Young put it best]]. Batman as a premise is fundamentally bent for purely editorial reasons, and trying to fit him into of the above categories either doesn't fit the categories, or breaks the Batman premise.

I'm not sure quite how to put it. It's like, I like rational fiction, and fiction on general, to be meaningful. I like it to have a consistent logic, and for that logic to be based on real-world logic. I feel the best works of fiction are the ones that "bend" narrative causality, ideas like "the hero should win" or "interesting dramatic things should happen" and other demands of fiction, until the story is roughly shaped like real life.

I feel that ideas like "Batman doesn't kill because it would be addictive" or "Batman represents the rich crushing the poor under their strength" do the opposite. They take real world concepts, and bend them until more or less fit story demands. I don't like this, because I feel this is the opposite of useful.

I really don't like this type of thinking in general; I think it uses / stimulates the same brain gears that make people go "9/11 was an inside job" or "Idiocracy is so real". Or, for a completely different fandom, "the Prequels actually have a deep philosophical message about how the Jedi order is too static and outdated to cope with the reality of their world".

On the other hand, these themes are all good, and probably make for interesting stories. I just... feel like they're the opposite of rational, somehow? They're not what I'd want from the "official" rational Batman story.

EDIT: Actually, Shamus Young put it way better than I do in the article I linked:

  But what's most interesting to me is how people continually try to impose order on the chaos. There are two ways you can look at the bent nature of Batman:

  - This is stupid. I'm done.

  - This doesn't make total sense, but I'm on board because I really dig this detective-and-brawling stuff.

  But some people try to forge a third way: They try to say the inherent nonsense is saying something. They look for a message in the madness. A reason for the eternal struggle.
