Based on your post, my impression is that you don't have a lot of experience writing. This is nothing to be ashamed of; experience is something you gather over time, with practice. Accordingly, my suggestion is; don't hesitate, just rush into writing. Practice is something you get by doing, after all.

That said, Rational Fiction is a bit of a high bar, and requires a bit of preparation and forethought that you are probably not accustomed to, given that you're asking for basic advice and ideas here. That's not to say that you shouldn't try... but you might want to consider something a little less ambitious, as early practice writing.

Note that November is coming up, and that means [[https://nanowrimo.org][NaNoWriMo]] is just around the corner. I'd strongly suggest that you start there. Don't set yourself up against your favorite author in writing something exceptional; just write something, and write a lot of it. NaNoWriMo isn't about /good/ writing; it's about getting into a habit of writing /anything/, which is a necessary precondition to writing anything good.
