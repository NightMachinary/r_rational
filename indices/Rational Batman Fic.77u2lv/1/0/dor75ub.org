I partly agree and partly disagree.

Superman within /Metropolitan Man/ is mostly there as a tragic figure, who contains the seeds of his own self-destruction in the form of both his overly-rigid and incompatible-with-the-real-world moral code, and in his inability to deal with his empathic side and attempts to retain some scraps of humanity (though I will say that I have four years of experience under my belt since writing it, and probably would have been able to do the whole thing better now - it's not a story without flaws). He doesn't follow the path of the traditional hero's story, which normally ends with the hero having grappled with their problems and become the stronger for it.

I think that if you /do/ want a traditional hero's story, then you /should/ figure out what the compelling flaws of the character are, because /that's/ the thing that's at the center of your story; it's what the character is forced to confront, and is the (occasionally metaphorical) source of their triumph at the end.

I'm pretty sure that a skilled writer could do this for almost any of the troubling aspects of Batman. Nolan already did "Batman as paranoid surveillance state" in /The Dark Knight/. The plot of /The Lego Batman Movie/ was basically that Batman was too much of a loner.

Heck, if you wanted to do an inspirational/affirmational "Batman as class struggle" story, one where, at the end, Batman is still ideal-driven and inspirational, all you'd really need is a good villain, like Lex Luthor, who can do a "Not So Different" speech at the end which Batman then refutes. Depending on how far down the rabbit hole you want to go, you then structure the plot so that it touches on things like the relationship between capital and labor, the necessity of an organizing force within society, maybe something about the inevitability of the rich given their incentives, etc. Or, somewhat more classically, you have Batman brought down to the level of the common man /but still be Batman/ and learn some lessons about crime as a systemic issue, or how to identify with people who commit crimes, before he (somehow) returns to power (again, still Batman) with a new perspective on what the city and people of Gotham actually need of him.

(And if you wanted Batman to be a tragic figure, he would be undone by his flaws rather than learning from them and eventually overcoming them.)
