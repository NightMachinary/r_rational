Speaking as possibly the only person on this sub who doesn't like Metropolitan Man, I think it's very important that you decide whether you are writing a deconstruction of Batman before you start. MM isn't a bad story, but I can't see it as a Superman story. Thematically, the superhero genre is about people with power using that power to fight injustice. It's escapism, but it's the kind of escapism people need in order to inspire them to follow the same ideals by example. That's the purpose of heroic characters in storytelling, while anti-heroes are defined by their contrast with heroes.

[[/u/alexanderwales][u/alexanderwales]] brings up interesting ideas for exploring Batman's character, but most seem to lead in the direction of preying on his faults instead of simply using them to generate complications on the way to a satisfying conclusion. It's not that I think deconstructing heroic characters is a bad thing to do, I just don't find it satisfying to read. I want to see Batman succeed at being Batman because of the virtues that he represents and flaws he overcomes on the way there. That's why I love the interpretation of him as wanting to kill, but ultimately resisting it.

I want to see him get called out for being an asshole with a martyr complex, but only when he overcomes those fault A over the course of the story with support from others. I don't want to see Batman be symbolic of a class struggle because what he's supposed to represent how much we want people with power to use their power to help others however they can. The debate over his methods is meant to make the audience what lengths /we will go to/, and seeing Batman choose to never compromise his principles inspires us to do the same.
