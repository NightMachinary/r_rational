I'd forgotten about the trope of the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicHero][Tragic Hero]], though it's hard not to view such a reimagining of an established character as a commentary on the original. Maybe it doesn't count as a deconstruction and I just hate tragedies.

I can't think of any tragedy that I've ever been glad I read. I don't even like episodes of The Twilight Zone with sad endings, though I have loved /some/ of Black Mirror's horrific social satire. With the possible exception of Walter White, I've never enjoyed the story of a tragic hero.

I love the original Frankenstein but that's more of a horror story, respect for Of Mice and Men was drilled into me so hard I have no idea if I actually if I actually like it, and Old English writing was incomprehensible to me as a kid so I grew up hating Shakespeare.
