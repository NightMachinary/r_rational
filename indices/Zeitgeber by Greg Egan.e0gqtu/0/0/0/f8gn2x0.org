Oh I was misunderstanding it.

Didn't she switch suddenly from normal sleep to waking up at night?

That's much worse. Still anything to relieve electricity, water, road, Internet, health services, etc peaks, you'd just work progressive shifts and so would everyone else.

If it's ten minutes every 24 hours, that's an hour a week. You probably need two hours before or after work of not working to be safe and not so tired.

So 12 hours. With 8 hours of sleep it means you'd need to move your shift forward every 24 days? Call it a month because people have a lot more flexibility than that even with people on 24 hour cycles.

Also I find that change far more improbable than shifting the circadian rhythm off. It's not like most people are bang on 24 hours cycle. If that was all it was then staying up an extra hour would be all you'd need like people who mess their sleep schedule up normally. Much better imo if all the normal indicators for sleep schedule is working normally but their body reacts slow to it (by up to a day lag). That would also mean that moving countries wouldn't work but initially I assumed it was magic when I was writing my comment.

It also makes long term human relationships much more feasible since you'll be together after some months or years at the most. Worse for two runners one who is 10 minutes ahead and the other who is 9 minutes 59 seconds ahead. Those guys will take forever to meet.
