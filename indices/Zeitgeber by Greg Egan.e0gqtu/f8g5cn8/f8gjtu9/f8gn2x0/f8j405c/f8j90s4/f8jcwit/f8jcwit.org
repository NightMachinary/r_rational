It's more like they are on a whole new cycle, governed by something internal.

It's sort of handwaved, but the most charitable interpretation is that the virus(or whatever causes it) has hijacked the system so rather than an external signal it uses some internal one (their 'inner sun'). In dark rooms the body still relies on external signals - they just never come.

  No one has done an extended version of that because it is torture but I wonder if it stabilises or if they stay awake for 6 hours and sleep for a few.

Typically they seem to extend their 'day-sleep' cycle to up to 48 hours, by sleeping more at once and being awake for longer.

Having said that, I just read [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circadian_rhythm#Effect_of_light%E2%80%93dark_cycle][this wikipedia passage]] and I think the whole story is based on it, without realizing that the cycles often become hours longer, not just minutes

  The rhythm is linked to the light--dark cycle. Animals, including humans, kept in *total darkness for extended periods eventually function with a free-running rhythm*. Their sleep cycle is pushed back or forward each "day", depending on whether their "day", their endogenous period, /is shorter or longer than 24 hours/. The environmental cues that reset the rhythms each day are called *zeitgebers* (from the German, "time-givers")...

  Free-running organisms that normally have one or two consolidated sleep episodes will still have them when in an environment shielded from external cues, but the rhythm is not entrained to the 24-hour light--dark cycle in nature. The sleep--wake rhythm may, in these circumstances, become out of phase with other circadian or ultradian rhythms such as metabolic, hormonal, CNS electrical, or neurotransmitter rhythms.

So I think he read the '/is shorter or longer than 24 hours/' part (possibly even on the same wiki), and didn't dig into it to see that it's way more frequent for cycles to extend than to shorten and very frequent for the cycles to be longer by hours.
