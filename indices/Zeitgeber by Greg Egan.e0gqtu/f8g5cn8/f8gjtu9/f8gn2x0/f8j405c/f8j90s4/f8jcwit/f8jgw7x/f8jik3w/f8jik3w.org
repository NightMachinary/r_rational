Their internal time in the sense of guessing how much time has passed is separate from their circadian rhythm in real life (in this book somehow everyone has a perfect internal clock accurate to within 5 minutes - either a plot device or indication that the internal sun is the controling stimuli).

There is a lot of variance and I think you are correct that this is what happened in that case. Fwiw, 3-4 days are not enough for the body to 'adapt' so not the best comparison - I am mainly looking at longer cases.

Take [[https://nypost.com/2017/01/22/this-explorer-discovered-human-time-warp-by-living-in-a-cave/][this one]] for example, which seems to be fairly typical:

  For the first five weeks, he later learned, he lived on a 26-hour circadian cycle. On day 37, which to him was day 30, he experienced a strange break from routine and a shift in patterns, living through an overly long day, then sleeping for 15 hours. After this, his days fluctuated wildly, from 26 hours to sometimes as long as 40 or 50.

  He emerged on Feb. 14, 2000 --- 76 days later, although he believed it was Feb. 5.

It seems common for them to think that a long sleep is just a nap, so they often think it's earlier than it is (also their cycles more often become longer as I've mentioned).
