Oh so nothing has changed about their cycle they've just become unable to fix their internal clock from eternal stimuli?

In that case I think they'd be off by far more than ten minutes a day. Look at mind field episode where he was trapped in unchanging room for three days, he was already twelve hours ahead internally.

No one has done an extended version of that because it is torture but I wonder if it stabilises or if they stay awake for 6 hours and sleep for a few.

Could try it with multiple people to dent the isolation effects. But they will take signals from each other.

People can't predict how long they sleep for even one night without external cues
