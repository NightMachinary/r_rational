I think you're misunderstanding the situation.

It's not that these people have 24-hour circadian rhythms that don't line up with those of other people, it's that they have circadian rhythms that are 23:55 or 24:07 (etc.) in length. So, if their solution is to move time zones to fix the issue, then they have to move over and over again. Let's say there's a four-hour window in which a "runner" can exist in line with everyone else in a timezone: if their offset is five minutes, they'd have to move 1/6 of the way around the globe every seven weeks.

And you wouldn't just need to find a person who had an opposite sleeping schedule; you'd have to find someone whose "day" is exactly identical to yours; as much as a minute longer, and, even if you start out twelve hours apart, you'll be on the same sleep schedule within two years.
