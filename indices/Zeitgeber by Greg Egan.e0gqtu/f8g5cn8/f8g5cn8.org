When I was in secondary school I moved deliberately to this sleep schedule. Home from school fall asleep, wake up around midnight or 1.

So I could game with my American friends once they were home from the evening.

I'm shocked no one on the forum thread considered jetlag or moving countries. Even just a holiday would surely be the obvious test if its related to the sky. There's a mention of a jetlag pill but not actually giving yourself jetlag

Also an even distribution of human sleep patterns would actually be amazing.

The peak and trough system of current civil planning would be dampened a lot. Instead of insane rush hours traffic would be distributed across the 24 hours, true of everywhere.

Keeping buildings and restaurants open 24/7 isn't harder if you consolidate a few together. The hardest stores are mom and pop stores who can't be open during peak hours because there are none.

Subways and buses now that demand is not concentrated would run less often but would run 24/7.

The places that benefit the most are cities while small villages and towns find their standard of living fallen. This will encourage more movement to urban concentrations which is good again for gdp and economic growth and efficiency.

However many stores already function without employees with cctv or even relying on human honesty alone. So this will encourage that kind of behaviour. Crime will be harder to because there's no period where the streets are empty and quiet.

Internationally this will bring the world closer together as timezones become pointless. I guess they'll be eliminated quickly. Instead of companies operating on daylight hours three or four shift hours will be the pattern 0-6, 6-12, 12-18, 18-24 covers all 8 hour sleep patterns.

I expect gdp to climb significantly after adjustment assuming even distribution. Its just so much more efficient to buy 5 computers used 24/7 then buy 20 computers which are left untouched for 14 hours a day. This is true in literally every single thing. Cars can be shared, even apartments and beds could work. If you and your friend have opposite sleeping schedules, save money and rent a 1 bedroom together.

Socialised parenting will be necessary which increases the nuclear family to four to eight parents with up to a dozen children. Again such units living in a single home is more efficient.
