Just read through SAPR up to current, and I'm really enjoying it.

Tried reading Emergence but holy shit they were anti-explaining things. Like, if you asked someone to explain our world in the least helpful and most confusing way that's still technically true you might get close to how frustrating that was to read. I had to stop because I was so mad.

I actually read The Games We Play because I was searching for Gamer fics, and didn't even realize RWBY was a show until I had finished the whole fic. I absolutely loved that book, and maybe because I have a really low bar for Gamer fics I didn't see it as rambling at all. I thought it was kind of brilliant how as his wisdom went up his thoughts became longer and more complex. When I actually saw the show and caught up to current I was simultaneously incredibly disappointed that the show didn't cover nearly as much as I thought and in awe at the worldbuilding accomplished in TGWP. An extra city, multiple world bosses, festivals, politics, semblances, meaning, history through puzzle pieces, and an overarching story that fit the world of Remnant and Grimm just right. The fight against Penny where he was pot chugging was brilliant. I've never felt such fear of an enemy in a book as I have towards Pandora Shells. The way he fully used the Gamer power up to the extremes is still peerless. God I miss the feeling of reading that book for the first time.
