[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/sapr-rwby-mlp.674638/][SAPR]], which is ongoing, is also excellent. When MLP's Sunset Shimmer ends up in the human world, it's /Remnant/, not ours. The crossover's used to its fullest potential - Sunset's a faunus, each of the RWBY girls ends up on a team separate from the others, and the cast generally seems to grow in ways that seem natural given their new situations. And, unlike normal fics where a character from one world is dropped into another, Equestrian characters still work their way into the plot.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/arc-of-the-revolution-rwby.373388/][Arc of the Revolution]], a deadfic where Jaune stumbles his way into becoming one of the most terrifying people on Remnant due to constant misunderstandings by others.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/%E2%80%98hazredous%E2%80%99-interruptions-nanoha-rwby.373136/][Hazredous Interrruptions]] is objectively well-written and interesting, but I don't know the crossover well and the updates are/were slow. I stopped reading it a while back, because I thought I'd read it once it was finally done, so I don't know if it's still going on or finished.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/emergence-rwby.308628/][Emergence]] has the RWBY crew getting dropped on Earth, in a sort of realistic reverse isekai thing. I liked the first contact elements, because I'm a sucker for that, but cared less about what the later stories looked like they were transitioning into, and haven't looked at it for a while.

The RWBY Time Loops are written by excellent writers, but is painfully long and might be hard to follow. The Games We Play has some good worldbuilding, but rambles on and simply gets boring as it continues.

I remember liking [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/shards-a-worm-rwby-crossover.334032/][Shards]], which is dead, but don't remember much about it, and can't say if my younger self had good taste or not.
