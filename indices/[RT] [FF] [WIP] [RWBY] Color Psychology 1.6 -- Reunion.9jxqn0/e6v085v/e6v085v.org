Good chapter overall. Liked the character interactions and worldbuilding.

Pyrrha is a fair bit more guarded than I remember her being. Then again, it's a somewhat darker reconstruction, so it makes sense.\\
Curious of Pyrrha's semblance in this story. Is this still merely magnetic manipulation, just interacting oddly with Ruby's semblance?

Atlas' assimilation is probably the most intriguing bit here. Wondering how other cultures deal with negative emotions, then. Also not certain if "class 1 restricted information" is lowest class. Is it?\\
Besides that... Weiss' semblance is /massively/ versatile (even more than original's, actually), if somewhat high maintenance.
