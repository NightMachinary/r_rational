Their "individuality" is their status as members of the schnee family. It's like those people who build their entire personality over which fandoms they are in, or the kind of extreme loyalty where you see yourself as a servant to the crown first and last. That's this entire family. That managed to survive the assimilation because of their control of dust, which would have had to have been nationalized to remove it from them.

Something interesting that /immediately/ occurred to me is that /weiss is going to grow./ It's a bildungsroman, she has to grow, and the opportunity is there because she's been moved to a novel society with radically different social mores inimical to her current worldview. (I mean, the author could have her double down on her identity as a member of the schnee, but that power has been on the outs already and I doubt the author is going to deny her the reinvention of herself that would require)
