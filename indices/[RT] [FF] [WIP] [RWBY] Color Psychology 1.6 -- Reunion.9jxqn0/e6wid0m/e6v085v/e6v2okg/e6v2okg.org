Thanks!

  Curious of Pyrrha's semblance in this story. Is this still merely magnetic manipulation, just interacting oddly with Ruby's semblance?

There's an interlude coming up in a few chapters (1.9 I think?) that should clear this up.

  Also not certain if "class 1 restricted information" is lowest class. Is it?

No comment. >.>

  Besides that... Weiss' semblance is massively versatile (even more than original's, actually), if somewhat high maintenance.

Yeah, definitely. I think strong abilities with one or two glaring weaknesses work best for protagonists. It lets them do really cool stuff without being overpowered.
