How about with paragraph breaks:

  I've been toying with the idea of trying to write a children's fantasy novel, which would require a simple and intuitive magical system. And what could possibly be easier for young brains, on a cognitive level, than a magical system inspired by simple machine learning algorithms?

  Transmorphication is a machine-learning-inspired system of alchemy. We tell Transmorphication what we want by giving it collections of things that have a key property in common, and then Transmorphication can add that property to base objects. (Like a generative network being set to learn a style of painting by looking at examples, which network can then apply this style to a base image.)

  For example, if you wanted to turn a rock red, you would start with the rock (plus applied Fire, which is the essence of Change) and then add (in quick succession) some red blood and red clay. The blood and clay don't have a shape in common, or even solidity, or any other properties /you/ can think of besides their color. If you're right about that being the only thing they have in common, then this Transmorphication should apply this 'red' property to the rock you started with.

  To produce metal, we could start by placing into a Fire a big rock that we intend to keep its hardness and solidity. We then find at least two things that are shiny (and otherwise have no obvious properties in common, that they don't also have in common with the base rock), and then add at least two things that are malleable (like clay and beeswax).

  (Aside from Transmorphication, the society in question has very little /other/ technology - they haven't invented writing yet, and are still transmitting recipes using verse. They're hunter-gatherers, or small-scale agriculturalists if they figure out how to use Transmorphication to make plows or otherwise enhance their gardens.)

  The laws of Transmorphication are as follows:

  1. Transmorphication takes place in the presence of Fire, which is the embodiment of Change. (The opposite of Fire, namely Cold, will turn fluids solid and make people and other animals sluggish, since it is the essence of Stasis.)

  2. To carry out a Transmorphication, begin with a substance already in the midst of Fire, then bring into contact with it two or more other substances in quick succession. The property held in common by these new substances will be applied to the base substance.

  - Transmorphication will /conservatively/ estimate what this new set of substances have in common - that is, it essays a simple-ish classifier that would be a narrow-ish boundary around the observed materials. The conservative bias lets Transmorphication work from only positive examples, without the classifier just being 'all substances are positive examples' every time.

  - If the set of objects has a property in common with the substance already present, Transmorphication will tend to ignore that property. E.g., if you are starting with a rock and add two solid things, Transmorphication will assume that you're probably not trying to say something about solidity.

  - Transmorphication has some idea of which environmental properties are rare and is more likely to pay attention to unusual or low-base-rate or improbable/surprising properties held in common.

  1. The key property takes its particular flavor or exact settings from the first new substance added within the set. If you turned a rock red by adding red blood /and then/ red clay a second later, the rock would be a bloody shade of red.

  2. The greater the relative volume or mass of the objects in the set, the harder the induced property is applied to the new thing. To make metal that's malleable when hit, without being easily deformable, you'd add a /small/ amount of clay and beeswax to a very hard base material.

  3. Abstract properties can sometimes be generalized and applied, if you find a base material ready to accept them. For example, honey, a sponge, and a jar that was used for storing ingredients, might have in common the property of 'storing resources'. A wolf's tooth and scorpion's sting might have in common 'tool for causing damage to living things'.

  4. The more your collection of objects sharing a property P, is /unlike/ the current base object, the weirder the results you get from applying P to the base object. (Since the Transmorphication has been given no examples of what things-similar-to-the-base-object-in-various-regards look like when P is added to them.) Start with a hat, and add a wolf's tooth and scorpion's sting, and you'll get ???

  5. Transmorphications may be applied in succession. It may get harder to go on as you try to create more /complicated/ objects - a rock transformed to red rock isn't much more complicated; but it's different if you try to add multiple abstract properties. There's no time limit on how long you can wait between Transmorphications, and you can take a Transmorphified substance and put it back in a Fire and add more properties.

  6. If you take a highly Transmorphified substance and then change it by any means /other/ than Transmorphication - e.g. by twisting the substance into a new shape - then the result is likely to be hard to Transmorphify in complicated further ways. (You've taken a complicated Transmorphed object, and then altered it along a new direction likely to be outside Transmorphing's native representation.) This is limiting but also useful, because you can use highly Trasmorphified substances to make relatively Fire-resistant objects, e.g., use metal tongs to hold a base object within a Fire. (Altered objects can still be used as ingredients.)

  7. Naturally, if you make a couple of Transmorphified things by adding the same property to both of them, you are super likely to get that same property again if you use those two things as ingredients.

  Further qualifications and corollaries:

  a. A spark of Fire can be produced by forcibly changing the form of something, e.g., rubbing sticks against each other repeatedly until they begin to wear away, or banging rocks together hard enough that bits of rock break off.

  b. If this spark of Fire is then applied to something that has the nature of Growth, like wood from a growing tree, the Fire will itself start to grow. Obviously, this is a very dangerous process which could easily get out of control.

  c. Putting your hand in Fire quickly becomes painful as the Fire starts to change your hand into ash, which is like a combination of your solid hand and the surrounding non-solid air into partially-solid ash. This is what happens by default when you use Fire on solid things, if you don't add more interesting substances to the Fire before. (The wise might deduce that air is a mix of at least two different gases, since Fire tries to add airiness if you don't give it anything else to work with.)

  d. Living things are extremely complicated, and different parts of them react differently to added properties, which usually kills them. You can use living ingredients with unusual properties, like 'firefly' or 'chameleon', to pinpoint properties for adding to base substances. But living things don't work well as a base material. The property of 'being alive' is likewise impossible to add to a stone just by finding three living things that are alive but have nothing else in common. e. Nobody understands how people or other animals reproduce, but it's obviously a Transmorphication process if a mysterious one. Two people rub together, which is how you'd start a Fire, and then they combine fluids from their body and mutual feelings of love to create a body and soul. A sufficiently passionate kiss with exchange of saliva can get an egg started.

  f. It sometimes takes multiple tries (like three or four, even!) and exotic materials (you might have to hunt all over the forest!) to successfully implement the next step of whatever Transmorphication you have in mind. But once you find a recipe, it should work repeatably.

  Any interesting recipes come to mind?

  In terms of general living standards, how far could an otherwise illiterate society go with this after three or four generations? What are their houses like? Their gardens? Their clothes? Their hunting tools and weapons?

  Or: You describe the recipe, I'll say what I think happens. Successful recipes so far: Pebble + {honey, grape juice} = Everlasting Gobstopper. (Jay Fowler.)
