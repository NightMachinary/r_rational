The magic system doesn't know anything, your associations of the items cause things to work, like in [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/04/03/the-study-of-anglophysics/]] when MOP + GUT made POT and GUM with cooking pots near kitchen utensils and weed near pipes and bongs. It operates on a subjective association unless in the wild, like with his ash example.
