  Abstract properties can sometimes be generalized and applied, if you find a base material ready to accept them

  A wolf's tooth and scorpion's sting might have in common 'tool for causing damage to living things'.

See, when you say the process has no idea what we're thinking... I have to ask, if it's not reading our thoughts, whose is it reading? Because these are clearly concepts it must have gleaned from some mind somewhere with a similar sense of salience to humans. Nature by default doesn't know that venom is important. It might just fixate on the shape of the molecules(although I'm not sure there are such things as molecules in this world) and ignore everything else. There must be a Great Transmorpher, who has learned to care more about whether an object can be used to carry or kill than about, say, the complexity of its molecular structure, and the ability of a transmorpher will correspond to how well they know that Great Transmorpher's mind. Without knowing what the baseline system considers important, you can't anticipate anything. The more you can anticipate, the more of that mind you'll know.
