Hmm, given the theory-ladenness of observation, what sort of theoretical lens would the magic system be using? What properties of the inputted objects would it know to regard as relevant vs. irrelevant to find where they intersect (I've been meaning to delve more into machine learning and neural nets and stuff but haven't yet, though presumably the sorts of relationships those methods broadly focus on are programmed and constrained by the user)? How does it handle overfitting vs underfitting to the training data? Especially with, like, 2 data points in your training set, you'd overfit like mad.

  For example, honey, a sponge, and a jar that was used for storing ingredients, might have in common the property of 'storing resources'. A wolf's tooth and scorpion's sting might have in common 'tool for causing damage to living things'.

How does the magic system know that the jar was used for storing ingredients (I'm guessing "honey" is included because bees make honey "intending" for it to store energy?)? How does it know that teeth and stingers can cause "damage" (what is damage?) to living things? How does it know what living things are? "If this spark of Fire is then applied to something that has the nature of Growth, like wood from a growing tree, the Fire will itself start to grow." What's "the nature of Growth" and how does the magic identify it? Would it identify "the nature of Growth" in all the ambient bacteria and whatever that are coating everything not thoroughly sterilized? How does it distinguish objects from collections of parts and evaluate emergent properties in different sets of circumstances?

Point 2 sort of addresses some of this ("conservatively estimate... simple-ish classifier... narrow-ish boundary"), but with really vague language.

Overall though it sounds like a fun system, but hard to make internally consistent and non-arbitrary. If there's a human-level intelligence on the receiving end interpreting all the spells it could work, though. I'd maybe worry a bit about cultural sensitivity and falling victim to stereotypes with respect to hypothetical hunter-gatherers, too.
