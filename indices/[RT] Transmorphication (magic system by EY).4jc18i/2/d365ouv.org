Aesthetically, this reminds me a lot Homestuck's alchemy system, where you combine the properties of items by AND-ing OR XOR-ing their addresses. It's great fun if you aren't real picky about whether you craft a pogo-head hammer or a hammer-head pogo, but really stupid if you want a consistently useful system that runs on something other than sheer predestined bullshit.
