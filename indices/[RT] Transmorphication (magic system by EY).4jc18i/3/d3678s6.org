Well, Transmorphication certainly doesn't look like a magic system for a children's fantasy novel. In books like that author should make rather something simple and dependant more on user's intention (like bending from Avatar or gramarye from Inheritance) or use magic as loosely defined force, that just adds flavor and doesn't resolve any plot points.

I am not saying it's bad, since the premise is very interesting and I love alchemy related stuff (unless it's reduced to potion brewage), but as for now Transmorphication is rather vague and often may become deus ex machina.
