Why is everyone in the comment thread for this chapter assuming Cat is half Deoraithe? I only remember the one offhand comment by Kegan that her ruthless practicality is like the Deoraithe.

It seems likely she going to try to make a claim for the Deoraithe throne, thus assuming the obligation of retaking the Summer Bloom. Kegan is not long for this world.
