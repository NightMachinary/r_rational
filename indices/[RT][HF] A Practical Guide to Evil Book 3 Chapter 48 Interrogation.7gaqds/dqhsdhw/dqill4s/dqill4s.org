I'm guessing it's a bluff that Akua needs to be willing to take at face value for her actual gambit to work.\\
1.) She's spent a considerable amount of time convincing everyone she's ruthless and willing to risk anything. It's softened to us because we see the interior conflict, but there isn't a hint of it on the outside for a while now.\\
2.) That ruthlessness was recently reinforced specifically to Akua such that she noted it out loud. Additionally Cat was carefully picking up on the messages Akua sent Cat and vice-versa.\\
3.) While she often uses directness to achieve smaller goals, she ends conflicts much more subtly. All of her recent endgames are story-savvy deconstructions.

  “When historians try to pin down Foundling's methods they point to the Battle of the Camps or the Princes' Graveyard, but those came later. After she'd learned her trade. If you want to understand how she operated, look to the Battle of Four Armies and One -- from the beginning to the end, she was playing an entirely different game from every other commander on the field.” -- Extract from “A Commentary on the Uncivil Wars”, by Juniper of the Red Shields
