Sometimes I feel the author is reading my mind... [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7fsrg8/rthf_a_practical_guide_to_evil_book_3_chapter_47/dqf47jj/][several of my concerns from Monday's post]] about Cat's options have been addressed now.

- Cat's army is getting dangerously low on man-power? Well check it out, Akua situated herself between three relatively untouched cities, with another Legion nearby.

- How do you assault a flying city? By needing it to land in order for some rituals to take place. Solves the problem of getting to an airborne target.

- How do you combat an undead horde? Well, what do you think millions of souls would do?

So all of a sudden the field seems quite a bit more leveled. I also like that we had some logistical updates (such as the state of Akua's forces and Daoine's). It still looks like it'll be tense and mistakes on Cat's fault could be catastrophic, but it doesn't seem hopeless now at least.

I'm wondering how the gestalt works - do all Deoraithe people automatically get their souls taken after death? Is it just if they live in Daoine, or anyone with the blood of the people? Because Cat's descended from them too... and her soul is held in only by "scaffolding." I could imagine a climatic confrontation where Akua *Calls* up the gestalt, *Binds* Catherine's soul to it, and *Claims* it all for herself... just to have Catherine in soul form *Break* Akua's control and *Take* the gestalt for herself.

And the make the flying city *Fall,* because c'mon, it still has to happen.
