Diane Duane's /Young Wizards/ series is great, though probably better for ~7th grade and up. Lovely blend of hard SF and character-driven epic fantasy.

Arthur C Clarke's /Dolphin Island/ is classic SF and great for younger readers.

Maybe /Rendezvous with Rama/?

TBH I'm not sure there's much kid-friendly hard SF; and my own childhood solution of "read it all anyway" may not suit everyone (especially if you're a teacher). Maybe play /Kerbal Space Program/?

Going a bit softer, Asimov's robots short stories are also good, and not too adult. Anne McCaffery's /Talents/ trilogy (fairly short).

Actually, David Weber wrote a young reader's trilogy in the Honorverse, that would be great too.
