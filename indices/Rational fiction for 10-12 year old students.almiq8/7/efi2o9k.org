Second the /young wizards/ suggestion.

SF is really tough 'cause the themes are usually more adult (not necessarily romance). Most SF is going to be YA which is 12-13+

But, some thoughts: /[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2493.The_Time_Machine][The Time Machine]], Animorphs, [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16060193-ship-s-boy][David Birckenhead]] (if only for the anthropomorphized/uplifted bunnies), probably and all of [[http://www.laury.dahners.com/Stories.html][Larry Dahners' series]] (though it should be noted that while good, all his books are basically the exact same story rehashed yet again), [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/114468-the-songreaver-s-tale][Songreaver's Tale]] (not SF, but feels more rational-y), [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6948420-grand-central-arena][Grand Central Arena]], Card's [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/40410-homecoming-saga][Homecoming saga]] could be fun/

If they were just a bit older I'd suggest the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Runelords][Runelords series]]. Not SF
