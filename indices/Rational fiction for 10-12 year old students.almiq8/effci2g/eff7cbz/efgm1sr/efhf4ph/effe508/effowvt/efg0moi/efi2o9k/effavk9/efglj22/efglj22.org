There is [[http://nyssa.elcenia.com/][Nyssa in the Realm of Possibility]], which is a rationalist Phantom Tollbooth pastiche and really good. However, it's not entirely published yet; Alicorn is serializing it, publishing two chapters a week. There are 26 chapters and 18 are published, so it will be out in full by the end of February.
