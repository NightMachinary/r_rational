Different Kinds of Darkness is short and about kids their age. I don't think the language is too difficult. The totalitarian theme might need to be explained to them.

I was mostly reading nature books at that time. Jack London, My Side of the Mountain, Swiss Family Robinson. These seem almost like SF precursors to me. There's a focus on mechanics and engineering and rational planning for survival in a lot of them.
