I don't know. /Methods/ is a [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Methods-of-Rationality][660,000 word]] work [[http://www.hpmor.com/][divided into six books]]; let's peg them at 110,000 words each. Compare with [[https://wordcounter.io/blog/how-many-words-are-in-harry-potter/][the original /Harry Potter/ books]]:

| Title                  | Wordcount |
|------------------------+-----------|
| /Sorcerer's Stone/     | 77,000    |
| /Chamber of Secrets/   | 85,000    |
| /Prisoner of Azkaban/  | 107,000   |
| /Goblet of Fire/       | 191,000   |
| /Order of the Phoenix/ | 257,000   |
| /Half-Blood Prince/    | 169,000   |
| /Deathly Hallows/      | 198,000   |
| Total                  | 1,100,000 |

I read the first three /Harry Potter/ books in middle school (that's ages 11-13 for you non-Americans). They took me one week each to finish, and I'm a pretty slow reader for a nerd (I /still/ subvocalize!). So if we assume the kids can read one /Methods/ book per week, they should be able to get through it in one and a half months (if the club meets monthly, you could assign the first three books on the first month and the next three books on the second, so you could get through the entire work in two months).

However, this is all theoretical; I agree that the content of /Methods/ is a poor match for 10-12 year olds. If /Methods/ were a movie it would be at least PG-13, maybe R depending on how graphically the troll and graveyard scenes were adapted.
