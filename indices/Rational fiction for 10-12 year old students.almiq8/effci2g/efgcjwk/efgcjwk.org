Asimov had a short book that's perfect for elementary school students, "[[http://asimov.wikia.com/wiki/The_Best_New_Thing][The Best New Thing]]." I first read it in a fiction anthology textbook at that age, and later found it in the library as its own book.

It's about a couple of kids who live on the moon who build up their strength with exercise in anticipation of their first trip to Earth, the homeworld of their parents. It combines a sense of wonder and a love of science, and I remember it to this day. I'd recommend starting their SF adventures with this story.
