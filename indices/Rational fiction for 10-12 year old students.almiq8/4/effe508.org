for time dillation and early sci fi themes there's a book i read at that age: marcos millions ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco%27s_Millions]]) the main premise is a boy who likes to explore and then finds a portal to this other world and solves a problem and then manages to get a box that can change the speed of time so there's a lot of things relating to that in the book though its not the central focus.

Echoing some other posters i think asimov is surprisingly approachable at young ages. I would probably recommend the foundation books as a particularly good example.
