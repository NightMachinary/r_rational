Consider, however, that one of the benefits of a book club is discussing various facets and themes of a book in detail, moreso than trading reviews at the finish line. In a way, it would be missing a different point of having a book club.

Especially for the kind of thinking-heavy content OP wants to introduce, reading material should be paced moderately and discussions frequent. Like in the first quarter or so of MOR, where each chapter is basically a series of parables and thought experiments loosely tied together by plot, those kids would have arbitrage, fermi estimates, energy conservation, and so on blow right through their heads because there is way too much going to comprehensively discuss at that pace.
