I was reading Great Sky River. You should have them read that. It's a fun romp across a deathworld where humans are being subjected to slaughter by machine lifeforms, with an upbeat ending. People live with the recorded, simulated personalities of their dead ancestors talking as voices in their head, to preserve culture and knowledge in a world where knowledge is trending down, instead of up. It should be enough to get them started. Once they're hooked, the prequels and sequels to that book touch on many of the themes you're talking about.
