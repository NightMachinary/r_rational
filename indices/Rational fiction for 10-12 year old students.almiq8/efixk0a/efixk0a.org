There are probably a lot of "actual paper" books out there that do a good job of introducing someone to SF themes; but I'm not sure which to recommend.

The anti-death theme is probably mostly in stories whose authors have read HPMoR. Most of those are fanfiction or other web-published works.

For fanfiction, the best starting point would be something based in a world that the student is already familiar with.

--------------

If they've read Book 1 of Harry Potter (or watched the movie / etc), HPMoR itself may be suitable. I know some (at the time) 8th-graders who have read it, at least, which should put them at around 13 years.

Another world that most kids are familiar with is Pokemon, so maybe daystarEld's Origin of Species would be okay. I'd encourage you to first read through whatever you end up recommending, though, as I'm not sure I'd remember any problematic scenes. There's a scene where somebody's been killed by a Beedrill, iirc, but I don't recall how graphic the description of that actually was.
