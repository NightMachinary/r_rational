/Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality/ is both a fun read /and/ teaches people some interesting things from a number of different subjects such as psychology, and...some others.

Also, it's important to remember that children past the age of eight have clear concepts between fantasy and reality, so they can probably handle rather visceral stuff (just not too visceral, mind you), but it's mostly the administration that will get on your case if you show anything that you can't reasonably justify.
