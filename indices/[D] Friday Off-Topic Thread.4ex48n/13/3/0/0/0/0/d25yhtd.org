Well, there's always the option of making it self-aware and having it subvert its own tropes. The universe rewards people who fight for those they love with massive power, so the main character starts consciously attempting to set up situations that trigger shounen powerups by gaining as many allies/friends as possible with precariously positioned people, and training their thought patterns to be as protagonist-y as possible. (alliteration motherfucker, I speak it.)

"My Trans-Dimensional, Overpowered Protagonist, Harem Comedy is Wrong, as Expected." for example, takes a standard shounen/harem story and makes it work without really changing the world or the storyline simply by adding another character and focusing on them, while they help the original shounen protagonist.

It's true that most shounen works don't react very well when you actively apply intelligence to them, but that just means more work needs doing on the worldbuilding. Of course, replicating the /feel/ of a shounen is another matter entirely. "I want to be stronger" may be the rallying cry of the rationalists, but generally that gets translated to "I want to be smarter".

Still, I'm sure it /can/ be done, though not simply or easily.
