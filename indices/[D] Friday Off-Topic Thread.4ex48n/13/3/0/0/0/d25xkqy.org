I don't know, a lot of what makes shonen...well...shonen would be fairly difficult to convert into a rational world. A lot of the vibes (for lack of a better term) that shonen works give off don't really fit a rational setting. For example, the classic "Me or Someone I love being in trouble unlocks greater power" shonen trope or even the "Anger = Power" trope. In a rational setting, while someone you care about may make you willing to go to greater lengths, it's difficult to justify the aforementioned tropes in their pure forms. Getting angry =/= Super Saiyan in rational works, usually. Especially since most rational works have a rational protagonist, who's usually too intelligent to go blind with rage. Again, that's just one example though.

In general, I don't think shonen works do well when you apply intelligence to them, particularly ones involving supernatural powers as, in the vast majority of the media in question, these powers are very inconsistent and/or easily exploitable if you think for 5 minutes. So any sort of rational attempt at super powered shonen would be either way too much work OR an OP protagonist. For example, the Waves Arisen. A very good, rationally done Naruto fanfic. But it didn't feel like a shonen work. Not at all, at least to me.
