Hmmm. Interesting point. It sort of eliminates the advantage that multi-chapter stories would have. It also doesn't allow "guest" favoriting either. Sorting my favorites vs reviews gives me an entirely different list of stories. #1 in reviews can end up being like #5 in favorites. Interesting metric.
