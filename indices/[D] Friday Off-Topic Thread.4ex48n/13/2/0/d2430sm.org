Yea, I just didn't like the thought of adding in author's notes to every single chapter. Like I definitely have them on most, but where I could leave them off, I did. But, that being said, the story's progressing to the point where I wouldn't mind doing that little "hey, look at this and what happened here" sort of author note every chapter so that my readers catch all of the hints....hm....

And yea, that's why I've been updating weekly. I know myself and, if I procrastinate too much, I'll just never get this story finished.
