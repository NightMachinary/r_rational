Directly asking people to review would probably work well. There's a reason that most Youtubers end their videos with "please like and subscribe" -- it actually gets people to like and subscribe who wouldn't have otherwise.

Personally, I think being consistent is the most important thing you can do in a serial, so it's really a matter of what sort of pace you can keep up on a regular basis. Longer than a week and you risk losing attention though; attrition is the enemy.
