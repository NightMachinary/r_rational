  Ok it's not that they lack any visual memory it's that they can't form mental images, though they can still do other things, and interestingly they can still dream normally.

Sounds sort of the opposite of me. I /can/ form mental images, they're just borderline useless. Think "blurry image of the Loch Ness monster" as my upper threshold. My dreams are more conceptual than visual, like a blurry man-size shape will be to my right, but I /know/ it's a dude in a duster wearing a cowboy hat. So, not aphantasia, just the far left of the bell curve.

  Studies show the accuracy of these mental images (along with visual memory) varies substantially between individuals with my own mental images being pretty low res.

I noticed the issue with myself after reading the story of a scientific argument near the end of the 19th century. One faction was insisting that people were perfectly capable of recalling or creating pictures in their mind, with the other adamantly insisting that this wasn't really possible, and those people who claimed to do so were only pretending they could mentally see the image. Basically just a shouting match with everyone making a Typical Minds Fallacy. Supposedly, it went on for a decade or so before someone thought to take a survey, and surprise surprise, it turned out that mental visual capacity was a bell curve.
