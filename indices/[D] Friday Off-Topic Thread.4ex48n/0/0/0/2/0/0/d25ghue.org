Ok it's not that they lack any visual memory it's that they can't form mental images, though they can still do other things, and interestingly they can still dream normally. Other types of disorders exist for other senses.

Just to clarify if you do have it and certain things are alien to you: Generally when people imagine images they are I guess, having a really low key visual hallucination that is of lower quality and not as "real" as normal vision or hallucinations and doesn't interfere with primary visual stimuli. Studies show the accuracy of these mental images (along with visual memory) varies substantially between individuals with my own mental images being pretty low res.

Ultimately this is like trying to explain red to someone who sees every color /except/ red, you can kind of explain stuff because they are familiar with visual stimuli vaguely similar in both cases but in both cases it's a fundamentally unbridgeable conceptual gap.

If you don't have this disorder it ought to be really obvious, however if you do then the concepts may not make sense.

Actually now that I think about it I suppose since very few people with aphantasia have the corresponding disorders for all other senses I suppose I could just say that imagining images is like imagining sounds, or smells, etc
