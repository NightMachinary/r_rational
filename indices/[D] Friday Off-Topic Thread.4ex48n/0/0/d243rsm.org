I like to write things down (usually in keywordy streams of consciousness) on post-it notes or emails/messages to myself and check them when I'm in a better position to do something about them. Like I'll be biking around and have a BRILLIANT thought on how to implement some algorithm or code in a more efficient way, but I sure as hell won't remember it (or even remember that I needed to remember something) when I've access to a computer in however many hours, so I'll pull over and text it to myself. Then, when I get home or when I'm working the next day I'll look at all the messages I sent to myself and jog my memories. If I'm at home already but want to jot some quick thoughts down, I'll use Windows' Sticky Notes app or scribble on one of my whiteboards (esp. useful if it requires weird symbols or diagrams).

There's probably a more sophisticated way of doing this with dedicated memo/note taking software, but my thoughts aren't so elaborate as to require such dedicated storage and just using my phone's facebook messenger is more convenient for easy access from any and all computers. Since my thoughts also aren't so important to dedicate effort committing them to longer term memory, I find this better than trying to construct memory palaces or whatever, too.
