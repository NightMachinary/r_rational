I've assigned a person-action-object visual image to each number from 0-9. In practice, I mostly use this to easily fix the page number of whatever book I'm reading in my mind. Sometimes for memorizing phone numbers.

Ex. I was on page 219 of Brandon Sanderson's Bands of Mourning yesterday (my favorite Mistborn book now, seriously, so great) - 2 is Luigi, planking, with a green fireball. 9 is Rick, belching, with his flask. 1 is Buggs Bunny, chewing, with a carrot. So the page number appears in my mind as a mental image of Luigi, chewing, holding a flask. Easily pictured, easily recalled.

There's an easier way of doing this for page numbers that just matches each digit to a letter, such that most combinations create memorable one-syllable sounds. But that's became it's meant specifically for remembering page-numbers, and isn't really applicable to anything more than 3 digits long.

My method is adapted from the system for memorizing the order of a deck of cards, which I got from the fantastic book Moonwalking With Einstein (all about memory and memory techniques - highy recommended).

Edit: corrected page number
