  Very virtuous of you, yeah.

Thank you! I was a little bit nervous to say it.

  So what do you judge on? For me it's usually about how someone treats ordinary people around them, in-person.

Same thing basically. I look at the friends and enemies that person has, and how s/he treats people around them. Judging them on their opinions doesn't make sense to me, because after reading the Sequences /How to Change Your Mind/, I have realized that in a slightly different life, there are many amazing and unpleasant people who I could have been. As a result, it's a poor way to judge someone on views and opinions that they most likely grew up with. It's far better to get a grasp of their character by looking at their actions rather than what they say. "Actions speak louder than words" or something like that.

To belabor the point with an example, I don't think knowing that someone supports gun rights is very helpful in knowing about their personality unless they /also/ do something like going out and actually buying a gun, has a license in using a gun, or goes to a protest to support gun rights.
