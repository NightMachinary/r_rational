Not to send you down a rabbit hole, but [[http://prospect.org/article/dreams-my-father-deferred][feigned dispassion is a very different thing from actual objectivity]]. If you actually believe Trump is evil, in the sense that you expect him to do evil things, and you also expect that telling people Trump is evil will help prevent him from doing those evil things, well, by God, you should damn well be shouting on those rooftops over there!

If you're not lying about your educational progress and your career plans, you're better than "a smart guy". You're a smart guy with a high Wisdom score. You have yourself more together than most people I know did at your age, and you say things like, "I have realized that in a slightly different life, there are many amazing and unpleasant people who I could have been."
