I'd like to talk a bit about the presidential election and specifically about Donald Trump. Even more specifically, I'm going to make a series of predictions and see if you guys agree or disagree.

Scary Prediction #1 - Trump will only get even worse with his insults and trash talk. He wants attention and doesn't care if it's positive or negative. I'll even go far as to say that he wants riots and people staging protests against him for maximum attention which is related to Scott's [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/17/the-toxoplasma-of-rage/][Toxoplasma of Rage]]. I'm actually scared and worried that he'll end up causing people to be hurt or killed because of this. And he'll even make use of the poor person's injuries/death to 'justify' his actions.

Obvious Prediction #2 - He'll win the nomination for the Republican party. He's so far in the lead that I doubt anyone else will catch up, although Cruz has my support.

Unusual Prediction #3 - Sanders will win the Democratic nomination. This is because people will see Sanders as Trump's counterpart and the guy to beat him. Yes the Democratic Party wants to vote Hillary who is currently leading, but Sanders is anti-establishment and an underdog. He'll win through the popular vote. If Trump wasn't running, Sanders would not have such a strong position.

Shocking Prediction #4 - Afterwards Trump'll change absolutely everything about himself. He'll say that he didn't mean his words as harshly as people thought. He'll be accepting of immigrants, higher wages, gay marriage, marijuana, etc, etc, major Democratic issues, and everything else he's been dumping on. He's only been as publicly extreme right as he is now to lock in the Republican vote. No Republicans are not terrible people who support racism, but if you are a supremacist, I can be very confident you voted Republican in the last election. Or just good old fashioned xenophobia towards foreigners.

Either way, Trump will paint himself as a Democrat and most likely even pick a Democrat as his running mate. He'll switch to the left side so fast that you will get whiplash. Yes people will fight and scream how he is a turncoat and a liar (as if we didn't know this already!). But memories fade and people will be fooled. He will become someone who you agree with and you will think, aw he's not such a bad guy (I even expect this to happen to myself and I'm the guy writing this!).

Hopeful Prediction #5 - This will not work and Sanders will become the next president. No, I cannot provide any accurate reasons/evidence for why I believe this. I'm betting on this prediction coming true with 60% likelihood and it's more wishful thinking and hope for this to be true when the betting percentage should be closer to 50% (between him and Trump, not between all of the candidates right now). But it's important for the next prediction.

Surprising (not really) Prediction #6 - If Sanders becomes the next president, Trump will claim this was his plan all along. Why? Because he *knows* prediction #3 as well. And he will want to get something back after losing which is to deny his losses and claim that everything that happened was all part of his master plan to...make politics engaging, say that he always supported Sanders, and to change up the two-party system, or something like that probably. Oh and he'll say that while being President would have been nice, he didn't care too much about it.

Depressing Prediction #7 - No matter what happens, Trump will face absolutely no consequences for his actions.

Let's have a calm and "rational" discussion!

EDIT: Some grammar edits, editing #6 a bit, and adding prediction #7.
