I'm a big fan of Bernie and voted (well caucused technically) for him in my state. But I have a feeling this will be a contest between Trump and Hillary during the general. I would certainly be happy if trump did a 180 but I am unwilling to take that risk and in this scenario would definitely vote hillary. She is nowhere near as liberal as me but my life under Obama hasn't been bad, another 4 years of this would be ok with me, though I wouldn't be very ecstatic about it.
