I did not blame Clinton for anything. You are making an assumption. I said he harvested the tax income generated by Reagan's policies, which were proven to work in the real world. If Reagan policies hadnt worked, Bill Clinton would not have had the money to start balancing the budget. Reagan and Bill Clinton were pre-housing bubble presidents, so that wasn't the source of the federal income.

Your comments about the middle class are mostly right on, except where you fail to note that the D party has consistently shrunk the middle class for the last 7 years. It's not Bush's fault any longer.
