Clinton had basically nothing to do with the Dotcom bust, so why are you blaming him for the economic downturn? The issue there was irrational investors convinced they were buying in on the ground floor of the new Walmart, when the companies they were buying didn't actually have coherent, workable business plans. There's nothing the President could have done to fix that problem.

In addition, at this point it's been more or less proven that Reagan policies /do not work./ Growing the upper class to grow the middle class is a frankly stupid idea because the upper class doesn't spend money the way the middle and lower classes do. Middle class and lower class folks spend all or most of their money on goods and services, increasing economic liquidity and driving demand for food, housing, clothing, and other consumer goods, as well as movies, music, etc. Rich folks, on the other hand, do invest money in businesses, but without people to purchase things from those businesses that's totally pointless. Zero jobs in businesses geared for the middle class can be created if there is no middle class, no matter how much money the "job creators" pump into them.

In addition, rich people don't tend to start businesses as often as middle class people. Once someone is rich, they can either take an active role in their wealth (which some of them do) or they can do whatever their conservative financial advisor aimed at maintaining that wealth tells them to do. Starting a new business is /not/ a money-making move most of the time! It takes a lot of work someone used to luxury isn't necessarily willing to do, for no guarantee of any return. How many billionaire entrepreneurs do you know who continued starting businesses after they made it big? I can think of two: Dean Kamen and Elon Musk. And, Elon Musk doesn't do what he does for money, he does it because he literally wants to save the world. Most billionaires don't have that kind of motivation.

Most of the really super wealthy in this country see this problem already. The fact is that the titanic machine of American industry cannot move without people to buy the things it makes, and right now we are crushing the people who buy things. Could Warren Buffett have made it as big as he did in a country which didn't have a middle class? Absolutely not, because Berkshire Hathaway buys and sells companies which rely on that middle class. Could Bill Gates and Steve Jobs have done what they did without a middle class? Nope, because they sell consumer electronics to the masses of people who can afford the luxury.

Not everyone can be rich until automation happens, I get that. However, until then, making the rich richer will just result in millions of angry poor people and no economic liquidity. If you can barely afford to eat, what's the point in inventing? You only have so much time, and you need to spend it scraping together enough to eat.

Or, as will eventually happen on the path we are following, you can spend your time scraping the bones of the formerly rich together. Those who pretend everything is fine in the ivory tower have always found themselves cast into the glaring light of reality and dashed upon the ground. If you don't let people eat good food, they will eat the rich. Marx was wrong about many things, but he wasn't wrong that, if you get enough people mad at you, eventually they kill you.
