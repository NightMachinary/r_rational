I don't understand...how does that stoke racial- or income-inequality-based hatred? If Obama had said anything about guilt, innocence, or police bigotry then I would definitely agree with you. If he had made the comment proactively I would at least somewhat agree that it had a message, but he didn't. He was talking about a nominee for the World Bank when a reporter asked him about the Trayvon Martin case. [[http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/23/obama-trayvon-martin-tragedy][What Obama said]] was that [paraphrased] "This is a tragedy and every aspect of it should be investigated." Mitt Romney (Republican) [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urKe8M2YOf8][agreed with him]] in words that were, if anything, stronger, commenting that [quoted] "The shooting of Trayvon was a terrible tragedy. Unnecessary, inappropriate, and inexplicable at this point", and that it was "entirely appropriate" for the governor to call a grand jury.

Trump's statements seem a bit more...vituperative and unprompted than that.

Could you give another example?
