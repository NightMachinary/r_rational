When our President uses the bully pulpit to comment on racially charged court cases. ONE specific example being when he said (paraphrased) "If I had a son, he might have been Trevon Martin." (Please note I am not commenting on the merits of the case, I am commenting on the President making statements on live court cases that are racially charged. That is not his place as President to fan racial hatred and make jury selection more difficult.)
