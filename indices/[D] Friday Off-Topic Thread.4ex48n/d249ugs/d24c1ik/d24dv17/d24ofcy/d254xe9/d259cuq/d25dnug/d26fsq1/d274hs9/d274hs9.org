You do not appear to be seeing the underlying point. The President and his press team have a great deal of power over what gets talked about in the media. He has almost completely ignored inner city violence, which is a huge problem compared to law enforcement violence cases. Why does he do this? Because he wants a fractured social infrastructure. Victims vote for people who stand up for them. If you can use the big lie technique to create an entire victim class, and pander to it, then you have a large voting block you can count on.

However, when you point out that people are hurting themselves, it doesn't have the same political effect. People prefer to be able to blame others for their problems, and pointing out that teens kill more teens than cops do won't have the same political effect.

If the President were truly concerned about the lives of violence victims, he would address the most numerous cases. Unfortunately, lives don't matter, votes do.

Does this address Trump's over the top statements? No. Trump is using the same tactics, but more openly. He is painting a picture of the US against the world instead of blacks vs cops or rich vs poor. Do I agree with it all? Hell no. But I do believe that we need a period of economic growth, and I don't trust any D to make that happen, because they want divisiveness to drive their voters to the polls, and a healthy economy doesn't generate as much anger and divisiveness as a faltering one.
