I do not think trying to approach societal governance with a goal of increasing happiness is a sound concept. People's requirements for happiness vary to an incredible degree. What makes me happy will probably not make you happy. People's needs can be much more accurately measured. Therefore, IMHO, social welfare should be based on need.
