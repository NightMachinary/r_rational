I agree with you about the results of people being shat on. The problem that I am seeing is that people are being made to think that they are being systematically shat on when they are not. I'm going into racial issues now, as an example. White cops kill very few black teens compared to how many black teens are killed by black teens. But I rarely ever see news coverage of teen-on-teen killings. When I do, it's a blurb, and gone forever. I don't see our President trying to use his position to promote healthy black communities. Perhaps this is because the media doesn't think that is worth covering. In that case, the President should use his powers to force the media to pay attention to that issue. And he could do it. Why isn't he? I will leave that to you to think about.
