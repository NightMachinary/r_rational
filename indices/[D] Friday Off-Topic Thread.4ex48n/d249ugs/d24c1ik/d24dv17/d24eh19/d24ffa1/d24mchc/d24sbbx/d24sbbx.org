Follow-up question. Trump is widely looked down on by much of the world (particularly Europe) and his politically incorrect bravado / impulsive decision-making reinforces the "cowboy" reputation the international community hates about the US. How much does this matter? I would assume this will make it harder to coordinate with allies on things like conflict in the Middle East, sanctions against Russia, etc. but how quantifiable or well-defined could the effects be?
