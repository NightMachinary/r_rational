By the way, the reason Biden is listed as having a chance is the possibility of both Sanders and Clinton withdrawing from the race. Let's say Clinton has something come up like she gets thrown in jail or something and completely withdraws. Then, Sanders has a stroke cause he's like a million years old and just dies or becomes unable to run. This happens, like, 3 weeks before the convention or something.

In this situation, the party needs to go take a look at who it has lying around who could step up and run for the presidency, since both candidates who have delegates are disqualified. The Democrat with the best national-level name recognition who might be able to win the general election from a standing start is Biden. So, if both Clinton and Sanders withdraw from the primaries, Biden will be the Democratic candidate.
