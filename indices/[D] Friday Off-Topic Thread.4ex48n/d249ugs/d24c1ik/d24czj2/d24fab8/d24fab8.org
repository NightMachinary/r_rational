I got these specific odds off of betvictor (not to be confused with bit vector), but you can find other similar bookie websites that give similar odds. I can ask one of my british friends what his bookie is giving on american election odds. Those guys like to bet on everything.

Also, it's probably like super illegal to actually bet on american election outcomes if you are an american-- just look at the odds if you like, but don't place bets. These sites are for europeans.
