I finished Dark Souls 3! Well, ish. Turns out I missed several optional areas and bungled all the NPC quests. Also someone has been killing my merchants. But I completed the main quest!

I'm listening to Steven King's 'It' as I play. It's the first King book I read. It's good, but I definitely need it in audiobook form while doing something else, because King takes his sweet time getting to the point in most scenes.
