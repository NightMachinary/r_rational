Trump's chances are overrated. Cruz doesn't have to catch up to him in delegates, merely keep him from getting an outright majority. If it goes to a contested convention, Cruz will probably win, because delegates are people and many of them don't like Trump. Meanwhile, Cruz has been doing a good job of getting loyal delegates selected.

As for Sanders, the only way he wins at this point is if Clinton drops dead, basically.
