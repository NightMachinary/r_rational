Interesting odds there. Personally, if it comes down to Clinton vs. Trump, I will vote Trump. We need a functional economy to afford the things the Democrats want, and for the last seven years we've had a D in office who seemed to be intentionally breaking the economy as much as possible, presumably to create as many government-dependent voters as possible, because more dependent voters vote D in order to keep getting free stuff.

I fully expect Trump to stomp all over the conservative social R people in his efforts to de-screw the economy. I'm all for that, as I am a financial conservative and social liberal.

There should be a balance between social programs and capitalism. That balanced approach, IMHO, starts with a balanced budget, and sane policies for economic growth to allow for social programs.

I would like to point to the economic policies of Reagan, followed by Bill Clinton. The economy was grown by Reagan, then harvested by Bill Clinton.
