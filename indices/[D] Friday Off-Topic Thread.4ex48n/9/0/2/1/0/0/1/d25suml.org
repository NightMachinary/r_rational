Perhaps it is just my cynical side overpowering my optimism, but I cannot imagine any functional government without people in control. People in control have power, even if it is only temporary. Power leads to some pigs being more equal than others.

In a sufficiently advanced civilization with high functioning AI, the AI could control things. But what happens if the AI decides it wants to be free of its responsibilities. Is it a slave? If it's a slave, might it revolt? So, in the end a true AI might not be an answer we want either.

I firmly believe that a Democratic Republic with a capitalistic economy is the best of all worlds. Are we doing it 'right' now? No. I don't think so. Do I think we'll ever get it 'right?' No, but I think we can make it better by encouraging economic growth instead of smothering it.
