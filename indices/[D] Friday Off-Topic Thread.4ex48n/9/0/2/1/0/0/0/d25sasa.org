I'm not entirely convinced that violent revolution is inevitable without change. There's an interesting correlation I like to keep my eye on. Basically, when the cost of the cheapest foods per year dips below a certain point, you get a revolution. This was the case in the arab spring, and has held out over many other revolutions. People revolt when they're starving.

Now, I don't think that it's likely for any group of political leaders in the USA to be incompetent enough to bring it to the point where large percentages of the population are actually going hungry. Mainly because that would require some extremely advanced levels of incompetence. So I don't think it's likely for the USA to have a revolution.

Unless increased automation leads to massive percentages of people to be out of work and the system is dumb enough not to put them on some form of government support. If that happen, yeah you'll have your revolution.
