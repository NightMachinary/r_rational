I don't think anyone can halt the shrinking of the middle class under our current system. Democrat, Republican, doesn't matter, our system is broken beyond fixing and should just be rebuilt if we don't want to have a violent revolution sometime in my lifetime. It so happens that there is an economic system which has been shown to fix a lot of those problems, and that system is called democratic socialism. Unless we transition to a system where everyone in the country actually benefits from massively improved production and wealth, eventually the people who have nothing under our system will kill those who have everything.

That's a fact borne out by evidence. Russia had been oppressing its poor for generations until the day the poor obliterated the old order. Hitler killed every person with money and power who didn't line up behind him. Imperialism collapsed worldwide as entire continents sent a collective Fuck You to Europe. The problem, of course, is that /none of those turned out well./ For the most part, violent revolutions go very badly. Which is why we must prevent one from happening here at all costs, by identifying and fixing the problems that will lead to one now, before it's too late.
