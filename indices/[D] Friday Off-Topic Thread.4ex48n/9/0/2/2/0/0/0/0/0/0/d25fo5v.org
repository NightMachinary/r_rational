So, we need fiscal conservatives? and "fiscal conservative" policy will "create wealth" (an unquestionable good!) more so then "fiscal liberal" policy which involves ominous "forced wealth redistribution". This created wealth will help form a balance against spending, with this desired balance being The Most Important Thing right now. A D President would be much more likely to block these R-backed "fiscal conservative" policies, so an R president is preferable. Therefore Trump before D.
