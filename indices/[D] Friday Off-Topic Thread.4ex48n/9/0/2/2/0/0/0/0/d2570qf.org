I think you make a false dichotomy here. Neither side is entirely about one or the other, and this assumes that the American political system falls on a well-calibrated centre compared to other countries. There will be some redistribution under the Republicans and some growth under the Democrats, and I suspect the absolute amounts of either won't vary a huge amount.
