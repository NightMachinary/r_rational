I'm genuinely curious about this: how do you stomach the ass-backwards social policy standpoints and decisions that Rs currently have and make? I feel like no matter what reasonable positions they may have about how to handle the economy, I'll never be able to quietly sit back and relax when such ignorant and hateful people are in power.
