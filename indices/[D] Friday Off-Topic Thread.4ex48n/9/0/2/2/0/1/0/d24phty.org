Personally, I typically have voted for the Democratic candidate in elections in which I have been eligible to vote, but I see how one who disagrees with Republicans on some of their social policies might still vote for a Republican President. The main thing a Republican president would do is:

- Not veto Republican legislation. A Democrat in the White House will stonewall certain suggestions from congress, including popular Republican ideas like reductions in both taxes and spending on social programs.

- Direct the executive branch and cabinet positions. A president might decide to enact or enforce [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_9066][executive]] [[https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/04/01/executive-order-blocking-property-certain-persons-engaging-significant-m][orders]] based on what they think is best for the country, which can vary quite a bit.

- Control the military and the intelligence branches of the government

- Appoint new justices to the Supreme Court

The actual stuff a conservative Republican can directly do to harm the social standing of various people directly is limited. Mainly, you'd want to watch out for anyone who seems trigger-happy on restricting civil liberties through direction action (Executive Orders and control of the intelligence agencies allows for this), or someone who would not veto socially restrictive national legislation. Also, anyone who would appoint rightist supreme ourt justices.

Since a lot of social policy is done on a state level (gay marriage, and effective access to abortion for example), the President won't be able to directly affect that. Probably the most worrying thing would be if a president was able to nominate a supreme court justice you disagreed with.

If your main goal are good social justice outcomes, probably the thing you care about most for presidents is that they nominate justices with whom you agree. Their use of military force doesn't directly affect social outcomes. Failure to veto bills you disagree with is a problem, but not nearly as much of a problem as a congress where both houses can muster a majority for a bad bill. Eventually, someone with whom you disagree will get elected unless the house is fixed.

The president has a lot of power, but things like setting tax rates, banning gay marriage/abortion, and so on, are not actually in his power. Anything he wants to do with that stuff has to rely on his ability to herd the cats in congress, which actually is not something I expect Trump would be able to do. Could Trump still cause lots of trouble with his court appointments, usages of executive power, and potential decisions with our intelligence and military agencies? Definitely. I wouldn't worry about his ability to lead the legislature though.

The ACA wasn't passed because Obama had direct power as president, it was passed because as president he had soft power and influence with his party, and the Democrats controlled both houses. Any threat to social justice from a national legislative level is likely to come from something like that. In this sense, one who agrees with Democrats on these issues should always vote for Democrats.
