  I fully expect Trump to stomp all over the conservative social R people in his efforts to de-screw the economy. I'm all for that, as I am a financial conservative and social liberal.

I think it's fair to say that so far Trump's talking points have been full of anger, hatred, misogyny, and xenophobia. Do you feel that (a) he will abandon those attitudes if he wins, or (b) his economic policies are important enough to outweigh those things, or (c) something else?
