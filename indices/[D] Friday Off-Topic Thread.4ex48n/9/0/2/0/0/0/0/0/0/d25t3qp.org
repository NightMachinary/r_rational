Where does my responsibility to pay for other poeple's happiness end? I believe it is right for me to pay into a pool of taxes that will be used to preserve the state, provide national infrastructure, and provide for several 'safety net' social programs that help those that are in hardship.

I have issues with paying for other people's happiness though. Perhaps it is because I am the sort of person who gets rather upset when I am offered any sort of charity when I am not in dire need.

If I didn't earn it, I don't want it. That's a bedrock part of my personality. It may make it impossible for me to come to agreement with many folks here.
