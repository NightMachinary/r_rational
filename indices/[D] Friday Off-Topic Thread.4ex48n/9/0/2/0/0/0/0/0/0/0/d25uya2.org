I don't think that's the core conflict, because that's actually a fairly major part of my own personality, but it doesn't lead us to the same conclusion. To the extent that I'm still not on welfare despite qualifying for it for the past 2 years. I tend to look at the whole thing through the lens of which solution would maximise total efficiency and also happiness. From this perspective many conventional arguments don't really enter into it.

Happiness gains decreasing returns from more money, therefore redistribute money in order to increase total happiness. Chances of most competent workers ending up in best positions increase in meritocratic rather than inheritance based systems, therefore curtailing dynasties through higher taxation can increase total efficiency by limiting nepotism with the side effect of increasing opportunity.

I don't claim that these are the absolute answers, but they fit my best current understanding, which is really all I can expect to be able to claim, in the end.
