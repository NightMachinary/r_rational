Fun predictions!

I don't have any of my own, but I do have bookies that I keep up with. The bookies are saying:

*Democratic Candidate*

- *5/1 (long) odds on Sanders* being the Democratic nominee. They give Sanders a *17%* chance of being the nominee, assuming fair odds. Since they shorten it to gain profit, they think his odds are actually lower.
- *1/8 (short) odds on Clinton* being the Democratic nominee. They give Clinton an *89%* chance of being the nominee, assuming fair odds. Since they shorten it (probably quite a bit) to gain profit, they think her odds are actually lower.
- Amazingly, they are also giving 25/1 (long) odds on Biden somehow becoming the nominee. Obviously, they real odds are much longer and they're shortening it, but it's hilarious to imagine Biden becoming the next Democratic nominee 4% of the time. Probably some people are betting on this so they shortened the odds a huge amount to make more cash.

In any case, since this adds up to 118%, you can tell they're shortening the odds to make a profit. Even so, the bookies disagree about who is likely to become the Democratic Party nominee. Sanders may well be our nominee, but it seems that the people who make a living off of making good probability estimates think it's more likely, though not certain, that Clinton will be our nominee.

*Republican Candidate*

- *4/7 (short) odds on Trump* being the nominee. Assuming fair odds, they give Trump a *63%* chance of being the nominee. Since they shorten it to gain profit, they think his odds are actually lower.
- *7/4 (long) odds on Cruz* being the nominee. Assuming fair odds, they give Cruz a *36%* chance of being the nominee. Since they shorten it to gain profit, they think his odds are actually lower.
- *9/1 (long) odds on Kasich* being the nominee. Assuming fair odds, they give Kasich a *10%* chance of being the nominee. Since they shorten it to gain profit, they think his odds are actually lower-- probably much lower.
- Romney and Ryan are both in there with very very long odds, that are still probably shortened for profit.

So, it looks like the bookies agree with you on Trump being the Republican nominee. Since this adds up to 109%+, you can tell they're shortening the odds to make a profit.

*Next President - Outright*

- *2/5 (short) odds on Clinton* being the president. Assuming fair odds, they give Clinton a *71%* chance of being the president. Since they shorten it to gain profit, they think her odds are actually lower.
- *5/1 (long) odds on Trump* being the president. Assuming fair odds, they give Trump a *17%* chance of being the president. Since they shorten it to gain profit, they think his odds are actually lower.
- *8/1 (short) odds on Sanders* being the president. Assuming fair odds, they give Sanders a *11%* chance of being the nominee. Since they shorten it to gain profit, they think his odds are actually lower.
- *10/1 (short) odds on Cruz* being the president. Assuming fair odds, they give Cruz a *9%* chance of being the nominee. Since they shorten it to gain profit, they think his odds are actually lower.
- Small chances in here for Kasich and (wow, again?) Biden as well.

Pretty fun. Again, as always, they shorten the odds for a profit. Here, we see 108%+ chance, added together. These predictions are from a standing start, not contingent on anything in the future, and the odds change over time.

*Winning Party -- Outright*

- *1/3 (short) odds on the Democrats winning. 75% chance if odds are fair*
- *9/4 (long) odds on the Republicans winning. 30% chance if odds are fair*

Pretty fun. Again, as always, they shorten the odds for a profit. Here, we see 105%+ chance, added together. These predictions are from a standing start, not contingent on anything in the future, and the odds change over time, especially as we see nominees.

Looks like your predictions on the electoral outcomes are not implausible. Trump will likely win the Republican nomination, and will likely lose the general election. Although Clinton is more likely to win the Democratic nomination than Sanders, Sanders still has a good shot at it.

The moral of this story: watch for Biden coming out of left field! Biden 2016! Biden 2016!
