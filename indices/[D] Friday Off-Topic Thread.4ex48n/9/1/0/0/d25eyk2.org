I mean, ok, fair enough, but Trump is running for the /Republican/ nomination. And Trump is also majorly missing one of Quirrellmort's most important implied pieces of advice: have a David Monroe figure. For an egomaniacal sociopath, he's suffering from the sociopath's typical flaw: such a total lack of self-control that he never reaches past the sociopathy to acquire any real charisma he could use to get followers. I mean, he's basically an Ork Boss -- not even the Fist o' Gork an' Mork, just a regular Bossboy.

Fuck - speaking as a voter, donor, and volunteer for the Sanders campaign - in this campaign, Bernie "Anvil that Needs to be Dropped" Sanders is the /most/ charismatic candidate in the race. That's actually really fucked-up. Or possibly, on the other hand, my expectations for charisma are completely miscalibrated by anime and other fiction in which both the heroes and the villains are really good at making you actually root for them.

And sorry to say, but I do expect Hillary to win in New York. We've pulled upsets before like in Michigan, but that was a unique situation where a state law prevented polls from actually drawing a well-randomized sample. In NY, we're well behind, still suffering that retarded racial gap thing, and she's got the state's Democratic machine sewn up. It's the state that gave the world Tammany Hall.

  To test my understanding of politics and people by predicting how the public will vote. I'm doing this publicly as a way to keep myself from flinching from being wrong later and not saying, 'I really knew that other person would win' all along.

Very virtuous of you, yeah.

  To have some political discussion where people are most likely to keep a cool head. I am also curious to know where people stand in politics. Don't worry! I won't hold anyone's political views against them. There are too many good and interesting people I want to meet who have political views strongly opposed to mine for me to reject someone purely on politics.

So what /do/ you judge on? For me it's usually about how someone treats ordinary people around them, in-person.
