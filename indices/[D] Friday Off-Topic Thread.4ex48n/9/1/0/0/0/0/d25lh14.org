  Thank you! I was a little bit nervous to say it.

Why? You shouldn't feel nervous just about saying stuff.

  To belabor the point with an example, I don't think knowing that someone supports gun rights is very helpful in knowing about their personality unless they also do something like going out and actually buying a gun, has a license in using a gun, or goes to a protest to support gun rights.

Funny thing: I work with several Massachusetts liberals who /looove/ driving up to New Hampshire and going to a firing range for fun. I can't bring myself to do it mostly because I /really do/ associate guns with war, or rather, with the off-duty soldiers who I would mostly see carrying, and whose lives I generally didn't envy.
