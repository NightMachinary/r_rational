I'm not comfortable betting money on politics, but if you wanted me to put a value on how strongly I believe Sanders will beat out Clinton, it would be 70% certainty. It seems to depend on who wins NY.

I posted my predictions for the following reasons:

- To test my understanding of politics and people by predicting how the public will vote. I'm doing this publicly as a way to keep myself from flinching from being wrong later and not saying, 'I really knew that other person would win' all along.

- To have some political discussion where people are most likely to keep a cool head. I am also curious to know where people here stand in politics. Don't worry! I won't hold anyone's political views against them. There are too many good and interesting people I want to meet who have political views strongly opposed to mine for me to reject someone purely on politics.

- To test my understanding of Dark Arts Rationality. Trump seems to do a lot of the same things as Quirrel says to do to manipulate the public and he reminds of Quirrel, but not in the hyper-competence way. In addition, he acts very much like a sociopath I once knew who I will call S for sociopath. Like S, Trump will say anything he wants to get other people to believe his 'image', he only cares about his public image. Like S, Trump has never shown any remorse or regret for any of his actions and the few times S apologized for anything, S showed no signs of lingering guilt. The one time that S was caught out in his lies and manipulations, S did a major 180 degree turn and went from being dismissive and insulting to wooing and being extremely loving towards the woman I knew. Since Trump has show many other signs of being similar to S, I fully expect him to do a flip-flop once he gets the Republican nomination. I think of his relationship towards the Democratic party as similar to the relationship between S and the woman (She dumped him hard with a restraining order on S).

Sorry for such a long post. I know it wasn't what you were asking for but when I started typing, all of this just flowed right out of me.
