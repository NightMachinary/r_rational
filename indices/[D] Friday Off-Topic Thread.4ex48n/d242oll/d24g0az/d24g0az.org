Wherever you get the number from, you need to learn how to get them to make you an offer first. The first person to make an offer is generally considered to be at a disadvantage. A truly good negotiator will still probably get the better deal. If you feel like you are being lowballed, ask for a set raise after 90 or 180 days if you are meeting their needs well enough to remain employed. If they agree, get it in writing. Also, you absolutely MUST learn what types of questions you should be asking. There is a science to interviewing, and if you learn it, it can make a huge difference in your pay and benefits.
