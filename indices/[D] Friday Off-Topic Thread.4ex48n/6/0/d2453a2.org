There are actually specific responses you should try to give if you can, or try to get an offer from them first. In general, part of what they're hoping for is that there's a like, inverse bid-ask spread, where your dream salary is lower than what they're willing to offer. So for example:

- The most you'd ask for is $65,000 since you're not aware of your value.

- The company is willing to pay you up to $80,000

So, in this case if the company asks you what you'd want, you say "$65k/yr", they pay you, and you leave $15k on the table. However, if you are canny, do research, and ask "$90k/yr", they say "the best we can do is $80k" and you don't leave cash on the table. Or, if they make an offer first, they offer you say $75k/yr and you leave less cash on the table if you accept it. You can also still counter-offer.

Either outcome (hearing their offer first, or being informed and making a big ask) is better than making a small ask and leaving cash on the table.

You won't ever be given more than you ask, so ask high. It's tough to ask so high that it negatively impacts you. I use glassdoor to find out salaries. In my area, the SF Bay Area, an entry-level electrical engineer or software engineer should be making at least $60k/year. Depending on your field and level of knowledge (and the company) this can be higher.
