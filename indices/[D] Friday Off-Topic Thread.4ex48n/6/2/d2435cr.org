It depends on the state, I believe. The average salary is higher in large, metropolitan places like New York, Atlanta, etc. than it would be in other places. I'm not an engineer, but I was a mechanical engineering student for three years at Georgia Tech. We were told that we'd be expected to have starting salaries in the $50k area, although for the life of me, I can't remember if that's before or after taxes. This was in Atlanta, Georgia.

That being said, just google your question. There are tons of sites and whatnot that have done that research for you :)
