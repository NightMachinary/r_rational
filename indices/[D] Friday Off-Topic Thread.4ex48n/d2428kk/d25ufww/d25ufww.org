I pay fairly close attention to the metrics on my story and the ways that they trend upwards and downwards. If you look at the charts for viewership numbers, (which are a more useful metric to a writer than reviews, as well as tracking closer to favs which I see as more important as well) you'll see that on the day you post and 1-2 days afterwards you get increased numbers (around 3-4 X my non-updating baseline), after which it'll basically go back down to baseline pretty reliably over the course of the next few days. Unfortunately this means that the most useful advice I can give you is "no more often than every 3 days", which obviously doesn't answer your question but I'm afraid it's the best I've been able to come up with from my study of the data.

Now if you want to encourage (manipulate) more readers into reading your story, but you don't want to feel manipulative your options will obviously be fairly limited. So instead I'll just list all the methods I'm aware of and you can decide from there. I don't use all these myself, they are however the methods I've noticed as being most effective. Breaking up your chapters and posting every 3 days would probably increase your numbers, by allowing you to ride a constant tide of high viewership numbers, but you've said you don't want to do that. Asking questions in the A/N at the end is a time tested method to get reviews. Simpler questions will encourage more reviews, as they require less effort from the reader. It's best to ask questions which are genuinely interesting to you, because people can sometimes tell if you're being insincere. A good picture is definitely a plus, yours is pretty good so you seem to have that covered. Chiaroscuro as an example of both recently asked people to vote on what his new picture from four options, which I recognised as an extremely effective manipulation while also being taken in by it. So I left a review. Very clever of him/her.

The largest option you have for more readers would be crossposting it to SufficientVelocity and SpaceBattles forums, with links to the ff.net version in the first post. You would likely gain both extra total readers and extra ff.net readers as people migrated to read on their favourite platform. Properly implemented, it is entirely possible that your total readers over all platforms would multiply as much as three or five times over. It is also entirely possible that you'd get as many likes on each chapter as your current fav count on SB, since the more general method of people finding new fics means you'd be competing for readers from a far larger pool. Instead of competing just for Shokugeki no Soma readers, you would be competing for the pool of all readers. For example if I have 174 arbitrary numbers worth of views on ff.net, then I have 264 on SB and 82 on SV. I approximate that normally the SB number should be only twice the SV number, but since I engaged the community regularly in discussion and conversation on SB and not SV, the SB thread stayed on the front page for a disproportionate amount of time and the numbers were inflated. You can obviously manipulate that by posting replies when your thread coincidentally is just about to leave the front page.

The downside to this is the extra time spent posting things on three sites, and the extra time it takes to make any edits to three sites. This is especially a problem for me because I suffer from depression and thus pull from an extremely limited pool of purposeful effort every day, I think therefore that it might be less of an issue for you. On the upside you can generally expect a far greater volume of feedback, and on SB and SV a surprisingly large percentage of the people you talk to will also be working on fics of their own. This means you can get some surprisingly high quality feedback from people who really know what they're doing. It also means the readers can be somewhat mercurial. While by and large it's positive, sometimes it isn't, especially if the author doesn't know how to properly mediate a crowd. There is also the risk of spending too much time interacting with the community and not enough writing, because it's fun to talk to readers. Also if you've got massive plot holes or other discrepancies, they will point them out.

Finally there is obviously the option of posting it here, if it's rational fiction that is. I think I picked up a fair number of readers around here. In fact, it's probably where I got a /lot/ of my first 100.
