Those are pretty interesting ideas. The cross posting idea is a really good one, I'll have to look into that. A few people have mentioned it, so I may look into doing the little question/poll things at the end of each chapter. As far as posting it here, I wouldn't do that. It's not rational fiction in the least. It's just an AU, more intelligent interpretation of Shokugeki no Soma. But it's still most certainly shonen.

Either way, thanks for the detailed response good sir/madam!
