Fanfiction Question:

So first things first, this question will have little to do with rational elements at ALL (unless you count trying to manipulate an audience somewhat rational), so I apologize in advance:

I'm writing a Shokugeki no Soma (Food Wars, an anime) fanfiction called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11804422/1/Nisegami][Nisegami]]. It's currently about 75k words, 9 chapters and it's been out for like two months (I update it pretty much every week).

Here's my question: I'm trying to maximize the amount of reviews I get on my story. I don't want to break my chapters up into smaller ones (which could be a valid way to increase my review spread) So, with my review goal in mind, is updating every week too often? I just wondered if leaving longer gaps in between updates would make people "thirsty for more", thereby increasing the story's popularity? There may not be a specific right/wrong answer to this question but many of you are experienced, intelligent authors, so I figured I'd ask :)

EDIT: And even beyond just my initial question about spacing out updates, what are some of the other methods you guys have seen/used to increase the amount of hype/feedback your story has gotten? I'm already posting updates on the subreddit of the series, and I do my best to reply to all of my reviewers. What more can I be doing to get views/reviews?
