Yeah, I can understand consistency being an issue, but for all the trouble it is it helps both readers and the writer, from what I've experienced and those I've spoken to. It certainly helps retain my interest as a reader. I really enjoy consistent, serial fiction, and having a day to it rather than + or - 7 days helps more than you'd think with that.
