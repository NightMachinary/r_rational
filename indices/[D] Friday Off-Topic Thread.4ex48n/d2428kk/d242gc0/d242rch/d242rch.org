I've seen that method employed on a fic or two but I really don't have any questions I'd need answered from my audience other than "So what did you think of this chapter" or "How're you liking A's interactions with B?" which are almost implied questions by default, since reviews are there to get feedback on the chapter.

So if I were to do that, I'd feel like I was just trying to farm reviews, in much the same way I'd feel if I broke up my chapter lengths simply to improve the spread. Your answer makes a lot of sense from an intelligent perspective, and I'm not knocking it, I'm just saying I don't know if it's a method I'd prefer to use :P
