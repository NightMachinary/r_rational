The effect is exaggerated to an incredible degree on ArchiveOfOurOwn.org, where any user (even an anonymous guest) can leave /multiple/ comments on a chapter, but can give only one "kudos" to the story.\\
- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/234222][The most-kudosed English /Harry Potter/ story]] is below #200 among the most-commented-on stories in the same category; and\\
- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/811170][The most-commented-on English /Harry Potter/ story]] is below #200 among the most-kudosed stories in the same category.

I don't see much point in paying attention to review/comment count.
