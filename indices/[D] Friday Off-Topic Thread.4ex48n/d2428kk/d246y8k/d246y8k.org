I wonder, though--when searching for a new story to read, how many frequenters of FanFiction.net look at review counts, and how many look at favorites? I personally sort by favorites, and try to give less weight to reviews, specifically because reviews are multiplied by chapter count, while a person can give only one favorite to the entire story. Also, a review may be positive or negative (e.g., /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3929411][Chunin Exam Day]]/ is #11 on favorites but #1 on reviews among English /Naruto/ stories, while /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644][Time Braid]]/ is #48 and #73, respectively), while a favorite obviously always is positive.

It'd be an interesting survey to conduct.

(In particular: I've given out 33 reviews in the course of my FanFiction.net career, in comparison to my 299 favorites, and probably half of those reviews were negative--so I /really/ don't consider reviews to be a very good indicator of a story's worth.)
