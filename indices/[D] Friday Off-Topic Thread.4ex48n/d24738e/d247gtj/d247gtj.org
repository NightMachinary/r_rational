I've never seen anyone use that. If I had to guess, though, ff.net users with alternate character interpretations like to say, for example, cold!dark!smart!harem! Naruto as ff.net doesn't have tags. So from there people would use Rational! in their summaries to denote that it's a rational fic, and from there, tl fit in ff.net's restrictive character limit, they'd contract down to R!
