In Fanfiction parlance, exclam means "version of", and can generally be replaced by "version of" or a space. So for example, in fanfictions in which harry potter is born a girl or named harriet potter or something, authors will refer to it as a "Fem!Harry" fic. In fics of Naruto where Naruto is ruthless and evil, it's a "Dark!Naruto" fic. Harry has secret magic? "Powerful!Harry". Replacing the exclam with a space or with "version of" makes sense of it.

This lingo was obviously developed by people who are not programmers.
