  +The Earth is changing. The alien invasion brought social upheaval, advanced technology, and an armada of peacekeeping robots. But+ Alan+, a college student pursuing a now-useless degree, cares little about all of this. He+ has only one thing on his mind: the Game. A fully immersive virtual reality, the Game appears to be a major part of the invading civilization. Alan can't wait to play, recklessly diving into the digital universe. Soon though, Alan realizes the Game is anything but simple, and the stakes are higher than he ever imagined.
