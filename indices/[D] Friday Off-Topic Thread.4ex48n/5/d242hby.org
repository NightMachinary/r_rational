I burnt my hand, want to see some gross pictures? [[http://imgur.com/btZ6z2a][Here's shortly after it happened on Saturday]] and [[http://imgur.com/4GMZa8I][here's today]]. I was pulling some bacon out of the oven and spilled some bacon grease on myself. Luckily it didn't get on my fingers, and aside from the first day (when it hurt really, really bad) it's mostly just an ugly, annoying pain.
