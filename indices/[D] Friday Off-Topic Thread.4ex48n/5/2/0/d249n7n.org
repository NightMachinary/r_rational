No, I didn't go to the hospital. Reccomendation for second degree burns is that you just deal with it on your own unless it's more than three inches across. There's nothing that they'd do there except put something cold on it to prevent inflammation, give me some painkillers, spray it with antiseptic, then put burn gel on it and wrap it in gauze. But I can do (and did do) all those things myself. This is probably the worst burn I've ever had, but definitely not the first in the course of cooking.
