  Wait, you burned your hand, then took a picture of it?

I always take pictures when I get hurt. Not only is it just good record-keeping, but it can help for diagnosis once you've got it covered, assuming that it's not serious enough to go to the hospital. (This picture was taken between soaks in cool water and after I'd taken painkillers.)
