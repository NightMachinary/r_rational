I had that happen to me too when I was younger. Mine was the quarter the size of yours, was from a hot pan instead of grease, and much closer to my finger tips. This is only from my personal experience, and not a medical opinion, but it should make something like a blister and then into a hard scab before disappearing without a scar. It helped to cover it with guaze and to keep an ice pack or something cold on a few times throughout the day.
