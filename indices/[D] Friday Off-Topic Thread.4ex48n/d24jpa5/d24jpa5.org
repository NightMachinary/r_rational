The cover for Two Year Emperor, Book 2 just arrived, and [[https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3294457/thedraugarwar.jpg][it is amazing]]. If anyone ever needs graphic design work for anything, go talk to:

Most of what she does is romance novel covers, which makes her portfolio seem a bit...straightforward?...monotonic?...not sure what word I'm looking for. When you give her a free hand, this is the quality you get. All I did was send her a paragraph-long summary of the book and she came up with this. She's not expensive, either.
