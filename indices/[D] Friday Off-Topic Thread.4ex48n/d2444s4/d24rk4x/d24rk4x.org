Anecdata: The reviews on apartmentratings.com tend to be correlated with both the tours that I've done and with other ratings sites. At least in Atlanta, I also see roughly the expected correlations (management, quality of maintenance) between apartments that are run by the same corporation, and with quality of the area. Those ratings have served me pretty well so far.
