To my knowledge the debate isn't settled. It's more of a trade-off in terms of wound healing vs. risk of infection (with infection greatly slowing wound healing) and highly dependent on the antiseptic in question, as well as the type of wound. Burns in particular are prone to infection so generally get treated with antiseptics, especially since in my case the top layer of skin was completely removed with the burn.
