I'm not sure it fits the 'rational' tag as well as Worm does though - reason being I have no intuitive understanding of what's possible in the Pact world: I don't know what the rules are. When a character in Worm does something clever I /could/ have thought of it myself, given time. Not so in Pact, I think.

I notice that I don't have the same feeling about hpmor even though the same argument could be made. I suspect the difference is my pre-existing familiarity with the HP universe.
