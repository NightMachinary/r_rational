I've heard that when it comes to roleplaying and mysteries, first come up with a number of clues that makes the mystery super obvious and solvable. Then triple that number. Basically, from an inside perspective it always seems much, much easier to solve than when it will be for your players to solve it. This makes sense, the author already knows the answer, so all the clues are interpreted in light of the answer. When it's an actual mystery, it's way harder.
