WaitButWhy just wrote a great [[http://waitbutwhy.com/2016/03/cryonics.html][article]] about Cryonics, covering nearly every aspect of the topic in an easy-to-understand manner. He's done great articles on several other topics Lesswrong has covered, including AI, the Fermi Paradox, and others. Overall a great site.
