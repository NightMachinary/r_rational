  About half of my project has been realising why my topic seems like an obvious hole in the literature. On good days I still think it's that crossing disciplines is rare, on bad days I dream of all the people who tried and just couldn't make it work. Less than two months to go, now.

Which disciplines are you crossing over? Particle acceleration and magic?
