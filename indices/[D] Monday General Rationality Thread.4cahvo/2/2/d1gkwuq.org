In all the time I've been playing roleplaying games, I have never once seen a group of players actually solve a puzzle. With that in mind, I strongly recommend that you make only light preparations, and be ready to change the story to that whatever zany scheme the players come up with ends up actually working. The alternative is sitting around the table while the players twiddle their thumbs looking bored.
