Is this a game with knowledge or perception rolls (like the various editions of D&D)? If so, you could supply them with extra signposts to your clues by doing hidden rolls in response to their questions.

E.g. players completely fail to notice that one NPC wasn't present in an eyewitness account. As they dig deeper into the details (still missing the crucial observation, becoming frustrated), roll behind your screen. Then ignore the result of the roll and just tell a player that they noticed something strange about the number of people that were there (or a similar "hint to a clue"). That will get them to ask the NPC the right questions, which will get them back on track.
