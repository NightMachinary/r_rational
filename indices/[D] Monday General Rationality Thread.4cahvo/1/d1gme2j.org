Aaaaaand the numerical measurement code I was using is buggy. Of course. But for a short, blissful period, it almost kinda looked like my hypothesis was correct: the trained model had a higher number. Now it has a lower number. God knows what I'm fucking doing anymore without a test dataset.

Edit: hahaha fuck me, I'm mixing discrete and continuous variables and treating both as continuous. That might be a problem, you know?
