As someone who reads a lot of RWBY fanfiction, but thinks the show itself is quite bad this is very intriguing to me. I'll try to give a semi comprehensive list of parts of the show I have issues with.

- First Volume:

  - Jaune not knowing about Aura and the lack of reasons not to unlock it are giant plotholes that have just never been addressed as you pointed out.
  - I agree Jaune should have never made it to Beacon. To follow up on that, he should have been so miserably behind that he could never have possibly caught up at the most elite combat school in the world. You can't just do a few weeks/months of hard training and catch up with people who have been training for half their lives like that. If you want to keep him around for some reason, come up with a good reason Ozpin would let him in despite him being worthless or buff him.
  - The team selection is fun, but extremely irrational. Almost any other method would probably create better balanced teams than what we see in the show. A rational Ozpin would come up with something else, or be manipulating the results behind the scenes to produce teams he thinks are good.
  - Also Blake is just kind of hugely awkward. A rational Ozpin would probably take more precautions with a known former terrorist than we see in the show. She'd also obviously change her last name at least.
  - The team conflict is swept under the rug a bit too easily. Weiss pivots on a dime with one inspiring speech to unquestionably support a leader who she has legitimate complaints about. (Don't get me wrong, I like Ruby, she does have flaws from a leadership standpoint though.)
  - The bullying arc... ugh. What a disaster.
  - Weiss/Blake conflict. Another situation that resolves too easily.
  - The docks and Torchwick. This should tie more into the overarching V1-3 plot. As is its a really bad look for Torchwick/The White Fang that random students mess them up so badly, and the stealing dust plot goes nowhere in the show itself.

- Second Volume:

  - God damn Emerald. She breaks the world in half. The fact that no one anywhere has something like Worm's Master/Stranger protocols is a massive worldbuilding fail. She either needs a power nerf, or the world needs to be massively overhauled to rationally respond to the existence of people like her.
  - Students running off to fight terrorists is just... I don't know. I'm not sure how you can rationally solve this without just scrapping the Beacon arc almost entirely. (Which I think wouldn't be a bad idea.) Not to mention the massive collateral damage they cause and get off scot free for. Also just not Torchwick's style up to this point.
  - The dance arc... well I definitely didn't personally like it. It actually rubbed me extremely the wrong way when both Ruby and Blake were pressured into it and too conform. That might be my personal bias though.
  - Cinder's "infiltration." Its absolutely absurd that she was caught in the act, but then nothing was done about the virus she planted. Also the security was just god awful.
  - Again, students should not be sent on a "training" mission to hunt down terrorists without a damn good reason. That they would try and do it anyway is not a good reason.
  - RUBY SHOULD NOT BE THAT INCOMPETENT WITH JUST HER FISTS. This annoys me so much. If she's is strong enough to swing Crescent Rose around like she does, she would have to be ridiculously buff. Even with almost no training she should be able to punch damn hard, especially against the pathetic white fang grunts who don't even seem like they have aura. Its also absurd that she is so clueless when her father and sister are both fist fighters and she has trained with them a lot.
  - The Breach was weird, pointless, and no one in universe seemed to care. This should be a big damn deal, but its just kind of forgotten after the finale and never comes up again.

- Third Volume:

  - Just in general the Ozluminati is hilariously incompetent and moronic.
  - The tournament is weirdly setup and makes basically no sense. Its a tournament though so they can kind of get away with it.
  - Do something else with Winter. Her first impression of slapping her sister then getting into a destructive fight only to be immediately yeeted for 4 volumes is terrible. What the hell were they thinking?
  - The Schnee semblance is weird, and the fact that its just randomly hereditary unlike every other semblance is a bit of a worldbuilding fail. Semblances in general just make no impact on the worldbuilding when they should be hugely influential.
  - Both the defenders and the attackers should be massively buffed in competence.
  - Probably should rework the maidens. A rational Ozpin would have never created them as they exist in the show in the first place. The vaults are also weird and don't make a whole lot of sense.
  - God damn Atlas is horribly incompetent. I know Fascist governments tend to be a pack of morons run by the lowest common denominator, but come on.
  - Basically I have nothing good to say about the second half of this volume. I know most people loved it, and maybe it kind of works on an emotional level, maybe. It doesn't redeem the clown fiesta of nonsense it represents in my opinion.

- Fourth Volume:

  - Just what is this. Volume 4 and 5 are a giant waste of space. What a disaster. Definitely the worst volumes of RWBY.
  - So yeah Salem. I guess this is as good a time as any to get into a critique of the Grimm in general. In most of the show Grimm basically exist to be meaningless chaff the heroes style on with cool animation. They just don't feel threatening at all. Any real fight is going to be against a human enemy, which is just massively wasteful of their potential. That said, how the hell has Salem not won already? Not only has she not won, Humans have goddamned flourished. They have setup a technological civilization with rough parity with modern Earth in a world full of Eldritch monsters. It baffles me that in the show they can act like Grimm are a threat at all with the context of how well humans have done. Either Grimm should be less threatening than they have ever been at any point in history, or humans should have lost already. If Salem is capable of challenging the civilization we see in the show in the slightest, then she would have easily annihilated a less modern civilization. This whole disaster mess of worldbuilding should be completely redesigned in my opinion. Don't even get me started on how trivial it should be to get around Salem's vaunted immortality.

Honestly I'm going to stop there. I don't see much point in going on harping on individual plot points any further. Any rational rewrite that gets this far is necessarily going to look completely different I think. Also I'm kind of tired of going on writing more atm haha. If you want more of my ranting/feedback on my problems with later volumes feel free to tell me and I'll write it out later.
