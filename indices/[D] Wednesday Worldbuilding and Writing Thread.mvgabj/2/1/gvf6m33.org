- *The Antidivinationist Party:* Well known for their flyers and cartoons which mock diviners as being perverts who walk around cities with one hand down their pants to stroke themselves off. Generally casts diviners as peeping toms, busybodies, eavesdroppers, thought police, liars, and perverts. Passes and proposes legislation restricting legal uses of divination as well as limiting access to supplies and training required for divination. Their opposition portrays them as a party which 'mysteriously' has a lot of support from some very wealthy and powerful people. Campaign slogan: "They're looking at your children right now!"

- *The "Party Party":* Best known for their drug-fueled raves, orgies, and wild parties which generally involve large amounts of alcohol, psychedelic mushrooms, and a 'fuckload of hella trippy illusions'. Popular among illusionists and enchanters, though all walks of life may be found in the Party Party. Passes and proposes legislation which advances sexual freedom, access to birth control, freedom to use drugs, illusions, and mind-altering enchantments, as well freedom to summon creatures for prurient or mind-altering purposes. Opposition parties often portray them as stoners who can be found drunkenly bleating at sheep in the wee hours of the morning. They do not argue with this portrayal. Campaign slogan: "Fuck us or fuck off!"
