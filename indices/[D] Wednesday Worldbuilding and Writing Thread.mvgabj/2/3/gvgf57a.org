*Neighbour Party*: Very concerned with making sure that everybody has good neighbors, which entails (1) entrenching the rights and powers of (or, if need be, inventing) homeowner's associations and (2) making sure that everyone has a horse, because that necessarily means that everyone has horses for neighbors (and as everybody knows, horses are perfect neighbors). Very NIMBY, except where horses are concerned, and would like to ban glue factories, violins, and certain paintbrushes. Often just called "Neighbour."
