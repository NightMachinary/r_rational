I feel like social media would be an easy way to deconstruct it, since it's already quite common to see it used as a means to enable evil as a way to get acceptance and validation. A facebook shitposting group, an anonymous imageboard, a chatroom with more than 50 people on it, etc. It's hard to call any of these practical when they're so chaotic and coordination or even coherent conversations are almost non-existent most of the time. The individuals also have very loose bonds between each other while identifying themselves as part of a greater whole. This way one could easily get a large family of strangers who have little in common other than the fact that they do evil to relate to each other through their involvement in a virtual social contract that is at odds with the commonly accepted one.
