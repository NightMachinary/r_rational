Ask and you shall receive!

- Volume 4 Continued:

  - Why are they doing this in the first place? I could just be forgetting but I don't remember ever getting good reasons for journeying to Mistral.
  - The idea of them going on a dangerous hunt while one of them is unarmed is laughable. How are we the viewers supposed to take things seriously when the writers are putting in ridiculous slapstick like this in what should be dangerous situations.
  - Ships should have hunter escorts. Sure they had a few defenses, but if Blake/Sun hadn't been there they would have all died.
  - The politics on Menagerie are weird. I'm not really sure what Roosterteeth was going for here, but any rational portrayal would need a lot of filling in I think.
  - The White Fang attacking Blake is haphazard and incompetent.
  - Tyrian being sent alone to kidnap Ruby is a bit strange. How the heck did he find them? There's a few possible explanations but none are offered in the show. Also, the sheer hubris of thinking he could pull it off alone is astonishing. Even in the relatively vulnerable position Ruby had put herself in.
  - This is more a matter of personal taste, but I hate the Oscar subplot. He proceeds to enter the show and devour ridiculous amounts of runtime with fairly boring angst plotlines.
  - The Schnee semblance is just begging to be munchkined harder. What are the limits? If she kills a person could she summon them too?
  - Its really weird that the Nuckleavee just hangs out in the village it destroyed instead of moving on and finding new targets. Its also weird that no hunters were dispatched to deal with it at any point. Presumably with it removed the town could be rebuilt easier than just founding a new settlement.

- Volume 5:

  - The Menagerie plotline continues to be a mess. In my opinion there is basically nothing salvageable from it except the most broad of details.
  - Killing Sien
  - It continues to be strange how unprepared everyone in setting is for Grimm attacks. Do they just hope to not be noticed? RIP Pilot boi.
  - Oh god so much exposition.
  - For people who bandit for a living Raven's tribe is really bad at holding prisoners.
  - They are also really damn incompetent in a fight, but that's probably fine.
  - Raven vaguely warns against trusting Ozpin but doesn't really provide any specific reasons not too. This should probably be expanded on.
  - Holy shit Raven's semblance is broken and it is also begging to be munchkined. If semblance's with effects this ridiculous exist they really really should be having much stronger effects on worldbuilding. Raven could make a killing in the transport industry instead of wasting time being a bandit.
  - Did I say oh god the exposition? Let me repeat oh god the exposition.
  - The Battle of Haven is a complete narrative mess and the worst laid ambush of all time. As you mentioned why the hell is Adam attacking it?
  - Do not have Cinder die but actually live because of author fiat after a pointless but flashy fight.

- Volume 6:

  - Why the hell would Ozpin not mention the lamp attracts Grimm? Why does it attract Grimm? This just seems like a cheap narrative ploy to give Ozpin untrustworthiness points.
  - Professional Hunters should not be so horrifically incompetent, or there should be good worldbuilding explaining why they are so pathetic.
  - Neo desperately needs a better motivation than revenge on Cinder then be talked out of it and into a loyal minion in two seconds.
  - The spiders should either not come up at all or have much more worldbuilding relevance.
  - Maria should probably have a better reason for showing up then coincidence if she shows up at all. She really wasn't necessary for the plot and kind of wastes space.
  - Jinn desperately deserves better munchkinry. If Ozpin really had unfettered access to her power for centuries then he should have gotten some damn good answers to his questions.
  - The God's backstory flashback is kind of a disaster, even if it was presented well. There is nothing rational about the behavior presented, and its never explained how humanity got completely wiped out then randomly came back.
  - Salem is immortal! Who cares. She's not impervious to harm, so this only increases the difficulty of dealing with her mildly. This also isn't a huge change from the status quo of the Grimm being an ever present threat that can't be permanently dealt with. I'm not sure why everyone loses their minds over this.
  - Ozpin hiding from everything is really damn childish.
  - Once again experienced hunters show a shocking lack of knowledge in types of Grimm.
  - Why the hell do Crescent Rose's heavy caliber god damn sniper bullets bounce off the physically weak Apathy?! Damn it Roosterteeth.
  - Adam is very sneaky to follow them so long and never be noticed.
  - The giant mecha fight is absolutely absurd. Do they keep no professional hunters on staff? In general the Atlas military is hilariously incompetent.

- Volume 7:

  - Oh boy is this one controversial.
  - The Ace Ops instantly incapacitating all of the heroes is just... I have no words for how stupid and ridiculous this is especially considering what happens later in the volume. At the very very least isn't Qrow supposed to be a damn strong huntsman?
  - Ironwood is a moron for not defending Mantle better. I'm sure he could spare the material to fix the giant gaping holes in the wall, and if he couldn't then he has bigger issues than trying to get communications up again.
  - Robin has a truth telling semblance?! Gaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!! Why does she not take advantage of this more. More really impactful semblances just begging to be munchkined.
  - Penny getting blamed for Tyrian's attack shattered my suspension of disbelief completely. Faunus have god damn night vision, it was sort of an important plot point in previous volumes.
  - Jaques is far too easily toppled. He just completely capitulated without resistance because of something a character we had never seen before did. This isn't even a rational thing, this is just awful storytelling.
  - Why does Ironwood go fight Watts 1v1? I am baffled why the general is out in the field fighting period.
  - Ironwood loses his mind at this point and every decision he makes from here on out is made to be as moronic as possible. (Not that he wasn't already really stupid.)
  - His vaunted plan to escape with Atlas is just ridiculous. There is no possible way they would be able to feed themselves with just the metal city. Even if they could, the economic disaster of doing such a thing would be crippling. This isn't even getting into the morality of it! The plan is completely unworkable in the first place from a rational stand point.
  - Tyrian breaking free and killing Clover could have been prevented with even a single second of any amount of thinking. This whole sequence is as irrational as it gets.
  - The defenses on the Winter Maiden are pathetic.
  - Neo stealing the relic is also a clown show.
