- Volume 8:

  - There is definitely a more rational way the heroes could have decided to try and do things here. I'm not sure wasting time calling for help is a good idea when the attack is currently happening and no one is that close.
  - Oscar getting kidnapped is a pathetic display of ineptitude. Buff the competence of the heroes and the kidnapper in this case.
  - Oh also in general when aura breaks is just horrifically inconsistent.
  - The Penny hacking plotline is just awful and makes no sense.
  - It felt a bit trivially easy for Oscar to turn the villains from Salem's side.
  - The staff storing enough magical power to blow up that whale is a gigantic plot hole, and should have been used to annihilate Cinder in Volume 3.
  - The Atlas army just fought... and they just won. No need to evacuate, no need for a murderous fascist takeover, no need for anything. They just straight up beat the Grimm. Makes Ironwood's desperate plan look even more stupid than it already was. They even had a plan to destroy the whale without Ozpin's help.
  - I really strongly did not care about Cinder's backstory. She is incredibly boring as a villain.
  - Neo's motivations continue to make no sense.
  - Everything they do with the staff is pants on head. I still don't really understand how they made the portal room when they do not actually understand how to make portals.
  - I don't really understand why the evacuation was necessary when they had already won.
  - Even further, after creating the greatest refugee crisis in the history of Remnant I'm unsure how they expected to feed or protect everyone.

There's probably more I could harp on, but I think I hit almost every major plot point I had issues with.
