Yes please! I'd love to hear more ranting + feedback, these are the exact sort of things I plan on addressing!

I also agree wholeheartedly with pretty much every one of your points. For the team selection, I was considering having Glynda subtly direct each person as they fly so that planned pairs of people land next to each other. Her telekinesis Semblance has no visible effect on the target, and the hand motions accompanying could be a concentration aid instead of mandatory action to activate the Semblance.
