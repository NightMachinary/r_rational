- *Heaven*: Actually a group of lawful-good-aligned Clerics who have decided to try to push the will of their gods through the political process. Their major aim is to set up the rules in such a way as to encourage people to be good. Slogan: "Do The Right Thing"
- *Hell*: A group of lawful-evil-aligned Clerics who saw the Heaven party and decided to have a go at trying things their way, instead. Slogan: "When We Come Out On Top, You'll Appreciate Having Helped Us"
- *The Eldritch Brotherhood Of The Eastern Star*: A group of mages who have not yet mastered the art of speaking in short sentences. Very much in favour of more attention being paid to the development of theoretical magic. Known for their multisyllabic public statements, and their intense opposition to the next group. Slogan: "The Optimal Choice For Your Vote Is The Eldritch Brotherhood Of The Eastern Star"
- *The Eldritch Brotherhood Of The Western Star*: To most people, this party and the above party are virtually indistinguishable. They are both similarly long-winded, similarly unable to shut up, and similarly interested in the advancement of theoretical magic. However, both parties absolutely /hate/ each other, and completely refuse to work together (apparently it has to do with some obscure differences in magical theory that one has to be a highly-trained mage to even /notice/). Slogan: "The Advancement Of Magic As Exemplified By The Eldritch Brotherhood Of The Western Star Will Always Be The Optimal Choice"
- *The Society For The Betterment Of The Realm*: An Elf-supremacist party. Is in favour of denying the vote to gnolls (along with goblins, dwarves, humans, and everyone else who is not an elf, but they're trying to get the ball rolling by just cutting out gnolls for the moment). Slogan: "A Long Life For Long-Term Aims"
- *Party Name Here*: A party that consists entirely of a single golem, designed by a wizard who was told to "get me control over the country". Runs every year on the understanding that, if elected, he will immediately abdicate in favour of the Black Wizard Alf the Mad. Does not care that Alf the Mad has been dead for several decades now. Never gains more than a scattering of votes, but stubbornly runs again every single year. Slogan: "Vote For Party Name Here"
