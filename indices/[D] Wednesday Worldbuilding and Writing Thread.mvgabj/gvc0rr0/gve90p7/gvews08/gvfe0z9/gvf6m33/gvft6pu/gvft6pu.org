*The Chaos Order:*

A while ago, wizards got together and decided that they really, /really/ don't like when religious folks use the power of their Gods to perform future-telling magic such as prophecy, precognition, or future divination which is unavailable to mere mortal spellcasters. They saw this as unfair, deterministic, and generally believe that knowing the future is a violation of free will. To fix this issue, the wizards discovered that sources of extremely raw chaos could butterfly future events today, but only if that chaos is introduced at a high enough level.

Because of this, the Chaos Order maintains a small but consistent voter base among wizards who ensure that one of their own sits in the council/senate/congress. This single representative abstains from all policy decisions and votes; they simply occasionally yell random words or perform random actions while politics is in session. Others find this annoying, yes, but this small introduction of a chaotic element at the highest level of power is enough to butterfly away even divine precognition for longer timespans.
