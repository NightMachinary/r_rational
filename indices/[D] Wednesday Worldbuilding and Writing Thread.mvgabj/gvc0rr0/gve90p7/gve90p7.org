I'm thinking of starting a Rational!RWBY fix, since no one seems to have done it yet (to my satisfaction at least).

Does anyone have any glaring plot holes that they want to see addressed?

I'll go first: (spoiler tagged just in case)

- In the latest season, it's revealed that Ozpin's cane holds a store of kinetic energy he's accumulated over multiple lifetimes. I don't see why he held back on using that when he fought and died to Cinder during the fall of Beacon Academy.

- Jaune should never have been permitted into Beacon.

- Adam should never have tried to blow up Mistral Academy. It's an empty building that's already owned by an ally. It doesn't help the White Fang. Even then, he never should have been foiled by sudden Faunus from Haven. It's the teleporting dragons from Game of Thrones all over again, there no way the distance should be crossed so quickly and conveniently.

- Awakening someone's aura should have some sort of drawback, or else there's literally no reason not to do it for other people. Remnant is a deathworld filled with monsters, an unlocked aura could easily save lives. Even if training is required to use it well, it still heals people automatically.

My idea is that an unlocked aura attracts Grimm to the individual. Aura is the light of the soul, and Grimm already hate humanity. An unlocked aura should thus make humans shine "brighter" to Grimm. This also means that unlocking aura for the general populace would be disastrous, as it'd massively increase Grimm attacks for relatively little gain. Thus, someone having an unlocked aura but not training to be a huntsman would be seen as a massive burden on society and widely looked down on by others.

- Characters conveniently forget when they have abilities applicable to situations. Team RWBY manages to fall into an endless void when two of them can outright fly.

- Mobilizing a giant mecha to fight individual huntsman you dislike is a terrible waste of resources and simply isn't justified imo.

- No way Penny should be so easily hacked, she is military hardware. And even once she was hacked, why not return her to Pietro to unhack her? Why gamble on using an unknown artifact to cure her?

- Adam and Ironwood in general.

And that's just what I can think of for now...
