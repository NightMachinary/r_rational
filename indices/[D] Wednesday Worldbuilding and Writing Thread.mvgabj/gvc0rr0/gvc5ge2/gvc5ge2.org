Sure... it's /easier/ to accomplish narratively if there's a charismatic leader, or critical mass group trying to convince everyone that those who oppose the status quo are natural allies. Your mileage may vary on how much you consider this a "cohesive non-evil worldview"/goal alignment.

But it could pretty realistically just be an equilibrium. In the above case or as an equilibrium, they could each have distinct, primary driving goals that nevertheless benefit from the weakening or overburdening of the society's protective institutions. If I'm just robbing a bank and you're over there eating people's faces, I'm not gonna come mess with things while the police try and stop you. Likewise, if I just want to practice mad science in peace (legitimately, mind you! For the good of human kind! THEY CAN'T COMPREHEND MY BRILLIANCE AND THAT'S THE ONLY REASON THEY WANT TO INTERFERE!) it's to my benefit that there are more attention-grabbing psychos around to keep the police from looking for something to investigate and realizing bodies are missing.

In practice, having protective institutions aligned against Evil makes it more likely that Evil will consider itself a "side", because the enemy of my enemy is my friend. In universes with superhero protectors, a Justice League or whatever, it's therefore almost a foregone conclusion that they'd consider alignment.

The institutions and rules almost force Evil to align if they can't accomplish a goal on their own. I need some muscle or protection for a job--what am I gonna do, go ask some civilian to work with me? No, I need people who I know are willing to do things that society considers "wrong". Maybe I don't like those people--maybe I think that unlike me, they ARE wrong! I mean, face eating!--but the more repressive the society, the fewer options I have.
