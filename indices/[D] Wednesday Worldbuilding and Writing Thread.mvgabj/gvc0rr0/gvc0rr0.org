How would you reconstruct [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsOneBigHappyFamily][Evil is One Big, Happy Family]]? I'll focus on the superhero genre, but feel free to reconstruct it in other fictions.

The trope where evil characters recognize themselves as being villains, and despite having a variety of ideological, personal, and cultural differences, the villains see themselves as being on the same team, as having natural kinship with other villains. This happens even when their goals don't align and they lack similarities aside from being designated evil.

If you have your villains working together for practical reasons, then this trope isn't in effect. They also can't share a worldview, unless that worldview is capital-E Evil, opposing righteousness through a variety of means.

It's easy to /de/construct since even cruel and/or self-interested people don't usually identify as evil (at least they don't wear it as a badge), and villains who are willing to see themselves as genuinely evil don't necessarily imagine themselves on the same side as other people considered evil, unless there are more concrete things tying them together.
