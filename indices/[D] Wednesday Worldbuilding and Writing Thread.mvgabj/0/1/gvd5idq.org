The Good Heroes are powerful.

No, wait, that doesn't get the full effect across.

The Good Heroes are */powerful/*.

That's better.

One-on-one, Team Good can take out pretty much /any/ other team, flat-out. Team Good could take out /all/ the Evil guys at once, as long as they work together.

However, at the same time, Team Good can only be in one place at a time.

So. In this world, there are two sorts of Evil. The first sort is the sort known as the Loners. The Loners are Evil Villains who like to go it /alone/.

They get very promptly wiped out by Team Good.

The /other/ sort of Evil are the Team Players. They work well with other Evil groups, as long as their goals do not /directly/ conflict.

The only reason that the Team Players are still around is that they all communicate with each other. And Team Good knows that if they stomp on one of the Team Players, then yes, they will win - but only after a drawn-out battle. And the /rest/ of the Team Players will descend on the Innocent Village while Team Good is out defeating that /one/ group of villains.

So the Team Players survive.

And in this way, before too long, the Team Players are the /only/ villains left. They're one big, happy family...
