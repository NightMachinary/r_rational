If "Good" is powerful enough, then there's always a sort of "kinship of the outcasts," where different groups may find common ground in the fact that they're they are all out-groups to the mainstream.

People may also declare themselves to be evil in an ironic fashion, not because they consider themselves to be fundamentally/objectively evil but because they are (1) commenting on how the mainstream considers them to be evil and (2) taking ownership of that label in order to reduce or co-opt its power. Many Satanists are an example of this: Not only do they not actually worship Satan, they tend to reject the existence of both Satan and God, but calling themselves "Satanists" puts them in a specific relationship with Christians, and they proactively use that relationship for their own ends (most often, pushing back against any Christian infringement on the establishment clause by e.g. saying, if the school has a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_News_Club][Good News Club]], then it has to allow [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/After_School_Satan][After School Satan]], too---which wouldn't be nearly as effective if the Satanists weren't so deliberately provocative).
