I'd consider the example of Big Mom's pirate crew in One Piece, in which an Emperor of the Seas holds dominion over a vast swathe of territory and control of several nations through an organization whose upper ranks are composed purely of her (100+ children).

The trope can easily be reconstructed if you consider that example, consider how her 'crew' (which was all her children) were generally Lawful Evil, desiring nothing more than the ability to rule their empire in peace (while ruthlessly crushing any resistance, such as the good guy MCs and the world government and other pirate groups) while at the same time being desperate to control and subvert the whims of their nigh-omnipotent, insane mother (Chaotic Evil).

The idea can be easily tinkered with at the margins, but the general framework of the idea fits your request. The Big Mom clan was basically one huge mafia clan that had grown to the point of controlling an actual empire, but even they had their problems with confronting forces of true evil (in the course of maintaining their own Putin-esque regime of stable, benign pleasure and profit).

The Akura clan from the Cradle series of progression fantasy books probably also fits this request, just not as obviously, due to the offscreening of how evil/abusive of the plebs most of their members are.
