Supplicant? Breaker is another one I like, she has successfully managed to break the intentions and goals of just about every being she has encountered.

Edit: Queen of Callow is also a distinct possibility, she needs to have a name to lead the woe, the story won't allow her to remain entirely mortal for long.
