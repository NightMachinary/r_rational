Oh, it would.

That said, I doubt it'd be Heiress. Both people we've heard of with that title were literal heirs, nobility. If the Name was to do strictly with the Tower, my money would be on Claimant. It kinda fits Cat, too, as she's claimed quiet a few things. Queen of Callow (to Contrition), a Dukedom in Winter, Sovereignty of Winter.

Interestingly enough, if you merge her claim of being the Duke's 'child' with Winter overall, every claim she's made, she's made multiple times. For Callow, it'd be with Contrition, at her coronation, and with the ghost of a King of Callow in Keter.

Winter, it's being the daughter of the Duke of Violent Squalls, taking the Duke's position via combat (and subsequently having her heart torn out), and ripping the framework of Masego's working to accept Winter in full.

I'd have to look around a bit, but I suspect there's a third thing that Cat has laid claim to, and thrice over at that. It'd fit really neatly into a three-of-three pattern.

Alternatively, the third thing Cat claims thrice could be the Tower itself, with each claim also being a pivot in a Pattern of Three with Malicia. I could see Malicia striking the first blow, establishing the pattern and also giving the first loss. The second would be a win for Cat, setting up the climactic final showdown to determine the winner.

Probably not going to happen, but it'd be neat.
