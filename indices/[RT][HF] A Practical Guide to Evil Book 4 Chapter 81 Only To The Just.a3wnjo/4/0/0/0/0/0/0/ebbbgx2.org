Warlord would be fitting but it has the ring of an orc Name to me. Which makes me curious, can someone acquire two names from two places? Unlikely to show up in the story but a neat thought. Say someone with a Name traveled far enough that none of their culture had weight, could they gain a Name from that new land?
