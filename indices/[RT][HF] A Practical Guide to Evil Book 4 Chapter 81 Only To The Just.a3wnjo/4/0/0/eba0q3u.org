I'd be rather disappointed. Cat succeeding against her current foes without a scrap of personal power stretches belief, especially since it opens her up to a ton of stories she has little defense against. She's made it this far playing stories, yes, but having the narrative weight of Squire or Sovereign of Moonless Nights has saved her more than once. Not to mention the personal power involved. She'd have lost at Second Liesse, lost against the crusade, lost in Keter, and lost before even entering the Everdark without the improved capabilities of Name or Title, discounting Aspects and other esoteric powers.

My money here is on Cat gaining a Name as a result of her actions, likely one that encourages climbing the Tower. It makes narrative sense that having Winter interfered with her 'destiny' as a Tower Claimant, and now that she's given up the mantle in full, we're likely to see another verse.
