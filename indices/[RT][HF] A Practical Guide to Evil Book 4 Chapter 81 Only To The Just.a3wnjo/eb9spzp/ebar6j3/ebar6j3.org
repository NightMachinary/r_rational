Seems like meaningful-sounding nonsense to me. Let me try:

#+begin_quote
  "Was compromise on another's terms even compromise at all, or just defeat by another name?"
#+end_quote

Whole point of compromise is that both parties settle on the terms /together/. Offering the entirety of negotiating power to the other party is just willingly consigning yourself to whatevers shreds of honour and decency they might have.
