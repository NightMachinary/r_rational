Oh I love that, so many 'anti-hero' or grim dark hero's hold the high road because they say they are willing to compromise, but they aren't, they are willing to win a little less, if it means allies in the future, even Cat has made this mistake again and again, with Praes and Procer.

This is Cat realising that isn't how compromise works, someone has to give, someone has to let go. Unlike so many other characters in this situation she was able to give in and prove her willingness to sacrifice, this is a huge moment of character progression for Cat and I hope it goes well, instead of turning back against her like so many other choices.
