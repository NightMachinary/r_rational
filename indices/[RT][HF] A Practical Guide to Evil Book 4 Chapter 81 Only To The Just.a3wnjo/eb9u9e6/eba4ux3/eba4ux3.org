In the short term this is going to deflect the attention of Saint and the Grey Pilgrim given that she's passed over the Winter crown. If she gets them where she wants them she can play them off against Procers heroes, and maybe even turn Pilgrim and Saint against each other when it comes to dealing with Catherine. Saints gone completely nuts and will always just want to cut her up, but depending on how Evil the role she picks up is she may be able to appeal to Pilgrim, he was thinking about cooperation before.
