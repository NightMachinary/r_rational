Many here have said that it's a bad move to turn down power, but I think it's been a running theme of the series.

  “Villains like Heiress think of power as something they can rain down on their enemies, but that's a false perception. She could set an entire field aflame and still die from an arrow in the throat. And unlike you, she will get in that situation. You make mistakes because of who you are, Catherine, not because of what your Name drives you to do. You can learn. You can adjust.”

In this story all the strongest powers have strings attached by divine design. Black's entire strategy involves avoiding the easiest paths to power to avoid the inevitable fall those bring. No over reliance on super magic swords, doomsday weapons, etc.

Instead foundations are built on mortal strengths. Fair governance, meritocratic organization, competent leadership, etc. Supernatural tools are only used when they're under control.

It's looking like her goals will eventually bring her into conflict with the bard/gods. In such a situation the narrative charged winter mantle would be an easy target for the continents foremost expert in narrative.

By shunting that power onto an ally it leaves her significantly weaker personally, but in a strategic sense she's in a better position to manipulate the narrative than she has been in a long time.
