  To everyone who missed the Chekhov's Gun at the last part of the chapter:

    “I demand no fidelity and offer no respite,” the King of Winter laughed. “I demand no faith and offer no protection. I give you slight and deceit, I receive hatred and betrayal. The Court of Winter receives you as one of its own, ‘till your last desperate breath clawing at the dark.”

    /Book 3, Chapter 15: Bestowal/

    "Night fell over me and I breathed my last desperate breath, clawing at the dark."

    /Book 4, Chapter 81, Only To The Just/

'Last desperate breath, clawing at the dark' is part of relinquishing Winter.
