  Hypocrite to end, was I? Demanding what I would not offer. Was compromise on my own terms even compromise at all, or just victory by another name? For all I'd said tonight, one thing had not changed: I had not learned to /lose/. I dragged myself up, biting my lip not to scream at the flare of pain.

Reminds me of something else I've read...

#+begin_quote
  "The /next/ time, Mr. Potter, that you choose to escalate a contest rather than lose, you may lose /all/ the stakes you place on the table. I cannot guess what they were today. I can guess that they were far, far too high for the loss of ten House points."\\
  "... And so, Mr. Potter, today you are going to learn how to lose."

Good chapter, really loving the sudden twists and turns in the narrative. I can't quite predict where it's going, but I'm enjoying the ride immensely.
