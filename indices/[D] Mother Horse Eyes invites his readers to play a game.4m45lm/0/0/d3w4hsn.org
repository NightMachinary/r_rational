I definitely detect elements of House of Leaves, as well as Cloud Atlas and Videodrome. People have been describing the Interface Series as "Philip K. Dick meets H.P. Lovecraft," and I think there's an element of truth to that, but I think Cronenberg's influence is much more present than Lovecraft's.

The cosmological horror angle also echoes Sam Hughs' latest contributions to the SCP universe.

It is definitely the most compelling work of horror fiction I can recall reading. It fills me with dread, fear, and the desire to know more.
