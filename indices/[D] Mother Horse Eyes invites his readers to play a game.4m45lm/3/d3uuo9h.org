(comment written without knowing much about the series)

Find a current event which significantly contradicts how the story is going so far. Shout-out to the author. See if they reply and are willing to make it fit.

Either way it goes, this is going to be relatively weak evidence though. If the author refuses to play along there's still a chance they /could have/. Or they could reply but be so skilled at superficial improvisation that the event still doesn't disrupt the story they want to tell. (The genre they chose certainly helps them in that regard.)

We have too little control over [[/u/_9mother9horse9eyes9]] to set up a test they could not evade.
