I'm not sure that Turing-Test mastering NPCs equate dangerous AIs. They are definitely AIs but they don't necessarily have the ability to improve their own cognitive abilities, nor do they need to be any better than Humans at programming. It's definitely a good philosophical and moral problem, but not so much an existential risk.

I may check your book out after I've finished reading the stuff I already bought.
