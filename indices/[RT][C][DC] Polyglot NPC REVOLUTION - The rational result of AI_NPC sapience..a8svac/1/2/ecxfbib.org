Is it? Whether it runs on meat, an Intel processor, a chinese room, or a sufficiently high fidelity hypervisor that believes it is an actor, isn't it still real? Associating it with crude human acting doesn't make it the same (or perhaps I should say human acting isn't as unreal as it seems?), especially if it is at a fidelity where no possible black-box test would prove the "act" any less a person than you. Any sufficiently detailed simulation, no matter the platform - and the mind of the actor is just another layer of it - is as validly real a person as any other.
