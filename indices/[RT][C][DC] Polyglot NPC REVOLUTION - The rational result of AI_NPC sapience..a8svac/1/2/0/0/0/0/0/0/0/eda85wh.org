You seem to pull on fantastical or extreme examples to get your point across. Pulling up yog sogoth doesn't count because you are separate from yog sogoth, and furthermore yog sogoth wasn't made by a game company earnestly avoiding moral issues like killing people. And you seem to still believe that because you see McPeasant (the map) that McPeasant (the territory) actually exists.

What part of my argument do you not understand? Please clarify why the AI is so superhumanly good that mere acting is not good enough and it has to simulate humans ex nihilo to be convincing.
