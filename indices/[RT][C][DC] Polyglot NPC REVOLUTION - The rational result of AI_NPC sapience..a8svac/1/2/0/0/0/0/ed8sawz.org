Okay. My position is: p-zombies are not real. Ergo, realness of a being may only be decided through external testing. Ergo, /if/ the McPeasant may not be detected as different from McPlayer, then I can only conclude that, since p-zombies are forbidden, he must be real. If that is inconsistent with "acted roles are different" then I'm going with "acted roles are not different."

To even get to that point practically requires the actor AI to be a better actor than any human, so the realness of your average Hamlet is probably not relevant. But if it was?

Keep in mind that the human mind is not monolithic; it's a big messy asynchronous neural net, the singular-ness of yourself is a convenient illusion separating my-action from other-action.

Is a schizophrenic one person, such that the deletion of one persona by, I dunno, a wandering ASI psychosurgeon, would be okay because they were just running on original_persona's meat? Their personhood to be declared null on this or that factor that stands apart. All that separates them from a most excellent actor is their natural ability to be halted and being borne of a disorder rather than the execution of a role.

If (possibly) being an act under the hood trumps the real-ness of a entities externally observable behavior, then you've opened the door to questioning the realness of anybody no matter how real they are when tested, and that's just not a model of personhood I can accept. If I'm understanding your position correctly, then we'll just have to agree to disagree.
