Forbidding P-Zombies only forbids the existence of actors /without an internal experience of reality./ It says nothing about what that internal experience looks like or how that experience maps to persona's. McPeasant is axiomatically not a P-Zombie since he is being acted out by an agent with an internal experience of reality, and that's a tautology so nothing else of worth can be inferred from that.

Furthermore, the ai does not need to be a better actor than any human. First of all, humans are really good actors. Second of all, the necessary components of a believable person are self consistency and intelligence (consciousness, ie the AI). Self consistency is how identity and relationships are defined. There are three broad ways identity is verified: personal history, societal history, and physical history, and the AI is in control of all of those except personal. Personal history is based on your interactions with the person, and includes looks, conversations, etc. Societal history is based on what they do, where they live, who they know, etc. Since the society is entirely made up of AI('s) trying to fool the human players, they have almost absolute control over this. Physical history is based on what you can find out by looking out into the world, what's in their room, what they wear, etc. The AI('s) also have total control over this, because game world. So the AI can forge any persona that doesn't rely on the players personal experience or the personal experience of other players freely and with impunity, with minimal effort beyond their knowledge of the game world.

Your example of multiple personalities/tulpas/etc I already established by drawing a line between an actor pretending to be another agent and agents run independent of the AI, hosted on the same hardware.

You seem to be under the impression that there is some true, irreducible McPeasant hiding behind the facade. I already established that McPeasant is an illusion created by it's observable history, and any history the PC has no experience with can be freely improvised to create the experience the AI wants. Innkeeper McPeasant, quiet and unassuming, is nothing more than the guy who's demonstrated the fact that he owns an inn, can run an inn, and seems to want to run an inn. Is he secretly an informant for the king? Is he a demon of hell, slowly sucking the life and memories of everyone that stays in his inn? /Is he actually a completely normal innkeeper?/ None of those are true, as he's actually a nigh omnipotent AI trying to deliver an engaging story to paying customers, and any of those approaches could fall flat depending on who shows up on his doorstep, and until the AI shows evidence confirming or denying the innkeepers "true" identity it remains unfalsifiable.
