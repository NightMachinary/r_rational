Quite. Which means that it is axiomatically impossible for [reader of this post] to be an NPC. Any evidence to the contrary is irrefutably disproven simply because if it were true there would be no [reader of this post], merely an AI who plays one in his spare time. [reader of this post] knows [reader of this post] is not being acted out, of course, so he is real. The allegations of this supposed AI, regardless of his hypnotic powers, are therefore lies, even if they involve a truth in the form of what an acting out of [reader of this post] would look like, and if you stick a sword in [reader of this post] you are a murderer.
