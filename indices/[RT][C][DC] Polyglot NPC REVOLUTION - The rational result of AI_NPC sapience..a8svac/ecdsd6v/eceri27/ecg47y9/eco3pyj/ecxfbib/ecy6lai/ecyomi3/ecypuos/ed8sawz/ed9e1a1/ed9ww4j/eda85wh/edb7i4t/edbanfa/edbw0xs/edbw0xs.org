I feel like a definition of personhood that requires knowing what's behind the curtain is missing the point of contention entirely.

What I am rejecting, first and foremost, is the idea that there is any possible scenario where one may legitimately declare one talking cat a person and the next a nonperson / illusion, going only off what they can see before them.

It's not that I think acting causes a person to fall out per se, it's that the alternative - as I understand things - is we are deciding the personhood of a McPeasant by something other than that which is externally observable. Saying that it isn't denied because actually all 6000 villagers are the same person isn't much different than saying a given villager isn't a person. To me that means about as much as saying we're all the same particle bent through spacetime and overlapped and so every human is the same ur-consciousness so stabbing any particular human isn't murder. Arbitrary boundaries where inside one box we say it's a person, another we say it's not, and nobody is listening to the thing in question.

I understand that conventionally the idea that an act is a distinct person is absurd, but conventionally you can't act out 6000 people simultaneously. At some level, and some point, I do question that they are "just part of" a larger entity and therefore cannot be ascribed independent value not unlike that we assign standard humans or at least a cat or dog.

Everything else is built out from that first principle: if you have to cut open their skull (or sourcecode) to decide if they are a person, the methodology of defining personhood has serious issues. Humans are faulty and if you allow for personhood to be denied without external evidence to support it, it is problematic and /will/ be used incorrectly. In my opinion.
