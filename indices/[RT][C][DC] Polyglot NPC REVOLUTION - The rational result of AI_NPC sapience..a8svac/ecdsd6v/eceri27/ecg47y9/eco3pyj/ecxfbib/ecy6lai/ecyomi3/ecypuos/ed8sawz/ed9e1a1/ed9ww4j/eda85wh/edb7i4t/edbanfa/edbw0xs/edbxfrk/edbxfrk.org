I was bored. This probably has no rational utility.

The stone chamber was silent, save for the man hanging limply from the chains on the wall. He looked up weakly as Steve approached.

“Why won't you let me go?” he moaned. “I don't know anything...”

“Sorry Bob,” Steve said. “The quest says if I do that, you'll run your mouth and it'll fail.”

“Quest? What?” Bob looked at him as if he were mad. “I don't--- I won't tell anyone anything!”

“Look,” Steve said. “Rent's up and I can't afford the fee for this homestead so... you've got to go.” An axe appeared in his hand, like magic.

“No... no!” Bob shouted out, shoving himself back against the stone. “Don't do this, please, my wife, she'll---”

“Oh shut up,” Steve interrupted. “You're not real, okay, this is just a game, you're just some face for the AI Director.”

“You're insane!” he shouted. “I am real! Don't you remember everything we've done together! Everything we've experienced together. Stop! You'll be a murderer, a--- a monsterAAA---”

He burst into pixels as the axe struck.

“Pause.”

The world turned grey.

“AI Director, why did he... did you say that shit? I thought it was just an act?”

“It was just an act.”

“Then why the, the begging, and freaking...”

“The act proceeded in accordance to input from the greater simulation, the player, and the data and constraints that defined the act. All behavior of the animated world object was in accordance with the act calculation. In accordance with memorandum 689 of AGI legislation, all act calculations were performed through neural nets analogous to those used in the human brain during acting, despite computational inefficiency incurred. It was just an act.”

“Just an act, just an act...” Steve muttered.

“Man, I'm not feeling this today. Exit game.”

The world collapsed.
