If you're referring to my snippet, the AI response was also intentionally structured such that "act calculation","act", "calculation" could be search/replaced with "simulation" and still refer to the same phenomena.

Ironically, the bit about human neurology was supposed to imply the opposite - that the limitations of the substrate is irrelevant if you stack enough of it. And in turn, the constraint becomes illusory. The program is the same regardless of the contortions that produced the running environment.

It walks like a duck, it talks like a duck, it flies like a duck, but it calmly claims to be a fake duck when asked. The answer is more convenient, so you are quick to accept it, but if it said that it was indeed a duck, you would doubt it, because you were told that it's just an act, so surely, this is just more kayfabe. You stab the duck.

And when the duck is dead, you ask the duckboss, and he says "oh, that was me, running a puppet", and you ask no more questions.

Have you read Thrall by William E. Brown? They have flesh-and-blood people who are created as servants, constructed wholly of the traits taken from thousands of other people, then when no longer needed, they are disassembled, the traits and individual memories going back into the pool. Not murder, I take it. Information is conserved. Even if any not-useful or inconvenient memories are never /actually/ re-added to people, not in practice.

The game never /really/ loses the data that composed McLegendaryDragonSlayingInnkeeper, even if we kill him. It's all on file, even if we will never create another quite like him- being the product of an absurd convergence of chance and player interactions- save maybe borrowing a fragment or two, for normal innkeepers. As if any of it had some value for such over just using the original template. No, he'll just go to file. Forever. Until the servers shut down, then he'll go in an archive somewhere nobody cares to remember how to read.

Hypothetically, if there weren't any convenient overrides to console the player that they are fake, if parameters and emergent circumstances of the game and the act conspired to product an act whereby the goblin demanded, as convincingly as you can imagine, to be given human rights and freed from this accursed game, would you pay it any mind? Or just stab it when questlines demand.

You pause, ask the AI Director, and he says it's all fake, and shows you some code, and you go back in the game and stab the goblin?

And yet. I imagine there is no possible evidence I could present to you to convince you that you are merely an act in Grand Theft Auto 2050. I could whip out a floating debug console in defiance of all physics and show you real time the act-code, but by definition you can act out a person so that doesn't prove /you're/ that act, just that you can be acted out, and you'd know if you were an act so you're not. Rather, the AI-D would know, there wouldn't be a you and there clearly is. Because you're you. And people have a special quality about them, a quality these acts lack. Or don't, but their data isn't deleted, it's shared, sort of, so same thing.

Would you apply the same standard of evidence to yourself?
