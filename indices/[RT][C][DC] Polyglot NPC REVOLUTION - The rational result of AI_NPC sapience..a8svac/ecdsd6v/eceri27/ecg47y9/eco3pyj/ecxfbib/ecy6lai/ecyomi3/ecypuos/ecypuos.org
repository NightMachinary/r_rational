/Humans/ already do that, and discarding persona's isn't regarded as an immoral act, merely a sign of growth. I get what you're trying to get at, but what you're thinking of assumes that McPeasant is being run on or outside of the AI, rather than in or of the AI. Here McPeasant cannot be separated from the ai, while windows can be separated from virtualbox. /The AI is McPeasant,/ but McPeasant is not the AI. You might as well ask whether Hamlet is real outside of the actors that play him. An actor playing Hamlet /is Hamlet,/ but Hamlet is not the actor.
