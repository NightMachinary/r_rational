The argument I was making was that if the act is sufficiently detailed, which I would think it must be. I'm arguing that the actor prefacing every thought with "If I was McPeasant" doesn't invalid McPeasant as a person in every way that matters any more than VirtualBox emulating each instruction invalidates a copy of Windows. In short, if your act is good enough to seem in every testable fashion a person, then it is a person, and the fine details of what is inside the black box cannot invalidate that. If it can, then we've opened the door to p-zombies.

This isn't about any sort of danger, just about a potential moral conundrum, mind you.
