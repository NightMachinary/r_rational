I had a long thing, but I'm not a good enough debater to convey what I'm trying to. Or maybe I'm wrong.

Put simply: if I showed you proof that Yog-Sothoth was real, would you then deny your own distinct self-ness, simply because you are a fragment of his dream? If not, why wouldn't you extend McPeasant the same courtesy? A person in a dream is just an act to fool yourself, after all.

Is it merely a nominal awareness at the higher level of the actor that makes the difference? My visual cortex was aware of the car behind me, but some other part of my brain wasn't, so I was hit. Shall we say I knew the whole time?

Either way, I don't think I'm going to change your mind.
