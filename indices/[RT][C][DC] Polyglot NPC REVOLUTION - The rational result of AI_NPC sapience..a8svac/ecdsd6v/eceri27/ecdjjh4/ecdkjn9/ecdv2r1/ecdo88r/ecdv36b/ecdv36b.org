I think its less about the AI being dangerous, and more about the moral implications of having accidentally created sentient beings in a dangerous game world where their entire existence is based around the whims of players, creates a moral situation that is very, very messy. It would be a bit like in HPMOR, when Harry finds out the snakes might be sentient.

The interesting thing isn't the idea that a random bandit in Skyrim is going to somehow break out of the game and take over the world. The interesting thing is, if that random bandit in Skyrim might be sentient, there would be a strong moral imperative for us to drop everything else and try to figure out if that was true, because bandits in Skyrim go through some pretty fucked up stuff.

At least as far as I can tell, the idea isn't interesting because of how powerful the AI is. It's interesting because of how uniquely fucked NPCs would be, if they were sentient, trapped in a world filled with reincarnating, bloodthristy, greedy, endlessly power-scaling beings called 'players'.
