It should also be noted that ai's don't have to be superintelligent to be dangerous. Human's are plenty dangerous with human level intellects. How hard would it be for one of their thousands of players or hundreds of employees to unbox an AI that is human level and specifically engineered to put people on quests?

Edit: How hard would it be to convince a /humanitarian watchdog/ they're people and they have rights?
