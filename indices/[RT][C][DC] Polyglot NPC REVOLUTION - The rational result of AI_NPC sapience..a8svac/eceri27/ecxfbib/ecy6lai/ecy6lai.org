The reason you use actors isn't because they are any less human, but because the ai's exist behind the scenes, having greater architectural freedom, and more importantly, the ability to know what they are doing is fiction. For example, when dms run npcs, you can do anything you want to them because you aren't actually threatening the life or safety of the actor behind them. Additionally, you don't need to spin up an entirely new sentient being for every npc you need, and you don't need to have any kind of storage for dead people.

Finally, the suffering npcs experience /isn't real,/ since everyone is playing the same low stakes game entirely aware of the fiction they're operating under.
