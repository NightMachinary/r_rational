You're implying that I'm implying that there's an npc at the bottom of this post. [Reader of that post] would be the AI, and stabbing the AI is bad because the AI is not an npc. [Inferred writer of this post] would be where indirection can occur, since the only evidence you have of the nature of that person is carefully controlled. The actual [writer of this post] would be the AI.
