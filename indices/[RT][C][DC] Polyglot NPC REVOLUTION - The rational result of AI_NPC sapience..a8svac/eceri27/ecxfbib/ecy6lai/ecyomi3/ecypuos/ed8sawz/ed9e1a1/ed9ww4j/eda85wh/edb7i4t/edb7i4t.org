Because acting is just a word. Simulation fits just as well, especially if the act is perfect. I don't understand what the difference is to you, and I wonder if it's a mental shortcut "humans act all the time, so acting cannot be real, so acting cannot be simulation". All I'm hearing - and maybe this is my error - is that you think that what's going on under the hood can make everything that meaningfully defines the NPC not a person. It is meaningless to say that it's just the ASI because if you stab the NPC dead it is solely the NPC part that goes poof. I reference Yog Sosoth because as fantastic as it is, my point was that, like.

Okay, suppose two hundred years from now, we're having a conversation, and we are both supposedly human uploads, and I trace your space IP. I decide that statistically, you're probably just an NPC no matter what you say, and you made me mad, so I fire a missile at you, reasoning that you are just an expression of a far greater ASI and since 'CreationBlues' isn't "real" I'm not killing anybody. There's holes in this analogy, backups or something, but you get the idea. Best case I start dismissing everything you say on the unfalsifiable claim that you (as in CreationBlues not a far greater actor) aren't real - unfalsifiable short of you sharing your mindstate or something - or, worst case I just killed somebody...

You're saying acting isn't simulating and I'm disagreeing; to me an act is a simulation that you then put on your face. In humans that simulation is crude, but in a VRRMORPG where the simulation must pass greater scrutiny by many players of possibly very high levels of intelligence, it isn't going to be nearly as crude. Now if you disagree with me about either acting being a simulation plus display of, or about it being a very quality act, then none of what I'm saying would apply.

(also, are you really separate from Yog? You can't just say you are by fiat, because, i dunno, consciousness or whatever "but i'd /know/ if I was an act...")
