Your claim was that you could stab [reader of that post] because they were an NPC and therefore disposable. My claim was that was nonsense because [reader of that post] was the AI and the NPC was only [inferred writer of that post], and the true [writer of that post] was the AI, a full fledged person. What is your issue with that logic?
