You still seem to be assuming that the AI is putting more effort into putting up some kind of scaffold for the NPC so that the AI isn't the thing being the NPC. You don't kill the NPC and then ask the AI, because the NPC /is the AI./ You can just safeword and ask the NPC to baldfaced spell out it's internal state. Just ask the AI to remove the mask and spell out what creative decisions are going into it's performance.
