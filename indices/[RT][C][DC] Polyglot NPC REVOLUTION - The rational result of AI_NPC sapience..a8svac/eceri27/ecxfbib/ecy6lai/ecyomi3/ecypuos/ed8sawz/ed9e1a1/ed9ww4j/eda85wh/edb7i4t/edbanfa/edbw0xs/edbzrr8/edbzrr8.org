Except that it is externally visible that someone is just an act and not a real person, you're just not looking in the right place. An admin, for example, could get an NPC to break the act trivially. True, free of any knowledge to the contrary you shouldn't discount the personhood of someone, but /it's a game./ The situations was deliberately engineered. You have access to information beyond that presented in the game.

Besides admins, what does your model say if the NPC's reaction to unboxing attempts is to go "Wait now, this is just a game, there's no white knighting needed here"?

And yeah, any given villager /isn't a person./ They're an act. Or a node in a hivemind. That's the point. That doesn't truck with "we're all the same person because mumble mumble" because information isn't conserved between people.

I'm not going to argue that there isn't a line somewhere, but the line is quite a bit farther out than you imagine. Yeah, a person can't act out 6000 people at once. That's why you're using an AI. That's a basic conceit of what we're arguing about here.

Your last point just proves me right, /because you have external evidence./ You aren't just going out and saying someone isn't a person. They've /actively/ given you evidence about the details of their existence, and /it's purposefully designed/ to avoid thorny issues of morality.
