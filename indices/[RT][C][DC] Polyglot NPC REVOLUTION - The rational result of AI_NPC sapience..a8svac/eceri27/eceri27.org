I always figured there was a pretty "simple" solution to this: you have actor ai's that pretend to be the npc's you interact with. Either one massive meta-ai that runs everyone, or a pool of ai's that run classes of ai's. Sure, you still have the problem of goal alignment in your actors, but it's a much less thorny problem than "lol we created you solely for the backdrop of our murdergame, you have no rights and will probably immediately die as soon as the person you're arguing with gets bored, have fun and don't revolt!"
