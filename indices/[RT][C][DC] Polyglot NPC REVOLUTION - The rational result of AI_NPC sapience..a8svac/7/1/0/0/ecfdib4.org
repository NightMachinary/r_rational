Hah. I'm amused. I've had the start of a LitRPG thing in the drawer for a few months now about a guy who gets cryofrozen without his consent and then uploaded into a MMORPG. One of the things it touches on is whether or not the being who is uploaded into the game is actually the person that he thinks he is.

It's nice to see that I have once again failed to have a novel idea. :>
