Yeah, I can see it.

Part of it is that for a student project, the natural story structure will be "Students has brilliant idea, student is overconfident, everything goes wrong, school gives student good grade anyway" which is pretty close to the structure of Instruments; part of it is me being lazy and just plain reusing concepts from Instruments.
