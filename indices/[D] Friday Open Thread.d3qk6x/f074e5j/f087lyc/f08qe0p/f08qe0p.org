1) I hope the only issue you have with my choice of words is semantics, Mr. /Retarded/ Wabbit.

2) Sloppy word choice is unavoidable under the influence. I was so drunk when I made that comment that I legitimately can't remember having made the comment. I type better when I'm blackout drunk than most people are capable of typing when sober. Iff ouy have esvere seen me typlig like hthis, know that I was probably /literally/ on the verge of death at the time.

3) I've been in plenty of facebook arguments with religious people about "miracles" where I've had to explain the differences between being brain dead and being in a coma, you're not telling me anything I don't already know. The sloppy word choice was due to inebriation, not lack of knowledge.
