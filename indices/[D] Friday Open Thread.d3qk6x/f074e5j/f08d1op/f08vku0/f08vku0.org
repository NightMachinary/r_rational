Most people have not. It'd be almost impossible for someone with no real experience with freefalling to aim at a slope or even a target as big as a field.

You mean literally 99.9% of the earth's surface area? And like I said, someone freefalling with no experience isn't going to have much ability to aim themselves.

In most cases, all that'll be available to break your fall is your feet.
