TIL about France's [[https://beta.gouv.fr/startups/][Startsups d'Etat]] (National Startups) program. We basically have a program for mentoring and incubating startup-like project sponsored by government administration, with a focus on using IT to give these administrations more data, minimize costs due to administrative overhead, and make life easier for everyday people interacting these administrations (and /boy/ do we need those last two in this country).

The projects are really modeled after the startup model in the private sector, with small agile teams, a focus on finding and eliminating user-facing pain points, and a willingness to experiment on novel ideas and drop failing projects.

The program has started in 2015, and currently hosts about 78 teams with various statuses in very diverse domains. Most of them have are targeted towards either companies or unemployed people looking for work, so I haven't really had the opportunity to see the results myself; though I'm really eager to see particulier.api.gouv.fr get some traction (having to give an administration a proof of some information I /know/ the government already knows is a pet peeve of mine).

I'm curious if similar initiatives exist in other countries. How far along is your administration in virtualizing paperwork? In particular, do you have from-the-source-taxing, where the state directly takes your income tax from your salary, and you basically have zero tax paperwork to fill unless you have other sources of income?
