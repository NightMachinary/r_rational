Within maybe a few years, you can expect German politicians to cautiously send explorers into this vast unknown territory, and cautiously try to make contact with the unwashed native barbarians. Seeing no value in communicating with them, our old parties (Social Democrats and Conservatives) will soon turn their back on them, leaving mainly the Pirates, the Greens, the Liberals, and the extreme right to gobble up these digital natives.

The idea that the bureaucracy could ever do actual /work/ via the internet is pretty outlandish.
