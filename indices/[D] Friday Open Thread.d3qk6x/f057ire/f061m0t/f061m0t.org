You may know from talking to MagicWeasel, but Australia does have “from-the-source-taxing” as described.

My workplace used the new Single Touch Payroll (STP) system this year to lodge relevant information electronically.

From the employee's perspective, this information becomes available through the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) section of the MyGov* portal. The ATO portal can be used to lodge tax electronically (has been available for several years now), and the process is pretty simple. It's mostly automatic unless you do have secondary income streams or other notable financial situations (inheritance, gifted money, etc)

*it basically provides links & oAuth connections to disparate government systems used by Australians (not sure about use by people without citizenship). It can also serve as a single message point to the user if any of the connected entities need to get in touch. It has had a rocky history, and has not always been a good experience to use.
