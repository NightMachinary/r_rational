If you have to fall out of a plane or a tall building, always land feet-first. You'll be a vegetable, but Hawking was a vegetable for like 60 years and he accomplished more than you'll /ever/ accomplish. Accepting your status of vegetable will pay off in the context of eternity. If you land in literally any configuration besides feet-first, you're done.

Obviously the best thing to do is to literally never step foot on an aeroplane or to enter a car. Beyond that, land feet first.
