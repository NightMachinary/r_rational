  If you land in literally any configuration besides feet-first, you're done.

Eh, that depends. Consider [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Chisov][Ivan Chisov]]. He passed out while falling from 23,000 feet and survived after landing on a snowy ravine, albeit with spinal fractures and a broken pelvis. Slopes and snow are a pretty decent choice for a landing, so it's easy to see how you might survive even if you landed ass-first.

I'll add that for relatively smooth, snowy slopes, if you've figured out how to do [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracking_(skydiving)][tracking]], you could try to glide in the direction of the slope. Considering that nearly 1:1 glide ratios are possible, and some ski slopes are [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_skiing][steeper than that]], you could conceivably achieve a soft landing on the slope and end it with a long slide down.

Overall, I think the most important question is not how you land but where you land. You need something to break your fall if you're going to survive. That could be snow, trees, brush, or buildings with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Magee][weak roof structures]]. Pretty much anything other than water or flat open ground gives you a chance, even if you're still unconscious at the time of impact.
