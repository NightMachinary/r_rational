[[/u/magicweasel]] and I did a cross-german/australian Berlin meetup. We had a most terrific time visiting the more interesting parts of german history - namely, the memorial to the murdered jews of europe and the nearby KZ Sachsenhausen.

She was great company for this, distracting me with amusing anecdotes of australian spousal law after we both got much more than we bargained for. I rate this trip 1/10 for fun, and rate magicweasel 5+/5 stars as a companion in case you'd always wanted to visit your local atrocity sites but had correctly estimated that you were too susceptible to the horrors involved.
