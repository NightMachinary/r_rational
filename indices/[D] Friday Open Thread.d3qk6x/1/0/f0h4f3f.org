After all that I have a 1/10? Least flattering typo ever!

Highly recommend [[/u/svalbardcaretaker]] for any trips to Berlin/Germany you have: though try to pick something more uplifting so his soul does not get ripped all the way in half.

It was great to have you with me, despite us interacting very little on here I felt we clicked really well and it was both heart-breaking and touching to experience the camp with you because of how affected you were by the atrocities.

I don't know how because I obviously don't believe in "souls" or "energy", but places like Sachsenhausen seem to retain this sad, powerful energy from all the suffering that went on there, and there's a lot of value in experiencing that first-hand. "Dark tourism" is becoming popular, and while there's complicated ethics around a lot of them (particularly the glorification of serial killers), places like this, that memorialise the large-scale atrocities of government in a way that puts respect towards the victims paramount, I think play an important part in the "growth of our souls".

The most depressing thing is, the nazis did such terrible things, and we say we can't let it happen again, but Pol Pot did more or less the same thing (but with very different goals) in the 1980s. It's going to happen again. Shit, no doubt, it /is/ happening in North Korea. And..... I'm reasonably powerless to stop it. That's... horrifying.
