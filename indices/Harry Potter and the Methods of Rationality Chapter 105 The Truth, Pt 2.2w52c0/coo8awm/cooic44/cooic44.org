  Have I got this sequence right? Because it seems way complicated, and like it requires far more than three things to go right. I suppose that can be answered as "well, Quirrel is just that good at playing Xanatos Speed Chess", but it still seems nuts.

Yup, it seems absolutely nuts. I am guessing/hoping that there are more details that will make this series of events make sense, but ... I don't know what my alternate hypothesis is which would explain all of Quirrell's actions. Here are two of my best guesses:

- If, as in canon, Voldemort /actually did want to teach Defense Against the Dark Arts/ then perhaps teaching there for the full year satisfies that value and is incidental to his other plans.
- If Voldemort /actually does want Harry on the throne/ then perhaps this is all a setup to staging a miraculous defeat of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named by the Boy-Who-Lived and the Philosopher's Stone is incidental to that plan - it only gives a setup for the narrative that Voldemort is trying to craft.

... but I'm not sure that squares with the psychology of Quirrell as we've been shown it, and I still think that his plan is a bit overcomplicated for all that.
