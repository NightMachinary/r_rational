Problem: Harry would have gladly gotten the stone without being blackmailed if Quirrell had stayed incognito, without so carefully asking questions, for the purpose of saving Quirrell. Edit: Additionally, if the procedure for getting the stone is identical to canon, any student could have been manipulated into doing it (and hpmor!Harry, in particular, could not have done it).

What are the implications concerning Quirell's interests and plot, and the implications concerning what one must do to get the stone, in light of this?
