Ah, I suppose I shouldn't assume that Quirrell did the Big Reveal on purpose...but still, I seem to recall Harry outright /offering/ to find the Stone and give it to Quirrell earlier in the chapter. There was no need to stage an overwrought comedy, no need to attempt to impersonate Harry's future self

No matter how brilliant an impersonation, there is a strong possibility that Harry /always/ uses an obscure recognition code when sending messages to himself. I'd normally suspend disbelief about everyone not always using recognition codes as standard practice for the sake of the story (hpmor, enders game, and other "super smart character shows their work" type fiction all in part rely on the character existing in a society which has collectively manged to miss an obvious exploit), except for that Harry /already used/ a recognition code at least once, so /Harry/ at least should have thought of it. It doesn't matter that Harry /wasn't/ using this method, Quirrell should have thought of the possibility that he was. (*Edit*: Annoyingly, I suppose he might just have fore-knowledge that it would work. Not elegant, but I guess it works.)

And that's only the most visible weirdness, there is so much else in that plot that wasn't necessary given what we know...indicating there is something we don't know. I suppose it's possible the author just didn't think of one or more of these things, but I highly doubt that given the rest of the story.

We have to come up with a hypothesis that /excludes/ him from simply saying "Harry, I'm dying and can be saved via the p-stone which is placed in the 3rd floor corridor, let's go get it". If he wanted a sense of urgency to prevent giving Harry time to think about it or tell anyone he could have simply said "I'm dying /now/, and I /just/ discovered where the stone is" and it would have been much more plausible than the ruse he actually implemented (which /also/ included that statement, just with a bunch of other silliness tacked on).

And there's an /additional/ problem - even given that he went with the crazy plot, Quirrell could have simply /not given away the puzzle about Sprout/, and then it would have been invisible Harry waiting by the door after Sprout called the Aurors and sent everyone away. Harry is no stranger to heroic last-ditch efforts and would have taken the Philosopher's stone and used in on Quirrell in a heart-beat if the note from his future self had told him to (assuming Harry /can/ get it himself).

Even if we posit that EY didn't think of the "ask politely" solution or rejected it on some other grounds, would EY have Quirrell orchestrate a plan that /would have worked/ and then leave out one crucial little step unless there was a deeper meaning? Perhaps Sprout /wasn't/, in fact, memory charmed and Quirrel just said that to prevent her meddling in an otherwise functional plot. What weird constraints are leading to this weird situation?

I think this is either an intentionally constructed puzzle, or something with a lot of hidden structure which isn't being directly shown to the reader. Unfortunately the Time Turner has an annoying habit of making things really unpredictable (for example, neither past Harry nor future Harry did the time turner prank/ the /do not mess with time/ - both were created by some meta-Harry outside of time that we have no access to.) It's quite possible that this self-consistent plot was generated by meta-Quirrell, that our current Quirrell himself has only a vague idea what is going on, and that he is going to take Harry's time turner /right now/ in order to set the self-consistent plot in motion.
