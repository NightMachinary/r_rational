Does not follow. I mean, I am sure that obliviation will not work to beat parseltounge, because going to the trouble of countering occlumency while leaving the far more common dodge open would be far too stupid for Salazar. But this doesn't imply it's a flawless oracle.

3 obvious options that would counter obliviate without making it an universal oracle:

1: If your mind or memory is tampered with, you loose all facility with parsel-tongue. Yes, especially including if you do it to yourself.

2: You can access obliviated memories via parsel and it spots implanted ones also.

3: Obliviate just does not work on a parsel-tongue.
