But Quirrel could have cast a spell on or dosed Harry with a compulsion to tell the truth, then use Parselmouth as a cover so Harry will believe everything he says. It doesn't have to be Veritaserum - legilimency or a weaker, easier to obtain/harder to detect potion would do as well. The latter could be tested by lying in English, so the former is more likely, especially as he's so good at it.
