Or maybe Obliviate is just a flaw in Parseltongue - secure methods of communication often have those, especially if they're designed by a single person without a lot of modern security-minded training.

It's also possible that Parseltongue predates Obliviate and the False Memory Charm, and so was constructed without those in mind.
