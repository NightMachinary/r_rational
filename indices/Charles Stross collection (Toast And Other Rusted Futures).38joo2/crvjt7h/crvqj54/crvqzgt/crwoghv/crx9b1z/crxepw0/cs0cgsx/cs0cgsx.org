That's reasonable, it's also not as if your writing queue isn't already quite long without adding it in.

I've actually been wondering how you'd fit a full version of /Palimpsest/ in a even a single book. The model of time travel seems to give you an immense space to play in, and there are surely at least a thousand interesting stories exploring any number of themes in even just the chunk of that ... time fractal^{?} ... where the Stasis wasn't in control.

The process by which you pick and choose the threads you want to focus on is something I'd love a chance to peek into after you're done. (even after you filter out the threads which don't depend strongly on the unique properties of the setting, there are a lot of choices)

Somewhat tangentially, it tends to get my hackles up when people compare /Accelerando/ unfavorably with your other work. It's a bit surreal making the same argument to you, but despite its technical flaws it's a wonderful piece of work, mostly because of its scale.

Sure, you're gotten a lot better at both the technical aspects of writing, and in how you present the various big ideas that are part of your work, but /Accelerando/ did a wonderful job of presenting a huge stack of those big ideas. The fact that you threaded a few characters and one broad narrative through a huge time scale made it much easier to relate to the vastly different worlds you portrayed.

Admittedly, I'm a mite bit biased. I read /Accelerando/ as a kid and it's had a huge influence on who I am. The grooves it etched have been worn into canyons by other works and experiences, but you can still see the eddies and meanders it caused. Hell, when people ask me about my goals in life I still end up talking about Manfred Manx, so feel free to take what I say with a bit of salt.
