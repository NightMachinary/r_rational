/Wireless/ is great; I have both a paper copy and the ebook version, and consider both to have been well worth the money. I'm still idly wishing for a novel-length treatment of /Palimpsest/ (but I'm also eagerly anticipating /The Annihilation Score/, /Dark State/, and everything else, like some greedy dragon who collects Stross novels instead of gold coins).
