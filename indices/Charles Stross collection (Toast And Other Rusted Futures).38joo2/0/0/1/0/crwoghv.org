/Palimpsest/ is going to be a novel ... eventually. (I've got a lot of notes on the second third of it, not so much on the final third. It's way down the to-do stack.)

Next up after /Annihilation Score/ and the Empire Games trilogy (of which /Dark State/ is the first volume) is /Nightmare Stacks/ (about 75% written in first draft), aka Laundry Files book 7. Then there's /probably/ going to be a one-off gothic horror/fantasy SF thing, then Laundry Files book 8. By which time it will be 2018 and all plans will have changed again ...
