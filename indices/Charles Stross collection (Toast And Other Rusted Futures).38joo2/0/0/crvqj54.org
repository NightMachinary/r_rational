/Toast/ was an early collection; there's a rather better-curated one from 2008, /Wireless/, which I view as a replacement. (For a bonus, it also contains the novellas /Missile Gap/ -- which won a Locus award -- and /Palimpsest/ -- which won a Hugo.)

I'm vaguely fumbling my way towards a Laundry Files short story collection some time in the next 2-4 years, but really, the rise of ebook distribution of short stories is probably killing the short story collection as a distinct category. (They never sell as well as novels, which makes publishers reluctant to touch them, and now that short stories can stay in print indefinitely as ebooks in the $0.49-1.99 price range there's much less point in compiling them.)
