I sort of feel silly recommending things by Stross, because ... I mean, if you're in [[/r/rational]], surely you've already read /Palimpsest/ and /Accelerando/, right? Or you at least have heard enough about them to know that they're not going to be a thing you would enjoy? If you're the sort of person who enjoys singularity fiction, then you almost have to have read /Rainbows End/ by Vernor Vinge. I wouldn't go into [[/r/steampunklit]] and say, "Hey, you guys should check out /The Difference Engine/," for the same reason; if you're there, you should already know it.

But at the same time, I know that there are people who /don't/ know the classics, except by osmosis, and I know that threads like this are good for discussion.
