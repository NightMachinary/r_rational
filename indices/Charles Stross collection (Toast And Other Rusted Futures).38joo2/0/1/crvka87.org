I always feel like I'm talking about people behind their back when I talk about them using their real names, instead of using [[/u/cstross]] or [[/u/alexanderwales]]. I certainly enjoy knowing when people are talking about the things I've created, even if I don't want to participate in the discussion. It's a courtesy, at least on reddit. Although I imagine if you were interested in that kind of thing, you could tune google alerts to do a lot better of a job.

Anyway, it's a very nice change of pace from the recent influx of pop-culture and anime related topics. Some nice old hard-scifi.

As someone who didn't really grow up in that much of a sci-fi household, more along these lines is always appreciated.
