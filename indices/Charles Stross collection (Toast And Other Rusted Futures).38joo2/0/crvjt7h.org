I've long been a fan of Charles Stross; I believe of what's collected in Toast, "A Colder War" is my favorite, in part because of my love for the Cold War era (and the analysis that Stross puts towards it). For the same reason I'm a fan of "Missile Gap" (not in this collection), which features Cold War era Earth flattened out and put on [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alderson_disk][an Alderson disk]], which has some immediate consequences for civilizations that have intercontinental ballistic missiles as part of their balance of power.
