*1 Week Delay*

I think I can say with some certainty now that I work better with a concrete target date as my goal... even if I don't actually meet it. My writing went a lot better than it did previously - the chapter that had been giving me a great deal of headaches is half-way done and I have a solid plan so there should hopefully be less rewrites and discarded sections.

My dear readers are doubtlessly less pleased than me with this result, since they still don't get any new chapters and I've delayed things yet again... but what can I say? I'm glad I have such a patient audience, willing to wait literal months for me to finally wrap up the story.

The new target date is *February 2nd*, one week from now.
