You know, I saw this sentence and I thought "that had /better/ mean that it was an illusion and the AI didn't /actually/ give up just because a couple of people got BORED..."

I googled the thread and [[https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/5vi7hs/fiction_the_metamorphosis_of_prime_intellect/de30fw5/?st=jpxkqbfl&sh=d4517dcc][indeed WoG confirms]].
