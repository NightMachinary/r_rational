Uhh, no. Please try to read the post above and actually check Erix Drexler's blog or writings if you want more detail.

I was posting on the toilet but what I was trying to say was that realistic nanorobotic systems are /not/ nanobots. There is no such thing. These are macroscale machines - on the order of kilograms of matter or larger - that have nanoscale robotic /subsystems./ And these subsystems are not free to move, they are installed inside the machine in permanent locations.

The reason for this is the surface area to volume ratio scales down to the nanoscale such that "nanorobots" basically are not capable of doing any independent action. They would run out of energy in an eyeblink and the way they are built (from stable and reliable components like diamond) requires far too much energy for them to ever harvest from the environment before they wear out. They only can function as part of larger host machines.

See this video for a rendering of the idea: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY5192g1gQg]]

So the science fiction concepts are wrong. As for tearing down planets - the reason you can do this...I will leave to your imagination. But the basic ideas is once humanity can build these kinds of nanorobotic assemblers, once you build the first one you can copy it as many times as you wish. And essentially you can have an entire industrial base contained in a small space, and you then double that industrial base geometrically. So your appetite for raw materials also scales exponentially, and the mining equipment to systematically tear down solid planetoids (the Moon) can be made by the same industrial base. (and the energy gathering equipment, and any computers to run the automated equipment, and you can manufacture spare parts, and once you have general AI you can make workers using the same stuff, and so on and so forth)

It's a virtuous cycle and the obvious endgame for our solar system.
