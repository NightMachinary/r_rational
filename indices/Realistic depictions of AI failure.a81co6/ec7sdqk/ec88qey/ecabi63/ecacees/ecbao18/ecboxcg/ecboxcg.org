Living cells don't chew up the entire planet. There are cells that live deep in the crust, and possibly mantle, but such a lifestyle imposes severe limitations. Their chemosynthetic food source is so unproductive that they are indistinguishable from dormancy when functioning normally, they go millennia between mitotic divisions and may have lifespans in the hundreds of thousands of years, maybe even millions.

Nanobot doomsday scenarios expect access to an arbitrarily large amount of energy, and for the world they chew through to be made of suitable substances. In reality, were an uncontrolled grey goo scenario possible, they would quickly reach a limiting factor on their growth, and it would /not/ be "there's no planet left to eat".

It wouldn't surprise me if they entered into competition with biological microbes and lost.
