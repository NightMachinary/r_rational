Ah, that makes sense. You still have to deal with the teleporter paradox (especially if you make multiple copies of the same mind running in parallel), but that is never really addressed in Friendship is Optimal either. However I'd still be cautious about making any absolute statements. Sometimes it looks like we understand a lot about how something works and only need to iron out the details, except to then find out those details weren't details at all (DNA as mentioned above is one example, nuclear fusion is another, where the running joke is that it's been '50 years from now' for 50 years).

  I mean, for one thing, one a person exists soley in a digital machine, they can be regularly backed up. So no more fidelity loss until the end of the universe.

That seems a bit optimistic about digital storage, no copy is ever 100% perfect, but it'd still be lots better than biological matter.
