  (e.g. about brain uploading being possible, the physical limits of hardware, etc.). We won't know what's realistic until we see the reality of it
#+end_quote

The brain's a loosely distributed network of separate cells. It communicates primarily among the network by either physical signaling molecules that the brain has sensors for or timed electrical impulses.

Because it is a loosely distributed network, parts of the brain are able to reliably share information to other parts. This means uploading /is/ possible. That is, no coherent model of reality* "the laws of physics are the same everywhere" exists that means you could not build artificial devices that are compatible with neurons and replace a small section of the brain. Emit queries to the network to let you obtain the weights of the neurons adjacent to the artificial ones and then replace the adjacent ones. Gradually replace the brain ship of Thebes style.

Now if you meant to say "about brain uploading being /feasible for human beings and human civilization/", yeah, sure. Devices you can digitally connect to yet are inter compatible with human neurons and can be manufactured trivially by the trillions just to help a single ordinary person are clearly not feasible today, and will not be feasible in the foreseeable future.

​

As for the physical limits of hardware : well, we already know the brain is, well, alive, so it isn't as dense as it could be. There's obviously plenty of matter available just on earth to build enough brain emulating computers to emulate every human being, even if those computers had to be the same size as the brain they are emulating. Note that "emulation" done with /different/ processors than the original architecture in computer science does require a bigger and more capable chip, but when we talk about brain "emulation" it's assumed you actually build a digital system that exactly 1:1 implements the same logic that the brain does.

​

And there's very strong evidence that you can do hugely better than this, you don't need to wait for it to happen to reach this conclusion.
