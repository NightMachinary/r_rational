My understanding is that in this scenario we all end up (somehow) as steel paperclips anyway. I'm not convinced that brute-force mind control is easier to implement under any budget, not least of which as a spontaneous invention of an AI that is optimised to produce paperclips instead.

I get the game is just a bit of fun, but I'm here on a /rationalism/ page being told that this is a realistic scenario for improperly implemented AI. It's a computer running a factory, not a god.
