Yeah, I played it. It never accounted for why the company let it do any of that shit without oversight when you wouldn't let a human employee work without some kind of supervision or accountability, nor why you'd even give a machine with such a narrow purview the ability to do most of that stuff, nor why they let it produce more paperclips than they could possibly sell to anyone, costing them money on the loss of value due to supply/demand and the price of storage, goes up also due to supply/demand, especially when the storage facilities start being converted into paperclips.

It seems to me that something like this doesn't happen by accident. You can't fail your way up to such a complex system with specific programming to do things you don't need and specific hardware to do things that are wildly inappropriate. Someone has to deliberately make that happen from the start and go out of their way to clear out all the obstacles, and to troubleshoot all the bugs that would inevitably break any such machine. Because, come on now, we can't write basic software without bugs that make the whole thing break down and stop working, and we're supposed to fear that we could make an AI god where the /godlike state/ is the bug, and not /crashes on the 2^{16} paperclip/ which seems more likely.
