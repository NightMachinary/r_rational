  It never accounted for why the company let it do any of that shit without oversight when you wouldn't let a human employee work without some kind of supervision or accountability,
#+end_quote

That's the "Trust score" mechanic.

#+begin_quote
  nor why you'd even give a machine with such a narrow purview the ability to do most of that stuff
#+end_quote

Again, "trust score" and the fact that this machine says it can improve your company's finances if it's allowed limited access to money.

#+begin_quote
  nor why they let it produce more paperclips than they could possibly sell to anyone
#+end_quote

Were you not paying attention to the markets and monetization interfaces? People were buying paperclips up until the point where the mind-control drones took off.

#+begin_quote
  especially when the storage facilities start being converted into paperclips.
#+end_quote

If this was before the mind-control drones, it's called "resource reallocation" and it's why GM shuts down car factories in Michigan for a while before reopening them in Mexico.

  crashes on the 2^{16} paperclip which seems more likely.
#+end_quote

2^{16} = 65536 paperclips, which is about 650 retail-unit boxes' worth. If your paperclip factory can't produce more than 650 boxes of produce, then your paperclip factory is not fit for purpose and /will be re-engineered by humans until it is fit/.

IPV6 encodes 2^{128} addresses, 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 many. Roughly 10^{32.} There are [[https://www.universetoday.com/36302/atoms-in-the-universe/][estimated to be]] 10^{78} to 10^{82} atoms in the known universe. Now, a paperclip doesn't contain 10^{50} atoms, but if you're a recursively self-improving AI, I think you can use [[https://math.arizona.edu/%7Eura-reports/021/Singleton.Travis/resources/bignums.htm][established programming practices for manipulating large numbers]] like are used in modern-day encryption.
