That's not rational. A rational individual will update all their beliefs regularly with new information.

As for folly and the extinction of humanity, well sure. But I feel you are applying some serious cognitive bias. The reason humans are fallible is because we are a series of randomly chosen hacks that worked just well enough to reproduce, and the primary evolutionary environment was a series of small groups of tribes where we had only primitive tools.

There's nothing "evil" about this, and you cannot expect such creatures to do any better than we have done. Probably in most possible futures you would expect worse. The universe is dark and quiet for a reason, the majority hypothesis seems to be that humanity getting to this stage was incredible luck.
