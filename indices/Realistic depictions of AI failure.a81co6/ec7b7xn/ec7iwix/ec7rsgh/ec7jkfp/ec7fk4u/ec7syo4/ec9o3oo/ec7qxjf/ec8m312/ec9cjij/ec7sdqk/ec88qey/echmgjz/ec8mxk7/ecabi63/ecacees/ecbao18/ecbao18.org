Umm it's a mix. If you read or skim the source materials on nanorobotic equipment it's more like a robotic chemical plant that is both more complex than all the chemical plants humans have built so far but also could fit in a toaster. Such a factory would be able to make a number of related products which would include nanoscale robotic systems that the chemical plant is itself made of.

So give it a vacuum chamber, a cooling system, a high current low voltage DC power supply, a source of purified gasses carrying each element the plant uses, and a series of instructions from a computer system, and the plant could manufacturer a daughter plant in the same chamber identical or similar to itself.

This technology would in fact let you tear apart entire planets for matter and turn a solar system into main clouds of robotic hardware, just it can't quite work like it does in science fiction.

Note that living cells existence proof that essentially this idea is possible.
