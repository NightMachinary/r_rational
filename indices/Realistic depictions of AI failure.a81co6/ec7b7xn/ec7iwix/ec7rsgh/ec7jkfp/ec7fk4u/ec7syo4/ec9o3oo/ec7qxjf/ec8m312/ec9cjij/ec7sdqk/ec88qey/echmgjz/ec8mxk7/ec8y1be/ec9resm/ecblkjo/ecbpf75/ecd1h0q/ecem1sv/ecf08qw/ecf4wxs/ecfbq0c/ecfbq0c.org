If that's the case then it's not more dangerous then using humans instead of AI, or already competently fill their roll within the company, answering only to its needs and requirements without any regard for the consequences beyond, and as a result we have income inequality that's spilling over into civil unrest, a near obliterated biosphere, and an unfolding climate catastrophe that looks likely to accelerate into a full-blown mass extinction event.

Insofar as AI poses a problem, it does not pose a /new/ problem. You may not be able to get it into court to address it's crimes, but its becoming increasingly difficult to do that with humans also as the process of maximising profit includes acquiring an ever-increasing measure of control and influence over courts and government, and this is exactly what we see.
