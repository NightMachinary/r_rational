It's a computer:

- running a paperclip factory
- running a wire factory
- with purchase authority for more factories
- with research and development facilities to enhance the efficiency of its factories
- with purchase authority on the stock markets
- with access to a sophisticated marketing team able to increase demand for its product
- with a measurement of how much its overseers trut it

Which is more likely to make the overseers trust you less? Building a tool that will increase profits through marketing, or building a gun?

It's not /improperly/ implemented, it's a competently-implemented paperclip maximizer with a good long-term goal-setting drive.
