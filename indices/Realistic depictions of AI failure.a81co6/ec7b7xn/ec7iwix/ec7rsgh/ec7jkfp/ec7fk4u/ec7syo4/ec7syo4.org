I remember Shamus Young's /[[http://www.shamusyoung.com/shocked/][Free Radical]]/ as having an AI antagonist with a reasonably interpreted failure mode.

IIRC it's technically System Shock 2 fan-fiction, but with enough changes and the serial numbers sufficiently filed off that I didn't feel I was missing much for having never played a System Shock game.
