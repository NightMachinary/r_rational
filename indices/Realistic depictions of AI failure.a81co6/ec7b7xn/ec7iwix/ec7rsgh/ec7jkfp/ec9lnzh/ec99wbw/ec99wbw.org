I'm not necessarily looking for diamond hard sci-if, just more thought through than “robot discovers it has feelings” type genetic stuff. Asimov spends almost all of his stories showing how his own law of robotics fail in interesting and unintuitive ways Because they're not like humans, that's what I liked about them.

I'll check those out, thanks!
