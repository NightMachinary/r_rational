  I'm pretty sure that anything in Asimov's ouvre is not a realistic depiction of AI failure.

I think a lot of his ideas are pretty interesting instead. For example a lot of the Susan Calvin or Donovan & Powell stories are built around weird failures caused by an AI taking some orders too literally or thinking in ways orthogonal to the way humans would. It's not all fully realistic, maybe, but what could be? I wouldn't say Friendship is Optimal is especially more realistic either, you have to assume a lot (e.g. about brain uploading being possible, the physical limits of hardware, etc.). We won't know what's realistic until we see the reality of it, and at that point we'll either find our previous ideas laughable or be amazed at how this or that author managed to be incredibly prescient.
