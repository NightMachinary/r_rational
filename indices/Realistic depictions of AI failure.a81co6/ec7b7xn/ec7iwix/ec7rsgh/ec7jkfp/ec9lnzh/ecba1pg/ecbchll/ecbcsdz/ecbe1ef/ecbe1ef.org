Ok, first, the uploading model you describe doesn't seem to be the one featured in FiO. But besides that, what I meant is it depends on /where/ exactly the information is stored.

Let us face it: biological systems are messy, and we don't really know fully how they work. They are hacked together solutions built on top of other solutions without rhyme or reason. We thought we'd figured DNA out, a neat string of bases encoding information, then turns out methylation actually changes the game. DNA itself isn't even close to an ordered string of bytes the likes of which we'd use either. So to expect human neurons to be as predictable and well-behaved as the ones we put in ANNs is... naive, imho.

The question is, where is all the necessary information encoded? What level of fidelity do we need to reproduce it fully, and what can be discarded? The only 100% sure way to upload a functional human brain would be completely cloning its quantum wavefunction - and we know that's impossible without destroying it, but okay, we're considering destructive techniques so it's /theoretically/ feasible. But the simulation cost for that would be forbidding, so it's more likely we'd need some kind of simplified, reductionist model that throws away unnecessary information. Replacing each biological neuron with an artificial one would be ideal, but then comes the issue of how much do we need to know about the biological one in order to copy it precisely. Characterising it by for example prodding it (extract it, then send various potentials in and out and get the response) might as well /modify its state/, which in itself will produce an altered brain, not a perfect copy. Merely trying to study its structure and extract its properties from that is more or less feasible depending on the required detail. Is it okay to just have a vague idea of the folding structure of certain proteins, or do you need more detail than that? I don't think it's completely impossible that we might find ourselves in a situation where every possible analysis technique that's detailed enough would /also/ break, damage, or otherwise alter the neuron, thus denying us the possibility to copy it with 100% fidelity no matter what.
