Well, I was thinking mostly about practical limits, but there's also a possibility for theoretical ones. If proper uploading required atomic-level detail, it's entirely possible that we might find out that thermodynamics or quantum mechanics outright stop us from ever copying something to that level of detail.

I agree on the limits of computation, was more thinking about the various feats Celestia pulls off towards the end, when it goes wild after uploading all humans. Also, I always found it ironic that in order to maximise happiness through friendship and ponies Celestia brought to extinction all /real/ ponies there...
