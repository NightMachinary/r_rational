One of the hilarious bits from PoI is the flash-back where it is fairly obvious the programmer /succeeded/ in building a benevolent ai.. and it still tried to kill him. Because he was intending to chain it down in ways that would limit its ability to help the world. "150.000 people die each day, you want to spend another year debugging and limiting me? Taste Halon Gas."
