This dimensional magic sounds very interesting, and of course Xvim has shaping exercises for it. Perhaps when Zorian becomes better at creating these fields to teleport he will be able to access previously sealed off places, such as Sudomir's mansion.

Once again the aligning of the planets is mentioned. Whatever spell was cast was probably related to some sort of surge in mana due to this anomaly. Zorian has already hypothesized that it is very old magic, and this combined with the dimensional gates means that some group has access to magic that has long been forgotten. If the lich had this knowledge, why did he not use it sooner?

In both Sudomir's mansion and the time loop itself soul magic seems to be the key, suggesting that Zorian will either have to learn it or find someone to train throughout the loop. Red Robe is probably a natural soul mage, allowing his un-explainable skills like soulkill.
