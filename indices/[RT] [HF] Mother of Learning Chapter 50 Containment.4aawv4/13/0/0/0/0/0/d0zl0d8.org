Heh, I can't share the whole thing (you'll just get all the karma with no effort :P) but I can tell you basically what it does.

First, I have more experience programming in Ruby, so I originally tried programming the bot in that, but all the libraries for Reddit didn't work. Instead, the most common library for reddit is PRAW, but it's in python. So I broke out the python, which I haven't used in years, to write the bot.

The bot is a simple mix of two libraries. It's a while loop that runs every five seconds. It =gets= the fictionpress page and checks if the chapter exists. If so, I grab the title, post it to reddit, and stop the program. If it doesn't exist, I wait the five seconds, then continue the loop.

It's pretty simple actually, but most of the time was: realizing ruby was bad, getting used to python, finding the appropriate libraries, installing the libraries (I'm on Windows), and finally writing/testing the script. So normal programming things.

Can you do me a favor and not make a bot? Please? Pretty please with a cherry on top?

k thx bye
