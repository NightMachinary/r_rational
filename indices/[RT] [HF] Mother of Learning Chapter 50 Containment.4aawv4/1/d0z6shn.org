Jaglenac and Rutvica come from the Bratac Jaglenac i sestra Rutvica (Brother Jaglenac and sister Rutvica). A children story in croatian language.

Here's rough summary, but my croatian is far from perfect, so I might've made some mistakes:

When the local countess was running away from the enemies, they stopped at the old farm woman and gave here for the savekeeping golden belt and golden cross. She kept them save and eventually died and passed them to her children - Jaglenac got the cross and Rutvica got the belt.

After the funeral giant eagle (khm, Tolkien, khm) swooped down and grabbed Rutvica by the belt and took her to the very castle from which the countess fled years ago. There she saw 7 fairies (protectors if I understand correctly) talking to a dragon. They wanted to convince the eagle to give Rutvica to them, but he liked her and decided to carry her to his nest for a playmate of his baby eagles.

When he was carrying her they flew by an island in the middle of a lake, and upon that island there was a church and near the church a meadow to which the eagle, the dragon or the fairies couldn't come. However when Rutvica saw the church, she grabbed srda≈°ce (no idea, google gives me some flower, but I'm clueless) and her belt somehow got unfastened. She fell in the lake and the belt fell after her. And she took the belt and swam on the island and the eagle was furious for he couldn't go to the island. But even if she was saved, she was sad, for the lake was too big to swim and no one could get to her either.

Jaglenac in the meantime was after the funeral very thirsty, but no one understood him (he was very little still), so he found a bucket of water, drunk, and seeing no one understood him he left after Rutvica.

((Ugh, that's the first 4 chapter, I've something I've to do now, will do the rest later I guess.))
