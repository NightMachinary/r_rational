Huh, very interesting, nice catch! Apparently the author is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivana_Brli%C4%87-Ma%C5%BEurani%C4%87][Ivana Brlić-Mažuranić]], Nobel prize nominee x4. An English translation does exist, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatian_Tales_of_Long_Ago]]

I guess it should be possible to /ahem/ find it online.

Oh, that's easy. It means heart. (Bleeding/broken heart is the name of the flower in many languages).

Little Brother Primrose and Sister Lavender... It's a flowery tale. Huh.

add: good news: it's public domain. [[http://publicdomainreview.org/collections/croatian-tales-of-long-ago-1922/]]

add II: apparently, Kosjenka is a tiny fairy named Curlylocks form the fairy tale Regoč (Reygoch) from the very same book. I guess we need to read the whole book, just to be sure we don't miss a time travel related tale.
