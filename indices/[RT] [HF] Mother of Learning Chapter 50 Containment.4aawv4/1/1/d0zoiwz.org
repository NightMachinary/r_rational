Finally got the time to continue. Sorry for some coherence breaks, first time I'm reading this, and as I mentioned before, Croatian ain't my forte.

Jaglenac got to the mount on which the castle (in which the countess used to live) lived and because no one told him, he shouldn't, he started to go up the mountain. There he came upon the before mentioned fairies (as it turns out I was wrong earlier, those fairies are maleficient spirits), they were happy to see an innocent and helpless babe and start to dance around him, but when they tried to touch him, they couldn't because he was wearing a cross. But he was fascinated by their wings, so they lured him in a pitfall trap. He fell in, and the fairies were happy that he died. But he was light and as the leaves fell with him they both landed on spikes and the leaves protected him. So fairies came closer and saw that he's sleeping, and they were troubled. One of them figured out that they could make a storm and the leaves would get wet and slide down the spikes, and they were happy again and tried to make the storm.

In the meantime Rutvica was sad and lonely. She missed her brother. A storm started brewing around her, but sun shone upon her, for the fairies couldn't touch the island she was on. But she felt bad for anyone who could be caught in the storm, so she prayed for them and she started ringing the bell that was in the church for them. And look, the fairies were afraid for hearing the bell that was silent for a hundred years and they scattered. And the storm stopped. But it was too late for Jaglenac. The rain that fell formed a fast river and it was racing down the mountain towards the hole he was in. And it covered the hole - the spikes, the leaves, Jaglenac. And nothing but water was seen. Yet the water when entered the hole spun and it lifted still sleeping Jaglenac and it carried him down. And on the way down he impacted upon a bush, and light as he was, the bush stopped him and he woke up. And he climbed up the bush and sat on it like a bird and above him the sun shone and below him the water raced and he sat in the middle like a bird. And he wondered who woke him up so suddenly, but he didn't see anyone. And when the waters passed and the sun shone he went up the mountain again.

But when the bell stopped ringing the fairies came out of hiding and they saw the sun and they were fearful for nothing are they more afraid of than the sun. And they saw that Jaglenac escaped and they wanted to get to him, but they did not know how. And they went to the mother bear and asked her to kill him, but she didn't want to leave baby bear alone. And the fairy tells her that she'll take care of him, and the mother bear goes to kill Jaglenac and she raises both of her front legs to strike him when he comes. But he knows not that the bear is trying to kill him, and thinks she's trying to hug him, so he also raises his hands to hug the bear. And in that moment the baby bear weeps, for he was stung by a black wasp that gather around the fairies. And mother bear is furious and goes to protect him, and she fights the fairy and they forget about Jaglenac, and he laughs and walks on.

And the fairies gather around again and decide to poison him. And they lure him to poisonous berries, but there are two berries, black and red and Jaglenac reaches the black berries and eats them, but fairies don't know that. But when he wants to go on, he's tired and sick and can't get up. At that time a fairy that was gathering the red berries reaches him, and offers them to him. And he eats, and get better, for the red poison killed the black poison.

And the fairies are worried as Jaglenac is nearing the lake. And one of them goes and tells the singing bird to sing, to slow down Jaglenac, and she goes for the dragon. And the bird slows down Jaglenac and dragon arrives. And dragon takes a deep breath, and fairy tells him to burn Jaglenac, but the dragon tells her that he must take some more breaths. And he takes another deep breath, and suddenly a wind blows and blows Jaglenac over the lake. And fairy is weeping and dragon is raging, but they can't touch Jaglenac.

And on the island he meets his sister. And they start to live together there.

But after some time, Rutvica starts to worry how they'll survive in the winter, when there'll be no berries. And on one such day, she nears the lake and sees across the lake the youngest fairy, and she's fair to look upon. And fairy sees Rutvica and sees her golden belt, and she wants it. And she asks Rutvica to give her the belt, but she doesn't want to, for the belt was given to her by her mother, but fairy tells her that it was duchess' belt, and that she'll get her and her brother down the mountain safely if she gives her the belt, but Rutvica still doesn't want to. And she kept asking for seven days, but Rutvica never agreed. And fairy sat down and cried, for she wanted the belt that badly.

And the duchess and her son lived peacefully bot poorly, and they both lived, and the duchess was growing old. And the son was one day lured by the promise of silver, and he wanted to kill a man, and duchess didn't want to lose him, so she told him the truth, that he was the duke, and she told him the whole story. And he asked where she left the golden cross and belt, for he wanted them, and she told him. And he left to get it, and he was wielding a sword.

And he got to the mountain, and the villagers told him what happened, and that fairies took children who have the belt and cross. And he's sad and furious and he goes up the mountain. He comes upon the dragon and he kills him. And he goes on and comes to the crying fairy. And fairy tells him, she's crying for the belt. And the duke asks her where is the lake with children, and he tels her he's the duke. And fairy is thinkin, she'll get him to get the belt and then she'll doom him and get the belt, so she takes him to the lake.

But when he comes to the lake, he hides for a while, and fairy once again asks for the belt, and Rutvica is sad, for they're getting hungry, but she still refuses. And the duke is moved, and threatens the fairy and decides to get the children down the mountain.

And when they get down, he remembers what he came for and asks children for the belt and cross to get them to his mother, but when they hear that they tell: "We don't have a mother, bring your mother and she'll be our mother too." and he's moved and he goes to get his mother.

And he came back with his mother and they lived together. And duke married Rutvica and went and conquered the castle and became a proper duke again. And they all lived happily ever after.
