  This was the perfect opportunity to give us a clue in the form of Tinami spilling some juicy rumor about House Boranova. Something along the lines "Oh, you think Noveda have it bad? Wait until you hear about our former classmate Boranova..." Instead nothing happens.\\

  He is the biggest gun on the wall BY FAR (counterpoint to 5)

Both of these arguments depend on narrative reasoning and the strength of said evidence is strongly dependent on the author's decisions. This is a rational story, and while in other genres I think you would have a good chance of being correct merely by recognising such patterns and completing the cliche, under the circumstances it provides only very weak evidence. Damien may exist only to flesh out Zorian's characterisation and provide his principle motivation for growing stronger; if Damien never plays a role in the story I would not be surprised. If Tinami had mentioned House Boranova then that would be reasonably strong evidence in support of the Veyers Boranova hypothesis (though relying somewhat on the Law of Conservation of Detail); Tinami's failure to do this is extremely weak evidence unless you have strong evidence that the author would follow such rigid narrative patterns.

  He starts the loop outside of Cyoria (to 3) on another continent even, which could even explain why marker detection doesn't work: he is simply out of range (although, most likely he has a different maker).

I believe it was made quite clear that Zach and Zorian ended up only with the same marker due to Lich schenanigans. It is entirely expected that the spell shows only two markers and this is no evidence at all.

  He is known exploring awesome magical ruins of awesomeness, is there a better place to find some forbidden time travel magic and start the whole thing? (to 1)
#+end_quote

This is a reasonable point. Damien is sufficiently famous that he may well be the highest profile and most successful magical archaeologist in the the country (or nearly so). Furthermore, Damien is said to have recently discovered something particularly remarkable. If the time travel device were discovered in magical ruins then the chances of Damien being the discoverer are pretty good.

  He is known to be extremely talented, suspicious by itself.
#+end_quote

Very weak evidence. Most Red-Robes are prodigies but few prodigies are Red-Robes. How many prodigies or otherwise extremely competent mages are there in or near Edelmar? I would not be surprised if Damien has at some point in the past spent some time in a Black Room, but that doesn't appear to have any immediate bearing on whether he is Red Robe.

  Then there is the the fact that RR is the only person known to perform not one but two magical equivalents of square circles, time travel and soulkill.

I don't see how this is evidence specifically for Damien, but it's still good to discuss. It's clear that the time loop required some particularly extraordinary feats of magic: isolating from the divine planes not just a small room but a large chuck of the material plane that may extend past our solar system; engineering the soul marker that appears to be designed for the controller of the loop; and the time-loopy bit itself. Frankly, this seems beyond even an extraordinary prodigy and well into the territory of either divine intervention or a secret government project involving many of the greatest mages available and drawing massive amounts of resources (Evidence against: Xvim, obviously the greatest archmage in Edelmar, was not involved).

A running theme throughout the story is that the Ikosian magical tradition has already assimilated most of the knowledge of older traditions and is with high probability has the most sophisticated understanding of magic in history ("It's true that we rarely find something worth learning among other magical traditions these days, but that's mostly because we already stole and traded for everything that was worth taking." - Chapter 23). Based on this, it seems unlikely that all the engineering of the time loop, including that particularly sophisticated soul marker, was done by an ancient civilisation.

It is not made at all clear that Red Robe actually soul-killed the aranea and battle mages, note that he has plenty of motivation to lie to Zorian. I think the most credible explanation is that Red Robe understands the mechanics (or at least the control interface) of the time loop well enough to instruct it to exclude individuals from future loops. Note, also, that he did not attempt to "soul kill" Zorian; this is evidence that being tied to the loop is protection from the technique.

  He secures an alliance with Ibasans and carves a grand duchy of his own, or something. Smaller than Kingdom of Eldemar, infinitely bigger than what he has right now (nothing).
#+end_quote

Not entirely implausible. This would be similar to Sudomir, who appears to be allied with the Ibasans to carve out his own independent territory around Knyazov Dveri (in addition to charging his soul battery). We really don't have sufficient characterisation of Damien to be able to judge whether this could be his motivation. What's the prior probability for a brilliant and highly successful prodigy to want to carve out an independent dutchy? Tinami's explanation of the political landscape implies that as a first-generation mage who would not have achieved his considerable success without the Mage Guild, Damien should be loyal to the Crown. This is even more so the case if Damien has been inside a Black Room, which appear to be controlled by the government.

#+begin_quote
  What if he poked something that was much bigger that he could handle (and even for a prodigy, world-wide time loop is way way way out of his league) or got betrayed by his partner (someone's got to fund his expeditions, right?) and Zorian has to deal with this shit in the end.
#+end_quote

I think it's pretty likely that the time loop was not part of the Ibasan invasion plans. Quatach-Ichl and Sudomir both appear ignorant of the loop without Red Robe's involvement and it doesn't appear to have been to their benefit. When Red Robe was actively supporting the invasion to great effect, the time loop didn't end so either Red Robe did not achieve what he wanted or he is not the primary controller of the loop.

Leaving aside the identity of Red Robe, I think the most plausible explanation for the time loop is that it was triggered after the invasion. Perhaps Cyoria was lost and the Crown ordered the activation of the secret project. Perhaps the primordial was released and a god came back from holiday and the time loop was created by divine intervention (in the manner of Time Braid).
