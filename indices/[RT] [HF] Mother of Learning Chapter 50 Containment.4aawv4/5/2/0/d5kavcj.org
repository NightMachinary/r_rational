Mainly narrative reasons at [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3eju9z/mother_of_learning_chapter_39_suspicious/ctjvwis][first.]] I completely ignored the mention of him on my first read through, and when I re-read it a second time (almost immediately after), I realized that he had never shown up.

Many things in the story are mentioned once, then only show up as important 20 or so chapters later. The cat by the river being Notcha, for instance. Few things are mentioned for no reason--It just doesn't seem to be the author's style.

Once I realized the oddity, other evidence began piling up. Zorian's search for the other time traveler made no real sense, as pretending to be one wouldn't let you use the loop to your advantage, and would quickly drive you crazy. Even if the time traveler had been there, finding them would have been fatal (which obviously ruled out Xvim, who others saw as a suspect. He of all people would have realized Zorian's growth early on.)

It had to be someone who was close to Zach in the beginning...who was missing. Damien was both too obvious and too far away, and fit more with Zorian's character development arc (realizing how much his empathy skill and general attitude had skewed his view of people around him, especially his family.)

We've known Zach has had his memory wiped for a long time now. The obvious way to find the time traveler would be to compare notes, and see who he doesn't remember. Or simply look for people who should be present but are missing, but that wouldn't have worked with the narrative arc. Red Robe needed to be hidden until the second arc for purposes of dramatic tension, so that wasn't likely to happen.
