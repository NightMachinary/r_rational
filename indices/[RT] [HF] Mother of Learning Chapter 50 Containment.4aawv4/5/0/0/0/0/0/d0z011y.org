Zorian was never that negative about Kiri, expressing some annoyance at her actions. I wouldn't really say she was redeemed, I'd more say he better understands her motives and is more sympathetic- she didn't really make amends for her actions. He still often sees her as an annoying brat, but he never hated her like he did his brothers.

Yeah, I doubt Fortov has some secret goodness to ivy pushing.
