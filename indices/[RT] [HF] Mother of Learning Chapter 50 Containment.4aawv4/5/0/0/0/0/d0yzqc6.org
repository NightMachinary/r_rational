  Zorian had genuine reason to have issue with her, in that she stole his stuff and always went for the toilet first and repeatedly jumped on him, but never had as much of an issue with her as he did wit Fortov.

Well there's a point when Zorian realises that Kirielle goes into the bathroom to force him to go downstairs and talk to their mom (about him taking Kiri to Cyoria) So that's not a bad thing as such as Zorian says she's just a kid and doesn't realize it's actually counter productive.

Also, she tells him that she steals his stuff to practice things that their mom doesn't approve of - her drawing and learning magic. So Kiri has been redeemed I think.

But you're right about Fortov, he's been a consistent jerk. Let's see if he has a proper reason about pushing Ibery onto the vines.. I doubt it tbh.
