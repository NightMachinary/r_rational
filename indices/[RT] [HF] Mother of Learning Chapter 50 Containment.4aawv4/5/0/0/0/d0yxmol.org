  Fortov seems like an ok guy,

  "I kind of pushed her into a purple creeper patch during our wilderness survival class," Fortov admitted. "Please, you have to help me! I'll find you a girlfriend if you do!"
#+end_quote

He purposely pushed Ibery into plants, to the point where she was as such.

#+begin_quote
  Her eyes and nose were red, as if she had been crying recently, and there was an ugly purple splotch covering her right cheek and neck. It didn't look like a bruise, not exactly, more like...
#+end_quote

This happens every month.

#+begin_quote
  As far as he knew, Fortov always came looking for him for help with the purple creeper salve, even though his accident with Ibery only happened near the very end of the time loop. Which, now that he thought about it, suggested the accident wasn't so accidental after all. Kind of suspicious for an accident to be so insensitive to changes...

Kiri describes his actions.

#+begin_quote
  "Fortov once burned a bunch of my drawings when I asked him to show me some magic," she admitted. "Said it was a joke."
#+end_quote

He describes Kiri in a much less negative manner.

#+begin_quote
  She was downright impossible this year, though

  He was pleased to note Kirielle hadn't rummaged through his stuff before waking him up. She had a very fuzzy notion of (other people's) privacy.

  Why was she always so intent on getting there first anyway? That was horribly petty, even for Kirielle. He'd have to ask her in one of the restarts.

Fortov doesn't seem like an ok guy, he deliberately destroys other's property and Zorian always was much less negative about Kiri- and Kiri wasn't fully redeemed. Zorian had genuine reason to have issue with her, in that she stole his stuff and always went for the toilet first and repeatedly jumped on him, but never had as much of an issue with her as he did with Fortov.

His judgement isn't that poor, he clearly has good reasons to not like his brothers.
