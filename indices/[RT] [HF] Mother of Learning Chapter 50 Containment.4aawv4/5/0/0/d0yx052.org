Not quite.

1) Zorian and his brothers are first generation mages--his parents are mundane (although his mother has witch ancestry.) So he doesn't have much rationale politically to screw over Cyoria--the opposite really.

2)Damien had zero reason to be anywhere near Zach during the start of the time loop. He's off messing with something in the jungle of another continent. Why would he go back to Cyoria? I guess he could have found something there that led to the loop, but then why would /zach/ be the target of the time loop spell?

Red Robe is a leech, a tagalong. I just don't see why Damien would need his involvment at all.

3) Zorian is incredibly biased against his family. (and people in general, at the beginning.) He hated Fortov, and was quite irritated by Kirielle. Fortov seems like an ok guy, while Kirielle was completely vindicated. His dad is certainly rude, but Zorian was an ass to start with--he could have his reasons. Damien is a bit of a jerk from what we know of him (he practiced the dancing spell on Zorian), but we don't have anything damning. His siblings don't like him, but his parent's and everyone else do.

Meanwhile, Veyers did something bad enough to get him sent to a disciplinary hearing, and then was enough of a jerk to get expelled. Despite being the Heir to an important house, which likely gets him special treatment.

Personally, I think Damien is a massive red herring, and is in fact close to what Zorian would have turned out like if he didn't go through the time loop. Perhaps not nearly as skilled (Damien probably went into a black room), but with similar relationship problems.

Zorian has changed his opinion about a ton of people, but only after really getting to know them. I think Veyer's temperment has more evidence, he has more motive (heir of a strong house?), and finally his presence is less well explained. He sticks out like a sore thumb, while Damien fits well with the rest of Zorian's family problems.
