Dabbling in soul magic perhaps?

"it seemed there were some things that just couldn't be overlooked, even if you were an heir of Noble House Boranova."

And if you had an interest in the field, and perhaps had gone so far as to gain soul sight (what does House Boranova specialise in? We don't know), and you had no discernible ethics, and a former classmate came to you (because he came to everyone he could find) telling you about his soul being pulled back in time, why then, you might try messing around with soul magic to get in on the loop.
