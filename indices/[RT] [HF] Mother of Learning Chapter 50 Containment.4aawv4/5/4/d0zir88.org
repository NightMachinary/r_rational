One piece of evidence about RR which I don't think has been discussed:

RR, being a competent soul mage ("necromancer"), should have no problem seeing the loop marker. He is able to identify Zach as the looper on sight (but, oddly, not Zorian). Presumably this is because of the marker, but I don't know.

Why, then, did he soulkill /all/ of the aranea? If he knew about the marker at all (a necromancer would), he could simply perform a search for the same marker. RR's behavior here is odd and probably irrational.
