The soul trap is something of a background concern at the moment, the memory packet is going to expire soon and red robe is arguably the greater concern. Also, he can't easily get at it until the very end of the loop and getting into Alanic's good graces takes quite a bit of effort.

Black boxes are also not as important as the memory packet. In fact, he has less need than most for the extra time. He's only 'competing against' Red Robe who, while very scary and smart, is lying low for now. The main benefit is the insights they'll provide into the loop mechanism. (Also he has no way of getting to the facility.)
