I didn't write down the errors in particular but I tried redd, reddit-api, and I think RedditKit. I'm not sure. There weren't any others besides that (as far as I looked anyway)

If I can recall correctly, one had a hashie problem and another had an https problem (because Windows).

Ultimately, I was able to get the python one to work nearly right away but I kept running into problems with the ruby ones. Maybe I'd get one to work, maybe not, but I have it now, so get wrecked! :P

Actually, I don't think I did RedditKit because it was too old. It didn't support OAuth that Reddit now requires (I'm not sure if they disabled the old user/pass interface or just deprecated it.)
