They're sealed \ cut off from outside environment (think thermodynamics). Trying to use a Black box inside an active time loop would be like building a box inside a box. It may be malfunctioning when used (e.g. not reaching x30 time dilation or not working at all) if black boxes and the time loop are operating on relatively similar principles, but I don't think it w\could entrap the Aranea.

On the other hand, if Red Robe is privy to how the FMA-soul trap operates, he may have been able to “blacklist” the Aranea souls and prevent them from getting reset with each iteration.
