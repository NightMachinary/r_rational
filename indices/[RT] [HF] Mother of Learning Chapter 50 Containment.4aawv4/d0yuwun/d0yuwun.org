More evidence for the Veyers Boranova = Red Robe theory!

#+begin_quote
  He was pleasantly surprised that one particular asshole wouldn't be joining them this year -- apparently Veyers Boranova lost his temper on his disciplinary hearing and got himself expelled from the academy. He wouldn't be missed. Honestly, that boy was a menace and it was a disgrace they hadn't expelled him sooner. Fortunately, it seemed there were some things that just couldn't be overlooked, even if you were an heir of Noble House Boranova.

Evidence:

1) The time traveler is almost certainly someone who would have been near Zach during the original summer solstice, when the spell was originally cast. This could be a fellow student, teacher, or diplomat at the party.

2) Zach and Zorian have demonstrated that it's nearly impossible to do the same thing over and over again. They certainly couldn't/wouldn't do so without showing their increasing skills.

3)If Red Robe was present at the school, he would have noticed Zorian becoming better, and eliminated him. So he can't be someone who is present during the story.

4) Zach starts most loops by kicking Tesen's ass. Zorian started hating Kirielle for her annoying actions at the beginning of the loop, before he got to know her better. This sounds awfully familiar to Veyers losing his temper, although this could have happened before the loop.

5) Veyers is a briefly mentioned character, at the very beginning of the story, who never appears again. The author doesn't put in unnecessary details very often--he was mentioned for a reason.

6) He's mentioned as decidedly unpleasant character, although early Zorian was sometimes an unreliable narrator.

7) He's a member of a noble house, which we have just learned in the last two chapters, may have reason to hate Cyoria, which has shifted power from Nobles to first-generation mages.
