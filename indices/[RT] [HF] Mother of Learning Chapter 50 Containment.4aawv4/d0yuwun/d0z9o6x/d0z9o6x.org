A bit too... speculative for my taste. He he he.

(1) is unsubstantiated assertion at best. (2) has little to no relevance to RR. (3) It is pretty obvious that RR is not a classmate/teacher of Zorian, which excludes, statistically speaking, insignificant amount of people from our search. It is a strong evidence against, say, Akoja the Red Robe, but it is a bad evidence /for/ Boranova the Red Robe. (4) is grasping at straws. The chief librarian is hating academy rector over a political */gasp/* dispute. Sound the time traveler alarm! (5) that is probably the only real evidence, but not a watsonian one and it's not new (6) lots and lots of people are described as unpleasant by Zorian, partially because he was angsty, partially because lots of people /are/ unpleasant (7) if anything this chapter serves as a point against this one. This was the perfect opportunity to give us a clue in the form of Tinami spilling some juicy rumor about House Boranova. Something along the lines /"Oh, you think Noveda have it bad? Wait until you hear about our former classmate Boranova..."/ Instead nothing happens.

A much stronger case could be made for Daimen. "Unpleasant? I'll show you unpleasant!" (counterpoint to 6)

He is the biggest gun on the wall BY FAR (counterpoint to 5)

He starts the loop outside of Cyoria (to 3) on another continent even, which could even explain why marker detection doesn't work: he is simply out of range (although, most likely he has a different maker).

He is known exploring awesome magical ruins of awesomeness, is there a better place to find some forbidden time travel magic and start the whole thing? (to 1)

He is known to be extremely talented, suspicious by itself. Then there is the the fact that RR is the only person known to perform not one but two magical equivalents of square circles, time travel and soulkill.

He is not a member of a ruling elite and as grampa Reid has noted in his infinite wisdom no one achieves greatness by being goody two-shoes. Perhaps an extremely ambitious young upstart Daimen wants the world crash and burn so that he can come on a metaphorical white horse and save the day, securing his position. Have enough prominent houses eliminated as a collateral damage and the crown will be strongly motivated to ennoble him. Collateral damage from destruction of Cyoria will be HUGE. He secures an alliance with Ibasans and carves a grand duchy of his own, or something. Smaller than Kingdom of Eldemar, infinitely bigger than what he has right now (nothing).

This, of course, offers no explanation why exactly Zach is looping, but neither does your theory.

Add: another fun idea is that Daimen is not the main antagonist, but is the damsel-in-distress, of sorts. What if he poked something that was much bigger that he could handle (and even for a prodigy, world-wide time loop is way way way out of his league) or got betrayed by his partner (someone's got to fund his expeditions, right?) and Zorian has to deal with this shit in the end. Who is the brilliant brother after /that/, huh, huh? No evidence for this one, of course, but that would be a fun subversion.
