Oh, the razor is definitely not forgotten here, but the point is, Red Robe is either a necromancer without equal (soul kill) or is occupying metaphorical driver seat in the time loop business, whereas Zach is a mere passenger and Zorian is a stowaway. This means that Red Robe is probably way more capable as a mage than Zach. This point is further demonstrated in Soul Kill chapter, Red Robe is /very/ capable. Damien, being the prodigy even before the loop, fits (along with every other capable mage out there). Boranova, a mere student that got kicked out of the academy doesn't.

As for suspicious people, there was that girl in Zach's group in restart zero that we know absolutely nothing about.
