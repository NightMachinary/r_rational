All valid points.

  Both of these arguments depend on narrative reasoning and the strength of said evidence is strongly dependent on the author's decisions.

Absolutely, I was merely pointing out that if we are resorting to out-of-universe evidence, the case for Daimen becomes so much stronger.

  We really don't have sufficient characterisation of Damien to be able to judge whether this could be his motivation. What's the prior probability for a brilliant and highly successful prodigy to want to carve out an independent dutchy?

I think we have indirect evidence via characterization of Zorian's parents.

Now, Zorian's depiction of his family is somewhat suspect. I believe re-evaluation of his earlier judgements is not done yet. It seems reasonable that he could be more sympathetic to his mother and Fortov, just as he became more sympathetic to Kirielle. But his father, it seems to me, is a lost cause.

As per Zorian's description we have a social climber that neglects his other children for being not talented enough. How would someone like this raise a really gifted kid? Would they instill loyalty to the community and the country, personalized by the ruling elites? I feel that's not very likely. Opportunism, self-entitlement, cynicism and bitterness at his low social status are well on the plate for Damien.

  Leaving aside the identity of Red Robe, I think the most plausible explanation for the time loop is that it was triggered after the invasion. Perhaps Cyoria was lost and the Crown ordered the activation of the secret project. Perhaps the primordial was released and a god came back from holiday and the time loop was created by divine intervention (in the manner of Time Braid).

I have thought of this. The biggest problem with all time loop theories proposed so far is that I do not see a satisfactory reconciliation of Zach and RR both being in the loop.

Suppose the loop is a case of divine intervention. This implies that Zach is the Chosen One, and it's not far-fetched. He is suited for a damn good narrative. A deity could choose someone like him to be the Champion, easily. But why did RR get into the loop? Why that option was on the table in the first place? Technically, we know it's because loop soul markers are vulnerable to soul magic, but does divine intervention really work in such... reverse-engineerable ways?

Time loop as a government program has even worse problems, such as why even bother with Zach? Apart from being a heir to a Noble house, he wasn't someone really fit for this task. Someone like Haslush was. Someone who was already a capable mage before the loop, preferrably an officer and definitely an adult. Unless the loop prohibits biologically older people from looping, there was no reason to loop Zach.
