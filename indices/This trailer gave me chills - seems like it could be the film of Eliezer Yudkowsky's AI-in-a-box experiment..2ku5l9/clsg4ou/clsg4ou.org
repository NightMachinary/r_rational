  The "dramatic" text at the start of the trailer is just silly. The rest is okay, but they could have done without the start. If you merge organics and machines, you don't get something godly, you get a down-grade. Organics are superior, but humanity is only about 0.01% of organic life's potential. People who assume we're the maximum potential also assume the only way to get more powerful is to use cybermods, but we're not anywhere near organic life's maximum. We still have 99.99% of the way to go on that front. I predict that cybermods will be very useful for a period of about 50 years, but then genemods will make cybermods and AI as obsolete as an abacus.
