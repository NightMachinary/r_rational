wow looks cool! I hope it comes to my country. I've got a few nitpicks with the premise though. why the need to put a super AI in an android body is it a Turing+ test? its both dangerous and unconformable to look at. if you need to, why give it enhanced mechanical strength instead of a weak body in case it needs to be restrained?
