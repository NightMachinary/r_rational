Overall, I'm pretty happy with this update. I've found that having an beta reader has helped me enormously. Finding things like word repetitions or mistakes that make it through the spellchecker is really nice, and having someone point out things that don't make sense is also excellent.

One of the big forces both in this quest and in this particular update is religion. Argonath has an organized polytheist religion with a canon and a hierarchical unified church. Religion is as much a part of their society as it was a part of, say, French society in the 1300s. The booming voice commanding the legitimacy of the queen adds a fun element to the mix.

We see how different people react to this situation. One goes from being an agnostic worshiper to a zealous heretic, accepting the divinity of The Interloper. Another feels his faith is renewed, and turns on his fellows, slaying them for going against the words of the gods. The last reacts in a brutal, efficient fashion, taking advantage of the battlefield conditions ignoring the possibility of gods.
