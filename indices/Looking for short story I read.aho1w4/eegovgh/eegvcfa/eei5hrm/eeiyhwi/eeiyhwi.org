It looks like a big chunk of the protagonist's village is in that category, and unafraid to make it known.

And again this seems too simple. If drones focused on people who strongly disagree with the AI economy, you'd think their acquaintances would notice. Pretty quickly it'd be common knowledge that Loom = desire for freedom from the AI. It'd be taught in school etc.

Maybe that /was/ true once upon a time, but now the drones have moved on from such low-level thinking and instead kill people whose deaths will ripple into nth-order effects that are good for the market somehow. Or maybe the drones have gone full paperclip-maximiser, optimising for something unintended and worthless.
