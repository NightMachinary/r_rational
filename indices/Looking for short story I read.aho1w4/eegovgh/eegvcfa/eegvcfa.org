There is the one line from the immunologist,

#+begin_quote
  They still laugh and work and --- love their daughters. They just care about something different. Reaching other people, instead of reaching that new promotion, that new car.
#+end_quote

but that can't be it. It's too simple. The main character heard that line, yet carried on being so hopelessly confused about what the Loom might be that he's uncertain it exists at all.

Also, what little we see of the world is far too normal. People behave like normal human beings in a normal human society (besides the AI-run stock market and random drone strikes), not like profit-maximising ants. They love each other, they make art, they rebel. /1984/ this isn't.
