I'm actually on the AI's side on this - I assume they have some concept of normal human behavior, and if an expanding subpopulation suddenly stops optimizing for human things and starts optimizing for being in immediate proximity to as many sequential other humans as they can, that's a mite suspicious.

If a parasite was able to hijack the human brain's reward system, it wouldn't necessarily stop the rest of the brain from doing its best to [[https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/fungus][rationalize the new behavior.]]
