  Edit: I have no idea why autocorrect would change subreddit to diversity, but it happened.

Examining the layout of a QWERTY keypad, the letters for those are all really close together.

S,D\\
U,I\\
B,V\\
R,E\\
E,R\\
D,S\\
D,_\\
I,I\\
T,T\\
_,Y

Almost aligns perfectly, each pair is adjacent... and even where it doesn't align, the unaligned letters are either repeats or adjacent to the previous letter.

Experimenting further, Swype is really surprisingly good at picking up the difference between the two... I haven't taught it subreddit as a word but it was reliably picking either subvert/suggest or diversity depending on which I tried to type, even when I tried to exaggerate the laziness of the swipe pattern to make it a bit ambiguous. I guess based on whether you go E-R or R-E, and whether or not you flick back to the Y after the T at the end.
