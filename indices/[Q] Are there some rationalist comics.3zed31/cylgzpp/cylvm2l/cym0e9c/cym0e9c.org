I would point to the art as the biggest fault of Thorsby's comics. I find the weird treatment of romance, sex, sexuality, and gender relations the second biggest. But by good writing, do you mean the story, or the actual dialogue? He is ESL, I suppose I might be unusually tolerant of bad translations.
