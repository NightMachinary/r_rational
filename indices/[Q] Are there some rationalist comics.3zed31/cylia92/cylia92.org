Fullmetal Alchemist is a fairly rational manga, with an interesting magic system and good characters - the protagonist in particular pulls off some excellent munchkinry in the last third that wouldn't be out of place in a rationalist fanfiction. It can be somewhat deathist in places, though other than that it's about as rational as mainstream media gets.
