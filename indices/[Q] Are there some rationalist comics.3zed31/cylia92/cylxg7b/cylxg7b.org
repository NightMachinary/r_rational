If manga are applicable, I would recommend: Qualia the Purple: A single girl sees people as robots, and can modify them as such, things spiral out of control as one of her friends becomes literally everything.

Ajin: Immortals start appearing at the rate of 1 to 250 million or so, and the main character is immediately on the run as he gets hit by a truck. Ramps up into terrorist and anti terriorist shenanigans.
