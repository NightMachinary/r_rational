Comics by rationalists, for rationalists, and most certainly not about rationalists.

Bouletcorp is another good one. I find them to be somewhat related, one of them referenced the other once and Bouletcorp did the illustrations for Wienersmith's /Augie and the Green Knight,/ which I want so very badly.
