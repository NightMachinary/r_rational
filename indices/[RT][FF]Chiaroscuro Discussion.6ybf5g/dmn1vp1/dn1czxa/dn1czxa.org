Team 8 is well done, I think, but on extended hiatus. It focuses a lot on Naruto, and especially Hinata, working through their isolated/abusive backgrounds. The Naruto-Hinata-Shino team dynamic works well, certainly better than canon's love-hate triangle. Team Anko has them too as I recall, [[#s][except]]

Lighting Up the Dark is fun, but will probably never be finished.

If you like seeing the true power of the Multiple Shadow Clone technique, I'd suggest either The Waves Arisen (complete) or A Drop of Poison (incomplete).
