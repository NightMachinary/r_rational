that thought never crossed my mind. Black Zetsu is something that existed for centuries in canon I would believe the same applied here.

I consider chiaroscuro my favorite Naruto fanfic. Infireforged was a close second but it was discontinued as author finished university.

DO you know other Naruto fics on the same level?
