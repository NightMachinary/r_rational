  These aren't all rationalist, but I did enjoy them.

Yes, generally the factors of quality are:

1. Execution of the page-to-page writing (the "juiciness", if you will - I think [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/649528/nonjon][nonjon]] is an alright example of this).
2. Pacing.
3. Competent rationalist fiction.
4. Interesting premise.

Although #1 and #2 /might/ be the same thing, and #3 and #4 could likely be swapped (because not all good fiction is rationalist fiction - although non-rationalist fiction basically /requires/ #1 or #4). But that's something approaching the priorities of a decent author.
