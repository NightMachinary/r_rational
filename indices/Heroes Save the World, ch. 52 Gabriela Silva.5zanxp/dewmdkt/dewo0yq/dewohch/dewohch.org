I'm glad that you liked it!

I'm a little disappointed that I wasn't able to fit in more, but...the chapter was originally an attempt to shed additional light in Akvo's people (as the last chapter of each sequence always does), and only exploded from there.

I'm pretty sure that we're going to be seeing more of Gabriela in the not too distant future, though.
