My understanding is that, as Eden was killed, it restricted the PtV shard. Contessa had several blind spots, namely:

- She could not use PtV to directly counter/predict anything Scion did, and by inference Eden; I would expect that this is why they could not predict what the formulas would do- because they were technically shards of Eden's dead-but-still-dreaming body. This was the main cause of Cauldron's strategy- Contessa could not ask PtV "How do I defeat Scion with the minimum number of casualties", they had to frame questions around him instead.
- She could not use PtV against the Endbringers.
- She could not use PtV against specific capes; notably, Eidolon. She countered this one by building a mental model of Eidolon, and then asking PtV to use that instead of the real one. "How do I make my mental model of Eidolon do X", not "How do I make Eidolon do X". It's unclear which other capes were blind spots, since Cauldron had a habit of letting powerful capes run amuck to cause triggers rather than try to PtV them into submission.
