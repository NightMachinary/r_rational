Hero was just an example. /Path to building X/ can duplicate any tinker or group of tinkers, and doesn't have mass production limits. If they considered it worth having tinkers around to fight Zion, then why not >tinkertech armed armies?

If there isn't some limit on such uses of PtV, her power effectively includes those of Accord, Uber, Leet without the once-only limit, Armsmaster, Bakuda, Blasto, Bonesaw, Sphere, String Theory Numbers Man and Tattletale. It stretches my credulity to think that none of those abilities were sufficiently relevant to become a major part of Cauldron's plans.
