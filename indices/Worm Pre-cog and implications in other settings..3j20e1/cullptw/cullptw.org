Word of God is that PtV is /also/ simulated, so the universe isn't actually deterministic. Same goes for most of the precog powers. This is part of why the PtV can be wrong sometimes; it doesn't give a full and accurate simulation all the time, because there are things that can interfere with the simulation space.

  In a setting in which perfect precognition is a thing that exists, can you have multiple possible timelines, or would precognition that suggests such things simply be a limitation of that particular power?

[[http://lesswrong.com/lw/fok/causal_universes/][You might want to read this post.]] I think it's mostly analogous, because perfect precognition is basically a form of time travel except the only thing doing the traveling is information.

In short, I think the answer is yes. We can easily imagine two universes which are self-consistent in different ways even if they are exactly the same prior to the incident of time travel (or precognition). By analogy, it's like a game with multiple Nash equilibria. The person who can see future probabilities can see all of the equilibria that might result from the circumstances while the person who can see the path to victory can see which equilibrium they're going to end up at.

(It's late a night here, so hopefully I haven't made any glaring errors in logic.)
