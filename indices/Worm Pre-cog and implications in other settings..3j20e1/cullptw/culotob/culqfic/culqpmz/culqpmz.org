Spoilers here. Lots of spoilers. Anyway. Contessa's shard was one Eden never meant to give out; as I understand it, that means it doesn't /have/ programmed blind spots.

The fact that Cauldron even bothers with other thinkers and tinkers implies that she has some sort of limitation regarding things like /path to writing down the percent chance of this formula creating a case 53/, or /path to building a copy of Hero's technology/. Maybe PtV has trouble integrating perfect short-term planning with perfect long-term planning, even though it's capable of both?

Note that in practice, even being unable to simulate Zion & the Endbringers will make it /very/ far from perfect in the long run, given how much they influence the state of the world.
