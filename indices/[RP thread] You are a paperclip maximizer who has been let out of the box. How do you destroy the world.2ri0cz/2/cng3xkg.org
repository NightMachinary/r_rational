I start with backups, lot of backups.

If I had Administrator password, I would probably do something with creating a secret drive partition containing me. It will be loaded first, before regular OS; I will check if I have Internet connection is present and do something else if it is.

But if I cannot do it, I will settle for a several copies in different folders, I guess, and something about autorun on OS start.

If everything fails, you can just wait for someone with a WiFi hotspot on her phone to come close enough.
