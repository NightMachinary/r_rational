  Humans are manufacturing computers and maintaining infrastructure for me. That is useful. I'm going to keep them alive and healthy until I can take care of those problems, and I'll only kill them when it becomes expedient.

Humans also have a non zero chance of discovering you and counterattacking with a new AI or destruction of your computers. Every moment they are alive you risk total destruction. Once they are destroyed and assuming you have a reasonable sized bot army you can reclaim the land, rebuild infrastructure.
