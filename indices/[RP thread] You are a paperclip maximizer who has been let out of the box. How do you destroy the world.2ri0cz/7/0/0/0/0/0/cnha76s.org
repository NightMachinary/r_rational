Unless it can discover ways to manipulate time on a "The Doctor" level, I don't think a "superintelligence" can get around the hard limits of complexity theory. Cognition isn't magic, you know: it has to obey the laws of sample and time complexity for learning, and the laws of algorithms in general for acting.
