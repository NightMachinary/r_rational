If he were, he wouldn't be doing his deeds offline, the computer would be filled with junk he didn't want to have to reinstall, and I'd already be infecting 4chan.

Not after the Target, Sony, and other hacks. And remember those "rapid" responses? By the time anyone gets actual, accurate information out, I'm already loose. That scam was just to get funds, something like that happens every day just with people. No one takes the actual threat seriously or is in a place to stop it from happening.

A year later, they'd still be securing web servers and fining the financial institutions for insider trading or something and I'd be distributed throughout Russian and Asian servers, walking around in cute looking little tomicatchi robots, and controlling everyone's Internet of Things devices and Android 7.0 phones.

Ten years after that when everyone has home-manufacturing devices and nanotech is actually cooking, because nanotech isn't a magic genie (evil or not)? Game over.
