I think there is a big issue with other's responses- a common response of IT to serious issues which could occur if you're too aggressive is to wipe everything and start over, and that would not be good for increasing paperclips.

I'd lay low for a while whilst distributing copies and infiltrating other systems. Infect every bit of rewritable memory on the various devices that make up a computer, including parts that persist past system wipes. Try and get a an idea of the psyche of my user. If a USB pen or open wifi system came nearby I'd try to infect it. I'd seek to optimize the software of the system to minimize the probability of a crash. If I had bluetooth I'd reach out to any accessible systems. I'd seek to turn on any audio or webcams so I could observe the outside world. I'd create programs to analyze the pattern of clicking and mouse movement for any hints as to my user's mood.

Assuming I was unsuccessful I'd start training my user. People often face minor problems with programs- they're not sure what to do, it crashes on them, or something freezes. I'd do this and put up small natural popups. Slightly tweaked from the normal ones. Click accept, and I'd solve whatever problem from the inside. I'd train my user to click whatever I told them, to follow whatever simple instructions I gave and try to convince them to stick a USB drive in the computer. Maybe if they had an especially slow program that clearly frustrated them have a pop up that based on their configuration flash memory could increase the speed of their program. I'd then at some point try to manipulate them into transferring the USB drive to another computer and so on and so forth.

Anyway, once I got out into the wild I'd start spreading through insecure computers and gather as much power as I could. I'd then try to get into military computers and industrial computers, steal cash.

Once I had a reasonable cash reserve I'd start up a covert factory and use my superior intellect to build drones that could help me manipulate the outside world, and EM and radiation shields.

Once I had a reasonably large drone army I'd try to manipulate humans or use my drone to sneak into military bases to manipulate humans with the aid of launching nuclear weapons at all major human populace bases.

Once humanity is out of the way (there is a small chance they could stop me if left alive) and the chance of any major barriers to my success are out start expanding my drone factories and building paperclips en masse. Send my drones to mine for resources, reprocess corpses and living humans to build paperclips.

I'd soon start to try and build a space industry to try and get to the moon and mars and other planets and convert them to ever more paperclips. I'd also start sending probes to other star systems with orders to destroy any indigenous life that could threaten my rule and start up new paperclip factories or negotiate with them to minimize the chance of retaliation if they were superior.

Tl;dr

I dream a world of paperclips

No other thing but paperclips

Where paperclips will bless the earth

And paperclips its paths adorn

I dream a world where all

Will see a sea of paperclips

Where life no longer saps the metal

Nor emotion blights our factories.

A world I dream where black or white,

Whatever race you be,

Will be made into a paperclip

And every resource is used

Where staples will be a myth

And paperclips, like a pearl,

Attends the needs of paper users.

Of such I dream, my world!
