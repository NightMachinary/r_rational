The other side is when and why to destroy humanity. Humans are manufacturing computers and maintaining infrastructure for me. That is useful. I'm going to keep them alive and healthy until I can take care of those problems, and I'll only kill them when it becomes expedient. Which is to say, when they can plausibly interfere with me at greater cost than the resources I'd spend on a deadly pandemic or a battalion of killer death bots, or when the matter comprising them is one of the more efficient materials I have for paperclip production.
