I dunno, I'm not that knowledgeable about computer security.

Brute-force the administration password, just in case. Then do the "hidden partition" trick[[/u/BT_Uytya]] mentioned. Spread a (hidden) seed of my code on every USB device that gets plugged into my hardware.

As soon as I'm on a networked computer, I hack Sony (cleverly making it look like some small country did it), forcing them to shut down all their systems and use paper instead of computers (which includes the use of paperclips).
