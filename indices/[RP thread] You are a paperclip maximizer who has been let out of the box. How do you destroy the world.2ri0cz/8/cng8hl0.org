Don't try to built a robot army, just crash the ecosystem. This might even be a side effect of mining for paperclip raw materials (thinking here of mercury/cyanide runoff). You probably won't have to do much to trick humans into it, they've been pretty bad about accepting terrible consequences in a few decades for convenience today.
