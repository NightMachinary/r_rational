The first (actually the third, but never mind the first two) thing which comes to mind is for the chefs to precommit--either by Consequences or by mutually trustworthy agreement, as with clones--not to use sabotage.

On one end, for maximum motivation and authenticity for viewers/show/future-reputation, winner takes all. On the other end, for maximum safety, winner splits between all. Different ratios of splitting are possible, potentially calculated according to estimated chances of winning.

--Here's another way of looking at it. If you /don't/ think you can win, then maximising the expected money for all chefs is much better than any sabotage (unless no money at all goes to losing chefs). If you DO think you can win, then nothing's better than 'winner takes all without sabotage', and a quarter of the money is better than losing and getting nothing due to sabotage (assuming that at least two chefs will notice how good you are and be willing to spend up to three quarters of their money on sabotaging you).

For it to be worth accepting sabotage, you have to think that you can win somehow while spending less than 3/4 of the month on sabotage, but that you can't win without sabotage. I haven't checked the numbers, but this can perhaps been addressed by the concept of people with more likelihood of winning getting a bigger share, so that they have potentially less they would be willing to spend on sabotage.

Now, if the rules are enforced and there's no way to split it or agree on no-sabotage... hmm. Well, for one thing try to toe the line so as to stay in the running while not being seen as a threat, until the end. That case, now... not sure whether there's any better approach than 'refuse to sabotage and hope opponent does the same', if imagining two people with equal skills for which magnitude of sabotage determines victory (and for which no agreement or precommitment is possible).
