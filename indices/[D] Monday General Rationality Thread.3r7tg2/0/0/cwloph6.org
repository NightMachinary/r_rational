I assume that 1667 words is the 50,000 words divided by 30 days?

My suggestion would be write more than that, say 2000, so that way if you happen to miss a day once or twice a week, you'll still be on track. You don't want it to be November 27th, something unavoidable happen for a couple days, and then have to write 5000 words on November 30th.

Doing even a little bit extra will build in a buffer so that things like that can't happen.
