If at all possible, get some accountability going. One of the reasons that I like writing serials is knowing that if I end up late on a chapter, someone is going to come along and poke me about it. Without that, it's pretty easy to just let a project linger, begin avoiding it, and then never finish.

Options for this:

- Find a NaNo buddy who will call you on not getting anything done
- Set up a deposit with some internet stranger which you won't get back unless you e-mail them your words every night
- Rope in a friend or family member who will check your work

The idea is that if there's a social or monetary penalty for failure, you're more likely to find the time to continue on.
