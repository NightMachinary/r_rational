Yeah ... that didn't happen. Clearly. Partly because I tried writing it in the style of an in-universe scholar, which I think just turned out more wanky than an explanation of a magic system already is. I will try to get that out by this weekend, then split time on the second appendix and National Novel Writing Month, which I think is doable.
