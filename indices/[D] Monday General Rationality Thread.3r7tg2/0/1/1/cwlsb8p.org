This is definitely a good idea. I'd noted this effect when I was on the official NaNo site a few weeks ago, and reciprocated a buddy-add from someone. I just realized that, although I have people who know I am doing NaNo, and friends who I have added on the site, I highly doubt they'd actually check my word-count. I'll have to try and get someone to stalk my word-count and bug me about it.

Thanks muchly.
