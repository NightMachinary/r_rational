What worked for me is the following:

- Use the Workspace feature of my computer to put the Google Docs window over in Workspace 2, with /nothing/ else there, or at least, nothing there but the writing and writing-related stuff (eg: tabs for research or whatever).

- Write dialectically. Sometimes I've got a particular line of rhetoric or narrative "burning", sitting around in my active working memory and asking to be put on the page. Most of the time, hell no. So instead I start by just writing down the /questions/ relevant to each section, and working out the answers via a dialectic with my own brain. Only once I've thoroughly worked out the actual core content do I then start writing things out with narrative or rhetorical /style/.

This has actually been especially helpful for fiction, as it lets me separate a character's perspective from the "objective" events I'm inventing in the "third-person" view.
