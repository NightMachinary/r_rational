I've been trying to create a scheduled sit-down-and-write habit for myself for the past month, in preparation for NaNoWriMo. I found a good cue at the same time every evening, and it gets me into hands-on-keyboard position with near perfect accuracy. The problem is that this only works when I am on base, because this cue is a part of my larger schedule. I have off every other week, though, and I know that when I get home next Monday, sitting down to write my 1,667 words every day is going to be about a gazillion times harder.

Any suggestions? Anything that works for you that I should try?
