Yes, this is definitely something that works. On base, the trigger (I was just reading /The Power of Habit/ by Charles Duhigg, which uses the term 'cue') is getting off of work for the day, which is impossible to ignore because it involves walking across the base for fifteen minutes, and then I just go sit at the cafe (and reward myself with a drink or something) instead of continuing on to my room.

At home, there's nothing quite like that in my schedule, and an alarm is far too easy to ignore. I don't even have to ignore it - I just acknowledge it, and tap it off, like I would if I were about to go get my laptop and start writing. And then I just wouldn't go get my laptop and start writing.

"Right after I clean my dishes" sounds like something that could be pretty effective, especially since I'll already be standing up, and having just done something that my brain counts as being productive. Thanks for the ideas!
