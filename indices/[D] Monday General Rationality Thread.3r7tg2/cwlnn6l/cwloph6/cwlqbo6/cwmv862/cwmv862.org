If you want to make something a habit, make it rewarding. I noticed this when I actually made myself a sandwich to take to work today, /just because I had a sandwich grill to toast it on/.

A tiny increase in the rewardingness made it appealing enough to do the work of carrying out a good habit I always know I should have.
