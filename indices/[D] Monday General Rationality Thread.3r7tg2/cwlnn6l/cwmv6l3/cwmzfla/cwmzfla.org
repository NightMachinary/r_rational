Generally, I don't have much of a problem writing once I'm sitting down at my computer with the document open in front of me - it's just getting to that position each day that's like trying to cross a violent river while hefting a boulder over my head and stepping only in time with music I can barely hear over the rushing water.

I don't have my laptop connected to wifi while I write - I used to use this Chrome addon that let you shut off your own internet access for a set amount of time with no take-backs, though I haven't needed to use it this year. I love how absolute the Google Docs fullscreen is, when you make the window fullscreen as well as hide the toolbar. Pristine.

Dialogue is always what really gets me itching to put words to paper- or screen - and I often end up with White Room scenes because of this. Sometimes I let it run its natural course and then go back and add in description after, and sometimes I say screw it and let it sit until post-NaNo editing. Rarely, I will actually remember to add description of the room/area while writing, but after reading your points I'm thinking I should maybe set up the visuals before going into a scene, as a sort of bullet-point format right on the page, then add each point in where appropriate.

Thanks for the helpful response.
