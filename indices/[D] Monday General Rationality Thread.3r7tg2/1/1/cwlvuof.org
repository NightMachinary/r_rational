So, assuming nobody bids on sabotage and equal cooking skill, the EV of this competition is $6,250. Therefore, if you can collude with your opponents, the correct strategy is to decide ahead of time for one player to deliberately flub their dish per round in return for $6,250 from the player who is chosen to win. If someone defects in the first round, the player chosen to lose the next round bids $25,000 on sabotaging that player. This strategy only falls apart in the last round, as there is no player left to enforce the concession.

That's the best I have.
