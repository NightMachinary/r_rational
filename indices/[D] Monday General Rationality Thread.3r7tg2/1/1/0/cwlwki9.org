If they had the funds, all players could collude by depositing $25,000 with a trusted third party which would be paid back in the event of either a loss or evenly dividing the full amount of loot following a win. Then the expected value for anyone attempting to buy a sabotage would be a net loss and all parties would evenly split the winnings following the conclusion of the competition.

There are a few problems with this. Realistically, most contestants don't have that much capital, most contestants would imagine themselves as more skilled than their competition and thus willing to forgo entering into the scheme because their EV is highly than $6,250 (which would mean that there would have to be extra pressure applied to anyone who didn't opt-in), the producers would probably cotton on and take action, etc.
