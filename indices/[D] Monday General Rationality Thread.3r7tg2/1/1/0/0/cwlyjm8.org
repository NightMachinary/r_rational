Actually, I just came up with a much better plan.

Have the guy who draws the shortest straw really ham it up on camera about how he will easily crush all opposition. When sabotage bidding comes, have him bid $1 to sabotage /himself/ as a "show of dominance." This will simultaneously knock him out of the running in a believable way and produce a compelling narrative for the producers to sell, decreasing the likelihood that the show gets stopped by suspicious producers. In the second round, have the guy who is supposed to lose third bid $20,000 (reducing his EV to below what complying would get him) to sabotage the guy who's supposed to lose in the second round, saying something like "I feel like he's the only threat left, now that Large Ham has been knocked out." In the last round, the guy who's supposed to win wins because his winning increases everyone's EV.

If the first guy defects, the second guy has his entire pool to work with to take him out. If the third guy defects, the second guy still has a large pool to work with. This only really falls apart if both 1 and 3 defect.
