It's unlikely that the loop was deliberately created to stop the invasion, since it was triggered a month before the invasion took place.

That would only work if the Maker found out about the invasion early, and decided that the loop was the best way to counter it - a strange reaction, at best, and given how it has drastically shortened the total loop duration, quite suboptimal.
