Yeah the events of the invasion with demons would make things worse and factoring in that there had to be some reason for the Loop to be initiated in the first place I wouldn't be surprised if stopping the invasion was a possible the goal of the loop by being able to learn how the enemy thinks. At this point it is hard to speculate why the loop was started as neither Zorian or Zach have memories of that and red robe has left the loop permanently. So it is nothing more than an untested hypothesis.
