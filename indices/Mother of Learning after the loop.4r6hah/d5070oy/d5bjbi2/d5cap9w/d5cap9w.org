Hmm I do see the point and I will admit I am grasping at straws but the reason for the loop initially is a huge mystery so I was more or less grasping at any possibility I could see. In retrospect the release of the primordial ending a loop early is a counter point. I guess we just lack enough information to make a decent hypothesis on why the loop was started.
