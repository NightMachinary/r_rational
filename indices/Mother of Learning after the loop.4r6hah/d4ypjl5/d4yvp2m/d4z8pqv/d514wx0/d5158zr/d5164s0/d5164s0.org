True, true ... Of course, he's smart and would probably just wait another 400 years rather than recklessly throw away his life, at which point Zorian and Zach wouldn't care anyways, so the problem would be solved.

But the thing is, he was always rather tough to get. I mean, the only time Zorian managed to get him down, was when QI thought he was just a student and talked to him.

Other times during the invasion he just teleported in, killed Zorian, and most likely teleported out.

So even considering that he can be dealt with, the problem is getting to him first.
