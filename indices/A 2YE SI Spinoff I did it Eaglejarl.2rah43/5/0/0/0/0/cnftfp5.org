Sorry. That wasn't sarcasm at all although, on re-reading, it is entirely clear how it could be perceived as such.

It was meant to be a small act of public self-flagellation. I did actually "look" at the list of previous posters. I did actually miss EagleJarl's name. I deserve the label "idiot" for that.

Also, thank you for pointing it out in the first place and for replying to my response to let me know how you interpreted it. It's genuinely valuable for me to (re-)learn that online text-only comments can be easily misunderstood.
