Depends on how you define machine ethics. If all that matters is human intelligence, sure. If you're willing to expand your empathic sphere to include all sophonts, what's so bad about Proto, Rock, and Roll that they can't be considered another species of intelligent life?

It's not like they're free-from-the-box self-improving AI, They're limited to a single brain, even if it's artificial it's still similarly solid-state, does Roll ever go out, graft another lobe in, and start the upward spiral?

Heck, in another version of the timeline, they could have been the result of the scientists learning how the brain develops, and ran a cell-resolution simulation of the process until consciousness formed, to better understand the risks of using artificial neuron transplants as a stepping stone to a slow upload. In that scenario, how could you ethically /not/ give them agency?
