I recently wrote down a lot of my old story ideas to see how they've changed over time, and it's really interesting. The premises have evolved over time to become simpler, and more stereotypically novel-like, while the actual outlines themselves tended to become more complex. I think this is a result on my conception of the ideas and characters becoming clearer over time, which explains why most of my attempts to spoof this process (by doing something like taking a punchy novel premise and working back from there) don't work - the only thing that allows me to be more certain about my ideas is to think about them.

I'm going to try to stop this from letting me sit on them for too long, though. I don't have any right to be proud of them if I haven't given them two legs to stand on.
