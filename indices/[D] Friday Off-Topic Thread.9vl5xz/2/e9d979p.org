I received an interview invite from MIT this week. It arrived on the last of 3 possible days, and after being [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9nl1og/z/e7nll9u][rejected by Harvard]] I was pretty nervous about my chances.

Interviewees have a ~50% chance of being admitted in contrast to the ~11% admission rate of the entire applicant pool. Fingers crossed.

MIT's final decision comes shortly before Christmas.
