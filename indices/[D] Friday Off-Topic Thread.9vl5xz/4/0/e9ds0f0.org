A lot of it seems to be counter-reaction to the alt-right and neo-reactionary brand of rationalism that's quite common in [[/r/slatestarcodex]], and is (or can be seen as) an outgrowth of particular elements of "rationalism" as established by LessWrong. Browsing the front page of that subreddit, you'll see that most of them are pointing out racism, sexism, nationalism, fascism, etc., all of which are somewhat common within /certain parts/ of the rational-sphere.

So, typical culture war outrage factory stuff, despite their insistence that they're not. Not worth paying too much attention to, IMO.
