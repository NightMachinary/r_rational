Taskmaster series 7 just ended, and I think it was my favorite since the first one (though it's never been bad, just sometimes failed to properly gel). If you're into seeing people do random tasks, check it out. The show has more genuine problem solving per minute than any other I can think of.

Edit: Also, the [[https://www.amazon.com/Taskmaster-Extraordinary-Tasks-Ordinary-People/dp/1785943588][Taskmaster book]] is apparently quite good; it's on my Christmas list.
