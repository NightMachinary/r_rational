I recently found... an odd sub. One that is very critical of rationalists (especially the Yudkowian kind). It's name? [[https://www.reddit.com/r/SneerClub/][r/sneerclub]]

I wouldn't be surprised if there's a unspoken rule of not talking about this group, but I am curious- what's your take on them?
