I got bad news this week: the coauthor of vampire flower language is officially burnt out of the story, the characters, and quite possibly even the setting. This made me understandably... sad.

When she announced it to me, I had a knee-jerk "can't possibly finish the story without her, she's the glue that holds the story together", but now it's really sinking in that the ~90,000 words I wrote will not be seen by anyone other than myself if I don't get over that attitude and maybe deign to present something suboptimal, if it'll mean that it actually will see the light of day.

The other option is for me to focus my energy (for now) on writing a werewolf story in the same universe which I am satisfied I can write without her, it's not a romance, I'm not entirely sure what it is yet, but it's going to be a little bit about blue and orange morality as the main source of conflict, I think (but.... probably not too cerebral, maybe pitched at a young adult sort of "philosophical"). I might write up the babysitter's club startup stuff I futzed around with first, since that's no stakes.

What I'm most sad about, oddly, is that I had this weird fantasy that we'd self-publish the book on Amazon when it was done, and maybe get a patreon with a modest ~$15/month level subscriber base, and go out for a modest dinner once a year on the proceeds, and have some sort of ineffable feeling of wider recognition and accomplishment from that. I was already feeling really great about myself because of the positive comments the story was getting on AO3.

Not that I need any of that stuff to feel accomplished - my coauthor has called me "the most productive person she knows", and she's probably right. But yeah. I had all these strange little hopes and dreams tied up in this, and those have all "come crashing down". So I'm mourning it.

Thanks for listening to this; I needed to get it out there.

Thanks especially to [[/u/callmesalticidae]] who said some really lovely things to me right after it happened.
