They're good at pointing out the parts of [[/r/slatestarcodex]] that lack self-awareness and social adjustment.

Otherwise, they have the common problems of communities that are built around people telling each other how much they hate something. They seem really insecure overall, in the "I sure hope these people we hate realize how much we hate them!" sense.

I'm not sure what else to say; they're like dozens of others subreddits that are dedicated to finding things to hate about the outgroup. After a while it's just sad and boring.
