It's intriguing, since most authors who write about Diamond Tiara tend to prefer to write her growing into a better person, or as someone who is deservedly punished. You're going in the opposite direction and whole-heartedly embracing her more sociopathic traits.

I think the story will depend strongly on what challenges she will face and how you can still have the reader support her despite any initial feelings of dislike.
