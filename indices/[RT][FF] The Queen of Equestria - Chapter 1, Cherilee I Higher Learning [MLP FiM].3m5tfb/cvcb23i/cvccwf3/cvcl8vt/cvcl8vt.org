  As far as I've witnessed, the Brony community has a rather unanimous dislike for Diamond Tiara. It's going to be an uphill battle to keep her true to her character as being highly manipulative while still making her someone who can be empathized with. I think I'm up for the challenge though.

Fortunately, you have the rationalist community here, who have previously demonstrated the inclination to empathize with /Lord Voldemort/. You'll be fine.
