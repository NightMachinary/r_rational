Diamond Tiara (and similar "bully" characters in other media) has always intrigued me.

Seriously, here's a character that just has a seemingly natural ability to assert their dominance on the people around them. If they could focus that ability and actually put it to good use they could accomplish some incredible things with their life. Exploring that idea is definitely going to be one of the main Rational focuses of my fic.

As far as I've witnessed, the Brony community has a rather unanimous dislike for Diamond Tiara. It's going to be an uphill battle to keep her true to her character as being highly manipulative while still making her someone who can be empathized with. I think I'm up for the challenge though.

Thank you for the feedback.
