Agreed, your interpretation would (in real life anyway) is more likely in general and when considering his surprise. However, knowing how stories love pretending the hero has died would shift some of the probability to my interpretation.

Also, I just reread the chapter paying careful attention to his internal monologue. His thoughts revolve around stopping Emma from injuring herself to disable his tracker and give him a chance to run away. Then he thinks about how he was so happy because of his siblings. He thinks once about how he wants to live and needs to keep smiling. He does think about how he has to be shipped out once.

At no point does he think about dying, rather his monologue is consistent with being shipped out if his plan relies on escaping somehow after/during the shipping. He never thinks about how he needs to dies for the others to live, just that he needs to be shipped out.

I suggest rereading the chapter while paying careful attention to the exact wording of his thoughts and seeing how they match with each of our interpretations.
