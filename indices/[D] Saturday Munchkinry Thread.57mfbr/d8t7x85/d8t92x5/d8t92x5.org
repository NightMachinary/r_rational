This one is a bit tricky because you want to avoid comparing the relative probability of e.g. (wins the lottery and apparatus works correctly) and (doesn't win lottery and apparatus malfunctions in a way that injures you permanently or leaves you braindead but technically alive).

I'm not entirely convinced there is a non-dangerous way to get data leakage here, considering you don't get any prevention of those things. Been puzzling it out for a while.

Best recommendation I have is to deliberately weaken your physical constitution so that things are less and less likely to leave you in the states where you're terribly handicapped but not dead. Something that tries to kill you if your IQ drops below some number would not be out of place, and dead man switches that try to murder you would also be a good safeguard against lack of substantial agency.
