My first thought would be to do some kind of daredevil stunts for money... but then I realized that not dying is a lot different than having a good quality of life.

So it's entirely possible that something could happen to you that won't kill you, but might paralyze you from the neck down or something similarly debilitating.

So if you're going to use this knowledge to take risks, you ideally want to find something that is likely to kill you, but not likely to damage you in an irreparable way.

Unfortunately I'm having a very hard time coming up with something that could likely kill me, but won't have any negative effects on my quality of life.

The best I can think of is perhaps infecting myself with HIV or some other dangerous virus to see if I have an immunity... but again the price for being wrong is potentially living for all eternity with some disease that perhaps makes your life miserable.

It may just be a lack of imagination on my part, but it seems to me that the only safe way to use eternity to your advantage is to be frugal and acquire wealth overtime and do everything in your power to ensure that you're safe and healthy.
