There are plenty of legal ways to exploit people. They generally work by exploiting a persons biases or lack of knowledge to get them to value certain things more than should until they wise up or taking other measures to distort the market.

On reddit there are people that make money by buying goods cheaply over aliexpress and reselling them on ebay or other online stores at a markup. They are exploiting a market inefficiency. The more people who use this strategy the less profitable it becomes because an increased supply of those goods on E-bay will lower prices.

As an aside stuff like the above on a larger scale can cause a colossal financial mess. If a lot of people see an exploit like that at the same time, it can occur that people take out loans to use it only to find that when it comes time to profit the market has corrected itself, they default on the loans and then there can be a massive financial problem.
