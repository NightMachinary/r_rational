What are the questions a rational character needs to ask in order to recognize an exploitable system? In politics? In finance? The problem is that most realistic systems aren't 'munckinable'. So one is likely to miss it when one comes across low hanging fruit. Sorry if this too vague. But my blind spot is in failing to ask the right questions or even realizing questions must be asked.
