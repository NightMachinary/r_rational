What happens if someone says "this neutron just split into an electron and a proton and 0.99 anti-neutrinos"? What does it mean for your feeling of wrongness to be non-quantitative? Do you feel that it's wrong, but not very wrong?

What if someone defines "category-N" as "an average number of anti-neutrinos between 0 and 0.99" and someone says that a neutron split into a proton, an electron, and a category-N; does that count as a large qualitative difference (it isn't a category N at all) or a small quantitative one (your power is smart enough to substitute in the definition of 'category-N' and knows that after substitution the number just needs to be changed from 0.99 to 1)? If the latter, how does your power know when to do substitutions--does it know that "category-N" is something you just made up?
