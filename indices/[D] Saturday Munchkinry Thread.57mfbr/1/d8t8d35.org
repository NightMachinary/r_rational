You exist in a near futuristic society where there are 'mods' which allows you to modify your appearance into nearly anything. The only restrictions is that you can't change your appearance into something that doesn't follow the human body plan: Bipedal, skeletal structure has to be the same, and joints have to bend in the same direction. You can only change the appearance, not your abilities to do something, so you won't be any stronger or more flexible.

The mods are about to come out in several days and the first few mods will be free to use for each person. There is a challenge to come up with the most memorable appearance you can and whoever wins will have a unlimited lifetime supply of mods. The winner is determined by the person who was the most memorable. There isn't any voting, people will simply be quizzed on who they still remember a few days to weeks or months later. Whoever is the most unique and have the most people remembering him/her will win. You want to win. How will you come up with the best appearance?

Side challenges: how would you sabotage someone else, and what would you do with unlimited mods?
