Hmmm. Memorable. I can't become a better swimmer by webbing my fingers, I take it?

I guess one way to be memorable would be to emulate some famous historical figure. Hmmm. Doesn't have to be a /good/ association, we're going for /memorable/ here.

Okay, how about... looking exactly like Hitler, except black? Claim it's a commentary on and utter rejection of his Aryan master race philosophy. I'll trigger massive political debates and /everyone/ will remember me. (Not always pleasantly...)
