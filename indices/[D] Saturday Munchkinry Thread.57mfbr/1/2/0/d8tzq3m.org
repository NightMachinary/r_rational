Do skin diseases count? If so, you could make tattoo paintings from different types of acne, and that sort of thing. Are you allowed to mod yourself with vitiligo skin so that it shows images? That might be something. Alternatively, use various diseases to look really grotesque or something. Or make yourself look like the president or something and go streaking somewhere where you will get filmed.
