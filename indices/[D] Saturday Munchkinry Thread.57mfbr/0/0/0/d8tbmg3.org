I find it difficult to conceive of an explosive collar failing in a crippling but nonlethal way, but the odds may be higher than effectively zero, which would be very very bad. The odds of the device failing entirely and simply not activating, on the other hand, would probably be much higher (but possibly reducible with good engineering), which would limit your ability to manipulate probability.
