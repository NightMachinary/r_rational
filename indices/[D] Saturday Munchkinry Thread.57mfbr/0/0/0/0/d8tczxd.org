I guess it depends on how you obtained the explosive collar, but if it's filled with some sort of explosive substance, it could be possible that whoever gave you the material mixed it with fake explosives so that it's actually a much weaker bomb than you expected. (Or if you made it yourself, your process somehow malfunctioned and gave you weaker explosives) If you somehow tested it by exploding a random sample, it could be (although very unlikely) that the random sample you picked was the best of the bunch and not indicative of the average quality.

Or maybe it just randomly explodes in a way that sends most of the force outwards instead of inwards, I don't know much about explosives.

Regardless, if it ends up being a lot less powerful than you expected it might just injure your spinal cord and leave you paralyzed from the neck down.

Whatever good engineering techniques you used would have to have a rate of failure smaller than whatever probability you were trying to exploit. If you want one in a million odds to happen, you need a method that produces collars with significantly less than one in a million failures. Even if there were such a method you couldn't know because you would need to test more than a million collars to measure with such precision.
