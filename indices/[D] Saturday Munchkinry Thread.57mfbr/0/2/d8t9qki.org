The first and biggest question here is what causes timelines to diverge? Or rather, what factor results in the question of one out of two timelines surviving even being possible? From your setup, it appears of the form that making choices branches timelines, but then we have a different perspective:

If all choices I can make are made, and all the ones that do not result in my death exist, what sorts of things go on in the timelines which are still alive? Keep in mind, from this perspective I've made every /conceivable/ choice from the most wild and reckless to the most mundane and uninteresting. The only consistent thing about my actions is that I don't die from them. So there's a timeline where I take a flight to Russia, grab a gun, and invade as a one-man-army. If it's even theoretically possible that I carry it through without dying, there's a timeline where exactly that happened. I don't know /why/ I'd invade Russia on my own, but by the nature of branching timelines I end up deciding to anyways.

But, if we're talking about reasonable actions, ones that more fit what I'd know about myself... well, basically I can do anything with a high chance of dying and see it through. Now, I don't /normally/ find myself in situations where dying is any possibility, so I'd have to find those myself.

I'm not sure precommitting to anything would help, since the nature of the timelines mean that I'd choose not to kill myself as often as the timelines where I kill myself, which never happened. I mean, I think I'd still /try/ it, and there would be all sorts of timelines where it appears to work and timelines where it didn't work, I decided not to kill myself, and end up in jail or with both legs broken at the bottom of a cliff or something.

But then again, this is just a slight limiter on the perspective in which every possible event happens. We're already dealing with timelines where I turn communist and manage to depopulate Australia and ones where I get a job in economics and retire safely and happily. The butterfly effect means that slight divergences in the timelines create significant differences years down the line, so it's sort of like Murphy's Law, extended. Everything that can go wrong, has gone wrong. Everything that can go right, has gone right. Everything that can go nonsensical, has gone nonsensical. Everything has happened and almost no event except me dying has been spared.
