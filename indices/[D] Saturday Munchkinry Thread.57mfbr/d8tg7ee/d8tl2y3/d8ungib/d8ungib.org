Also it depends on how strong of an advantage is considered an "exploit". For example, if someone discovers that a certain good is cheap in own town and expensive in another, he can "exploit" this by buying it in the cheap town, carrying over to the other town, and then selling it for a higher price. But this requires the effort of loading up a cart and traveling back and forth, which we eventually call a job and label him as a "merchant". Is he actually munchkining the world? Or is he just providing a service in exchange for money? It probably depends on how much he's actually profiting compared to the effort. If he's making a reasonable average person's wage then it's probably just a job, but if he's making money 100 times faster than everyone else then we might consider him a munchkin.
