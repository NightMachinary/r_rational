Great question! I have thought about it few months ago and came up with these symptoms of exploitable system:

- Vague definitions
- Unspecified quantities
- Math mistakes
- Legal mistakes
- Arrogance of the opponents (One needs to understand the system much better than its average user)
- Difference between needs of the system and its requirements.
