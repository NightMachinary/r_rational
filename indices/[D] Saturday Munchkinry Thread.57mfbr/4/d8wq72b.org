You have a perfect instinctual but non-quantitative feel for the physics of the universe. You don't know the laws and don't have a model, but if someone says "This neutron just split into an electron and a proton" you get the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_decay#.CE.B2.E2.88.92_decay_2][feeling something is missing but don't know why]].

This power cannot be turned on or off. Studying physics-based subjects can feel uncomfortable and wrong, the more so the less the model you are learning.matches reality. You have no special skills improving self-awareness, so you may not be reliably aware of when and why you feel uncomfortable.
