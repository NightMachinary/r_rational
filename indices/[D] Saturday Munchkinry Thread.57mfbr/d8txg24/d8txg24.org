Reverse Munchkin: You have to kill a person with a very acute danger sense. As soon as ill will is directed towards him, he becomes aware of it and every relevant thought of the plotter. This man is currently employed by the US government as a bodyguard.

Note that by reading this, he has become aware of you and will know every thought of yours relevant to this mission. He is already alarmed and is likely on his way to contacting his superiors.
