Camouflage that changes abruptly into a meme (whether a physical "costume" or chameleon skin.) Sneak in front of news cameras and abruptly transform, I'm bound do go viral.

Not sure if this counts as changing my "skeletal structure", but a detachable body part could have a similar effect if timed right in the middle of a live broadcast.

One thing that definitely /doesn't/ alter the skeletal structure is a big ol' hole in the torso. You could probably do something exceptionally gross with that.

- Start an internet meme encouraging other people to copy them, or try to.
- Unlimited as in I can get any modification, not just surface stuff, or unlimited as in I can get appearence mods as often as I like?
