I've played every main CoD except for the first one. MW3's campaign was silly (more so than MW2, which in turn was sillier than MW1, which was actually pretty realistic). The other campaigns have ranged between silly and forgettable, although they've had good moments (e.g. there's a neat space sequence). I actually liked Advanced Warfare's campaign until the end - it started off as a good futuristic extrapolation before falling into boring (and irrational) tropes.

Multiplayer's a different story. I never got into any of the WWII-era MPs (including World At War), but the other games have had increasingly good MP. For reference, my favorite FPS MP was Deus Ex, due to how your character "leveled up" during gameplay with super powers. CoD has essentially gained this kind of system, albeit without the ridiculously awesome powers like super speed and friend-or-foe vision. Each MW, BO, and Ghosts consumed probably 100 hours of my time each, and I get addicted to non-Hearthstone games very rarely these days. Great maps, great progression systems, etc. The exception, unfortunately, was Advanced Warfare. I really, really wanted to like it, especially due to its movement system, but they removed Dead Silence, the perk I absolutely love. (Silencing your footsteps makes you sneakier, which is nice, but it also allows you to listen for others, which is almost like having X-ray vision. I enable it ASAP in every game and I always play with headphones.) After realizing this, I lost interest quickly. Hopefully BO3 (Treyarch) will be a return to form, since AW was Sledgehammer. We'll see.
