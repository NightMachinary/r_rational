Says [removed] for me. You might not have much luck since proving consciousness is a bit difficult. Disproving would be more practical, but given that there is brain activity that also might be difficult. Frankly I hope someone can disprove it, because I find it deeply horrifying. Hence writing a story about it (also it fit my criteria for a reveal that was not supernatural and was more horrifying than the mystery).
