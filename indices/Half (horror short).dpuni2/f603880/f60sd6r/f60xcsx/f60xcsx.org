I remember reading a book some years back (a brief Google tells me that it was "Peace On Earth" by Stanislaw Lem) in which the narrator had had his brain bisected in a bizarre accident. In his case, each half of the brain retained control of half of the body; the narration was carried out by the left brain, since the right brain couldn't talk (but was clearly still active, since, among other things, it would pinch the bottom of any blonde the narrator passed - which got the narrator slapped about half the time and his right-brain twin slapped the other half the time).

I have absolutely no idea how accurate Lem's description of the two halves of the brain were (or even were intended to be) but if you can find a copy of the book, I can heartily recommend it; the protagonist remains same, merely unable to think in certain ways and with half his body under control of someone he can't quite communicate with.
