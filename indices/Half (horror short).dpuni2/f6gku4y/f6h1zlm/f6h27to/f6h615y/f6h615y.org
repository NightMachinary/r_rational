The isolated hemisphere is the more damaged one (since that is where the seizures are originating). So it would be expected to have less function than the connected one, but exactly how much would be case by case. The peri insular functional hemispherectomy leaves pretty much the entire isolated hemisphere intact. It is still alive and active. The procedure seems to be safer and have better outcomes than the more destructive alternatives.

  Overall, peri-insular hemispherotomy can be viewed as a radical hemispheric tractotomy, resulting in a completely disconnected hemisphere. Advantages include shorter operative times, a less stormy postoperative course, and better anatomic preservation of the operated hemisphere, thus presumably reducing long-term complications.

I don't see any particular reason it couldn't think, though this story does portray a very 'cogent' remaining hemisphere.
