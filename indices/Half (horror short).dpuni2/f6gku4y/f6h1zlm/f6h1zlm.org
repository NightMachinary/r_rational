Terrifyingly I believe it is indeed possible. In researching this I found that postop eeg and ecog indicate continued activity in the other hemisphere. The brain can be quite amazing at recovering, even in cases where it is more than half missing.

On the other hand this procedure is typically done in children with a significantly damaged hemisphere, that may not be capable of thought. Plus I'm not a doctor so who knows.

It does make for some really strange and difficult moral and existential questions.
