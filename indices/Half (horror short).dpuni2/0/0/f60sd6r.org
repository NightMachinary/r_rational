Heh, I usually can't stand when narrative style tries to reflect the insanity of a character. In most cases it just makes the description incoherent and painful. So it may be less likely he would verbalize his thoughts like this, but as a story about his thought process, entirely from his perspective, I'm not sure how to convey that properly otherwise. Probably a better author could do so just with images. But to take your comment seriously, I'm no neurosurgeon, but from researching this procedure I think this capability within the plausible range. The brain typically has distributed capability, and can recover remarkably well. Keyword: Majority.
