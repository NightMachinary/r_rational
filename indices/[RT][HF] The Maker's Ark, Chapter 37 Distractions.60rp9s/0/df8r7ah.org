Life on the edge of information overload, and a bit of foreshadowing of the next book.

This is a more 'rationalist' chapter than most, and shows something I think is useful to remember: You don't always have the luxury of knowing which details are important to the particular puzzle you're trying to solve, which are unimportant, and which are important, but to some other problem entirely. Life can happen from all directions.
