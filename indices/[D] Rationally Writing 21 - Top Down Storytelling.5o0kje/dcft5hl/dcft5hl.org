I shamelessly love Avatar, and it has nothing to do with the visuals. I understand that the message is transparent and the film doesn't do anything new with it, but I just got so invested in the story and characters. Something about it clicks with me, I can feel the passion and effort put into the movie. I won't pretend it's a masterpiece, it isn't, but it's one of the few films I've watched multiple times and enjoyed it just as much each time. The comparisons to Fern Gully are fair, but I will defend it as a better story because it talks about how people interact with each other more than the environment.
