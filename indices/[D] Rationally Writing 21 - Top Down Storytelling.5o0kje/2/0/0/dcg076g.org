I honestly like the villains. The general was a charismatic jingoist personifying military toxic masculinity, and the performance sold me even if the character was shallow. The executive wasn't all that great, but he came across as someone who genuinely didn't want to fight the Na'vi and regretted making the call that he did. The mercenaries, on the other hand, I will not be defending since even /if/ they were an accurate portrayal of imperialist armies I still lost all empathy for them and that hurt the conflict.

I admit Robocop did social commentary on corporations better, Princess Mononoke did the war of humans with nature better, and Nausicca and the Valley of the Wind did war between humans in a hostile environment better all because of antagonists that we could understand and empathize with as people (I'm referring to OCP in Robocop, not the psychotic executive and sadistic criminals). Maybe Dances with Wolves did colonialism better too, but I haven't seen it.
