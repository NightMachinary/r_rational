  The sneaky war benefits RR/SL much more than ZZ, so they should burn the whole playbook and use a hammer instead of a scalpel.

Yeah, this seems like the most obvious course of action. Enough hints and tips given to the right people could easily create an environment where any sort of plan to free Parthanax is at least in the short term, totally unworkable, due to heightened security and paranoia.

Zorian wouldn't even have to work too hard at it - as a mind mage he could easily just edit the memory of the information into people most likely to do the most harm and leave himself out of it.
