I was wondering about this too. I know Zach doesn't have a good opinion on the Crown of Eldemar. Zorian doesn't either albeit in smaller dose (his disappointment when finding out Eldemaran army refused to destroy Sudomir's well of soul comes to mind). But those are not really a downside. Are they worried the crown and the church tracked them down so that they will no longer has semblance of normal life afterward? Are they still wary about how Red Robe manage to snatch the dagger without much fanfare implying him has close relation to the crown?

edit: ah, I just read the lengthier comment below discussing this.
