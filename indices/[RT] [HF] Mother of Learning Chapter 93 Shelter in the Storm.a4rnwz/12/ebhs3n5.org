The 'real world' chapters continue to deliver. The conclusion of the in-loop arc was underwhelming because it was essentially a long list of magics ZnZ accrued. Booooring, save for the occasional gem here and there. I think nobody103 felt it too and rushed that arc to a conclusion ASAP. We skipped several /months/ in a single sentence.

Now? Now the story dedicates two chapters to a single day, and Zorian is communicating with real people again, and that's the thing that made first 2 MoL books so good. Ibery, Byrn, Nochka... man, these are the names we haven't heard for a looong time.

tl;dr SQUEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE MOL IS BACK BABY
