I doubt it.

The main reason to do that would be to fool Z&Z and she would know that any mental defense adequate to repel a mental sucker-punch from Zorian would give away her disguise by their presence.

Confronting Zoian and pretending to be original Silverlake dealing with an uppity kid without adequate metal defenses, is not a gamble Silverlake would take as she'd expect Zoian to at least check that she's not pretending with a quick mind-probe. Even if she thinks he might be too ethical to try that on a stranger or a friend, she knows he isn't above doing it to an enemy and she did juts betray him.
