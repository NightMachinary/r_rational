I think I figured it out. The first time, he stayed in Ibery's compartment to whole ride, was joined by an annoying group of girls, started heading for the nearest exit as the train neared the station, and met this girl there who said pretty much the same things she did this time.

The next month, when the train got to Korsa and he knew the giggly girls were going to get on, he left for a different compartment and so didn't end up near that girl when he went to the exit. The next time he tried finding a compartment he knew would be empty, but found that if he sat there to start with, Bryn would join him. So after that his usual routine was to either start in Ibery's compartment and leave for a different one at Korsa, or start in the other compartment so Bryn would distract Kirielle.

This latest month is, I think, the only time he's been in Ibery's compartment all the way to Cyoria since that first month.
