Speaking of people we haven't seen since the first loop, was that girl Zach hung out with along with Neolu ever mentioned again? I just happened to notice in Ch 7 Zach tells Zorian that Neolu is the only other person who believes him, which seems... odd. Did he somehow, suspiciously, forget about her?
