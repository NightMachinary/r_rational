My best guess at the moment is that it's just a red herring and a troll by nobody. I'm pretty sure their only other appearance was in chapter one and they fulfilled their narrative purpose by giving Zorian an excuse to exposit about magic. I guess it is kind of strange they were literally never mentioned again considering how stuffed with foreshadowing the early chapters are. If it's not a red herring my best guess is they were soulkilled by Red Robe after that initial meeting for some reason. It seems unlikely that these unnamed first years are Red Robe so that's my next best guess. It might also just be a subtle nod from the author that Zorian has forgotten some details from the first loop that will come back to bite him later and nothing about this girl in particular.
