To have Silverlake still so springy at over a century may skewed my expectation. You see, lately I have been thinking about Silverlake. Does she have a younger body now, what is she doing, why Zorian still haven't had any contact with her, that sort of question. Y'know, thinking about her so much might be a sign I'm falling in love with her.
