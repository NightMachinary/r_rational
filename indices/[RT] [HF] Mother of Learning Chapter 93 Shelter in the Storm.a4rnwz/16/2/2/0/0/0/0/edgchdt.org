A decade of hellish training much of which was spent in a time dilation chamber making it closer to two decades doing nothing but train with no monetary concerns allowing him to fund experimental research, study with the very best teachers, and learn the most powerful secrets mages would otherwise never teach. His time in the time loop is probably worth most other mage's 200 years outside. ZZ regularly go toe to toe with Quatach-Ichl despite him having what is probably the most powerful magic item in the setting and a thousand years of experience. Don't underestimate Zorian, there is nothing in the story to indicate that he is a magic neophyte. The dudes above expert level at everything except for medical magic and alchemy and he is still pretty damn good at those.
