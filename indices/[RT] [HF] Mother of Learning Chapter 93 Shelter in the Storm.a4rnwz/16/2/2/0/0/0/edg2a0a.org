Here the core of my argument, "Archmage power is highly tied with his/her experience."

See the latest feat done by Quatach Ichl. Zorian want to intensify time dilation chamber from the already impressive thirty days to outrageous 6 month. Quatach Ichl previously had little idea how it could be done, but as he given complete research note he accomplished it in less than 2 weeks *(!)* That implied that he had experience so rich he could understand everything in a single read.

Xvim wouldn't be that hard to kill if he had not practiced his plethora defense magic for years.

Without experience, archmage is not that good. Zorian had about a decade experience with his mind magic, you can safely multiply it to 3 decades worth since he often used it in life-or-death situation. That makes him unparalleled in mind magic (like Silverlake in alchemy). But what about his warding expertise or his dimensionalism expertise? Those are only backed by less than a decade experience.

Therefore, by argument I presented, notion from magic neophyte like these:

#+begin_quote
  ... describes him as the kind of archmage that makes other archmage jealous
#+end_quote

is irrelevant.
