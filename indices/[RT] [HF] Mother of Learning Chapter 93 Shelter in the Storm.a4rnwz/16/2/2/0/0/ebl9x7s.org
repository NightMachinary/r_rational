I think you are underselling Zorian here. When Zach and Zorian first meet up Zorian describes him as the kind of archmage that makes other archmage jealous. We know at this point that Zorian's shaping skill is better than Zach and it's implied by the text and outright stated for a few of his skills that Zorian is now better than Zach at a lot of fields outside of combat magic of course. I'm pretty sure at this point in the story Zorian isn't just an archmage, he's pretty high tier among archmages. The only other ones we have met though are Qutach Ichl who is the most powerful mage in the story and Xvim who Zorian definitely outclasses in several areas at this point. I expect Zorian to be within the top 10 mages on the continent at this point. I would be surprised if he was outside the top 5.
