Imagine time looping for so long and you know how the loop is going to end. Like playing pokemon on repeat. Suddenly your playing it for the last time with a multiplayer option, with stakes so high that your feeling frustrated due to being unused towards uncertainty. Zorian confidence and moral probably have taken a huge blow. This was reflected so well with his somewhat negative thoughts and mood. The character development is insane!

Edit: instead of saying his being negative, it feels like his being visibly uncomfortable out of the time loop.
