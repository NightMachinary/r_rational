Why do you think that RR ever found the entire key, or that he ever possessed any pieces besides the dagger? The Gate was open to begin with. He didn't need to collect the entire key to unbar the path. And he would most likely not hesitate to sacrifice dozens of lives in a ritual in order to gain soul sight, even if he somehow failed to find an alternative method to obtain it like Zorian did. So why do you think that he has any idea of the location of any of the artifacts other than the crown and the dagger, or that he has a method of traveling inter-continental distances like Zorian?
