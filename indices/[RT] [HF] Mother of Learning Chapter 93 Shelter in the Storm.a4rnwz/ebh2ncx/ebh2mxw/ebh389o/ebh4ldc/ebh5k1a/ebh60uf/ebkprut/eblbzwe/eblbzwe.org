Because it seems counter productive to underestimates him, if nothing else, SL definitely knows all of that, and probably much more, it was established early on that she is nosy, and she likely tried to find out as much as she could about Z&Z while in the time loop, possibly even using Mind magic on the other temp loopers while Z&Z weren't around. So we shouldn't underestimate them, overestimating is a bad thing too, but not as bad as underestimating.
