Silverlake probably knows where the pieces are and at least some of the methods Z&Z used to get them.

Even if Z&Z never trusted her with the information directly (unlikely, as they would not have been able to keep her cooperation if they appeared to be shutting her out of important conversations) and she never participated in any of the recovery quests, it would have still been impractical to completely obscure when in each loop Z&Z begin having each pieces and what resources they take with them with and where they go just before that point.
