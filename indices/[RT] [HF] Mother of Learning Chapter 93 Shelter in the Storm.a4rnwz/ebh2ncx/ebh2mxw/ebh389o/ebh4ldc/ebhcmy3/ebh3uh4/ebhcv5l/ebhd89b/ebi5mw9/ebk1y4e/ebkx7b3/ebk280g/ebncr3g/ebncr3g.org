I thought it was implied that using the gate as an alternative was only discovred by the cooperation between the cultists and the black room researchers and require the cumulated research done by Z&Z and the temporary loopers.

RR probably never reproduced that particular think tank. He would have lacked the motivation to do so (already had a viable plan he just needed to optimize in the ritual), several of the skills Z&Z used to make it happen (notably the mind magic, and dimensionalism skills to turn the orb into a black room), and the background research much of which was done by people we have no reason to believe RR ever met.
