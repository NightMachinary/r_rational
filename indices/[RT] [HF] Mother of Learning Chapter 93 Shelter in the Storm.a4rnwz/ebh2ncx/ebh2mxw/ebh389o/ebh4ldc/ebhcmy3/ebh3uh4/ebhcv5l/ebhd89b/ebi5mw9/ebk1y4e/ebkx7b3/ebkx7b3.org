The Sovereign gate had contingencies such that if a primordial was freed inside of it, that iteration would be destroyed and a new one made. We've seen this happen, in Ch 52:

  Above the Hole, and presumably on the inside of it, space shuddered and writhed, distorting everything like hot summer air. Slowly, jagged black threads started rising into the air from the depths, zig-zagging through the air and occasionally forking offshoots.

  They were cracks, Zorian realized. Reality was breaking.

  Suddenly, a huge volume of space in the center of the cracks simply... caved in, creating a pitch black hole that hung in the air. Something huge and dark brown, like a hand studded with mouths and eyes, shot out of the rip in space, but Zorian didn't have time to study it much. Without any prompting from him, the marker on his soul suddenly activated and everything went black.

  He woke up in his bed in Cirin, with Kirielle wishing him a good morning.

So Panaxeth has been freed inside the loop (the usual way with the shifter children, not using the Sovereign Gate, but the result would have been the same), but it didn't help him at all in the end.
