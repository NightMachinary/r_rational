Oh I imagine the reason for not seeing the vampire girl is twofold. First off her appearance was orchestrated by Red Robe, we don't even know if she participates in the invasion without RR's intervention. Second she was a complete non threat to Zorian even when he had been barely looping. Even if she was around it's plausible she is never mentioned because she is completely irrelevant and Zach or Zorian could dust her in seconds.

For the dancing, that never comes up because Zorian never agrees to do it anymore. He only did it at the beginning to get on Ilsa's good side and not have Xvim as a mentor. Without that motivation he has no reason to waste his time with it.
