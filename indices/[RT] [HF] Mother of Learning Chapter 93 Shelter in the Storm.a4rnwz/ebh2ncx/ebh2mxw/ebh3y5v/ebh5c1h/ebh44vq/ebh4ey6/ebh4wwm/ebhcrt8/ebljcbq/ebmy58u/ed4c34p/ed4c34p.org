Her name was Jade. She tries to turn in an assignment late that time that Zorian was a TA/apprentice for Ilsa. During the soulkill loop, she's at the dance at Zach's house. She and some other girls approach Taiven and Zorian to interrogate them. It's just that after Arc 1, when monsters start attacking the city because the Aranea are removed from the loop she was one of the students that was pulled out.

It's unlikely Zach forgot about her, and I don't think she believed him or anything the way Neolu did- they were just friends in that loop.
