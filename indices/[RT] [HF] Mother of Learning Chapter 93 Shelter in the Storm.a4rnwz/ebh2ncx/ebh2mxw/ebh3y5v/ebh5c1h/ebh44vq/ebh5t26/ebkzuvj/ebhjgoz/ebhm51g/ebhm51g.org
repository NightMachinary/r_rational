I don't think that is possible. There is no way Silverlake would have been impersonating this girl on Zorian's first loop and if she wasn't she has no way of quoting the girl verbatim after replacing her. It's just unnecessarily convoluted and ineffective to boot. Even if she was a diabolical sleeper agent she didn't even learn anything, Zorian gave the same answer his non loop self would. It also just occurred to me that if she had any form of mental defense Zorian would have immediately noticed and there is no way Silverlake runs around without one of those.
