Huh, good point. If I recall, I think Ibery's compartment was the one the girls usually ended up in, and Byrn usually ended up sharing a compartment with Zorian if he picked the empty one. I can only assume either bringing Kirielle along, or maybe also inviting Byrn in, meant there weren't enough seats for the whole giggly girl group.

I really doubt the first year or any of the giggly girls are Red Robe, though.
