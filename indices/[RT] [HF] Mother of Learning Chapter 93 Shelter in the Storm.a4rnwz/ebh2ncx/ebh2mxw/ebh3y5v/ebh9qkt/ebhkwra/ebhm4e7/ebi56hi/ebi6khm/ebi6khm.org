Interesting theory, which generally follows my line of thought about RR - it can't be Veyers but is probably someone connected to him. It has to be someone more knowledgeable in magic whom Zach foolishly told about the loop, but it offers some specifics /who is it and how they are connected to V./ Off the top of my head, I can't name anything that contradicts it outright, which is refreshing.
