yes they exist. they've existed for a long time as you can see from the records and usage. the Sulthrom definitely couldn't have been told in the loop to pass on the Ring, and QI definitely didn't only stumble upon the crown during the loop. or the Ghost Serpent having an undying hatred for past users of the gate, or the research facility having the gate and studying it. so...........

not sure what you mean with the Russian nesting dolls considering we know exactly how the loop works (inside Panexth, recreated and destroyed repeatedly)
