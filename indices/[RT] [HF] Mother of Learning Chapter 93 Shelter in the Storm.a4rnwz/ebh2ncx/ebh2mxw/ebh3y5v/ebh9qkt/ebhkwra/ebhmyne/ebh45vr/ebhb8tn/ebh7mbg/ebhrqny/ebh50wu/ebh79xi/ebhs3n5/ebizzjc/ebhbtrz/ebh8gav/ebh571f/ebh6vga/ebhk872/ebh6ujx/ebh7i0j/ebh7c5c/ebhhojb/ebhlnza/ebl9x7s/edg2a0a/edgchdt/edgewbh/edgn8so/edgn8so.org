Did you just call me a naive fanatic for disagreeing with you about a fictional character in a Reddit thread after you replied to a comment I made three weeks ago? I could level the same criticism at you pretty easily. I regret to inform you that Zorian has referred to himself as a skilled archmage many times, not just an idle thought at the beginning of the story. If you want to bring the real world into it 20 years is more than enough time to be considered an expert in a discipline but it's not the real world so that's beside the point. At this point the only two mages we know for sure are better than Zorian are Zach and QI. He's shown expert level skill in many magical disciplines throughout the story and the only mage that consistently outdoes him is a 1000 year old lich. He can even use Xvim's defensive techniques to the level of skill where he casually backhands extremely dangerous magic projectiles which when first introduced shocks QI. Sure QI is a better mage, he's 1000 years old and he's the most skilled archmage in the story by far as a result. Despite this Zorian can fight him. You can't fight someone like that with some tricks, Zorian would have to have a deep understanding of the many magics he uses in such a fight, anything less would get him killed. That's not really your argument though. Your argument as far as I can tell is that you seem to think that such ridiculous growth would not be possible in the real world so he must be merely a trickster neophyte with no real knowledge. Sorry to say that's not backed up by the story at all and it doesn't really matter what you think is possible in the real world, This is literally magic we are talking about. The author goes out of his way to spell out through Zorian's narration and the various characters reactions to his ridiculous skill that he is an archmage among archmages. As there isn't a single piece of evidence for your claims I am going to believe the text over your skepticism.
