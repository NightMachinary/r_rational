Was it stated whether there are high ranking cult members that have children in the age range of Veyers? If they had, they would be good suspects for Red Robe as it would explain:

- Their fast accress to a red robe
- Zorian not noticing anything unusal when scanning the minds of the members themself
- The height of red robe
- If they were in a parallel class of Zach he would have told them about the time loop. Or maybe they only knew Zach through Veyers. That would explain why only Veyers is missing from Zachs memory
