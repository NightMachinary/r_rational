If you recall, the discussion thread for last chapter had a lot of people saying she would get out of helping Panaxeth by simply abandoning her new body that will die if Panaxeth isn't freed and hopping into a different one, either her own or someone else's. I thought of a couple reasons why that might not be possible or be more difficult than we expected, but by then that discussion had long since died. They weren't specific to that chapter anyway, so I just posted them here instead.
