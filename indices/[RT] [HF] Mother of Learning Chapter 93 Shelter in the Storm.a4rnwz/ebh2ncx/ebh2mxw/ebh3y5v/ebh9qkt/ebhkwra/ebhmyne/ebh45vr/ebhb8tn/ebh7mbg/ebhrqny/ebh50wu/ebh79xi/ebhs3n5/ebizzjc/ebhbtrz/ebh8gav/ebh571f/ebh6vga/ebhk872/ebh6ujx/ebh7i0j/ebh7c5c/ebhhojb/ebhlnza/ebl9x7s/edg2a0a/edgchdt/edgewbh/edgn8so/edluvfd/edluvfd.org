Oh gee, this gonna be long. It's going to be nerd-geek distinction argument, which is pretty worthless. Please do read on only if you have inclination for a reconciliation.

I'll start with a retrace. You said 20 years is enough to be considered an expert in real life. Heck I would even say a single decade is enough. My mantra (LOL mantra), "A single year of solving real-world problem makes you decent, a decade of facing ever-changing problem makes you an expert."

But I said Zorian has *less* than a decade worth of experience in magical field other than mind-magic. Didn't he lived around 12-13 years in the loop? (6 years by ch 66). So, if Xvim definition of archmage to be heeded, which is more or less "outdo a specialist in their own field," Zorian had only exceed specialist in mind-magic field. He's equal to the specialists in others. Well, I missed spell formula which I suppose worth two or three decades of experience (same "life-or-death situation as multiplier" argument). I admit I was mistaken on that part. This correction, as the result, makes Zorian had 2 field that exceed specialist. He's a definitely an archmage. But our point of contention is never whether or not Zorian is an archmage. It was whether or not Zorian placed among the top. I said he's a fledgling, you said he's maybe at the top 5.

The word of neophyte to refer Zorian seemed to ruffle your fur. I stressed you must consider when he said the "made other archmage jealous" notion. I said he was still a regular 3rd year student, his world view is not accurate in the slightest. Yet, you ignored this. Why? On one hand I started to think that you take everything stated in the story at face value (mark of fanaticism), on the other hand, I might be mistaken in my initial believe (because you said you're not a fanatic). So I retraced.

Turns out, that notion was stated by Zorian when he reunited with Zach, ch 53. Clearly I was mistaken. I first thought he said that when he witness Zach fighting Lich, before he started looping. Turn out what he said at the time was "throwing spells like throwing candy," more or less. So I give you that, Zorian is not a neophyte.

But even at that time, had Zorian already had accurate view on what an archmage can do? Let's note his dimensionalism skill. He hadn't able to cast a gate spell. He was not even aware the micro-gate spell (first witnessed it when he's under Xvim 'serious' tutelage). By the time he already mastered gate spell, he still can't cast the micro-gate spell (note his remark about Quatach Ichl micro-gate when they raided royal treasury). See? This explain all my skepticism. The magical field in MoL is deep. Even when he's perfectly capable of doing something (that chapter 53 again), there's still many thing hidden from his understanding. Even at the field he seriously pursue. That's why I said he's a fledgling. A fledgling among the archmages is powerful no doubt. But let's not hastily note that powerfulness as a top 5 or something.

On that note I would like to bring this to your attention, Quatach Ichl may had lived for a thousand years. But did he spend that thousand years finding ever-different problem to hone his expertise? Indeed, I'm a skeptic idiot.
