At the end of the chapter Zorian is talking about a big advantage, all they have to do is notify the authorities and the enemy plans are in trouble. Since thats obviously a major problem for the invaders, and would remove a lot stress from the month. We know that won't work in Zach and Zorians favor. So we have to ask. Why? Why won't the authorities help as Zach and Zorian think they will. Is it just that they won't be able to convince Alanic without the loop being ongoing and the spiritual plane being cut off? He is important as he is usually the one that gets the authorities involved. Or maybe Silver Lake has already killed him? Really since he was so important he should have been higher priority for Zach/Zorian. That said I don't think thats the reason it won't work out.

​

I think the problem lies with Red Robe. All the times Zorian involved the authorities in stopping the invasion was after Red Robe left the time loop. Because of this, its hard to predict what power Red Robe will have in being able to stop the authorities from getting involved. Which ties into my main theory.

​

Red Robe is a member of the Monarchy. This gives him excellent position to not only prevent the authorities from listening to zorian but perhaps the ability to make Zorian and Zach outlaws should they try to "stir up trouble." Plus if he comes out to discredit them, they will have a much harder time getting support from their typical allies (Xvim and Alanic).

​

My theory is based upon the fact that Red Robe has the dagger and uses it to soulkill with. It is located in the treasury of the royal family. No one else could get it without causing an uproar. In the restarts when Zach and Zorian just attempted to break in to the treasury it made national news and started a manhunt that would chase them all over with the divine tracker. I think had redrobe gotten the lich to help him take the dagger we would have heard about it. Further red robe didn't have an easy way to teleporting to another continent like Zach/Zorian did so he would have been harassed by the authorities trying to get it back. The easiest way to avoid this problem is if he could simply walk into the treasury and take the dagger and walk out with it.

​

Now for some wilder speculation:

​

I also think its possible that Zach tried to involve the royals near the start in the time loop. The royals were friendly with Zach's family and stole his families artifacts and we know they were interested in the sovereign gate as they were having it studied by their researchers. Since they get involved at the start. They can order the people in the research facility to help zach figure it out and figure out how to bring more people into the loop and modify markers etc. Its possible they could have even played a role in getting it activated.

​

Even more wilder speculation. Maybe that's how Zach got pulled into the time loop to begin with? My thought is his soul marker is part of his bloodline. And they couldn't get the gate to work and in the summer between school years they had Zach working with the researchers trying to get it to work. I'm just trying to remember if the time researchers ever saw Zach's real face. Usually he had disguises on. If that latter part of the theory was right they would recognize Zach if they saw him.
