I honestly always thought of Ilsa as a bit younger than that, Zorian states that Imaya is 'twice his age' so about 30, and she was in the same calss as Ilsa, so it's safe to assume that Ilsa is also around 30, and I assumed Kyron was a similar age, maybe a bit older, my guess for Xvym is late 50's early 60's, similar with Zenomir.

Edit: honestly I imagine the teachers in the series are probably similar ages to any actual highschool teachers (anywhere from early mid 20's on) anyone can teach something if they understand it well enough, and they don't need to be incredible mages to do it.
