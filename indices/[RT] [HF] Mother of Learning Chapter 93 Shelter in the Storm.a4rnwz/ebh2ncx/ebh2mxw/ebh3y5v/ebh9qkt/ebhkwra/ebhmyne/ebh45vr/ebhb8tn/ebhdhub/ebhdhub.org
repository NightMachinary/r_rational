I honestly don't think RR having the dagger at the very end of a single restart is enough to theorize that he is a royal, we have seen that it is possible to rob the royal treasury without too much uproar form Z&Z's later successes, if RR knew that he would need the Dagger to soul cut out a possible time travelling threat at the end of the loop then he would be able to preemptively get the dagger earlier in the restart, this is further supported by the fact that he didn't immediately use the dagger on Zorian in the next restart, he didn't even have a simulacrum.
