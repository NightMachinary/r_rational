in a generalist sense maybe. as Scytelian mentioned, Zorian is said to be Elder lvl. because do remember a few things that probably keep matriarchs above Zorian's skill lvl. mind magic is their default communication method and as natural as breathing and done since they were born and used every moment of their life. aranea can live to 50s, and even just 30 is above Zorian's lifespan including the looping (not to mention 15 years without Open status)

they were also a *lot* braver about messing with their own minds. Zorian had to slowly do it and in a safer manner. they also had a lot more freedom of responsibilities to devote to it, further widening the gap of time involved. tho in the end, the stealing secrets from multiple webs probably helped boost Zorian's understanding and ability to learn, the higher willingness to mess with their mind is probably the most important thing separating them from Zorian
