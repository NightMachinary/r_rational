I wasn't arguing for the Zach killed Silverlake theory, I find the idea surprising and don't know any arguments for it.

I was just pointing out that we don't have strong reasons to believe the gate was barred, or if we did I would like to know them.(There is the argument that they would have noticed while working on the gate, but I hold the opinion that expecting magic to behave sensibly is a losing bet.)
