Yeah, it seems more like the events in this chapter are a purposeful attempt to contrast to the first (or early) chapter(s). There are multiple things that are mentioned here that only occurred in the very first loop. As to practical reasons for the electives, matching his behavior before the loop is a way to avoid notice. Who knows how many loops Red Robe went through with Zorian before he ever woke up? Obviously different events will lead to some anomalies, allowing for some deviation in his actions, but matching his previous behaviors in the easier simpler ways is worth doing if there is no cost.
