Having another continent you can get to instantly, that your opponent can't is never a bad idea. It also contains a strong seat of power that's aligned with his brother and the imperial orb. Getting through the gates is essentially their key to having access to the entire planet instead of the small fraction of it they can teleport to quickly.

Also, I'm of the opinion that the angels are already very much aware of what's going on. They wouldn't have told Xlotic to give up their ring otherwise. The time loop was intentionally started early, with at least the angels knowledge if not by their hands. Presumably it occurring just before the time when a primordial prison was going to be opened is intentional, to raise a force capable of preventing it.

As to why the others haven't been brought in yet, it's still the first day. It's possible that messengers have already been sent and haven't been mentioned, for brevity, and the other party simply hasn't acted yet. Most of the other characters take several days or even weeks to come around. Another possiblity is that all of Zorian and Zach's simulacra are currently focused on amassing resources and attacking the most critical enemy power bases before they have time to move. As discussed, the other members won't be willing to act decisively immediately.

Edit: I'd also like to think that Nobody is purposely putting off showing the other characters, because one of them is actually Red Robe. I think that'd be a neat twist. It's probably not the case, but I think it would make for some interesting drama.
