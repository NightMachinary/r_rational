What I mean, is that it's all a facade. Zorian made it clear that worse comes to worse he can still stop the invasion by informing the government, and now that Red Robe is aware of his existence - with Silverlake lurking somewhere - he cannot fail to notice that the original plan isn't going to work. So on the surface he continues the same preparation pretending that he's still going to invade the place, but he's clearly isn't trying too hard at all.
