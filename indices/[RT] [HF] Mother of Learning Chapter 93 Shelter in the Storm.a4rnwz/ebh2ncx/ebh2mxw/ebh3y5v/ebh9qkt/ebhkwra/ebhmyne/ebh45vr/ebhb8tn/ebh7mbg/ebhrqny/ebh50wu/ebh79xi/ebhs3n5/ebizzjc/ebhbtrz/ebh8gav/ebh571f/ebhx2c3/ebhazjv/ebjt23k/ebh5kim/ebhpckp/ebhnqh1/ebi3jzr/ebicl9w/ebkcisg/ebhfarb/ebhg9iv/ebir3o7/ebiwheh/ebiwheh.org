It's pretty much what he said. Silverlake obtained a new body. His theory is that this girl is Silverlake and she asked Zorian to perform magic in hopes he shows some magic he should not be able to perform, therefore confirming that he managed to escape with his knowledge intact.

This is unlikely because Silverlake doesn't need nor it is her MO to put her in such close proximity to Zorian, well, ever. She can scry from afar. She probably just monitored some key places, like her own house. Zorian's simulacrum went there, boom, she knows Zorian escaped.
