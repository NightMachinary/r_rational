Is it actually confirmed that the loop happens inside Panaxeth? Is it not possible that the Sovereign Gate itself is a primordial, that the looping universe is happening within that unnamed primordial, but that the Gate has to be connected to a different primordial (Panaxeth, in this case, but it could also be any other primordial in the vicinity of the Gate) to gain the energy it needs to function?

The alternative is, as you said, that the Gate is a divine item that connects to a primordial and which forces a soul within a world created inside the trapped primordial without its consent.
