Unlikely. Remember how excited Tinami was when she was introduced to the aranea? Can you really imagine her just killing them all instead of at least trying to recruit them?

Zorian being Red Robe was brought up before. As far as we know it's not physically possible. How were they both in the loop at the same time? If Zorian is Red Robe, then when he gained a marker, he would have replaced the Zorian who is our main character. As far as we know, it is not possible to add anything to the loop template, only remove.
