The start of the time loop isn't wrong; Zorian just always slept through it before and this time he was awake. The other divergences can more easily be attributed to changes like the Noveda mansion being attacked. Also I think at this point most of the differences between Zorian and his simulacrums come from them knowing they won't have to deal with any long-term consequences. At least, that's what Zorian was thinking about this chapter. We know Red Robe can't be a simulacrum because those don't have their own soul, which RR would need to get a marker.
