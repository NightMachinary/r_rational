On the changes in the real world compared to the time loop Soriano hit on some good ideas at the start simulacrum so are not exact compiles and tend to diverge, the initial copy of the world wasn't perfect with small changes in people that may mean conversations are a little different. With subsequent restarts the world is copied perfectly. As noted there were several things wrong with the start of the simulation such as wrong start of time for the loop. This could mean that red robe exists because of a glitch at the start a change or divergence in a person resulting with red robe, I get the feeling red robe is a divergent simulacrum.
