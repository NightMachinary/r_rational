While Red robe being a member of the monarchy makes a lot of sense I doubt Zach had much involvement with royals due to how much he hates them, and even if he did not know about the theft before the time loop, I kind of doubt he would fail to notice that they stole stuff from him if they tried to get him involved on something hereditary. There is also the fact that Zach is something of a public figure, and I doubt Zach would not have had someone remark on him constantly vanishing for periods during the couple months before the time loop after having looped for about for 35 years(I think. It is at least over 30 years).
