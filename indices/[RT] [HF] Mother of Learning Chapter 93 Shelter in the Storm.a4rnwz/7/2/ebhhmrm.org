The biggest obstacle is probably not RR, but the head of the cult, who is also the head of the mage guild. ZZ haven't trained scenarios to involve the gpvermment, so revealing everything has a chance to backfire.

That said, I still think it's better to involve the government, but just a bit later, when they have Alanic and Xvim on board.
