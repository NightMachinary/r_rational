Ever since they said the monarchy took the sovereign gate from Zach's family I've had the theory that the monarchy hacked the sovereign gate and inserted their own agent (red robe). They didn't realize that Zach, being the original heir of the gate, automatically had the marker. Since then there's been the revelation of Zach's divine blessing, and the ransacking of the gate research institute which found nothing along these lines. So that weighs against this theory.
