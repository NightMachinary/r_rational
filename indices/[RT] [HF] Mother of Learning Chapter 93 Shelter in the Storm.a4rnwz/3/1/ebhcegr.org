Right, and Silverlake knew about the loop exit project, and so presumably doesn't know Zorian is the only one out. Same for Red Robe, to a lesser degree: he knows at least one person other than Zach got out, and last we heard he thought there was an entire army of time travelers and skedaddled. If one person escaped, then maybe more got out the same way.
