Aside from us having only the datm that Zorian and Silverlake acted the same way as their default after supposedly exiting the loop, is there any evidence to think Paaxeth was telling the truth about exiting SIlverlake, vike resetting her marker? I thought the argument that it was a ruse to blackmael Zorian int mind-raping Zach was compelling, but I have not seen any facts to support one verses the other.

Note: Zorian assuming SIlverlake is out there make complete sense to me. From our (/rational) perspective this makes sense in a limited AI's gambit (can't prove a negative) playing the AI box game but from Zorian's perspective: Silverlake is probably out there
