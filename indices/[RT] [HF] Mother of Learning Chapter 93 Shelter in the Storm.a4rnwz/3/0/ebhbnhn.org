Silverlake is without a doubt being cautious, I don't remember if she ever saw them fight but she knows they are very capable and that they may have access to some of her secret without her knowing. Plus she probably received a new body, younger and might try to adapt to it. And she has no reason to act aggressively for now: since she knows Zach and Zorian will actively try to prevent the invasion, she needs to find an other way to summon Panaxeth, more subtle than invading Cyoria.

As for Red Robe, he left the loop way earlier thinking there was an army of time loopers after him, and he doesn't know how much time they spend in it as you mentioned so he won't do anything too bold for now imo.
