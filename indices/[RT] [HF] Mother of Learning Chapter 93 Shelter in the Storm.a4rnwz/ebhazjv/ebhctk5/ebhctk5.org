Do you have any evidence for this? The things Red Robe has been doing (attacking Zach, attacking the aranea, defending the cranium rats, evacuating Jornak, Veyers, and cultists and getting them to change their warding schemes) all seem compatible with planning an invasion. From his perspective, what's the cost of trying? Even if it ultimately fails, it gives Zach and Zorian something to think about other than just keeping the primordial contained. At worst it exposes his identity, but I don't think he considers that likely.
