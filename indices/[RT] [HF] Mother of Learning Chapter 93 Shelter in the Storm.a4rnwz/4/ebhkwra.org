By the way, someone in spacebattlesforums came up with a pretty consistent theory regarding RR. [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/mother-of-learning-discussion-thread.349206/page-109#post-52987276][Link]] and transcript:

  After a few years away from the story, I just did a full reread over the course of two days. It's been a fun couple of days.\\
  My big thing to near-necro the thread for? I think I may have figured out the identity of Red Robe. Strap in, this is going to be a wild ride. I'll try not to sound like a conspiracy theorist. If you don't want spoilers, I don't know what the hell you're doing here at the end of the discussion thread. Go read the story.\\
  My theory rests upon a central point: Veyers was possessed by another soul before the loop even began.\\
  There is some evidence that points to this. He underwent a ritual to fix an inherited power, and came out the other side with new power, a tendency for wild mood swings, and a loss of control of his magic much akin to a recent large modification to his soul, much like the difficulties Zorian has a simulacrum entirely devoted to keeping under wraps in the recent chapters.\\
  Based upon the nature of the ritual (his inherited power), I believe it likely, but not guaranteed, for this soul to be an ancestor of Veyers. Possibly a soul who had been part of the house wards, much like Murder Mansion. I'll be referring to him as Ancestor from here on.\\
  Everything from hereon assumes this is true, and some later events add supporting evidence without directly corroborating it.\\
  This possession would mean that there were two souls in Veyers's body when the loop was created and they were recreated the exact same way. Eventually, Zach's habit of trying to convince a large number of different people that he is a time traveller bites him in the ass when Ancestor takes advantage of him to find a way to join the time loop. It's likely that Skeletor was involved at this stage for the required manipulation of the temporary marker.\\
  However, something goes wrong for Ancestor. He's possessing Veyers, and the mark is applied to either Veyers alone, who he must piggyback off of in order to loop, or to the both of them as a "conjoined" soul. I believe /something/ must have gone wrong for Ancestor, otherwise soul-killing Veyers would not have been necessary.\\
  Let me explain that thought. Veyers wasn't anyone incredibly special. He's a minor noble with attitude and inheritance problems. He's no insurmountable obstacle, like the soulkill spell was originally intended for. Veyers must have been looping in order for soulkilling him to have been necessary. Otherwise, killing him and letting the loop take care of any problems and knowledge he had or was cause of would have sufficed.\\
  Enter the primordial's offer: He specifically offers to create a body for someone outside of the loop for them to take in exchange for his release. They'll die if he is not released. This provides two-fold motivation for Ancestor as Red Robe's obsessive perfection of the invasion: Both his literal resurrection and his escape from the time loop rely upon it.\\
  Ancestor as Red Robe also explains Red Robe's unusual surprise at a mage with firearms-- he'd literally be from a time where that was unthinkable.\\
  Ancestor not having full possession of his control marker also explains why Veyers was soul-killed when, or perhaps well before, Red Robe left. If he left Veyers's body before leaving the loop so he could get a body of his own, then the control marker might have been left behind on Veyers. In that case, /not/ soul-killing Veyers would mean he would leave a looper behind with full knowledge of his identity, possible weaknesses and nature, a massive grudge to nurse, and years to prepare to unleash a holy asskicking on him, should he also find a way to leave the loop---or take a suicide deal with the primordial.\\
  The main reason I believe this theory is true, or something close to it, is it's the only reasonable explanation I can think of for:\\
  A) So much evidence to point towards Veyers-as-Red Robe.\\
  B) Veyers definitively not being the culprit due to Soulkill.\\
  C) Someone going out of their way to Soulkill someone as seemingly unimportant as Veyers. If it was ever a common solution to a problem, there'd be way more of them popping up.\\
  Apologies if I've explained my thoughts on this poorly. I'm a bit lacking on sleep after marathon'ing the story for the last two days.
