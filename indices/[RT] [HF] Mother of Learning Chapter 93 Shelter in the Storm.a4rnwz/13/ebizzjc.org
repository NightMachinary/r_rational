So this is now two updates in a row with Silverlake seemingly not having done anything to help Red Robe. It almost feels like the author is setting up a reveal that she /didn't/ make it out of the loop, but that would be kind of anti-climatic. I think this is a red-herring.

Here's my thought instead: She's out, but she isn't working with Red Robe. She's off doing her goals her own way, and she'll show up at the last minute with some completely convoluted plan that no one was expecting. What would this mean? /Red Robe, hypothetically, still might not know who Zorian is./ In their last in-loop encounter, Zorian was careful not to leave a body, and then Red Robe apparently departed without searching him out. Outside the loop, Red Robe attacked Zach immediately, but didn't go after the less-defended Zorian. Combine that with the fact that Zorian has accidentally set things up such that he's going to blend in at school more than he does in the average reset (the non-dupe is the one going to school, and he's keeping his magic use low for various reasons), and we might have a scenario where the first one to discover the other's identity is going to "win".
