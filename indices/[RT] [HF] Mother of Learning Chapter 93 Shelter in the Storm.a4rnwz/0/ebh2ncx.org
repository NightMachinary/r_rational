I love how perfectly this story properly represents this subreddit. You have a time loop as an advantage, but so do your enemies, so each character acts as their own entity, and you get really interesting conflicts.

Munchkining does not work out great if both people are doing it. If your plan relies on taking advantage of a "super obvious weakness" then it probably is not a real weakness and your plan probably will not work.
