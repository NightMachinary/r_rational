do remember that Silverlake and the rest of the cast were probably informed beforehand about the absolute number of loops left and that Zorian only reasonably had less than 1 left unless breakthrough. with possible confirmation from Panexth. so in terms of loop experience, she doesn't really have anything to fear in that regard, especially when Zach already has so many years of loops under his belt, what is a few extra months worth do anything when he's reset to no co-loopers and almost guaranteed to be repeating the same loops that he's already done?
