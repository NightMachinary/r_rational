Very good point about Silverlake's body. She would have no reason not to ask Panaxeth for that, since he was creating her a body from scratch anyhow. Imagine if that body ended up being identical to the unknown woman's appearance took when talking to Z&Z. Anyhow, this is likely to be an unknown advantage that'll bite them in the ass.
