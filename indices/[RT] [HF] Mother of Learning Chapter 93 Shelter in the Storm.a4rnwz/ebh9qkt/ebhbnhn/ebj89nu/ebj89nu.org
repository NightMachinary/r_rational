Don't forget also that Silverlake is not wantonly destructive, just self-interested. She will almost certainly try to release Panaxeth, because it's necessary for her survival. But I'm sure that she would prefer /not/ to let it rampage around the continent. It's dangerous to her personally, destructive to the environment (surely important to a potioneer), and would make ZZ mad at her, which is risky. She's probably trying to find some way to fulfil the conditions of her deadman switch while minimising the rampage risk.
