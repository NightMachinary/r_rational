The one thing that's been bothering me about all that is, if Panaxeth is imprisoned, why does he still have the capacity to affect the real world like that? Enough to put a soul out there and make a body for it? I guess putting a soul out there could be from taking over the Guardian's capabilities, but a body?

I'm pretty sure that if he was capable of releasing Silverlake, then he did.
