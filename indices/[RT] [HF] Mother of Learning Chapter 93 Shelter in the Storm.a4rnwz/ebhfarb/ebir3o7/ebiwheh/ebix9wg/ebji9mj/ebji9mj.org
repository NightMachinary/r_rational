  Zorian picked up his bag and went to stand by the exit. The idea was to be among the first to disembark, and thus avoid the usual crowding that always occurred once they got to Cyoria, but he was too late -- there was already a crowd at the exit when he approached. He leaned on the nearby window and waited, listening to animated conversation between three first year students beside him, who were talking excitedly amongst themselves about how they were going to start learning magic and whatnot. Boy, were they going to be disappointed -- the first year was all theory, meditation exercises, and learning how to access your mana consistently.

  "Hey, you! You're one of the upperclassmen, aren't you?"

  Zorian looked at the girl talking to him and suppressed a groan of irritation. He /so/ did not want to talk to these people. He had been in the train since early morning, Mother had given him a nasty lecture because he hadn't offered Ilsa something to drink while she was in the house, and he was in no mood for anything.

  "I suppose you could describe me as such," he said cautiously.

  "Can you show us any magic?" she asked eagerly.

  "No," said Zorian flatly. He wasn't even lying. "The train is warded to disrupt mana shaping. They had problems with people starting fires and vandalizing compartments."

  "Oh," the girl said, clearly disappointed. She frowned, like trying to figure something out. "Mana shaping?" she asked cautiously.

  Zorian raised an eyebrow. "You don't know what mana is?" She was first year, yes, but that was elementary. Anyone who went through elementary school should know at least that much.

  "Magic?" she tried lamely.

  "Ugh," grunted Zorian. "The teachers would so fail you for that. No, it's not magic. It's what powers magic - the energy, the power, that a mage shapes into a magical effect. You'll learn more about it in lectures, I guess. Bottom point is: no mana, no magic. And I can't use any mana at the moment."

  This was misleading, but whatever. There was no way he was explaining things to some random stranger, especially since she should already know this stuff.

  "Um, okay. Sorry to bother you then."

  With a lot of squealing and steam-letting, the train stopped at Cyoria's train station, and Zorian disembarked as fast as he could, pushing past the awed first-years staring at the sight before them.
