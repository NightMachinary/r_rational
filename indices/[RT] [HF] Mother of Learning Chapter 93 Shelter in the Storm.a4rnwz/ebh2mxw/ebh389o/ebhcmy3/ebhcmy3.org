Panaxeth was connected to the Gate while inside the loop, sure. There is no guarantee that this is still the case. I seem to recall seeing mention that it was only this particular time that it was Panaxeth powering the Gate; that it was his turn, but that it is sometimes another primordial's turn. Whether the Gate can still be used to bridge the worlds is unclear.
