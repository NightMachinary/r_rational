  However, the cult leaders would ultimately see the light when Zach and Zorian showed them the Sovereign Gate. They did not explain to the cultists what the object exactly did, but they did tell them it was a divine artifact that contained some of the essence of Panaxeth itself... and could thus be used as a key to open Panaxeth's prison. A much better key than the shifter blood essence they originally planned to use for the purpose, too.

  Though their description was deceptive, the basic facts were entirely true -- *within the reality of the time loop*, the Sovereign Gate could very much be used as a key to open Panaxeth's prison. In fact, using the Sovereign Gate was the key part of their plan to exit the time loop. This had been true while they had Silverlake's cooperation and it was true now.
