I think this would likely require the key, which is currently scattered around the world and in the hands of some very dangerous creatures, it's possible that RR knows all of these places as he managed to leave the loop, but it's also possible that he never had to unlock the gate as it wasn't barred when he went in. This would mean going to Koth, fighting princess breaking into the Eldermarian royal volt, beating up or convincing QI out of his crown, and raiding the demon wasps.

There are of course easy ways to do a few of these but I don't think RR and SL have access to them, the angels could have visited the wasps and told them the loop is over, which makes getting the ring /hell/, they may not know how to use the dagger in the orb, I don't know if Z&Z made that info public, and they don't have Zorian's skill at Mind magic to shunt QI out of his body.

They may not need them, but their is no reason to assume that everything will go well for them, especially because they are suspicious unstable psciopaths who almost certainly don't trust each other.
