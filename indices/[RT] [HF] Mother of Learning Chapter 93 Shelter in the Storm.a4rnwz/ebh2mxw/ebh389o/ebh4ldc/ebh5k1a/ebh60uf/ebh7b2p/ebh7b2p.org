Regardless, they're not going to get the key unless QI has a ready-made gate, standing or Simulcrum-based, in Koth. The Silent Doorways adepts are already being paid by Zorian and Zach and then it's like, 30 seconds to get the orb via teleportation, considering Zorian can now teleport across the continent to drop his parents off I'm pretty sure he can straight up teleport to the Orb Cenote as soon as he steps through the gate.

No orb, no key.
