You might be right, but stating it as a certainty isn't useful for the sake of debate, and I doubt that the key piece are going to be ignored in the real world, I suspect the daggers actual function will be put to use at some point (my guess is to kill QI), and it's distinctly possible that RR needs the ring for his soul sight, though he may just have gone the quick and dirty path to get it.

My point isn't that this would be the only obstacle, just that they will be facing obstacles of their own with their tasks, no matter what they are, they have to try and guess what Z&Z are doing at any moment as well, though SL has a better idea of it than RR.

It's also distinctly possible that they aren't working together.
