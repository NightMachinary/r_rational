I agree with you. However I have the feeling that almost all possible characters are weak from a storytelling perspective, if I don't overlook any. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9x7kcg/rt_hf_mother_of_learning_chapter_92_the_scramble/e9qkb8l/?context=10000][This comment]] list some possibilities and the likely ones are those we don't really know.

Who do you suspect?
