Waitaminute there, physical combat is half strength half technique. You can definitely learn technique in-loop. What Zorian can't have in loop is strength, which is tied to muscle build. Taiven once taught him physical combat, his two classmate Estin and Naim once challenged him into it, Zorian just wasn't interested to follow through.
