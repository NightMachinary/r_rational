Well yeah, Zorian is likely a better mage than most if not all of the schools teachers at this point, the only ones that could probably give him a run for his money are Xvym and maybe the principle (who we actually have yet to meet), who are likely much older than the average teacher like Ilsa and Kyron.

Honestly I wouldn't argue a statement of Zorian likely being one of the best mind mages alive, barring Aranea, and he is even at the level of some of their elders.
