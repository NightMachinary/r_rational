In chapter 28, Zorian specifically thinks that she looks 90 and probably dyes her hair black.

That said, it's possible her black hair is actually a result of partial success from her experiments in making a youth potion. Zorian also thinks she is "spry" for a woman of 90, which is also probably a result of her potion-making or alchemy.
