An actual apprenticeship is likely the highest form of education, the idea is for them to specialise in school and then finish and pursue work in their field, if they excel or just catch someone's eye then they get an apprenticeship, in which a much more experienced mage, like one on Ilsa, and Kyron's level teaches them them their personal skills, which they then carry on in their field until they are ready to pass them on as well, all the while researching and experimenting in their own choice directions.
