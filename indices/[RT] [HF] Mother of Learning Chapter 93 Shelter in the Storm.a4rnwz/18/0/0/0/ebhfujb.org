I see. I agree he's definitely going to try something else as well, but I still think you're underestimating how much even a failed invasion helps Red Robe. This is a game of choosing the right priorities because of time constraints, and I believe stopping the invasion will take more effort from Zach and Zorian than it costs Red Robe, even if they get the government's help. Plus, I don't think it's actually guaranteed to fail, from RR's perspective. We know the cultists can attack and release the primordial on an unexpected date, they'll have demons, and the city tends to underprepare even when informed. Really, if it weren't for narrative reasons, it could go either way. As for Red Robe's main priority of releasing Panaxeth, the biggest weakness I see is that the summoning must take place at a particular location already known to Zach and Zorian. He can't just move it, so he needs to defend it, and having most of Cyoria's defenders stopping the invasion instead of the summoning seems like a good start. The only other thing I can think of would be to perform the summoning before starting the invasion, but that sort of thing is hard to hide, which is why they normally do it during the invasion in the first place. As for clearly not trying, I think that's just what RR being cautious looks like, unless I missed something.

Edit: I think I underestimated the chance of ZZ actually getting the full might of Eldemar to help, and also had forgotten about the last few paragraphs in this chapter.
