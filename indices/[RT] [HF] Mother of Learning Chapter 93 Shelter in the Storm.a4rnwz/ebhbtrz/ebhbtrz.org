Good, Zorian rescues Notchka's bike! That's honestly one of the details I was most concerned about, since I knew it was coming soon. I half-expected him to get it without Kirielle so Kana would end up happier, but this way works too. And Notchka and Rea are conveniently outed as shifters so Zorian won't have to pretend so hard, as a bonus.

Now all that remains is to see if he's careful not to be so nice to Kirielle that she thinks he's been replaced. Plus the whole Red Robe and Silverlake thing, I guess.

After rereading the whole thing yet again for the 6th time or so, I've concluded that Original!Silverlake is probably safe since she was already good at soul magic and loop!Silverlake won't be much better, at least not by enough to force her out of her body (without resorting to some sort of trickery, anyway), and also because Silverlake was mentioned as one of the few temporary loopers who would probably be fine with leaving their old life alone. I don't know how easy it would be for Silverlake to just take someone else's body either, since there's been mention of rejection issues that normally plague possession attempts. Of course, if anyone can overcome that, it's probably her. But anyways, because of all this, I've concluded there's a non-negligible chance Silverlake will actually try to release the primordial.
