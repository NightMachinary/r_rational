Since both sides have SG experiences, ZZ's biggest advantage is the state/church, which are much more powerful than the invading forces. It's the opposite of their SG role, but they might be better as support/backup for the authorities now that RR/SL are on to them.

The sneaky war benefits RR/SL much more than ZZ, so they should burn the whole playbook and use a hammer instead of a scalpel.
