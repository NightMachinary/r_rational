Guys I figured it out! Bryn is clearly Red Robe. No other explanation accounts for him knowing about the attack on the Noveda estate so quickly! He's helping the invasion of Cyoria as an indirect way to murder Briam, so that he can be the sole owner of names that start with Br and end with some sort of nasal consonant.
