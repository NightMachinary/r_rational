Ok, time has been applied. There are multiple members of House Boranova with an ignited bloodline at the same time. We know this because it was unplanned that Veyers's father died without igniting his bloodline, and it this doesn't make sense if doing so made the previous ignited person somehow lose their powers. So, how would that work? Is there more than one Ancestor? If so, why do they all seem to give the exact same ability?

Also, no matter whose soul the marker goes on, how can soul-killing Veyers be necessary? If he does that, he has no body. That sounds like strictly a loss to me. Panaxeth can make a new body for someone outside of the time loop, sure, but we have no evidence he could do that for someone inside, at the start of every loop. And if they could just hop into a different body, why have they been limiting themselves to those that go through the ignition ritual? The way I see this playing out, he keeps Veyers's body alive until he reaches the Sovereign Gate and is about to exit, at which point he has no reason to soul-kill Veyers because he thinks the loop reality is about to be shut down anyway.

Edit, one more thing: All ignited members of House Boranova have slitted orange eyes. Briam's fire drake has slitted yellow eyes. This seems like too much of a coincidence for the explanation to actually be some sort of soul thing. I think the bloodline most likely came from an enhancement ritual involving a fire drake or other similar creature.
