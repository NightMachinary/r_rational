It's good to see Zorian isn't completely unaffected by his time in the loop; it's very humanizing.

No sign of Silverlake is concerning. Is there any risk of RR/SL trying to break out the primordial early/setting things in motion before the invasion? I'm not sure whether the dimensional magic boost provided by the planar alignment is a requirement for that.
