I don't really see the point of attacking Cyoria while there is a rampaging Primordal flying around jacking shit up. The sensible thing to do would be to let him rampage and then mop up whatever is left after he moved on. Zero risk to you and your enemies are likely to be almost completely crushed before you even make your move.
