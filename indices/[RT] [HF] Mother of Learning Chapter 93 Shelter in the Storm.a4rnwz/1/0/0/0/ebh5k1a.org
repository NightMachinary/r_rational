You don't need the key to use the Sovereign Gate to connect to Panaxeth, just to unlock it as a portal to reality when inside the gate.

Panaxeth is directly attached to the thing, and if you need to open the gate to get at him, then it's useless because only The Maker and his Agents can activate it and thus open the gate to the inside, as they did for Zack.

Point is, there's no need for RR to get the key.
