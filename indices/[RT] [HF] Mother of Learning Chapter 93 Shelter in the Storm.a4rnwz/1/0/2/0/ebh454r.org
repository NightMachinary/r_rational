The closer you get to the alignment, the easier breaking Panaxeth out becomes, because dimensionalism magic gets stronger the closer we are to alignment. But they're not using shifter children anymore, they're using the sovereign gate, and everything is easier with that divine key, perhaps easy enough to do it weeks before the full alignment.
