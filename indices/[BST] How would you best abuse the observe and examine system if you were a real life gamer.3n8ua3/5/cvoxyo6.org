Get examine to a high level through grinding it doing other things in this thread. Look in a mirror. Examine self. Use the information to find my biggest flaw/weakness and get a numeric measurement of how bad it is. Try one thing after another to try to improve the numbers. Optimize, munchkin, /cheat/..... move on to the next weakness. Gradually become more and more awesome.
