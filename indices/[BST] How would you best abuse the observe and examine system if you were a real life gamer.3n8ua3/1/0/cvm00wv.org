I would generally say that if you examined a doctored image it would say this is doctored. Your right about the uses thing in my mind it would be the most obvious and useful uses first with specific and less useful ones later, with a hard cap on the number of uses displayed based on skill level. This of course brings up the question of who is deeming what is useful or not, which I have no clue. Gaia I guess lol.

Unsure about the computer thing an easy fix would be to say you could never have that high of a skill level to know it, but this is of course all hand waving.

I would say in general the less complex the problem the less skill you need to have a specific diagnosis, someone with obvious cold symptoms could be easily identified as having a cold, but if its some obscure complex thing it will require more skill, perhaps more than you could ever achieve in your lifetime.

Were trying to make stupid video game powers logical so unless I wanted to severely nerf the powers (which I would if I was writing a gamer story) I have to just make up stupid shit to make it work. The point of the exercise is to basically find out what I need to nerf and see how hard these vague things can be abused.
