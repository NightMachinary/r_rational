This is subject to one of the exploits also used for the inventory version: what's an item? ("I pick an item consisting of a visible spot connected to a one molecule wide corridor connected to a center section".) What if I want to pick, oh, the tumor in someone's body (plus the one molecule wide corridor) and I don't know exactly where the entirety of the tumor is located?

How do doctored images work? If I have an image of a bald man with hair photoshopped on him, does it work? What if I have an image of someone deaged? What if I have an image of someone that is deaged, /and/ that happens to be byte for byte identical to an image of the person actually taken at that age? Do the results I get depend on the history of the bytes?

What does it mean to get a report on something's "uses"? Anything has a near-infinite number of types of use and probably different numbers of each one, unlike a video game where an object only has one use. Do I get a reading of "1000 uses of this sword to kill things with, 100 uses if I use it to break glass windows, and 1 use when the use is melting it down for scrap"?

"Imperceptible" is a vague term. I can see a computer, but I can't see its program. Would I be able to gain information about the computer that depends on what it's programmed to do? You probably want to answer "no" to this, but you can't answer "no" without excluding a wide variety of things that you would probably not want to exclude. I can't see microscopic threads in my shirt, but those microscopic threads may affect how long the shirt lasts; am I unable to get information on that?

More generally, concepts like "item", "imperceptible", "uses", and such don't really divide reality at the seams.

Also, I would ask if the difficulty of finding information through this system exactly matches the difficulty of finding it without. If not, that can be used for exploits. It's hard to diagnose a disease or a fault in an engine, but the window may say "has disease X" or "engine with broken piston". Or "prime number".
