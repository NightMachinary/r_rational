I would say it becomes harder to identify things that are further from current human knowledge. I'm not saying you can't identify a disease no one even knows exists yet, just that it would be harder (aka require more skill level). The same with an item, in the future a certain material might lead to some sort of super fuel that would change the world, but you probably couldn't identify that particular use.

In The Gamer manhwa there's Gaia who gives these sort of powers but doesn't want to break the universe too much or advance humans too fast, hence it becomes harder to observe things that are father from human knowledge. We are pretty much using The Gamer rules for this system and unless you want to nerf the power you have to have some sort of external force limiting you like in dungeons and dragons you can't just conjure gold.
