  I would say in general the less complex the problem the less skill you need to have a specific diagnosis

Trying to pin this down, I think you mean something like "A disease is 'more complex' if given a set of symptoms produced by the disease the probability of the disease is still small". That still doesn't work because whether something is a symptom depends on whether you know about it. We know that some diseases produce high temperatures; we don't know that some diseases produce "positive result on test X, where X will be discovered tomorrow". Are both of those symptoms? And if not, what happens the day after tomorrow; does your window now start showing the disease because there is suddenly a symptom we know about?

Likewise, if you mean "a disease is 'more complex' if it requires more tests to determine that you have it", how many tests it requires depends on which ones you give first, how expensive they are, and how rare are the other diseases you have to exclude.

In fact, "hard to diagnose" or "more complex' are a lot like "item", "use", etc. Whether something is hard to diagnose depends on circumstances; it isn't a fact about the world like "the square root of 2 is not a rational number".
