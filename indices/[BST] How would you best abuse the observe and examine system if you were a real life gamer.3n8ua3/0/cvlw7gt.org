If you're starting out with a small amount of money you can use your skill to go to garage sales (and other things where people sell "junk") and buy things for cheap that are actually antique.

I can't think of higher value example of where you can leverage information you know, but other people are uncertain of, to make money. I'm guessing this skill wouldn't really work on the stock market. I'm guessing this skill also doesn't work on lotto tickets (or at least probably not at the level where your easiest way to make money is shopping around for lotto tickets).

After that you can likely use your skill on people to build a company of dependable people. I'm not sure what field, but it should be something that you can use your examining skill early on, but also something that you can hand off to others eventually.

In a previous thread someone mentioned the Randi prize, this would also be a good idea for getting starting capital, but information is harder to leverage if everyone knows you can do it.
