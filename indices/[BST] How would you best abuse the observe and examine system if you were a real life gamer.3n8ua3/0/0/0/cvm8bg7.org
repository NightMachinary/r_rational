This was my idea as well, which is why I think this is the most powerful power so far. The item power could make you a great smuggler or thief but with this power just by identifying where gold, gems, ore etc is you can easily become the wealthiest person in the world.

You could start a mining company (after you use the power to work your way up to a couple million bucks of capital) and find all the best people to run it. Then go around and start analyzing cheap land people think is crap. You'll soon find mines of all different kinds and then just buy the cheap land and start mining the crap out of it. Repeat and become the worlds richest person in a couple years. Best of all you can analyze your protection, friends, workers, and business associates to make sure they will never betray you. World domination isn't an outside possibility if you can leverage tons of money + knowing peoples weaknesses and strengths.

Wonder if anyone can exploit this power more than I already have?
