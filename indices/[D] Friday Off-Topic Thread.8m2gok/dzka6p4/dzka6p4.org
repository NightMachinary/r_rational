So I got around to reading Crystal Eternity this week, and was rather disappointed. The first two books were just so good, but the last one was a let down. No spoilers, but the whole first part with Zephyr was annoying after the reveal, Ro is silly and completely changes the hard sci-fi aspect that I liked, and then at the end various realizations that characters have are never explained to the reader, so I'm left wondering what is actually true and what is merely characters being wrong. And not in the interesting way that Inception did it. Really wished that the story had played out differently, or that the way in which the story was presented was done so more clearly.

I also started reading Dungeon Keeper Ami, and dropped it at the end of the first page of the story only because nothing interesting seemed to be happening. Not really sure why [[/r/rational][r/rational]] recommends it going off the first couple thousand words, because none of the characters seem to be rational or even particularly smart. They're not dumb, but they don't seem to be using the magic system in an interesting way, and the magic seems extremely easy to learn. There's one bit where the main character is trapped with a monster blocking the exit, and she learns and casts a teleportation spell to summon one of her minions as she is reading the spell. If she can do that, there really isn't any way for the reader to know what abilities she has, because she can learn any ability she has in a book on the fly (she can read any book in her library remotely). Despite this, when I stopped she still only knew a single offensive ability, the one she started with. She spends an enormous amount of time trying to make a better minion when she could have spent the same amount of time learning to become a walking natural disaster, when she knew that there were people coming within the week to kill her.

Will probably read some nonfiction now, as the last two novels haven't turned out great. The Worth The Candle update was amazing as usual, so that makes up for some of it.
