I agree that things can be disorienting reading fanfiction without knowing the premise. I didn't know much about Sailor Moon. But it was a fanfiction done well - the author took the premise and expanded in the world building beautifully while staying true to the spirit of the baseline. If it's creative application of her abilities that you were looking for trust me you wouldn't be disappointed.

Wait till you see her combining science and the keeper abilities. It is honestly the best creative munchkin fic I have ever read - without going into spoilers.
