Okay? Then the mechanics of the game make for a horrible story. As of the part I stopped reading at, she looked to be able to learn almost any spell she had the description of in seconds, and can cast it adequately on the first try. She can read any book in her library with only a small delay. In any situation where she is challenged, I as the reader have no way of knowing what spells she can cast, nor the limits of them, because she can almost literally pull new spells out of a hat. There can't really be tension, because at any point she can learn to teleport to arbitrary locations, or learn a new combat spell, or a better healing spell, or whatever. Her potential abilities are basically unbounded save for her mana capacity, which makes it pointless to speculate about how she could use her existing abilities to solve a problem because she can at any time learn new ones.

When she travels to the underworld and gets betrayed by what's his face, it was dumb for two reasons. First, she knew a single combat spell, and what's his face knows that she knew only that one. Any counter to that spell means she is worthless in a fight, and she got saved through a Deus ex machina. She was only in that position because she was the exact opposite of a munchkin and never bothered to learn any combat spell in her possession, when she knew that she was heading to a hostile location, and also that people were coming to kill her soon.

Second, it was dumb because what's his face chose the worst possible time to betray her. He could have waited a single minute, walked over to her, broken the possession thing, and killed her when he was a yard away, instead of giving her adequate time to prepare for his coming. If you want a rational character to be challenged in any way, you have to give them at least mildly intelligent opponents, otherwise the plot and tension just fails.

If the story follows Dungeon Keeper canon, then that just means the canon wasn't well thought out, or that it makes a horrible setting for a story, because it's too easy to overpower anyone if you have a modicum of intelligence. It's an abject failure of world building, but passing the blame into someone else.
