It's not that I'm unfamiliar with the source material, although I am, it's that the world presented so far makes magic too easy to learn, and the main character's failure to capitalize on it is anathema to some of the major themes of this sub. She obtained a bunch of books from a powerful necromancer. Afterwards she learned a possession spell, started trying to make a golem from imps, and then went on a risky journey while physically incapacitated, and without her normal ability to teleport to safety, without having ever learned more magic. It's just dumb. If she had learned an additional two combat spells, so that fighting didn't consist of her freezing things over and over, or some movement ability, it would be fine, but she didn't.

Being creative with abilities is fine, but she should first be smart with them.
