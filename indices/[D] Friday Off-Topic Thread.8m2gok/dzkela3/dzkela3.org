I've been thinking about popularity recently, in part because I found myself working on a short story (or maybe novella, or since brevity isn't a strong suit, maybe an actual novel) that takes place in the same universe as /Shadows of the Limelight/ (where fame grants powers, if you haven't read it, which statistically you probably haven't).

The question I've been mulling over, mostly while watching a toddler throw rocks into a lake, was "how do people become widely popular". Here are the general answers that I came up with, which I think with some editing I can map to major characters in the story I'm working on:

- *Slow grind:* You put in the work, hone your craft, and grind out a following. I don't think you even have to be /good/, so long as you're good enough to retain viewership/readership/attendance. You stick around long enough that people eventually check you out, and some of them stick around. It's rare for you to have full-on fans, but people are aware of you, and being everyone's fourth or fifth choice can bring a greater popularity than being first choice for a small group.
- *Lackey:* You ride someone's coattails. /They're/ popular, and some of it rubs off on you. They plug your stuff, or if they don't, then the simple fact that you're always around them makes you popular by association. If you're both creators, then maybe people go to you when they've burned through everything the more popular person has made, because you're close to each other, and though your stuff isn't quite the same, it's a substitute that /sort of/ scratches the same itch.
- *Influencer*: Someone known for having good taste, or maybe just with a lot of reach, tells everyone to check you out. A graph of your popularity shows a sharp spike, and if you're good, then you hold onto that audience. Probably before the moment raw influence touched you, you were in the slow grind, but the influence lets you skip years or even decades of slow growth. (Also under this umbrella would be the *Big Break*, which might be getting signed to a record company, a contract with a publishing company, or a spot on a big variety show.)
- *Virality*: Almost the same (and probably overlapping with) Influencer varieties, but much more grassroots. I sort of think that there's a tendency for this to not last, but I'd be pointing mostly to one-hit wonders as an example, and it's definitely possible to transition from a viral sensation into more normal popularity, even if there's a bit of a "lightning in a bottle" phenomenon.

(/Shadows/ runs on fame/infamy, rather than popularity, which is different, but the thing I've been thinking about is mostly /popularity/ as a distinct but overlapping concept.)

I think there's probably something missing from this framework, and it might be "Power", e.g. becoming popular because you're initially well-known for reasons other than popularity (e.g. CEO or king), which offers an easy transition from "people know who you are" to "people like you". I think it's good enough though, and probably useful for creating a cast of characters.
