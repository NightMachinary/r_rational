I think that just having a measure of power is not sufficient to achieve large amounts of popularity. Take for example members of Congress: the vast majority of the population probably couldn't name the senators or representatives of their respective state despite the fact that these people are directly responsible for relaying the opinions of their constituents.

On the other hand, any president and vice president of the US are generally widely known by the populace. I believe the critical aspect that distinguishes them from other government officials is *uniqueness*. There is only one president and vice president at a time and their responsibilities are distinct from others and affect a great number of people which lends to their popularity.

At its roots, popularity and fame require people to actually care about the individual in question whether through a personal connection or through being affected by the individual's actions. Taylor Swift and other music artists are popular because their music is appreciated by a large number of people. This is why people who produce entertaining content are more famous than faceless politicians, because their products have a more noticeable and distinguishable impact on the lives of their fans. Nobody is going to mistake one musician's songs with another, but a big tax bill being passed can have any number of congressmen that voted for or against.
