Power isn't sufficient, but I do think it's one of the pathways to popularity; in a way, it's sort of putting the cart before the horse by getting famous and then becoming popular from that fame. A CEO can attain that position without having any particular sort of widespread popularity, then become popular because they have a lot of power, importance, and reach - which is why in this typology I would class them as being popular because of power.
