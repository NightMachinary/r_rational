In my personal semantics, fame is whether you're worth talking about, popularity is whether anybody wants to hang out with you. Maybe your popularity is negative, and people want to hang out with you in order to yell at you or punch you in the face, but /you're/ what's important.

Wildly popular people are more interesting than the rest of us in quirky ways. They inspire opinions and arguments. They make a difference. They promise the impossible, and they deliver it.

Anybody can be a little famous for a spectacular coincidence or for doing something spectacularly stupid. There aren't a lot of those folks I want to meet. The former only has one story, and the latter is /dangerous/.
