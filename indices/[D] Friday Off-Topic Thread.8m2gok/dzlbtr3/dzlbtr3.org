For anyone here that likes CYOAs, I made two!

Well, one-ish.

Reading any further, or reading the 2nd CYOA first counts as spoilers for the 1st CYOA. This matters for game mechanics reasons, although I will say the penalty is mostly just there to manipulate people into multiple playthroughs.

...

Anyways, I made BBM:BWY after a great deal of thinking about how to balance options around different playstyles, but realized I hadn't accounted for one playstyle: people more-or-less completely unwilling to give up humanity for power. I did intentionally make "stay as human as possible" a legitimately valid option in the context of the CYOA, but I found that the people that play style was geared towards would simply rather not play the CYOA.

I thought that was interesting because, relative to some of the CYOAs that get posted, the available powers are still pretty strong and diverse. Even an absolutely minimal point option can be made to be strictly better than regular human. But what I think happened is that they saw the options they /could/ be getting, if the drawbacks didn't become so brutal, and got discouraged from engaging in the CYOA. The relative success of the second thread (where the CYOA it tweaked in favour of humanity rather than power) seems to support that-- 95-100% upvotes compared to 81%.

I think this represents a broader trend that can be applied to most literature. I'm having trouble articulating it, but I think, when writing, being aware of what the "reference point" for each emotion or character is important, because when you do something with that character or emotion, that's what the reader is comparing them to.

Any thoughts?
