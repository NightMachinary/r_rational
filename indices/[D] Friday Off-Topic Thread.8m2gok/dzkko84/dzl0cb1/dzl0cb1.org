Pretty good game.

The "hacking" is basic as fuck and ramps up in tediousness rather than difficulty (run do_the_hack.exe, do_the_hack_2.sh, do_the_hack_3.py), but it makes up for it with humour.

There's a single really bizarre design decision. There's a side-quest you're given which is pretty gray, and the game outright says "This might be against your morals. Feel free to skip this quest if you don't like it." But the quest is the only way to get an item that is essential to finish the main story! What the hell?
