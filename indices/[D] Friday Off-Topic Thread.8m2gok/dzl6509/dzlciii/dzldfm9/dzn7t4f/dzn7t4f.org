I ran into the same problem. However, by the time I started reading the 4th book, I had to stop. For me, at least, it just never seemed to get significantly better.

Personally I felt that Harry Dresden and Murphy never learned anything in regards to their own state or position.

Murphy, despite being characterized as smart, never reaches, what seems to me, to be obvious connections.

But I think what I felt was most problematic was that Dresden refuses to inform people about things that place them in direct and mortal/immortal danger. His reasoning is incredibly faulty in my opinion.

Just to give you another perspective.
