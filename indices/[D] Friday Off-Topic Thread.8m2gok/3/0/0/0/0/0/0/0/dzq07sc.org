Well, to be fair, if I thought the changes were organic and natural I would have kept reading. I just remember being incredibly frustrated that Dresden would say things akin to, "Saving people is important." and then let Murphy repeatedly almost get killed because information might make her a target. It was, for me at least, very frustrating.

I don't know, you're making me want to find the books, crack open some examples and examine then to find out if I am remembering it wrong. But regardless, good talking : D
