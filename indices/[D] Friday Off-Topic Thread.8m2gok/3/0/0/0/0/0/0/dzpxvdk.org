I hear you. The thing to keep in mind is just how long the series is, and how just a few months pass between each one, usually. I wish it got to the good stuff faster so that recommending the series carried less caveats, but taken as a whole and considering where things end up, the pace and rate of change actually feels really organic and realistic.
