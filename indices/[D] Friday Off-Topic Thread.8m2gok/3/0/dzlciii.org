I'd suggest giving the third book a try. It's where I usually recommend starting the series. Mr. Butcher doesn't really find his pace until then, and while the first two books do tie into the over-arching plot important events whose ramifications will affect other books only really start to happen with the third book. Also Murphy does evolve over time.

Then again I do have the motivator about Harry Dresden [[#s][Rather metal spoiler from around book 6?]] where he's described as Gandalf with an IV of Red Bull or the like included in my picture shuffle screen-saver. The books aren't quite rational but it does have competent characters with fairly realistic motives.
