No personal experience to offer as help, but I've heard nice things about the Lonely Planet guides (see: [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30513315-lonely-planet-thailand][/LP Thailand,/]] [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18899558-lonely-planet-cambodia][/LP Cambodia)/]] --- though admittedly it'd been a while since I've stumbled upon those recommendations.

  Cambodia→Survival Guida→Scams

  #+begin_quote
    Most scams are fairly harmless, involving a bit of commission here and there for taxi or moto drivers, particularly in Siem Reap. There have been one or two reports of police set-ups in Phnom Penh, involving planted drugs. This seems to be very rare, but if you fall victim to the ploy, it may be best to pay them off before more police get involved at the local station, as the price will only rise when there are more mouths to feed. There is quite a lot of fake medication floating about the region. Safeguard yourself by only buying prescription drugs from reliable pharmacies or clinics. Beware the Filipino blackjack scam: don't get involved in any gambling with seemingly friendly Filipinos unless you want to part with plenty of cash. Beggars in places such as Phnom Penh and Siem Reap may ask for milk powder for an infant in arms. Some foreigners succumb to the urge to help, but the beggars usually request the most expensive milk formula avail-able and return it to the shop to split the proceeds after the handover.
