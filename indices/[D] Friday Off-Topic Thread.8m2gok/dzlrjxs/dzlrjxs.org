Planning a holiday.

Going to:

Thailand:

- Khao Lak
- Krabi (Ao Nang)
- Bangkok

Cambodia:

- Siem Reap
- Phnom Penh

Probably Kuala Lumpur for a couple of days because of a stopover and why not go see the petronas towers again?

Anyone have any recommendations for must-dos at these locations? Scams to avoid? Interesting stories? Anyone here a local or near enough at any of those cities and wants to meet me and my entourage?

We'll be at the above locations around 20th June - 20th July.
