(I would spoiler that first bit, just in case)

I get what you mean now. The rationality is too explicit, which is a common flaw of rational fiction. Instead of having a teacher character go "I will now lecture about X for 5 paragraphs", it's better to work the lessons into the story to make it less heavy-handed. I didn't mind it too much in this story though, but I'll admit I started skimming some of the psychology stuff near the end. The epilogue especially felt to me like the introspection and narrating distracted too much from the ending.
