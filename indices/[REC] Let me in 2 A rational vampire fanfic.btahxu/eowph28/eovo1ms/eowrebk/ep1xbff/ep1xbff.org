Alright, spoiler-free review time!

I think this is a good example of a story that isn't necessarily /good/ fiction, but is very definitely /rational/ fiction (though I'd say it's quite good too). The characters are very introspective, the protagonist is way smarter than his age, and everyone spends their time discussing the practicalities and consequences of their actions.

The story feels like an okay continuation of /Let me In/, that shows the guilt of people committing terrible actions for selfish reasons, and how they deal with it. The story analyzes their behavior in a way that's very analytical and detailed; it lays out the different courses of actions available to them, what happens if they take them, and the reasoning both rational and emotional that informs their choices.

Spoilers: I'm a little disappointed by the ending. It works as a tragic ending, I guess, but I really don't like the idea that Owen killing Abby was the right choice. They point out that as time goes on her chances to get a stable, murder-free life increase, so it's not like she was terminally ill and had to be euthanized. And if you think your friend secretly wants to die and is too afraid to vocalize it (modulo some magic personality alterations), the right thing to do is to get them committed to a hospital where they can get the help they need, not enable their suicidal tendencies, let alone /kill them by surprise/.
