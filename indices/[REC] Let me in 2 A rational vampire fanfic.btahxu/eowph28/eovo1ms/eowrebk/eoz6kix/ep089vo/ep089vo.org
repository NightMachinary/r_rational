The Swedish version is a bit more artsy, and frankly, better. So unless you're a really big fan of Chloë Grace Moretz or hate Swedish, I would watch that one. That said, the remake isn't bad, so if you're only watching it to get a better feel for the characters in the fanfic, go ahead and watch the American one.

​

Edit: Oh, uh, if you do watch the swedish version, bear in mind that one of the characters has a different gender in the remake. That might prove a bit confusing, otherwise. <_<
