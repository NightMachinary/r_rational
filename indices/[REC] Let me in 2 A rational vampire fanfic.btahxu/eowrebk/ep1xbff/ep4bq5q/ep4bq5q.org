I agree it's definitely rational (to a surprising extent, given that the guy doesn't seem to know about us), but why do you say it's not necessarily good? I'd say the writing fundamentals are better than 80% of what's popular on this reddit. I mean, he has an actual editor, a clear understanding of the genre, and he planned the entire plot in advance. Yes, his use of dialogue tags is a bit novice, and he's not a big fan of descriptions (seriously, he never even described what Abby's wings look like. Are they bat wings? Feather wings? What?), but that's minor compared to the rest. Contrast this with stories like Purple Days, which is hugely popular even though it's unreadable garbage.

I totally agree about the part in spoilers: I got physically angry when that happened. At the same time, it was entirely believable that Abby would want that and that Owen would do it, hopeless romantic that he is. And I clearly *cared* about what happened to the characters, which is always a sign of strong writing. So yeah, I think this is a case of the author wanting to carry out his genre-established Tragedy Tropes(TM), when actually I think this would have been a great opportunity for a rationalist subversion. Have Owen go "screw the tropes, I have rationality!" and find a way to fix things. I'm actually somewhat tempted to write a (short) alternative ending to this story, just for the heck of it. <_<
