[Rec] this format for recommendations. We have a pretty large number of links being posted here and even in the minority that have some sort of a description, it rarely includes any references to the point of this sub, how rational the fiction is.

I haven't read your linked fic but I'm upvoting this post regardless because even if I think the story is terrible after I read it, I'd like to encourage other people to explain why what they're linking is rational. IMO it might even make sense to just make it a rule...
