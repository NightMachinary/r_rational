Hello,

May i ask for a recommendation for an uplift or industrial revolution style book. My favorite in this style is A Heroes War, i immensely enjoy all the parts about building up the technology basis of the world. On the other hand i also enjoy startide rising and uplift war, even though those don't show the uplift part specifically, the interactions with uplifted species is always fun.
