Copying from the last time I answered this question:

Sorting by popular on novelupdates, royalroad, and the various writing forums (sufficient velocity, space battles, etc.).

Sort by number of reviews on fanfiction.net / fictionpress. If you have authors you like on those sites, I've found some good stuff by going to their personal Favorites page. (This works well on Literotica if you read smut, too).

Look at recommendation threads in [[/r/hpfanfiction][r/hpfanfiction]] and [[/r/narutofanfiction][r/narutofanfiction]] if you're into those fandoms at all.

Examples on TV Tropes' pages.

Find a work you like on Amazon and browse through the "other people bought" suggestions.

For Netflix/Amazon, there's apps like Flickmetrix.

It's been a while since I sought out anime, but I used to use Anirec.com which looks like it's now anime-planet and still has a recommendation system. People write out what they think is similar about the recommended series so you have an idea if it's what you're looking for.

Like anime, I don't read much manga anymore but I've always found the ratings on Baka-Updates to be pretty good ([[https://www.mangaupdates.com/stats.html?period=month12][stats page]]). Lotta light novel crossovers get rated highly, though.

People make some good lists on Goodreads, including top picks for genres you're fond of. The sidebar giving recommended "if you liked..." on that site has never been very good for me, though.

Can be fun to browse [[/r/booksuggestions][r/booksuggestions]].
