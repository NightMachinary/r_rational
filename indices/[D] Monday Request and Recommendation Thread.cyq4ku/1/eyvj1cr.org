Probably a bit late posting this, seeing as it's technically Tuesday now, but I figure I'll give it a shot and if I don't get anything there's always next time.

I have a few requests. The first is: What are your favorite dungeon core stories? I've read [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25361/dungeon-engineer][Dungeon Engineer]] up to the current chapter and loved it (it's what sparked my interest actually) and I went looking on Royal Road and found [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25082/blue-core][Blue Core]] which isn't quite as good but I still thoroughly have enjoyed (be warned, has some (well written, imo) sex scenes). Besides those two though, I've looked around and haven't been able to find anything that is both decent and not dead, so any suggestions you have would be great.

I'd also like stories that are focused on progression of a society. Civ builders. Focuses on tech and infrastructure and political reform and progress. I don't even know where to start looking for these, and I'm not sure I've ever read one. What I want might not exist, but I figure if any community could point me to something like that, it's you guys.
