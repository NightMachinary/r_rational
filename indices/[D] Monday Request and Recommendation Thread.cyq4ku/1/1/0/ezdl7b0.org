Thanks for the rec. I'll have to check that out.

I'm actually caught up to the current chapter of Blue core. The tentacle stuff is fine with me. I can see why you would call out consent problems, and in the real world I agree, but I think most people have lower standards in fiction. I'd probably have more of a problem if I couldn't see in both character's heads and know that they both have the best of intentions.
