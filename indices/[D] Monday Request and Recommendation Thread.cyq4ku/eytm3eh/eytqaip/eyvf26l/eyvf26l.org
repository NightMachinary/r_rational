I'll specifically endorse the method of finding one story you like, then looking at that author's favorite stories/authors. It's almost always a guaranteed way to find good stories on fanfiction.net, especially underrated gems that are too short or niche to show up on review/favorite count filters. Building up a network of author endorsements and slowly revealing how certain stories get favorited by a lot of authors you like is almost like a game in its own right.
