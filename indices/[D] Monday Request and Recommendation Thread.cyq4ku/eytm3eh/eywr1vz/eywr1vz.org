What do you recommend from MLP stories? I only seen one episode, but read some very good sci-fi crossover with MLP and want more, without any genre limitation, but still story should have some rational type qualities, or be near. For now my tbr contains 'The Moon's Apprentice', 'Hard Reset' Series and 'Seeking Power'. Sadly i not remember, what I read before.
