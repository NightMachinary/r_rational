For the first: [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/i-woke-up-as-a-dungeon-now-what-dungeon-worm.620521/][I Woke Up As A Dungeon, Now What?]] is a crossover with Worm. Taylor from post-canon finds herself controlling a dungeon in a fantasy world. It's the only one of the genre I've ever read, though.

For the second: [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/2826/a-heros-war][A Hero's War]] has perhaps the worst title of a story I've ever liked. Characterization of the main character is severely lacking for the first few dozen chapters, but fits with the rest of your requests and eventually does get better in how it tells us about Cato.
