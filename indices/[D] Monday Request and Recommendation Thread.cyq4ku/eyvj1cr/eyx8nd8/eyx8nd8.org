[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/15935][There is No Epic Loot, Only Puns]] is a great one where a girl is reincarnated as a dungeon core, but forgets absolutely everything. The only thing that she retains is her morals which includes a desire to not kill other people which is usually what a dungeon does. It gets a little surreal at times with her actions to circumvent the necessity of killing for survival and is not rational, but I loved reading about her solving her problems with friendships and the weighing of friendship versus survival.
