[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21045/the-abyssal-dungeon][The Abyssal Dungeon]] is great. Usually I have problem reading LitRPG for being too gamey, i.e. status screen and hoards of abilities, but this one fix that by not focusing on the former, and have the former deals with creatures instead of abilities, specifically ocean lifeforms! Instead of a damp and dark cave filled with ghosts & goblins, it's a colorful coral reef filled with seahorses, starfishes, sea snakes, and lots of fishes, most being a magically enhanced version rather than a mundane one. There's also aquatic wyverns, sea serpents, kelpies, etc. And as the dungeon grows deeper, the biome became more varied... oh wait, I didn't realize the "not dead" qualification. Still a good read tho, in case you haven't read it.

For the other category, [[https://m.wuxiaworld.co/Release-that-Witch/][Release That Witch]] is a very enjoyable One-Man Industrial Revolution wish-fulfillment. [[https://www.novelupdates.com/series/maoyuu-maou-yuusha/][Maoyuu Maou Yuusha]] focuses on economy, while [[https://j-novel.club/s/how-a-realist-hero-rebuilt-the-kingdom/][How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom]] focus on social reforms, both I have some problems with, but they seems to be pretty popular, so it's probably just me. The anime [[https://myanimelist.net/anime/17265/Log_Horizon][Log Horizon]] is also really great.
