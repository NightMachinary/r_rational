Yeah, 1632 is the first book, and then there's a bunch of afaik nonlinear sequels/spinoffs. I haven't read most of the anthologies, just 1632/1633 one or two short stories. In the end the side stories were a bit too many for me (though I get what they were going for, kinda a 'history is messy' presentation), but the core novels were good.
