Posting for balance:

The first 4 books felt like a particularly Republican one-man-industrial-revolution, in a "if we just give everyone enough guns feudalism will sort itself out" sort of way. It's rational enough overall to keep you going, and develops just enough balance / nuance by the end of each book to suggest a more complex world and society than first presented; but that just makes the last book feel like that much more of a letdown. Never mind the pacing shift, the tone is all over the place; I mean, seriously, kidnapping alternate-Stephen-Hawking so he can fly a nuclear submarine through the sky? If anything it just feels like the author suddenly got bored of the whole series and wanted to bring it to a swift conclusion, taking the mickey out of anyone who got much invested in it in the process.

TLDR: YMMV

(edit: for those who, after the end of book 5, liked the setting with respect to what the "gods" turn out to be, I suggest trying out Trudi Canavan's Age of the Five trilogy, which has consistent pacing and tone throughout. For extreme contrast to the feudalism will work itself out if the populace could be armed so they can get rid of the pesky nobles thing, try the Strugatski brothers - Prisoners of Power, the Kid from Hell, Hard To be God etc).
