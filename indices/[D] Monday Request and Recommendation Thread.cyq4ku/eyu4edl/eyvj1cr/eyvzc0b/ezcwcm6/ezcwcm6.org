I'm surprised no one has suggested Dungeon Keeper Ami to you: [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/dungeon-keeper-ami-sailor-moon-dungeon-keeper-story-only-thread.30066/]] There's several other places to read it if you search but SV seems convenient for multiple chapters.

It's about Sailor Moon's Ami waking up next to a dungeon heart with a computer watch and progresses from there. Requires no background knowledge, I've never seen the show and I've picked up enough from this fic alone to enjoy it. It features some fun characters, interesting mechanics like munchkinning what dungeons value vs not(cheap electricity, high value of diamonds), and is overall rational if I recall (I haven't read the beginning in forever). It is also has currently progressed to her kind of controlling her own nation and managing large amounts of citizens. It's ongoing but currently updating very slowly.

Also "Blue Core" Warning: Blue Core features coerced tentacle sex and "breeding" as a core mechanic the protagonist quickly uses. There's some attempts to call it consent but they're not convincing to me. I'd strongly recommend avoiding it unless you're into that, it appears to be a significant part of the dungeon game system.
