A long time ago I read up to The middle of Echidna rampaging in the city but I fell off of it for awhile, probably cuz I skipped Simurgh arc and therefore didn't have the necessary characterization to appreciate the Travelers. Stupid idea to skip it, but I was desperate for more Taylor.

More recently I've been reading on and off again. Currently I'm back up to Shatterbird being about to scream in like 5 minutes and Taylor needs to run real fast to save her dad.
