When I was reading the last book, I kept thinking, "I totally love this, but I could also see how it might feel like a total departure." The alternate Hawking just barely worked for me, it's a little over the top. I'd still second the recommendation of this series pretty heartily. The prose is on point, some great characterization for something like this, and the POV of a fairly reasonable person in consistently overwhelming and escalating circumstances drew me along.
