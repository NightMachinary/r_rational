  Does he use his knowledge to munchkin the magic system at all?
#+end_quote

At least in the first book, the MC seems to almost actively stay away from magic as much as possible; he only uses magic when someone literally hands it to him.

The system looks to be loosely based around D&D 3.5, but it's been modified to make things grittier and low magic - yet there's still the whole "infinite power from a Decanter of Endless Water" thing available.
