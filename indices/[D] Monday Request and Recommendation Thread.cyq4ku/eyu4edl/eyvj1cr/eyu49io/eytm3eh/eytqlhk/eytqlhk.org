I've recommended [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/129874-world-of-prime][World of Prime]] series here before, and I'm reiterating and maybe even re-doubling that rec now that the 5th and final book in the series was released last month. It was by far my favourite book in a series where every book was better than the last.

The series starts as a pretty standard portal uplift fantasy, but it differed just enough from the mean that it kept my interest until it could start setting itself apart with its snappy dialogue, tight plotting, and great, expansive setting. Unlike most of the shitty books in this genre, the story got more interesting the more power the MC got, because the world is written as being nuanced and morally complex place rather than being a simple playground for a power fantasy.

The last book blew my mind with the way that the scope and scale just kept getting larger and larger. I remember I checked the progress on the book and I couldn't believe that I was only halfway through, that there was still so much left left after /so many/ things had already happened! It kind of vaguely reminds me of the Golden Morning arc in Worm, of the final, ridiculous showdown in Gurren Lagann. Not in content or even tone, just somewhat in the sense of escalation.

The caveats are: The covers are hokey and pandering and offtone, particularly the second and fourth books. Try to get past that. The first book has bad pacing, and a very slow first act. The prices for the books are a bit higher than I feel is right for the genre and how long the books have been out. And finally, the fact that it ends so conclusively that it eliminates the possibility of a another story in the setting(this one is both good and bad).
