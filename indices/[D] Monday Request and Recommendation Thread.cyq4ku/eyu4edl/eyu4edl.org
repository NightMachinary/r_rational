I've been kinda binging on Royal Road recently and found some decent stories I think this subreddit might enjoy. In a semi-random order:

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/24709/defiance-of-the-fall][Defiance of the fall]]. LitRPG and Wuxia combined into a weird whole. Earth suddenly gets included into a cruel, callous, interplanetary gamelike System that values only strength, usually induced by adversity. Our protagonist lucks into an unusual advantage immediately, but by the very nature of the system said advantage comes with corresponding challenges.

Fairly well written overall, no major grammatical issues. Characters feel like individuals and have at least some depth to them (in spite of how it might appear at first). A fair amount of enjoyable progression porn that doesn't necessarily feel cheaty or unearned by the protagonist. Author is writing full time and updating daily, with a large backlog of chapters (that's also accessible via patreon).

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/1193/the-gam3][The Gam3]]. LitRPG. Decent writing, but nothing amazing - still better than much of RoyalRoad. The main character is thoroughly flawed and makes a lot of mistakes that are acknowledged as such. All of the characters have alright voices and characterization, but it's not that deep. I found the overall story to be rather engaging in spite of the flaws and frustrations. Is complete and has an ending I found satisfying, although it's blatantly obvious a sequel is intended.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/20364/chimera][Chimera]]. An average modern salaryman was reincarnated as a monster in another world! Except not really. It takes a long while for the human memories in the chimera to really have any effect. For the most part the protagonist has an alien, animalistic mindset that's only slightly influenced by the human memories. Essentially progression porn with no game elements. Sparse updates, but the story's still active.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21450/the-power-of-formations][The Power of Formations]]. A random peasant happens to be very talented in a branch of magic that's essentially a mix of real-life electrical engineering and software engineering except with magical effects. Lots of references to real compsci concepts, but sadly doesn't really reach anywhere near the real potential of the concept. Definitely don't take the story too seriously, but it's a fairly fun romp. Story seems dead, but the last few chapters are a decent stopping point.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21623/the-perks-of-immortality][The Perks of Immortality]]. Quite a weird LitRPG with an unusual system. The main character can gain mildly useful perks, but at a very high personal price. Much more subdued progression porn than the usual LitRPG fare. Most of the fun in this one for me was just following the poor, tortured MC finally start succeeding, as well as the overall mystery of the plot. Story updates sparsely, but it's alive.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21323/metal-and-magic][Metal and Magic]]. Follows the story of Candle, a noble girl with no magic in a world full of it, and ostracized for it. No game elements, no gamification whatsoever - reads very much like a standard fantasy novel. Good characterization, good writing, interesting worldbuilding. The magic system is not all that exposed as of yet, but the author claims to like hard magic systems and it shows. The main character has some personality flaws, but nothing unexpected from a teenage girl. I found it to be a very enjoyable bildungsroman. Story is very much alive and updates something like two or three times a week.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/20101/the-law-of-averages][The Law of Averages]]. An average salaryman is transported to another world, one with superpowers! Sorta. Another story that focuses more on characterization and plot than any sort of gamification elements, and it's all the better for it. Has some humor and wacky hijinks, but it mostly plays itself straight. Good writing and characterization. Releases once a week.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21410/super-minion][Super Minion]] in spite of the uninspired name and amateurish cover, actually pretty good (I guess it's second most popular for a reason, huh?). Another "unusually strong alien being slowly joins humanity" story, similar to Chimera. If you like one, you'll probably like the other. Updates twice a month or so.
