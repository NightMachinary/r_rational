  The Gam3. LitRPG. Decent writing, but nothing amazing - still better than much of RoyalRoad. The main character is thoroughly flawed and makes a lot of mistakes that are acknowledged as such. All of the characters have alright voices and characterization, but it's not that deep. I found the overall story to be rather engaging in spite of the flaws and frustrations. Is complete and has an ending I found satisfying, although it's blatantly obvious a sequel is intended.

I disrecommend this, especially on the [[/r/rational]] subreddit. The main character doesn't just "make mistakes", he holds the idiot ball in a death grip so tight I actually wondered if the author was attempting to portray a character with serious mental disabilities for a while. It's pretty much the antithesis of the sidebar definition.

  Super Minion in spite of the uninspired name and amateurish cover, actually pretty good (I guess it's second most popular for a reason, huh?). Another "unusually strong alien being slowly joins humanity" story, similar to Chimera. If you like one, you'll probably like the other. Updates twice a month or so.

Super Minion on the other hand is very good, and features an AI (with a physical albeit shapeshifting body, not an infomorph) getting free and blending into a superhero setting. I'll be taking a look at Chimera!
