The more is revealed about demons, the more they seem like aliens. The mountain which is actually a ship - with two wings. Their world which can be shaped by stories, like a sophisticated simulation.

This chapter did a good job of clearing up some of the details. It felt good to have a clear explanation of how the stories effect demons and it made sense Winnum Roke would stay behind as a sort of entertainer that would keep demons occupied. The details all tie up, as far as I'm concerned.
