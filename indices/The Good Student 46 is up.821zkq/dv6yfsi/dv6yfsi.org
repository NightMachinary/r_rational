What a(n unsardonically) touching reunion.

The pug is totally a demon impostor. [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogWasTheMastermind][Probably also the mastermind.]]

Aw, Nic, must you dismiss [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6i12us/the_good_student_chapter_twenty_hfrt/dj2rlh4/][my predictions]] so offhandedly? But very well, I already have a new one: the pug is All-Father! It fits perfectly.

In actuality, I'm not sure why Nic trusts Winnum Roke's "true" fairy tale book. The Librarian already confessed to having "collaborated" with Roke on it, she had centuries alone with it, she was probably the one who subverted Roke's original plan and left her stranded for a millennium, et cetera. Is he sure there's no well-placed disinformation?
