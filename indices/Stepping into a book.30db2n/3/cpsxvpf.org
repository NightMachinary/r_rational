If anyone's interested, I would be totally willing to do this.

My most recent GMing looks to be falling to everyone-too-busy-to-coordinate syndrome, so I'm pretty much between games; and I always end up spending tons of headspace rationalizing whatever I'm reading, which is usually wasted effort unless I end up running a game there instead of a homebrew setting.
