Provided I know the genie isn't deliberately misinterpreting my wishes there's absurdly many many different easy wishes which all achieve the same purpose of being able to essentially reshape the universe into whatever you want.

For instance one could wish omnipotence onto oneself, or better yet create an omnipotent omniscient being whose only will is shaping the world according to your utility function.

Once you've got access to omnipotence directly or indirectly the next thing you need to do is use your powers to ensure that the genies lamp will in the future only end up in the hands of people you designate. If need be you could make an entire species of sentient beings designed so they won't bore the genie and never make wishes that conflict with your goals, then restrict the lamp to them.
