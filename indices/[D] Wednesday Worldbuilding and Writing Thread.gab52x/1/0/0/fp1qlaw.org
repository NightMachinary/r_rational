I really need more information on the setting to answer the question of 'why don't they go to the police'. Are vampires known to the general publicand/or to the relevant government? If so what systems does the government have in place to deal with the superhuman man-eating monsters? Assuming we're in the present time keeping the existence of vampires hidden from government surveilance would take massive work and would have implication for the rest of the setting. Even if a massive vampire organization had information suppressent agents in all government you only need one Snowden to leak everything unless literally everyone was mind controlled(which vampires conveniently have easy access to).

Point being that either there are government agencies tasked to deal with vampires or the vampires have large control over the government. A largely uncorrupt police could happen in smaller towns and could just be told from the top that they should close cases that look vampire related. In that sense I would predict that the police might just not look into cases or the vampire hunter would be directed to a vampire hunter organization.

Setting all of that aside: Maybe the MC have had experience with the police with the police that either makes them (possibly incorrectly) mistrust their ethics or competence. Maybe they or a close friend were mistreated by the police, possibly just very biased accounts or possibly a few rotten fruits. Maybe the police tried and failed to solve a murder of someone they held dear. Maybe all of their friends are acab people and their social norms doesn't allow them to go to the police.

I think there are some perks involved with having an acquiantance be involved with an organization that hunts vampires(possibly one that works with the government or one that is funded privately because some rich people want to train soldiers or whatnot). It lends credence to the idea of not going to the police because they probably already know.

Regardless, I really do think that being part of a vampire hunter organization should be a full time job rather than something you do on the side. Aside from the time training and missions would take, I think that being a vampire hunter shapes your personality. Assuming vampires are fast you need to be physically strong, learn to rely on your instincts, and train your instincts to kill when surprised. I really don't think that that training combined with the trauma from getting into near death experience with monsters that can both control your mind and literally want to eat lends itself well to working in a kindergarden. You daydream of your nightjob for one moment, a child surprises you, and the child ends up injured or even killed.
