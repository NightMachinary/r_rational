Since /Heroes Save the World/ was mentioned today, I guess it's worth bringing up that two major characters were put in charge of paranormal investigatory stuff because their task force had originally been a way to get rid of people without firing them.

So, maybe there's some kind of Bullshit Task Force that she's part of, which gets thrown this terrible, stupid "lead," and then later on it turns out that there are vampires involved here, and...now Jack is in a bit of a pickle.

See, she /could/ come right out and tell her boss about Oh Shit, Vampires, but Jack knows exactly where that'll go: Boss is gonna take the matter out of her hands and she'll go back to Bullshit Work.

Orrrrrr...she could keep quiet about what she's investigating, and pile up evidence all the while until she's able to put together an open-and-shut case on the whole thing, so that nobody can just /take/ this from her when she presents it to her superiors. (Either there's nobody else on the Bullshit Task Force, or they're tired of being underestimated and poorly treated too, and are totally on board with this plan).

Not only does this mean that she can be a cop who does cop things, but it explains why she's actively trying to keep her boss in the dark about everything.
