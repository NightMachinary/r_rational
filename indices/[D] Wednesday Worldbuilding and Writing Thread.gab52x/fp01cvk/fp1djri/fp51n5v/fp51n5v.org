  If nothing bad happens, then why isn't the supernatural public knowledge yet?

Vampires have, essentially, "pet humans" covering for them at most major places, but the masquerade is wearing thin and ultimately shatters by the end of the story (think of it as maybe the prequel to true blood).

Apart from that the masquerade is maintained by a combination of:

- vampire-aligned moles in high places

- very low vampire population (about 1 vampire per million people)

- the vampire monster is a relatively recent invention (~1700s); stories of Pharoahs and Emporers being gods/etc may well have been a cover story for people who were (at least at one point) openly vampires

- other supernatural beasties are even lower population (that said Our City is one of the few places where the veil between the 'real' world and the 'supernatural' world is at its thinnest, so to speak, so Our City has more supernatural beasties though fewer vampires.

- except for werewolves (see below), supernatural creatures have no interest in incorporating themselves into human society as they have their own culture, traditions, customs, etc. (even most vampires).

- the powers just aren't that impressive unless you really know what you're doing (for witches of all kinds) - James Randi's challenge aside, who is /actually/ going to notice a 'real' psychic / a plant medicine doctor who is about as effective as a real doctor / etc.

- tight-knit culture of secrecy (for werewolves)

- some light mind control

- in extreme cases (think like one or two shades below Godzilla; so something not easy to wipe under the rug), Obliviation may come into play

Not sure how well this comes together; the big problem with Rationality for urban fantasy is definitely the Masquerade. Unfortunately it's something that I'm more-or-less treating as a gimme (maybe I shouldn't, but having no Masquerade or having a plausible Masquerade both aren't stories I want to tell), but I do still want to have an answer to "why not go to the police" and when you /are/ the police it's pretty rough. The idea of her being put in charge of a secret vampire hunting division is quite clever, though, and could be a good way to sell it. But she'd be too young and inexperienced for that sort of responsibility, unless her boss is like a conspiracy theorist (who happens to be right) who brings it up /to her/ and then tells her to tackle it as an off-the-books assignment? IDK
