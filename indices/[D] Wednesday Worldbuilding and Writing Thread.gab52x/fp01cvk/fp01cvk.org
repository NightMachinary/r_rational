I'm tossing up between making my vampire hunter character a paramedic or a firefighter. She used to be a cop but I just suddenly realised that my big Rationality problem ("why don't they go to the police instead of hunting vampires?") is compounded a lot by the fact that a cop, of all people, should go to the cops.

PARAMEDIC:

- puts her near other major characters who all work in the hospital (okay, two major characters, an ER doctor and an ER nurse)
- gives her advanced medical knowledge which is kinda cool
- helps people directly (more similar to one of the things I was going for with cop)
- lives a relatively normal life

FIREFIGHTER:

- more emphasis on physical prowess (more similar to one of the things I was going for with cop)
- she will know how fire works, like, the theory behind fire, which is obviously big for killing vampires
- delicious irony in her starting fires to kill vampires, but also allows her to have a passing knowledge (not Dexter level tho) of how to get away with arson
- I'm pretty sure firies have a strange schedule/lifestyle where they're on call for ~48 hours at a time and sleep in bunkbeds (this is a con)

Downsides to her not being a police officer like I'd pictured her for the last 5-10 years:

- she'll have no work-related weapon skills, and it's set in Australia so access to guns any other way is very difficult (that said I always write her with a crossbow, so she could have had archery as a hobby in high school, which is in-character for her).
- she won't have access to police reports
- despite everything I don't want the police to be corrupt, so it doesn't altogether cut away the "why don't they go to the cops" thing
- however, I suppose one or two cops could be corrupt, and she could happen to get there
- the original backstory has her being put on desk duty after a run in with vampires, which results in her finding similarities in old files for murder or mysterious deaths. This is maybe a pro, because I was never satisfied with that, but I'm not sure how a reasonable firefighter can come up with "OMG VAMPIRES" when the prior probability is so dang low; an ambulance driver, however, could see weird vampire-consistent injuries and get suspicions that way?
- that said, depending on how Our Vampires look after burning to death, the local firefighters / all firefighters in the world could have legends about houses that are meant to have people in them but they just find ash no bodies and the houses are always really weird; however I think a sufficiently hot fire can turn bones into ash straight up so occasionally finding no trace of corpses is probably not that bad
- maybe her awakening to the supernatural is some sort of "fire monster" or, like, say a centaur who she finds in a house that's burned down and decides to look after (or a centaur skeleton, idk). like, she doesn't need to find vampires? she can find some other Urban Fantasy Creature and it can be like "oh no, there are vampires, hon"
- also maybe it's not her who finds out about the Supernatural Menace, perhaps it's her "vampire hunting partner/housemate" and she just joins in with the whole thing because she is a badass firefighter/paramedic who is handy with a crossbow. I think her housemate was a kindergarten teacher or daycare employee but she could be something more likely to find something interesting, OR she could suspect abuse in a family and when she drives past their house to investigate whether hte kid has food (or whatever) she finds out the family is actually nagas or whatever and is very scared and confused? IDK?

Anyway, this is all "THOUGHTS"????

Also, I heard somewhere that police officers and firefighters have a rivalry? [maybe that somewhere was Brooklyn 99 tho]
