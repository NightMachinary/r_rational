It seems to me that making the vampire hunter a paramedic or firefighter doesn't really solve the "why don't they go to the police?" problem. On the other hand, if she is a police officer, then going to the police could result in her being tasked to deal with vampires anyway.

Does something bad happen if everyone in that police department learns about vampires? If they all get Obliviated by vampire wizards, then there's a good reason not to tell the other officers. But it raises the question of how our vampire hunter doesn't get Obliviated herself. If nothing bad happens, then why isn't the supernatural public knowledge yet?
