  She used to be a cop but I just suddenly realised that my big Rationality problem ("why don't they go to the police instead of hunting vampires?") is compounded a lot by the fact that a cop, of all people, should go to the cops.

Another option, of course, is that she /isn't/ the first cop in the area to notice something odd (that leads to the discovery of vampires). The /first/ cop to notice something odd /did/, in fact, report it up the chain (after maybe privately sharing his worries with her) - only it turned out that their direct superior was one of the Vampire Goons infiltrated into the police force. His report vanished entirely, he himself was killed in what the evidence shows was /clearly/ a "totally unrelated incident" (perhaps shot by an escaping prisoner who was in turn shot by him, only it turned out the escapee was due to be released the next day and didn't have access to a gun in any case - /that/ sort of accident). The sort of thing that shows the Vampire Hunter character that (a) whatever these things are, they do exist, and (b) they've infiltrated the police force quite thoroughly; then she has /every/ reason to avoid passing it on to the (other) cops.
