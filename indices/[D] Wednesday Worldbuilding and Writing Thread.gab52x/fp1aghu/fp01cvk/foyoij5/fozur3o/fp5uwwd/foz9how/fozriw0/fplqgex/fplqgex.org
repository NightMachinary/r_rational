Can the genie ask a question that will stump it? No? Ok, good then the functional omnipotence includes functional omniscience as well. Likely functional immortality too.

As a rational mortal who is within the multicient and multipotent portion of each scale, with a wide margin of error, my hypothetical self insert has no concept of what would bore an omniscient, omnipotent, and likely immortal (within small margins of error for the first two items and an indeterminate number of coin flips for the last) being, so that part is not worth worrying about. (This is an important analysis, especially the part where I arrive at the trivial solution as the optimal course of action. It's not a waste of time, because how else would the reader know that my self-insert is rational, rather than some irrational pleb who didn't even consider the details before throwing them out? Thinking is a free action, so there is no opportunity cost in making the decision the long way.) That said, in a general sense avoiding boredom involves providing a minor challenge.

My wish, then, is this: "Grant me the life which maximizes my utility function according to the values held by my ideal self. "

The result is that the genie gets to barely avoid causing some paradoxen by letting me start over in a better matched time period, and has to keep my rebellious teenage self on track while I do everything in my power to live my own life, dad, you're not even my real dad, dad, since a maximized utility function includes perfect knowledge of relevant information.

I shall title this story "Raised by a Genie: please please help I'm trapped in this book and the Genie is so sick of my shit he started practicing militant tough love with a stick."
