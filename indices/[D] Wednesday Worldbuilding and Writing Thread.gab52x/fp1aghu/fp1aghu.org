The newest update to Worth the Candle has me thinking about calendar systems in non-Earth settings. Almost every fantasy setting I've read about has a 24-hour day and a 365-day year, or close enough that a reader won't notice the difference. From an author's perspective, there are good reasons for this - readers take our system for granted, and changing it is a lot of worldbuilding effort for something that probably doesn't contribute to the story you want to tell. But I can't help but wonder what interesting societal differences would result from a planet that didn't rotate about its axis every 24 hours.

What would our world look like if:

- days were much shorter? Say, a couple of hours long?
- days were much longer? What if a day lasted 1 Earth week? 1 Earth month?
- years (and therefore seasons) were much shorter or much longer?
- seasons were more extreme or less extreme? If the planet's axis didn't tilt at 23 degrees?
