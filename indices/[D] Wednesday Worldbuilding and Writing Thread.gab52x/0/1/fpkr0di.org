The 40 hour workweek could become a form of slavery if transposed in the naiive manner. There's a lot of room for subversion of expectations there. A wage slave is expected to put in 40h/week, but if a week only has 84 hours instead of the normal 168, there's not enough room to actually put in the expected time. Using 40 gives a chance to hide that from the reader until the reveal even in a fair play manner, as many readers might not make the connection.
