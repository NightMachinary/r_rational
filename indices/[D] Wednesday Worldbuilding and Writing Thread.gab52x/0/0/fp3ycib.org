All else (Earth's mass, air pressure, distance to the Sun, etc.) remaining the same, then off the top of my head:

- As the days get shorter due to faster planetary rotation, the planet gets windier. So, stronger and more frequent storms, and rarer moments of calm. It gets a lot harder to walk or run anywhere that isn't downwind, and wind chill gets a lot nastier in cooler regions. Land features that act as natural windbreaks become oases, while natural wind-funnels become Hell-on-Earth. And as wind direction shifts, so will the positions of these oases and hells So, I'm guessing there'll be a selective bias towards staying underground and in caves prior to inventing the great indoors, and the wearing of layers whenever you go outside. The former could extend towards an architecture-culture focus on interconnected dwellings and cities (possibly beginning with tunnels, later extending to underground cities!). The latter could be reflected in fashion trends -- heavy, concealing clothing is practical wear associated with outdoors labour, while leisure wear is the very opposite. Wildlife will have to adjust to a windier world: flying in any direction that isn't downwind becomes very difficult (maybe not worth the evolutionary effort), but using the wind to glide or sail become easier; mammals select for wind-proof coats of fur while wild plants select to become shorter and denser. Agriculture probably begins in natural wind-shadows, and expands with the building of artificial windbreaks. Overall, probably looking at smaller, denser populations. One wrong plague, and... whoops, there goes that settlement/civilization. Oh, and of course, with a shorter day-night cycle, humans and animals would likely evolve different sleep cycles, but with more time spent indoors the passage of day and night could become less culturally relevant.
- With longer days and nights... you're looking at slower planetary rotation, so less rotation-driven wind, but more temperature-driven wind thanks to the enhanced temperature differential. That /might/ mean crazier atmospheric circulation, with hot daytime air and cold nighttime air constantly chasing each other. Earth becomes slightly more Mercury-like, with more extreme high and low temperatures for day and night. Lots of daytime evaporation and nighttime precipitation, possibly as snow. Deserts are probably widespread far beyond the subtropics. Early land plants either evolved to tolerate both extremes, or you're not looking at much terrestrial primary production. If they did, then caves and the underground are likely still the habitat of choice. If not... then life is probably better down where it's wetter, under the sea.
- If the year and seasons are longer... well, you have a longer winter to prepare for, but a longer spring, summer, and fall to spend preparing, so perhaps not terribly different. That said... longer summers and winters mean greater temperature extremes. That could lead to greater risks of drought in summer, which means less food for a longer winter... unless you establish trade with agriculture in the tropics, where seasonal change isn't as extreme. Longer winter means a longer cold and flu season, and a longer period of less daylight, adding greater stress to both physical /and/ mental health.
- If the year gets shorter, then the reader of the story may encounter the same problem I did with Victor Milan's Dinosaur Lord Series, wherein the shorter year means everybody is described as many more years-old than their Earth equivalent. So until they get to part where the Old Home (i.e. Earth) to Paradise conversion is outright given, the reader is left wondering exactly how old all the characters are supposed to be.
- And lastly... seasonal extremes are directly controlled by Earth's axial tilt, so a change in one ought to necessitate a change the other. If seasons are more intense, see two bullet points above, but over a shorter time scale so leave out the chronic effects. Expect cultural adaption to hotter summers (more intense and regular droughts) with longer daylight periods, and colder and darker winters. /ESPECIALLY/ in the high-latitudes and polar regions. With less extreme seasons... a lot more lifestyles like the tropics. Temperature variations still occur with latitude, but the climate at one latitude is more or less what you get year-round. Without strong or noticeable winters in most areas, there's more time for food production in most places, but less relief from mosquitoes, ticks, and other parasites.

Well, that was fun! I'm a bit out of practice with my climatology and Earth-Sun astronomy; anybody more current could probably go into even more depth on everything, and patch up a lot stuff that I oversimplified/ignored/got wrong, whatev!
