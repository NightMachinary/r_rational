You, engaging in one of your favorite hobbies - collecting niche archeological trinkets - stumble upon an aged oil lamp. Suddenly, surprise, a genie appears to you! The genie has no particular relation to the lamp, it was just a coincidence.

The genie is bored, and trying to make the world more interesting by granting random wishes for people. The genie offers you one wish. The genie is not a monkey's paw - it will do its best to interpret the wish in exactly the way you intended it, using magic to determine this if your wording leaves ambiguity. The genie is functionally omnipotent, so assume no wish is out-of-bounds. You may wish for more wishes, but if you start getting boring the genie will abandon you and go find someone less intelligent to grant wishes for.

What do you, as a rationalist, do?
