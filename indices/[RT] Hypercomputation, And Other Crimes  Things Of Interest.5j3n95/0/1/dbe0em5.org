Thinking about this more, this isn't going to work as-is. If there's any point in the future (of the simulated universes) where the machine gets turned off permanently, then by necessity the same must be true for all universes below that. Thus, although the bottom-most universes are simulated infinitely fast, they're also infinitely brief.

Since you seem to be able to control the sub-universes' laws, this might be fixable (eg. by putting the simulated hypercomputer in some separate space to the rest of the simulated universe), but it's not clear if there's a solution simpler than that.
