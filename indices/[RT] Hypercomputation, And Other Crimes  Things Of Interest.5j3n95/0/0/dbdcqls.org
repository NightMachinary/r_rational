I agree that the hypercomputation aspect is a lot more interesting than the rest.

This might offer a good path to make warring time traveler stories more logically consistent. Normally, the trouble is that it's trivial for one person to wipe another person out of the universe unless both of them are in some kind of contrived limbo independent of intuitive time and its paradoxes. But if travelers are always coming from simulated universes, escaping upwards from layers further towards the bottom, this problem would be dealt with. It's also really interesting.
