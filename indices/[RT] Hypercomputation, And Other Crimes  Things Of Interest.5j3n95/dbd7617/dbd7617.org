The contrivance I saw was already mentioned in a comment.

  This scenario is based on the assumption that all the simulations are identical and will continue to be so. But if all the YOUS will always be identical, reducing their number back to one will not change anything significant.

However, there's a more interesting aspect, at least to me. Hypercomputation allows running the universe infinitely fast.

Save the state of the universe. Spawn a hypercomputation of that saved state of the universe. Run that hypercomputation at â‰«1x speed. You now have an infinite tower of universes, each running progressively faster than the depth below. This of course resembles a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno_machine][Zeno Machine]], except the universe isn't Turing complete and can fail.

If the simulated universe is augmented with some kind of anti-entropy law (that only kicks in later, to avoid destabilizing the setup of the infinite chain), and probably some kind of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rules_of_go#Ko][Ko-like rule]], this effectively beats entropy.
