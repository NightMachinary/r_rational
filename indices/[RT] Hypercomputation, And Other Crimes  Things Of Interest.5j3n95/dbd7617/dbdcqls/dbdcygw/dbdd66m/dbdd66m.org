Not really, although that's a novel time travel scheme I've never seen before.

I was not imagining a form of time travel where, say, you can travel back into the past and kill Hitler, but something more dramatic, where, perhaps, futuristic robots from a future Earth unlike our own travel back to a point shortly after the first hypercomputer was built, and do battle with futuristic bioengineered humanoids from a future Earth unlike our own, etc. Every invention of a hypercomputer within a hypercomputer would become a battleground. And if you win one round, you are still vulnerable to invasion from underneath if someone in your universe builds a hypercomputer. The motivation for people to continue to build hypercomputers is to get information from the future that lets them deal with entropy. But this means the future is necessarily more capable than the present. But you could still try to heavily stack the deck. But the future would have full awareness of the ways in which you attempted to stack the deck. The motivation for groups underneath to try fighting the groups above would be value drift, I guess.
