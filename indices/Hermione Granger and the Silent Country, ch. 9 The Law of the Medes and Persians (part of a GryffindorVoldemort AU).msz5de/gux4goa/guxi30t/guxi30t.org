I mean, if you could give the Dementors a different diet, that might swing the moral argument in favour of not destroying them all. Like, if you could create an artificial [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wirehead_(science_fiction][wirehead]]) which is sentient but not sapient or or intelligent or conscious, which exists only to create an endless stream of pleasurable memories for Dementors to consume, and the Dementors can (and are willing to) restrict themselves to feeding only on those, then it seems like it's in the same moral category as "vampires willing to feed only on cloned blood."

That said, except in that very specific scenario, they're a literal embodiment of torture, so yeah, tolerance of other beings can only extend to the point where their existence does not infringe on other people's basic rights (like the right to not be subjected to cruel punishment).
