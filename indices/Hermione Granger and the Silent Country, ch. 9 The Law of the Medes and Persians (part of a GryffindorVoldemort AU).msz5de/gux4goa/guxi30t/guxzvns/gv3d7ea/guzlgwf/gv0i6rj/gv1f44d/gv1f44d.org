I'm not as sure as you that this is true

  the best case scenario under this plan is marginalized communities selling their souls for bare survival in a far more literal way than they do in real life.

Well I think in a lot of ways selling 15 minutes of yourself to dementors is /better/ than selling your kidney, as it leads to no permanent damage, and it has the sort of quick feedback loop that no one would ever be tricked into doing it longer than they wanted to - Unlike with kidneys, where the lure of quick money might override good sense. It definitely seems better than working for years in a coal mine and getting lung damage.

It had occurred to me that if you successfully implemented Wizard Post-Scarcity Utopia (or even Wizard Welfare State) then perhaps no one would want to sell their time to dementors. Except maybe very kind donors.

But that's a separate question than whether, /given/ that conditions are such that people wish to sell their time to dementors, disallowing them from having the option of being able to make that sale isn't the answer (rather, building the Wizard Welfare State would be the answer).

In the real world, if you were the dictator, forbidding people from working exploitative jobs wouldn't really work to improve their lot, what you'd have to do is to give them basic income so that they did not /wish/ to work the exploitative job. The former would just take away their option to move from terrible to slightly less terrible. I'm a socialist as far as /values/ go but this seems like a cause and effect thing.
