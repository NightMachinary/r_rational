  If summarily executing Nazi death camp guards was justice (to be clear: it absolutely was), then so is starving all the dementors to death, no matter how sentient they may be.

The dementors don't have a choice though. Maybe they should be euthanized painlessly if possible but it's not like a Nazi guard. And if they can't be killed, what if starving to death for a dementor is more painful than being fed on by a dementor? Now you can't even make the utilitarian argument, you have to fall back on bodily autonomy.

Actually, perhaps people could be /paid/ to feed dementors. It does not seem so bad that you couldn't be compensated. Kinda like selling a kidney.
