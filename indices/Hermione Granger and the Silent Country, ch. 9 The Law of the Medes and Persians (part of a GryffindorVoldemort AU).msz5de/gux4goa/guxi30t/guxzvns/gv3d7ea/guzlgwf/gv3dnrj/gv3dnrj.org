  “I have spoken,” the headmaster said. “If I must speak again, then it will be to expel you from my sight forever.”

  The rebuke could have been a physical blow, the way that Haywood shuddered against it, and she moved almost as if she had been thrown, legs and hands and arms and feet spilling over each other as she withdrew, trying to stand at the same time she was trying to leave the room.

  On the opposite side of the room from Hermione, Derrick groaned and shifted in his bed. Riddle tapped Derrick's head with the end of a white wand, and he settled back down.
