  Why did Riddle want Hermione in the tournament?
#+end_quote

Cue bono?\\
A Haywood win:\\
If Haywood (or some other magical tryhard psycho duelist from Hogwards) won, this scares the international community. Not in Riddle's interest.\\
A Viktor win:\\
If Viktor wins, the wizard-supremacist gain in reputation.\\
Not in Riddle's interest. In Karkaroff's interest, but he's not a player. Very unlikely now, since he's up against two friends, instead of in a Free For All.

A Fleur win: She's quarter Veela, so the international wizard-supremacist faction loses face. Good for Octobre.

A Hermione win:\\
Unlikely, but worst-case for the wizard-supremacists.\\
Also would be good for English-French relations.\\
Also good for Octobre.

What's in it for Octobre?\\
Octobre benefits, because two of the Candidates are French now and he wants to kill the king. Two reasons. His name is Octobre and he doesn't drink coffee.

He's totally named after the month that saw another most Christian majesty killed. And because he prides himself on his French spirit. The French love baguette, fromage and regicide.

There's an obscure German joke about the French partisan in the Vichy restaurant asked what beverage he wants:

  "Kaffee oder lieber Tee?"\\
  "Libert√©!"

Also Riddle wins, if Octobre starts the French Wizarding revolution, because that'll make him look reasonable in comparison. Hence they're cooperating. Octobre probably couldn't have roofied Hermione into putting her name into the goblet otherwise. Or would have known that this would work.
