Sorry, re-reading my earlier comment, I think it was a little unclear. I wasn't disagreeing with you, just saying that, if dementors are people, then "what do we do about dementors" becomes more than just a practical issue. I don't think that anyone who's arguing in favor of dementor rights would be doing so if they were literally mindless monsters, but now that dementors are (in some sense) people, there /are/ those arguments.

(The "cheating" is on the writer-side, not the reader-side. There's a strong tendency for writers to depict dementors, or other monsters for that matter, as intelligent non-persons, which just rubs me the wrong way.)
