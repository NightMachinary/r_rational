  I can't say whether a solution like what [[/u/Nimelennar]] suggests is feasible, and it may be that dementors have needs which just make them inimical to other beings

I just re-read a few passages of /Prisoner of Azkaban/ and it looks like it's plausible that it could work; they could still feed on Sirius' dog form, although it sounds like it wasn't as effective. It would probably need to experience more than simple pleasure (more on that in a moment), but it sounds doable.

But all of that is beside the point, because we have a way in canon to coexist with Dementors (emphasis mine):

#+begin_quote
  The Patronus is a kind of positive force, *a projection of the very things that the Dementor feeds upon* --- hope, happiness, the desire to survive --- but *it cannot feel despair, as humans can, so the Dementors can't hurt it*.

Boom! Cruelty-free food source. And before you tell me that it's a difficult charm that very few can learn, I'll remind you that Harry was able to teach several fifth-year students to cast it in a time-frame of a few weeks, if that. Certainly, if they were content feeding on the low percentage of the wizarding population that were criminals, there should be more than enough people who could learn to cast the Patronus to feed them.

Also, the above passage expands the range of emotions that your wireheads would need. Not just happiness/pleasure, but hope, and the desire to survive. The latter shouldn't be hard to put in, but hope seems like it would require some amount of consciousness, which makes the whole idea more problematic.

Another option would be some sort of rationing. I can't think of a way that would be fair, would not act as an *extreme* disincentive to the activity it was tied to (e.g. inviting them to sporting events would be a good way to feed them on a highly emotional crowd... until people stopped attending sporting events), and would not either be horribly traumatic to someone with PTSD, or have everyone claiming PTSD to get out of it. But the fact that I can't imagine a solution doesn't mean that such a solution could not exist.
