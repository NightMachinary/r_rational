  determined that you have broken this rule, then you will be barred from participating in the next Task, which will not only trigger the forfeiture clause of the Tournament's contract but also put your replacement at a severe disadvantage

So ask for help and forfeit instantly

It seems untenable to have two students from one school and one from the other no matter how you look at it. Even for Karkoff every one will know his champion fought against basically just one rival

Though when you think about it one person beating two others is already not very impressive

  What is relevant to us now is that, if any student who is selected as their school's champion subsequently chooses to withdraw from the Tournament, or is thrown out of the Tournament for ill behaviour, then the relevant administrator---myself, in this case---must expel that student.

Except it would be hogwarts who had to expel them, it also seems rather unnecessary to have such harsh rules considering how badly this situation reflects on all three schools publicly

I also don't understand why anyone would bond themselves with any possibility of having to retire like that over some meaningless games. There's no prize after all.

But if I was to risk it then I'd step down as headmistress and put some random guy in charge who then expels the student

Alternatively expel the student and then let them attend anyway, but without grading them or anything. I can go to a university lecturer without being a student, similarly people can go on exchange. I think in the rather ad hoc world of wizards that'd be fine since their education is not as performative as ours

To what benefit? He'd just be harming himself for no gain. It's one thing to threaten to cut off your nose to spite your face it's another thing to go through with it after your face has left or whatever is analogous

I'm not sure risk of Haywood is such a good reason to stay in, there was already that risk after fleur was chosen, and I still can't see why anyone in charge would be satisfied by this whereas having four competitors is rather different because at least you still had three meaningful champions. Assuming this is riddle I don't see how it benefits him and doesn't he see a systemic issue with his best pupil being so violent which makes me think that he's happy that she did that but then why punish her

Since people know about animagus and bugs anyway, certainly I thought Dumbledore could hear anything said in hogwarts. So no privacy I'd say. Similarly couldn't Dumbledore tell when students were injured

Glad that Hermy doesn't fall for blackmail and much better than most media
