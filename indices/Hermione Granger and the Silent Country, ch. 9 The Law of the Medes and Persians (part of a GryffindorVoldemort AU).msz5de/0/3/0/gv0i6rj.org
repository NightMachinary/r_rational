I was assuming there was no known way to just kill a dementor in this continuity. If there is a True Patronus here then yeah, use that, but starving them out is the only way to do it in canon.

Paying people to be tortured only sounds like a reasonable solution if you think capitalism is good and money representative of anything real. I believe neither. The best case scenario under this plan is marginalized communities selling their souls for bare survival in a far more literal way than they do in real life. Everyone else would have access to better jobs than "dementor food," the wage paid to be tortured would be bottomed out through competition, and you would eventually wind up with Azkaban But Neoliberal This Time.

It's unfortunate, but when you have an entire race who are literally, verifiably soul-sucking demons (rather than just pervasive lies saying they are, as in antisemitic propaganda), who can't feed on anything but souls, and will starve to death if forced to stop feeding on souls, genocide really is the best option. We wipe out botfly infestations with extreme prejudice, and we would still be justified in doing so if botflies could plead for their lives as we crushed them. Dementors are even more parasitic than that.
