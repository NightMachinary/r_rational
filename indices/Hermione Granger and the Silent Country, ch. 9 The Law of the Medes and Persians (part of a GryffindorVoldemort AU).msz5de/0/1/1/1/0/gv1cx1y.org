Do you have any source for that? My previous quote is out of /Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban/, Chapter Twelve, "The Patronus."

The following is out of HPatPoA, Chapter Ten, "The Marauder's Map" (emphasis mine):

#+begin_quote
  'Dementors are among the foulest creatures that walk this earth. They infest the darkest, filthiest places, they glory in decay and despair, they drain peace, hope, and happiness *out of the air around them.* Even Muggles feel their presence, though they can't see them. Get too near a Dementor and every good feeling, every happy memory will be sucked out of you. If it can, a Dementor will feed on you long enough to reduce you to something like itself - soulless and evil. You'll be left with nothing but the worst experiences in your life.'
#+end_quote

I read this to mean that the reason why Dementors cause despair is because that's what's left in a person when the happiness and hope are drained away; a Patronus, not being a person but rather an entity composed of only of happiness and hope, have nothing other than what is being fed upon; if bled dry, they'll just vanish rather than ever suffering.

/Prisoner of Azkaban/, and specifically those chapters ten and twelve, are where I remember Dementors being described in the most detail, and I don't see anything there about exploiting despair to consume happiness, rather than seemingly consuming *ambient* happiness.
