I'm really quite pleased by how the reaction to Riddle's dementor policy runs the full gamut from "this is further proof that Riddle is evil" to "this is a surprisingly good thing that Riddle has done."

I can't say whether a solution like what [[/u/Nimelennar]] suggests is feasible, and it may be that dementors have needs which just make them inimical to other beings, but I feel like it's cheating a little to say, "We can't coexist with these creatures, but conveniently they aren't people anyway." Riddle and Hermione probably won't be able to sit down for tea and come to a mutually-satisfactory arrangement, but that doesn't mean that Riddle's not a person!
