Aaaaannnnd there it is. Not only has Riddle failed to abolish Azkaban, he has given Dementors human rights. I suppose it remains to be seen whether his claims about their civilizability are true, but I'm not sure why anyone should care. They are literally soul-sucking demons, their goals are diametrically opposed to those of humans, and they create misery by just existing. If summarily executing Nazi death camp guards was justice (to be clear: it absolutely was), then so is starving all the dementors to death, no matter how sentient they may be.

This Riddle is very clearly still evil, just in more interesting and exciting ways than the original model.

Remaining mysteries:

- Why did Riddle want Hermione in the tournament?

- Is Riddle still the best candidate for screwing with the Goblet given that he does not appear to benefit from this? (Yes, Riddle is always the best candidate)

- What did Dumbledore see on the night he died which would lead to Riddle's downfall?

- What is the fate of the House Elves?

- What is an Eye of Providence?
