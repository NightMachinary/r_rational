  Except it would be hogwarts who had to expel them

[[/u/Nimelennar]]'s theory that Hermione would be banned from all three schools is correct. I was concerned that I was already being too wordy, so I didn't explicitly point it out, but obviously I should've. I've been making a list of minor revisions to make in the next couple weeks, and this is going on it.

  Alternatively expel the student and then let them attend anyway, but without grading them or anything. I can go to a university lecturer without being a student, similarly people can go on exchange.

Hermione will not be permitted on the grounds. It'd be more feasible for her to conduct a series of correspondence courses with her professors that is technically of their own initiative and unrelated to attendance (even remote) at Beauxbatons, but that's not really the point for Hermione.

  Even for Karkoff every one will know his champion fought against basically just one rival

Karkaroff would rather come in first in a two-person contest than second in a three-person contest.

  I also don't understand why anyone would bond themselves with any possibility of having to retire like that over some meaningless games. There's no prize after all.

  I still can't see why anyone in charge would be satisfied by this whereas having four competitors is rather different because at least you still had three meaningful champions. Assuming this is riddle I don't see how it benefits him and doesn't he see a systemic issue with his best pupil being so violent which makes me think that he's happy that she did that but then why punish her

I don't want to spoil future events, so I'll just say that all these concerns are things that I've thought about and they will be addressed in the future.
