  [[/u/Nimelennar]]'s theory that Hermione would be banned from all three schools is correct. I was concerned that I was already being too wordy, so I didn't explicitly point it out, but obviously I should've. I've been making a list of minor revisions to make in the next couple weeks, and this is going on it.

My point was that it would be Riddle's job at risk

  Hermione will not be permitted on the grounds. It'd be more feasible for her to conduct a series of correspondence courses with her professors that is technically of their own initiative and unrelated to attendance (even remote) at Beauxbatons, but that's not really the point for Hermione.

That seems like a reasonable implementation, you could bring a magic mirror device as alternative to correspondence

But yes certainly she cares most about her friends

  Karkaroff would rather come in first in a two-person contest than second in a three-person contest.

Isn't it embarrassing to even be involved in such a tournament? It's like attending Qatar, except there are only four teams going, and Qatar quits and instead Saudi Arabia gets 2 teams instead, would Germany or Brazil still attend? It doesn't reflect very well.

If there is an actual prize then it matters more. Also since the tournament rules didn't say anything about sabotaging other people (not allowed to help candidates but you can hinder them) then Karkaroff can obliviate Fleur next time he sees her.
