  Except it would be hogwarts who had to expel them, it also seems rather unnecessary to have such harsh rules considering how badly this situation reflects on all three schools publicly

Yeah, that's what I'm not getting. Why wouldn't she be expelled from *Hogwarts*, not Beauxbatons? She wasn't selected as Beauxbatons' champion.

The only reading that I can see is that the contract between the headmasters would leave them ineligible to attend any of the other schools. And you could make that case based on what Riddle said back in chapter seven:

  If you are chosen, then your only choice will be to walk along the path that is set out for you, or hope that you can find education outside Western Europe.

It'd be nice if why the obvious solution doesn't apply could be made explicit in-story, though.
