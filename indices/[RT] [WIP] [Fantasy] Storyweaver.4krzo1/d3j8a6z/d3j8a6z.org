  "Ahh that's because they think, quite accurately might I add, that I'm carrying a, small, yet incredibly dangerous nuclear bomb" said Emmet, still trying to find the correct key. He got out a pulsating metallic sphere with his left hand and gave it to Catherine. "Here, hold it for me would you?"

Best line. Gets funnier every time I read it.

  "Quick explanation: we're currently inside an-"\\
  "Island-shaped dimension where reality constantly changes," said Arthur, "I know."

... I didn't know that. Were we actually told about the flexible reality before this? I think I missed that line.

  "The city acts like an anchor for reality. It's the only stable point of the universe and if it gets destroyed, then EVERYTHING will be gone."

This is incredibly contrived.

  -I don't get it, why doesn't she just share her feelings with Emmett?-

I didn't notice that either. Was there an entire romance arc that I missed? Am I just bad at remembering things I've read?

--------------

The story needs an editing pass, at least. The narration's very stilted, phrased strangely and punctuated inconsistently. There's several errors that your spellchecker should have caught. And you use some words that don't mean what I think you think they mean, I think. All fixed easily enough, you just need someone else to read your story and find the mistakes.

Beyond that, I have some other questions. Emmett seems to be the protagonist, but he's not the viewpoint character. We see the story through Catherine and Arthur's eyes, even though they do essentially nothing to advance the plot. What's the reason for that decision?

Is Emmett secretly the bad guy? In places he's channelling Quirrelmort from HPMoR. Brilliant but dangerous, flippant attitude to other people's lives... Yet he seems too likeable to be a real villain. If that's the twist you're building up to, you need to be less subtle about it.

There's a lot of focus on character interaction, but apart from Emmett I don't find any of the characters engaging. If I want to listen to twenty-something grad students argue about their lives, I hardly need your story for that.

It's the end of chapter 8 and I have no idea what the plot is. Apparently they're saving the universe from an unspecified threat, but I don't see how anything that's happened contributes towards that goal.

Edit: Actually, do they still have the bomb from chapter 2? I don't recall it being put down at any point. Quite an important thing to forget about!
