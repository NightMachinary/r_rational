  In its current form, is there really no redeeming value to the story?
#+end_quote

Of course not, don't be ridiculous. But as you say, it's a first draft, unedited, and will need some work to reach its full potential.

  Still, I've been considering making this a whole book instead of separating it. It really might help it to do it entirely in one go, but I'm not sure if its worth the trouble.
#+end_quote

It's not worth the trouble. Finish this project on time and stick with the plan you're already working on. I say, any lessons you learn about how to publish a serial or how to plan a story, you can apply to the /next/ thing you make. Better to have an imperfect, finished project than one that never finishes because you keep trying to make it perfect. (That's why I don't post anything substantial that I write. Once I start editing it properly, I'm too afraid to release it until it's perfect, which it never is. Don't make my mistake.)

Nobody expects your first book to be your masterpiece. You show a lot of potential already, you just need practice to bring it out.

Edit: Quotation marks are the standard in written English. All the English-language stories I've read use quotation marks for dialogue. Other languages vary. German uses „a different style of quotation marks“. French uses «guillemets» for short quotes and a single --- emdash when an entire paragraph is dialogue.
