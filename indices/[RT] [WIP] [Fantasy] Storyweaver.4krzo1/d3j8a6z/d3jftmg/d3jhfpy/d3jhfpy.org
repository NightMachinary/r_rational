This is just bizarre. Your summaries and spoilers evoke a very interesting and meta story, one that I'd probably love and not be able to put down. Yet the actual story you've posted seems meandering and poorly-written, no offence. Maybe it's just that it's not finished yet and it'll make more sense as a finished product than as a serial? Like you say, a lot of the interesting twists are yet to come, so large chunks of the story at the moment are effectively pointless until you write the part where their foreshadowing pays off.

I can accept that it's part of Emmett's character to be unhelpfully evasive, but Cathering and Arthur have little reason to trust him. Consider what he's actually done to them - tricked them into coming to an alternate dimension, under threat of the SWAT team surrounding the house and the nuke he'd threatened to use, and while he's the only one who knows how to go back to reality (where they're presumably still surrounded by armed soldiers) - he's basically their abusive kidnapper. But they still trust him and consider him a friend, which is strange.

... I actually did not see any of the things in any of the spoilers coming. Sorry.

Am I right in thinking English isn't your first language? That would definitely explain why you have impeccable grammar but odd turns of phrase, and it means your story would benefit a lot from a native-speaking editor. The jarring language (including your use of -dashes- instead of "quotation marks" for dialogue) seems like a small thing now, but it makes it incredibly difficult for the reader to immerse themselves in the story.
