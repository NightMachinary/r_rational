Thanks for taking time to read the story, your feedback is very helpful to me and I really appreciate it! I'm sorry if this reply is too long, but you're the only person I can talk to about this since I haven't heard anything from anyone else caught up. I hope you don't mind, I'm just excited I can talk to someone about it.

Arthur assumed the flexible reality when Artemisia says:

  -The Dreamscape is a chaotic realm where the only constant of the environment is change! The journey to the island's center is an incredibly dangerous one that could take decades, even knowing the proper route to it. No person we've sent has ever returned!-
#+end_quote

But I wanted to reveal it to the reader without info dumping too much so I had Arthur say it in the next chapter. Do you think there's a better way to do this?

I don't think the spoiler tag is necessary since this is revealed in the next chapter (and this is amateur fiction; not Game of Thrones here), but [[#s][Spoiler:]], though it's not as simple as that. [[#s][Spoiler:]]

[[#s][Bigger spoiler that some of my friends figured out, so maybe you've already thought of it too:]]

[[#s][Even bigger spoiler that I haven't seen anyone figure out yet:]]

I wanted Catherine and Arthur to be similar to the average grad-student/college senior, smart and good natured, but still too young to see how egotistical and overconfident they are. I'm trying to strike a balance of likable and arrogant so that, when all is said and done, the audience can see how much they've grown. If it helps, once I finish showing Catherine's backstory in the next few chapters, they're going to stop arguing about their lives and stuff. I just want the reader to see where they are coming from before I have them step up. [[#s][Spoiler:]] If you're at all familiar with anime, then the best comparison I can give to what I'm aiming for is Neon Genesis Evangelion. It's supposed to get darker and darker as the story goes on, along with subverting common tropes, suicidal/existentialist mindtrips, and convoluted metaphysical nonsense. Unfortunately, most of that is going to happen in the second half of the story since I needed to set up my characters before I could do any of that in a way that wasn't complete pretentious horseshit. It's also why I'm having the characters be a bit too philosophical in their conversations, so that the reader doesn't throw away the metaphorical book once they reach these moments later in the story. I mean, if they read past mushy stuff like:

#+begin_quote
  I deny the existence of love, not because I want to, but because I have to. Otherwise... it would just mean I've never been worthy of it.
#+end_quote

then odds are they won't mind my philosophical rantings later on, right?

Edit about your edit: The dreamscape machine works by sending the user's consciousness into the dimension, not their physical bodies. I /did/ forget to explain this, so thanks for pointing it out for me!
