If you have each spoken part on it's own line, and stay under 6 lines or so, you shouldn't need any other description-- just end quote and start newline.

I'd also suggest giving each character distinctive ways of speaking-- verbal tics and sentence structures they favor.

Maybe a character enjoys speaking long, flowing sentences; the semi-colons are almost audible as they pile clause upon clause and metaphor upon metaphor onto their audience.

Another? Terse.

And just because a character has certain traits doesn't mean their speech has to reflect them.

You can have yer fancy-pants, Harvard-educated, but still country boy, or a sweet, homely, but foul-mouthed as hell grandma that curses at the end of every motherfucking sentence, goddamn!

Finally, you can give characters physical tics as well-- maybe they like to tug on their earlobe, or tap their feet, or fiddle with their keychain. Even without directly identifying them, your reader will begin to notice who's speaking by looking at textual clues.

Of course, now I just need to take my own advice ;)
