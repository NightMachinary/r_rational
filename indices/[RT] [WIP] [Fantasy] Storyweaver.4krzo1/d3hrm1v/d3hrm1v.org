OK, I tried to read your story. Got to the first part of the fourth chapter before dropping it. Things that stuck out at me:

- The opening is super, super weak.

    Catherine, a 21 year old graduate student, heard the morning news while facing an emerald encrusted mirror and straightening her beautiful blonde hair. Though the girl didn't see it, her television showed a news reporter on the street approaching a young man with slightly spiky, messy brown hair

  This immediately pattern matches to something out of the [[http://www.bulwer-lytton.com/][Bulwer-Lytton contest]]. The third word is not the place to be lazy and refuse to write out twenty-one, and that alone almost made me kill the tab and drop the story... but the rest of the opening wasn't much better. This sort of bad writing is not unique to this part of the story, but the opening should draw me in and make me keep reading, and this story completely failed that metric.

- You have bits where you write with a sentence leading up to a piece of dialogue, then put a colon and separate the dialogue on the next line. This is super weird formatting, and breaks flow occasionally. You also seem to be constantly worried that the reader will not know who is speaking in a dialogue of two speakers - you have a lot of superfluous 'X said' and 'Y said' stuff in your text that breaks the flow of the dialogue. Shortening it down by using pronouns such as "He said" instead of proper names, or ideally removing them as much as possible altogether and still have the dialogue make sense, would make the dialogue read better and be much less stilted.

- Something interesting starts happening at the end of the first chapter. Why didn't the interesting stuff happen at the start, instead? Was the chapter of semirandom foreshadowing and setup work particularly interesting to you?

- I dropped the story in chapter 4, during the trial of Arthur. I just couldn't force myself through the particularly awkward and stilted dialogue of this section.
