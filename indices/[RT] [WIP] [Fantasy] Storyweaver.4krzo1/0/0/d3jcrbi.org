Thank you for your help! From what I'm gathering all of this seems fixable so at least I know I'm not writing /complete/ garbage. Every author I've studied says that the first few books will always suck, but at least it could be worse, right?

I've been told about "bad formatting" before but I can't seem to get anyone to tell me exactly what they mean by this. Are there any online resources to improve this? I'm going a bit overboard on the dialogue tags because I received complaints from some of my friends about it being hard to figure out who was talking. This is just for the first draft, though. I prefer to go a bit too much in the first run through and remove them in revision rather than doing it backwards. I just want to get to the ending before I begin editing, so a lot of the flow stuff is taking a backseat while I finish. Anyway, thanks for checking it out!
