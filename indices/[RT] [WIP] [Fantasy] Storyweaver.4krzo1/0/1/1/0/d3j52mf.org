  Finally, you can give characters physical tics as well-- maybe they like to tug on their earlobe, or tap their feet, or fiddle with their keychain. Even without directly identifying them, your reader will begin to notice who's speaking by looking at textual clues.

Yup! Unless otherwise indicated, the reader will assume that the last person mentioned is the one talking. It's a neat trick that... I probably use too much, come to think of it. Example:

#+begin_quote
  Violet choked on her tea. "Ex-excuse me?"
#+end_quote

See? Don't even need the "she said".
