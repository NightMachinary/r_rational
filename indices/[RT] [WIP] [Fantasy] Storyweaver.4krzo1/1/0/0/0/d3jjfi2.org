Yup! English is my second language. Oh, and no offense taken! In its current stage it /is/ meandering and poorly-written! I really don't want to sound like I'm making excuses here, since I recognize that my skill isn't yet where it needs to be for this story to reach what I'm aiming for. This is the second long-form story I'm working on, so I don't expect it to be great yet. I want to finish writing before I start revising though, or else I get stuck in editing mode and never finish.

I think a lot of the problems right now can be attributed to the fact that this is just my first draft. Again, not an excuse, just an explanation. I'm not afraid to admit I'm still a shitty writer! I started writing this in march so I still haven't worked on it as much as I'd like. I'm just confident I have something special here and that, with /a lot/ of work, I can make it a good story. Without people to read it, I've basically been jumping in blindly without knowing what works and what doesn't.

In its current form, is there really no redeeming value to the story? I thought that, despite its flaws, it could be a somewhat enjoyable read. Interesting enough to spark curiosity about the next chapter. Then again, I'm biased here so I'm obviously not the best person to know whether I'm fooling myself or not. Also, I was using quotation marks at first, but IRL people were complaining about them and I was told to use dashes. I really don't know what to make of it.

Still, I've been considering making this a whole book instead of separating it. It really might help it to do it entirely in one go, but I'm not sure if its worth the trouble.
