Very little.

I've read Coiling Dragon (good uptil halfway, then fell off) and I Shall Seal the Heavens (pretty good so far), but neither can be considered rational. They're the literature equivalent of junk food.

OP, I think [[/r/fantasy]] may be a better place, and they already have a few recommendation threads along these lines.
