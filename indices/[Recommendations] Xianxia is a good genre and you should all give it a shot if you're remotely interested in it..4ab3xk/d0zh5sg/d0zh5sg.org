They're not strictly rational, but ISSTH at least might appeal to a number of people here. The main character is moderately rational, and the world has a sort of alien logic to it that I've found interesting so far. I would note that it took me a few chapters to not dismiss it out of hand, but the writing isn't as weak as it initially appears. It also has a kind of unselfconscious bombast to it that I find entertaining.
