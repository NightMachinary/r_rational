So, the thing about the xianxia genre is that it's extremely homogenized. Xianxia as a genre has basically gone through the Moloch grinder and traded off a WHOLE lot of values to pursue a weird, ruthless quality of storytelling that I don't see anywhere else. For this (and other reasons), I find the Xianxia genre really interesting, both on its own merits and partially as a case study.

Basically, in Xianxia settings, magic is scarce. To get better at magic you need to consume large amounts of magical materials and use them to upgrade your physical form, and competition over nonrenewable magic materials leads to every practitioner being incredibly, incredibly ruthless. In Xianxia, the BASELINE for survival is to either be Mad-Eye or Quirrellmort; Harrys and Hermiones can't survive in that competitive world. A common trope is 'if you want to live happy, stay mortal. If you want to LIVE FREE no matter what, pursue magic.'

In that sense, it's not that Xianxia isn't rational. The problem with Xianxia in the context of [[/r/Rational][r/Rational]] is that it doesn't work like most stories. In most stories, because the author has prematurely closed off logical routes of story development due to various reasons, applying logic to those stories EXPANDS the field of development and enables more diverse stories. In Xianxia, it's the opposite; cruel logic has been applied to the extreme to create settings bereft of the human element, and making those stories more 'rational' is just a change in quantity, not quality. In other words, adding Rational elements to Xianxia doesn't diversify the scope of possible stories- it narrows it even further.

What Xianxia as a genre needs is more personal development and diverse motivations and actual characters that are not Literally Voldemort. Seriously. Holy fuck I am so sick of reading about Xianxia 'protagonists' who in a different story would literally be the BBEG. More ruthlessness and cunning is NOT what Xianxia needs, it has WAY TOO MUCH OF THAT ALREADY.

Edit: AND ENDINGS! Xianxia stories need to FUCKING HAVE AN ENDING! There are way too many long runners which don't have endings and just pile on dimension-rending existential enemy after dimension-rending existential enemy! "It's basically anti-spirals all the way down" is one description I've used before.
