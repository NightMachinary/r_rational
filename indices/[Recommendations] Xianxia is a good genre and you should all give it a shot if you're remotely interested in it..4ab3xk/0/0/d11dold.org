  Holy fuck I am so sick of reading about Xianxia 'protagonists' who in a different story would literally be the BBEG.

You may enjoy the first story arc of [[https://scryatranslations.wordpress.com/my-disciple-died-yet-again/][My Discipline Died Yet Again]]. The main character is a female computer programmer from our world, and the typical xianxia MC is a different character whose OPness is a product of a bug in the system that the programmer needs to fix.

It's actually pretty good.
