It sounds similar to the Japanese series Hero Union BBS (Yuusha Gojo Kumiai Kouryuugata Keijiban) WN/LN/[[http://bato.to/comic/_/comics/hero-union-bbs-r12956][Manga]]

I have read some of the translations of My Disciple Died Yet Again, and will probably catch back up one of these days. The MCish character reminds me a lot of Yun Che because of his ever-expanding harem and the YY protags in general because he never seems to find fault in his own actions.

Thankfully the actual MC girl of the series is immune to his charm and has her own romantic interest.
