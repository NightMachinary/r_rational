What's strange to me that the current crop Xianxia seems to be so much less sophisticated story-wise than even the Wuxia stories of decades ago. Jin Yong's novels have them all beat in terms in prose, diversity of characters, and development arcs that are emotionally moving. The only thing Xianxia has going for it is turning the power level up to eleven, even if that utterly breaks worldbuilding.
