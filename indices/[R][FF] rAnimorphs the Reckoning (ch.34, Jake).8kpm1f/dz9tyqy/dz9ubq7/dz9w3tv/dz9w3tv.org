You might add a sentence about this after "people had already tried kidnapping Controllers, and nobody had gotten away with it yet". Something like, "also, according to Marco, they'd already tried having Ax eat parts of a yeerk morph, and it hadn't seem to work".

(although, while I'm overthinking things, whatever process Visser 3 used would need to have been available and known to him when he infested Alloran, and workable with Andalite technology at most; it could have been deduced by Seerow, but not by the Arn)
