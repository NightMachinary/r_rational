OMG, now Cassie is truly gone? No one even has her as morph? That makes no sense with the Ellimist's involvement. He would have predicted exactly what would happen to her when he manipulates her choice and she stays. Why would the Ellimist go out of his way to get Cassie killed?

Who still has an Elfangor morph? Has Ax one?
