I'm very back-logged on my reading, and just got to this... but you said comments help so I guess I just want to confirm that I'm reading and enjoying and this is always /so good/

Intricate plot and the passage of time mean I'm almost certainly missing things and forgetting things, so I'm going to have to read it all again at some point... I'm sure I'll enjoy it even more when read clean through at a pace that allows me to make all the connections.
