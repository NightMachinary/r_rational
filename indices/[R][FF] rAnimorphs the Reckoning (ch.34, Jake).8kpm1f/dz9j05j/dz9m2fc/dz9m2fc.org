It sounds like Temrash is already benefiting from the morph-stasis, having gone for nine weeks without Kandrona so far by virtue of being inside of Ax while he morphs. There could be a layering trick they could use, where Temrash morphs into themself and then Ax morphs with morph-Temrash in his brain, but I'm not sure whether that would have multiplicative effects on Temrash's remaining time, or if it would provide no benefit whatsoever.
