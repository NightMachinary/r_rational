Long time reader, then [[/r/rational][r/rational]] lurker, and now Patreon supporter, here. I just wanted to leave some comments and thank you for such an enjoyable story! Animorphs has always been close to my heart and, after HPMOR, so is rational writing. You're seriously killing it with this series.

I'm continuously impressed by how consistent the quality of your writing is and how consistently engaging the plot is. Talking about this chapter specifically, I think many rational narratives fall prey to long and tedious internal/external conversations, but yours flow naturally and are very well-paced. There is enough subtext within the conversations to keep me engaged and thinking, but not so much that I have to pause, go back and re-read, or try to decipher cryptic comments. It makes the characters feel more real.

The plot/tone shift in this chapter is really refreshing. So much has changed for the characters seemingly overnight (or between chapters, to us readers) and they've essentially been given a second chance after losing badly. It feels like an Act 2 ending, and I think that helps the overall flow of the story arc - we needed some sense of where we are at in the story, and to know that it's progressing. We've been lacking some of that in the past 10 chapters or so.

One change that you might consider: [ "The meteor-" I began. ] made me think Jake was referencing the Ventura asteroid, which made me confused for a bit. It's been easy to forget the "threat" of the Andalite meteor since we, as readers, know it's not actually a threat, and the fact that Jake's been reset caused some dissonance. Maybe changing to ["The Andalite meteor-" I began.] might help? Or maybe I'm just singularly slow on the uptake regarding that part.
