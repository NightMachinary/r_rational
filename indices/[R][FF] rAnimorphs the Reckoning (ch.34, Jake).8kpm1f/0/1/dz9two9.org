Seriously, don't worry too much. I think you've established yourself as a "quality over quantity" writer by now. :P

And I think we can all see that parts of the chapter would have clearly suffered if you'd rushed it. You're basically writing the ultimate Animorphs fic (I mean, the fandom is kind of dying overall); so personally speaking, I'm absolutely okay with you taking your time, as long as it gets completed eventually.

(please don't die)
