I'll say that, after the last two chapters, I was a little apprehensive about what might come next. Maybe we'd get a cheap method of undoing the loss of several major characters, restoring the status quo. Maybe we'd have to reckon with a reduced cast of two-ish still-living characters, with the full weight of the last two chapters hanging heavy over us. Neither extreme was desirable.

Somehow you managed to find a solution that avoids /both/ problems, flows naturally from the existing state of things, and even reckons with the extended hiatus of the series. There's still hope, but the chips are further stacked against the main cast. I'm more eager to see how (and if!) they can eke a victory out of this.

Thanks so much for putting this together. You've taken a world rife with nostalgia and not just injected life into it but supercharged it, pushing it far beyond the series it echoes.
