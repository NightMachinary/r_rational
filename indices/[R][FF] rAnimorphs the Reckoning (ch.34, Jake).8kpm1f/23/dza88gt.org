  “What if we tried morphing a Yeerk again?”

  Marco had finally come up with a theory for what had happened, the one time that Garrett had attempted it.

  The morphing tech scans, he'd said. It doesn't just run off DNA. Look at your scar, or how long our hair and fingernails are. But I think---I think if the scan gets interrupted for some reason, the morphing tech tries its best anyway. Tries to extrapolate from DNA alone. And if a single Yeerk is like a finger---

  ‹We considered it. But the danger is too great. The body would be large enough to produce kandrona, but there is no guarantee that Temrash would be able to reemerge after the sharing. We do not know how a---a feral coalescion, a primal one, would behave. We could be lost forever within it---›

Found a probable solution: they could always have someone morph a feral Yeerk pool/sludge ball and then /eat/ them. Of course, the Andalite's warrior culture combined with the communal nature of the Yeerks makes this an unethical solution, but it would likely work if these characters were willing to get their hands dirty.
