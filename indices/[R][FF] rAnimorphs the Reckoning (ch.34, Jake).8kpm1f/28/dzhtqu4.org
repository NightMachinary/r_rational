Thanks for starting updating again! I'd forgotten how much I loved this story.

I've reread a few recent chapters, and I think that Rachel's monologue last chapter about not pursuing vengeance and being able to let go may be one of the more moving and heroic things I can remember reading. Since it's not about the traditional image of heroism, of fighting against adversity from without and sustaining yourself with the innate knowledge that your cause is just and righteous, that in the end you'll know you made the right choice. It's about knowing what the right thing to do is, and making that choice, accepting that there's no answer that will make you truly satisfied within yourself.
