Whaaaa - it's back! I ... don't really have much to say right now, since the story has been out of my mind for so long. Great chapter. I'm happy the characters were all resurrected, and in a way that makes complete sense and doesn't diminish the impact of what happened in the past two chapters. This is still my favorite rationalist story.
