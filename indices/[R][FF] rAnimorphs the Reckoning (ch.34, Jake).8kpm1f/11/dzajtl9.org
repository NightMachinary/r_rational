Does the information given in this chapter (insofar as Marco/Ax are reliable/able to understand the blue box tech) that morphing doesn't operate "just" off DNA (scars copied, stored morphs' most recent states (i.e. wounds) constantly updated) confirm that there's some sort of Miracleman shenanigans going on? Are they copying/uploading entire bodies to the Z-space cloud, and swapping them while maintaining continuity of consciousness via the inherent Yeerkiness of the blue box tech? It seems so, since morphing into a human puts you in control of a sapient entity with a "consciousness switch" you can toggle.

Wouldn't this imply that morphing into a human, allowing the human to be conscious for the two hours, demorphing, and then remorphing into that same human would maintain the new state of the brain, since the morph's memory of those two hours and the associated physical changes to the brain would be maintained across morphs? Or does the tech disallow this for some reason (inherently treats sapient creatures differently, maybe via mandatory memory wipes)?

(I've yet to do a reread of this fic, so forgive me if this has been asked/answered or if I'm way off base due to already established info I missed/forgot.)

Also, did Jake's (wonderfully confusing, well done!) Crayak pseudo-premonition confirm that the Yeerk race has some sort of extra-dimensional properties due to it being an offshoot of the greater Crayak entity (as another poster interpreted the "course correction" to be)? That would make a lot of sense, if true: Yeerk matter is part of the blue box tech because it's necessary to interact across dimensions. Visser Three is able to operate remote bodies because he's exploiting the dimensional stuff to bypass the "real" dimension's restrictions re space and time. And maybe Visser Three is freaked out about the Varynx (sp) because it's some sort of Crayak-based recovery process/error correction that's working to reconstitute his lost mass via "killing off" the Yeerk race.

Perhaps Crayak is soon to make an appearance on Earth, since it's about to be the biggest concentration of Yeerk in the universe? I could see that as a way to throw out a common enemy that'd dig the Animorphs out of the hole they're in, plus it'd make them relevant beyond the whole "power of the human spirit" trope since they've got some kind of Ellimist-given ability to directly gather info on space Satan.

(Also, Howlers confirmed! I hope they make an appearance because I'd love to see TK17's take on a race of uplifted, genetically-engineered murderhobos. They're basically space sharks, IIRC.)
