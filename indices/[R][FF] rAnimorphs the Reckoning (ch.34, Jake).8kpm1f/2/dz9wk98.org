While I'm flooding this thread with posts, one remark: have you thought about updating the story's Summary? The current one worked when you had a few chapters and you needed to attract a [[/r/rational][r/rational]] audience, but by now I think everyone in that demographic knows of your story whether they read it or not. You should probably think about attracting general Animorphs fan and mainstream SF fans; the "fix/sanitize/rational agents" parts might put them off.

Instead of the current summary, I would suggest the one I posted on TV tropes:

#+begin_quote
  "You know who does have brains, though?” I continued. “The Yeerks. Maybe a thousand of them already. A thousand human brains, a thousand slaves, except those slaves can't even think without their masters knowing about it. There is nothing standing in their way except us---did you get that? This isn't some movie, where humanity's going to rise up and pull some bullshit trick out of its ass. The Yeerks are /winning/. Did you not see Elfangor get eaten? Do you not understand the stakes? He was coming to /destroy the planet/ because he thought that might be the only way to stop them."
#+end_quote

(I really, really love this rant)

I think it establishes most of what you need in a few sentences:

- This an Animorphs story. The main beats of the premise (the kids met Elfangor and got powers, Elfangor died, the Yeerks control brains) are explained or implied.

- There's a first-person narrator.

- This is a retelling (as opposed to a cross-over or a fix-fic or a shipping fic) that starts around the time Elfangor gets eaten.

- The characters are really angry and terrified, and the Yeerks are freaking dangerous. They might actually win if the heroes don't pull their weight.

- The characters are rational, not because they're smarter, but because they take the time to think through the implications of their situation and their actions, and discuss them out loud. (which is something canon did really well when the author bothered)

It doesn't include the "morphing animals" part, but I think that's okay; because it's better to keep the blurb short, and because morphing animals is kind of secondary in the fic anyway.
