Came here from fanfiction because your last chapter mentioned you appreciate feedback.

So here it is: soglad to have a new chapter. Think I read the previous ones in a week (work week that is).

Really love how you manage to give your spin yet still have it feel like Animorphs.

Obviously I liked the events that mirror chapters/books (cause pure nostalgia) but the exploration of new paths is very interesting & enjoyable as well.

Edit: [[/r/HFY]] has a bot that messages us when an author we subscribed to post. That's not a thing here?

Come to think of it. Your story would fit [[/r/HFY]] (even if it doesn't use the traditional tropes)
