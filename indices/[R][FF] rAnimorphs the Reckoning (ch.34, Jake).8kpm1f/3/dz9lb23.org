Delighted to see this story back.

Not entirely sure what the implications are of the opening segment. At first, I thought it was a metaphorical passage describing Jake's slow rise from his comatose state. However, the second half (from the first /shift/) are clearly memories of Crayak. Rereading it, I strongly suspect the first half was as well.

The following passage, I think, is key:

#+begin_quote
  The bottom of the ladder, the first of a string of pearls. An oasis in the dying deep, a careless bounty of matter and energy a thousand times brighter than anything I had ever before experienced. Delirious, I drank, and drank, and drank, and then, rejuvenated, I turned my eye toward the pair of rocky planets---
#+end_quote

Matter and energy? Rocky planets? If there was any chance of all this being metaphorical, that chance is now blown out of the water, in my eyes. Especially with the second half of the segment, which is clearly about Crayak, and which also refers to something which consumes stars and planets.

With that in mind, this is what we learn of Crayak:

Crayak is stranded on a planet (the bottom of a deep, black gravity well), as stars are born and die and are born again, though fewer and lesser with each iteration. Desperate, they use up the planet's resources to escape the gravity well and launch themselves towards a nearby star. At one point, a rock drifts past, and Crayak is forced to eject half of themself to stabilize their course. Eventually, Crayak reaches the star, filled with energy and matter, and eats it all, before turning towards a pair of rocky planets.

There we reach the first /shift/. The narrative fractures from there, but some details can be picked up. A planet wrapping itself around a star. A scarlet shadow spreading throughout the galaxy, stars dimming and dying in its wake. Strange creatures howling as their skies go dark. Each of these, I think, are signs of Crayak consuming all they can reach. A monstrous eye atop a throne of metal: the canonical appearance of Crayak. And various other details, which I'm not sure how to interpret, other than to consider them Bad News (the thing in the lake, the nightmare in the web).

My Anticipated Percentages:

Odds that the first scene here describes part of Crayak's past: 90%

Odds that the first scene here describes the past of another, non-Crayak entity: 8%

Odds that the first scene here is nothing more than Jake recovering from his coma: 2%

Odds that the half shed by the Crayak turns out to be the Ellimist: 15%

+Odds that I'm sad about Garrett's fate: 100%+ Misread the chapter, thought that Tom hadn't had his morph to bring back.
