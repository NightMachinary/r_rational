You know, it's funny, with how far apart the chapters are, I keep forgetting how much I like this series.

Like, if you'd asked me two days ago, I would have said that /The Reckoning/ is maybe my 3rd favorite ongoing serial, after /Worth the Candle/ and /Ward/ and ex-aequo with /Practical Guide/ and, you know, /Girl Genius/ is pretty good too, etc.

Now? /Holy shit/ this is good and I've missed it! My ever-unsatisfied thirst for more Animorph stories is quenched for a few weeks yet again.

I think this is one of the "all the dominoes have been set up, now we push the first one" situations ("except the first one was two weeks ago and meanwhile you've been in a coma"). I really like that the fic goes into details of the logistics of setting up an open worldwide invasion. And that it's avoiding really hard the trap of Americano-centrism, and being very international instead. The parts about blackouts, confiscating nukes and oversight deals felt very real in particular.

I do hope we get a chapter or an interlude showing either the international politics or the street-level chaos from up close. This something I think Wildbow does really well in his stories, for instance: connecting the big events (Leviathan attacks) to the small-scale chaos (gangs take over, people need help everywhere, field hospitals are set up, food convoys are raided, vigilante justice becomes prevalent, etc).

It's also nice to get all our protagonists back in a way that doesn't really take away from the last two cliffhangers. The answer to "How did the group get out of this jam, how did Tobias get away, and how will Rachel survive?" is "Nope, they all died and had to be resurrected (out of cancer patients, no less) from old back-ups who don't remember the last 10 chapters of the story."

In a way, this is positive! Tom could pass along all the information they forgot (while getting back to side character status), and since they're fresh out of Ventura, they're not /too/ worn out and demotivated by weeks of mostly doing nothing while the world went crazy!

I wonder if they'll make another broadcast. "Screw you, Esplin, we're /still fucking/ alive!" (probably not)
