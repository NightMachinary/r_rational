CouteauBleu is correct (I bumped them up from eighth graders to ninth graders, so some are 14). I constantly get the criticism that my characters seem older than they are, and I constantly ignore it because of something like "just because thirteen-year-olds don't let /you/ see that they're capable of this kind of depth and maturity doesn't mean they aren't capable of it, period."
