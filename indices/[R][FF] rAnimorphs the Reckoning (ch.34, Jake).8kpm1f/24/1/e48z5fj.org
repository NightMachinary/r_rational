But the game is more about manipulating and predicting sentient minds than it is about multiplying mass times distance in clever ways. And the player (I'm acting as though it was Ellimist because thinking it was Crayak leads to too many levels of meta for me) spent a lot of time in the simulator making sure that conversation went exactly the way it did. My guess is that he was allowed to teleport one or more of them for free or cheap because Cassie "chose" to sacrifice herself for them.
