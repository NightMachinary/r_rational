This is the chapterly reminder:\\
Whoever it was that simulated the "time pause" during the Yeerk pool attack, thought it was worthwhile to teleport Erek, Tom, Ax, and Peter Levy *physically* multiple miles from the impact site, for what had to be a massive cost, but only transported Garrett, Marco, Jake, and Rachel's morph gates on the cheap.

It *really* wanted those first four, much more so than it wanted Cassie.

We can easily see Tom's, Ax's, and Eric's importance, but what about Marco's dad's?
