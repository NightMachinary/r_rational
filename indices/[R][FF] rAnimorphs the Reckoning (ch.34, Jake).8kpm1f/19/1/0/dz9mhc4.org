They don't recreate the exact same slugs each time, actually. They do keep a /majority/ of the slug the same, but as we saw in the first Aftran interlude, there's debate and tinkering and reassignment each time the pool reforms a shard. Generally, I'd expect the first shard S to be random, and its "fitness" similarly random (expected fitness 50%), and S' to be a much better fit (like 85%), and S'' still better (like 95%) and then for there to be less and less likelihood of major change after that.

As for major experimentation, they were in a stone-age mentality despite having plenty of spare compute lying around. They just hadn't really gotten around to thinking of it, yet (and didn't have a wide variety of native species to try it on).
