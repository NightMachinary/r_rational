I'm curious why the Yeerks had never engaged in major experimentation with putting different aspects or amounts of themselves into hosts prior to the Visser. It's also curious why the pool finds it to be in its interest to recreate the same individual slugs each time, rather than create new slugs with different personalities to meet some optimal specific purpose.
