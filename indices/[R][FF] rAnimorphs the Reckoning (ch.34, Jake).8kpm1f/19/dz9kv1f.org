Is there any reason why they can't just get one of the Yerk pools on their side? Like what was starting to happen in Ventura before Visser 3 interfered? Also I could have sworn that Visser three was not on the best terms with the other yerks. Maybe the animorphs need to get Axe to contact the andalites again and ask them to help get them in contact with one of the yerk pools outside visser 3's control? Perhaps one which had close relations with the pool that was killed in ventura. Maybe they could get the yerks in that pool(s) to agree to cooperative symbiosis with humans instead of enslavement in exchange for helping to take down visser 3?
