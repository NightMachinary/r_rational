Whew. That was a hell of a chapter. It's kind of cool that because the reader is getting all the exposition post-facto like Jake is, they can share a small part of his feelings.

Waking up to a world where everything has spiraled out of control is devastating, but of course one of the most important parts of Jake's character is that he always endures and soldiers on.
