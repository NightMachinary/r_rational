We're probably not going to find out the exact details, but I assume Congress is now pretty thoroughly infested and I would be interested to know if the Secretary of State got them infested before or after that plan got approved. Probably before. Also it looks like whatever they are using for brain scans is not entirely trustworthy, since the Secretary of State was revealed as a controller in one of the Visser 3 chapters, right?
