Yes yes yes yes! So happy to see this again! Thank you so much for writing this.

Like you, TK17Studios -- as mentioned elsewhere in the thread, -- I stamped Animorphs onto my soul about 15-20 years ago. Not only is this amongst my top three favourite works of fiction; it's the one I'm the most attached to for sure.

I'm super keen to see what happens next and I've been immensely worried about how dire the situation has been. Especially the whole time the ticking-David-shaped-time-bomb was right there. Now, as dire as things are, it seems like there's the possibility of hope.

What I don't get, probably because I don't have CouteauBleuâ€˜s memory related super-powers, is why they didn't keep doing the morph circle thing. Even if some of them had to mark themselves off-limits at times for information security (e.g Garret and the blue box) --- in which case update-acquire-only. Is it seen as too close to killing & death of an intelligent mind?
