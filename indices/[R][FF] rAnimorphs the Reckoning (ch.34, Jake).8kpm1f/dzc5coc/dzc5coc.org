Hi, longish time reader (started early last year) and first time commenter here.

I'll admit that early on I had some bones to pick with the series, especially compared to the original. The characters seemed a bit too different, and I felt a bit mixed about trying to make Animorphs uniformly serious.

But over time I've started to strongly enjoy this series, mainly because of the very inventive reworking of the backstory and technology. The rationality doesn't hurt either. The “flaws” I mentioned in the previous paragraph stopped feeling like a big deal once the Visser arrived on Earth and Australia sent 10,000 boomerangs to South Korea.

Regarding the current chapter: these Animorphs are insanely resilient: immortal even. But these versions of the Animorphs don't remember the “real” Animorphs' last moments, which could make things a bit odd if Marco learns about Visser One and immediately dies several times.

If humans are building Yeerk equipment there could be plenty of places on Earth to find spare rays. Of course Visser Three would be expecting that, if he knows Temrash is still alive.

Not really related to this particular chapter but do Hork-Bajir seers exist in The Reckoning?

Eagerly awaiting the next chapter. Keep up the good work!!
