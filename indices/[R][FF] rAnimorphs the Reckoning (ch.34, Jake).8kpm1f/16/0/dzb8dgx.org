There's no canonical answer as of yet as to whether the Yeerks can even use morphing tech (though I've previously speculated that they probably should be able to). The main issues seem to be:

1. A given Yeerk dissolves entirely into the coalescion, and so any nanotech that was trying to hang onto brain matter will have a hard time reassembling.

2. The control tissue /is/ Yeerk tissue, so if you're morphing into a Yeerk in particular ... can Yeerk control Yeerk? I think the control structure would just break down entirely, which might be catastrophic if you're then getting basically randomized inputs into bits and spots of a larger Yeerk mass.

Still might be worth trying compared to dying.
