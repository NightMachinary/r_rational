So now that I've thought about this a little more here's one thing that I don't think has been considered yet - what if Temrash tries to morph himself, imports everything he knows to the new coalescion, recreates a shard that mimics him as closely as possible for Ax, then stays past the limit? They'd then have a pool of their own to use.
