Very glad to see this updating again.

Previous couple of chapters might have been a better time to mention this, but I haven't been this unsettled by a villain since HPMOR!Voldemort. "Blade that falls without warning" (even though its Elfangor's title) is a great way to describe the feeling, the constant worry that even if things seem alright it might already be too late to even survive, let alone stop him.

I really enjoy seeing antagonists that are menacing for better reasons than kicking puppies (Esplin gets bonus points for being menacing while working to guarantee the health and security of all puppies).
