Finally checking in after binge reading through this whole series. I'm so glad I found this fic. You are doing great work and you're a Goddamn saint for keeping it going for this long already. This is the version of Animorphs that most fans never knew they wanted. This is what the story should have been, but wasn't allowed to be. Again, Thank you.
