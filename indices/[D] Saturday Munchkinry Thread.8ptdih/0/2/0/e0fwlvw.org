In Savage Divinity, warriors basically buff up their weapons whenever they fight. They make it lighter so they can swing it faster, or make it hit harder, or make it vibrate to cause worse injuries, or make it home in on a target, etc. All of those techniques are performed by injecting your Chi into the weapon.

But if you inject your Chi into a weapon that is bound to someone else, you die (though I don't think it was ever explained exactly what causes you to die). So you can touch someone else's weapon, and even move it around or snatch it out of an enemy's hands, but you can't buff it up without killing yourself. Effectively, a weapon bound to someone else is more useless to you than a random stick, since you can at least buff up the stick.
