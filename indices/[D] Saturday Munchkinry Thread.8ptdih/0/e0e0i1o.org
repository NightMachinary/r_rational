I don't know if you know the story Savage divinity On royal road.

But in the story there are "martial weapons" which cannot be destroyed (according to cannon as I understand it). and this is ripe for abuse. Therefore: What is the best OP weapons that can be created? (For example,I think that a very thin and sharp wire will be OP)

Additional information if yoy didn't read Savage divinity: 1) A weapon is only indestructible after being connected to a person's soul (the terminology is different in the story) and can only be used by that person afterwards. 2)a person is limited in the amount weapons he can connect to. 3) energy which closely resemble chi exist in the story universe, with it a person (after a lot of training ) can do things like make the weapon sharper, lighter, hit stronger, add reverberating for internal damege, and more. 4) there are no gunpowder! or other explosives allowed (for cannon reasons ) 5) cannot be overly mechanically complicated (think middle/dark ages blacksmith but an extremely talented one)

P.S I would very much recommend Savage divinity.( I don't think that the story is rational, although there are parts that are).
