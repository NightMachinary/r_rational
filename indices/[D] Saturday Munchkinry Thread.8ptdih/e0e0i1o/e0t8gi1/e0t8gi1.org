Taking from what other people have said, a suit of armour has too many pieces to bind to, but consider that unlike a weapon, it does not need to be injected with chi to be effective. If a group of people bind to armour parts then one person could assemble the set and use it as indestructible armour; and still have weapon slots free.

Another thing that comes to mind is [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urglg3WimHA][aluminium foil]]. I can't think of much applicaiton off the top of my head, but it's an indestructible sheet that is lightweight and lots of it can be stored in a roll. Good for storing sandwiches.
