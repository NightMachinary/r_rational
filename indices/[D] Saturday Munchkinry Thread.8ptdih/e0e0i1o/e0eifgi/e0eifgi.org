Other than a suit of armor...

How about a giant cast net? People may laugh at you for bringing fishing gear to the battlefield, but being encased in indestructible wires would counter many other weapons--a sword is useless if you're too tangled up to swing it. You can kill people with a sharp stick as your side weapon.

Also, you'd be able to retrieve delicious fish.
