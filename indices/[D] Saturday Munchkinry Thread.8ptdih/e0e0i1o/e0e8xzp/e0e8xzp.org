Create a "weapon" that's basically a suit of armor so you have indestructible armor?

I mean, I read Savage Divinity and one of the MC's weapon is a shield+sword, so why not an armor+sword? It wouldn't make you completely invincible, since you can still be burned alive in your suit of armor, or thrown about until you die from internal injuries, or just tied up and kidnapped, but it would still be an awesome indestructible armor that renders you virtually immune to piercing attacks like spears and daggers and arrows.
