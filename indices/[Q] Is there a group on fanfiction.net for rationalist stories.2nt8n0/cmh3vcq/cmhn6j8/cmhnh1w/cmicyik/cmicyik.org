It seems to me inappropriate to take other people's fics and claim them as 'rationalfic' when they might well, for all we know, disagree; and more importantly, I think the sidebar of this reddit is just plain wrong and way too inclusive. Rationalfic is (a) fic that was explicitly written in an attempt to be rationalfic or in a rationality-inspired way or (b) fic that focuses in on characters' thinking skills in a way that at least attempts, successfully or not, to transmit them to the reader.

This definition does appear to me to be perhaps less subject to acrimonious debates than the one that appears in the sidebar (we can ask the creator if they meant it as rationalfic), and also less subject to appropriating other people's stories under our own banner without asking them whether they like the label.
