Any reason why?

I'm trying to make a fairly clear and fair way to add stories that isn't based on my personal taste. At the moment I'm adding all the reasonably highly upvoted stories from this sub. I could add in that if anyone comments with a good reason I can remove one.

I vaguely remember most of the things that happen being motivation driven, most factions being driven into conflict by belief and all having plausible and ethical reasons for their actions, most problems being solved through intelligent application of knowledge, the rules being consistent.
