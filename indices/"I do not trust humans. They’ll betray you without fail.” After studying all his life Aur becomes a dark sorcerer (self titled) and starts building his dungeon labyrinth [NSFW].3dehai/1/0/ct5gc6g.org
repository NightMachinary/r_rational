I can understand the Succubus. She's a being who is clearly not human and has non-human values and utility functions. I feel the Hero broke way, /way/ too quickly.

The 'random villager girl offered power' seems perfectly logical however. She's been powerless all her life, and now she's been healed and offered things beyond her wildest dreams. Of course she's going to cling to the source.

The 10 year old is a 10 year old.

So really, the only main character issue is with the hero.
