the impression i get is less about him killing the family because they refused to bow down, but more that he would kill them because them refusing to bow down and living would mean others might get funny ideas like mutiny which would require killing far more of them or dying. so if he is in a situation where he makes a demand and isn't denied in a reasonable manner he will kill to make an example etc. but otherwise he would be fair.

to demonstrate the point, in the last chapter when he got offered a little kid as a sacrifice he didn't go and burn down the village. and when he took the burnt girl he didn't just take her, or even take her and say that this would could for the next year offering as well. instead he said that because he took one early they wont need to make another offering for 10 years, which is more then reasonable once you are within that frame of reference.
