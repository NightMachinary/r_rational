Interesting story of a rational villain and a good reason for heroes, monsters and the dungeon itself. However, for anyone who hasn't read it yet the NSFW is there because the main character is a straight up evil sorcerer who, as a human, happens to enjoy sex.

In other words, explicit sex scenes including rape (hesitate to describe it as mild as he hypnotises her so it isn't violent but still morally reprehensible) and nudity as well as a bit of gore.

As a side note, despite him being a villain, evil and a rapist he's still the best harem manga protagonist I've seen so far. This says so much more about harem mangas than this one in particular though.
