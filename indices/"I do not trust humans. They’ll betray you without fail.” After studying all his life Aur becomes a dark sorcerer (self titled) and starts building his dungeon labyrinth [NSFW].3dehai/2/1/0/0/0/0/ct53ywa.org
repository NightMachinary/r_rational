Personally i wouldnt call that evil, just selfish.

But anyhow even that could be argued. For exmaple even though there are innocent in that first village, the war that would happen if he is thought of as weak would cost far more innocents. So its actually killing a few innocent people now so you don't need to kill many more later.

You could claim that he is evil for going to them in the first place, but it is specifically shown that his effects(making their fields prosper so no one dies of hunger, protect them from bandits, etc.) Are significantly beneficial and i think they far outweigh the cost(some food, and a single maiden every year). I mean they dont give numbers, but pretty sure they get more food from his help then he is taking. And statistically the bandits take more then one girl per year, seeing as an entire village was emptied of multiple girls in one such attack

So then while he is not benevolent he is giving them a net plus in effect, is he still evil? He doesnt give them a choice, but neither does your goverment.. Your goverment also takes taxes from you in exchange for some services(far less then he is taking to be honest), are goverments evil?
