I think it only covers Rational, not Rationalist. I believe it satisfies all the characteristics, though explaining them one-by-one in detail seems pretty awkward.

For example: "Do plot events happen for a reason?". Well, sure. The protagonist just tries to get a job that interests him, has good affinity with his skills and fits his academic degree. Feels too straightforward to even be mentioned IMO.
