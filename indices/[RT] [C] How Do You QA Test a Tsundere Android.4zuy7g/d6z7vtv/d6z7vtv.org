Having finished reading this story; it says it's complete, but it really doesn't feel like it, so if that's the kind of thing that would irritate you, you might be better served looking elsewhere. It felt like the author was working up to a reasonably obvious conclusion, and then... didn't. To draw a parallel, it'd be like watching the Lion King, and have the movie end after Simba meets Timon and Pumba.

Having said that, what is there is kind of light and fluffy, very much in the style of a Japanese light novel; if you like that sort of thing, the cadence and tone will be very familiar to you, and in that respect I felt it was well done.
