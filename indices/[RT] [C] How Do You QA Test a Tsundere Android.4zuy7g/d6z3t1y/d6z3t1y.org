The story follows a guy who aims to become a QA (Quality Assurance) tester. This includes how he deals with job interviews, exams and his new job: QA testing a humanoid.

The protagonist rationally deals with all these challenges, without any special power that allows him to magically succeed. The story combines elements from real hi-tech workflow, and the hypothetical scenario of QA testing robots who act like real humans.

This idea was originally inspired by Eve no Jikan, an anime which dealt with the subject of "How human can an android get". I felt that some aspects of the anime weren't rational, since a complex product like an android will surely have to undergo serious QA before release. Hence, my story deals with this exact aspect.
