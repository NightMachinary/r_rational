This happens a lot in the army, but it's something that can happen with any big company which tries to be confidential to some degree. Though, I admit that there was a small sacrifice of "rationality" here, as I didn't want to info-dump about the job before he even got there.

Early on, explaining the exact job would require the company to arrange a special meeting between the protagonist and a knowledgeable worker. In my experience, nobody got time for that in the hi-tech industry. Especially, not when a new version of an important product is about to be released.

I'm sure it would have looked more "realistic" on the surface if he met such a worker earlier. But, in practice, I think that's actually less likely.

Granted, it's all a consequence of circumstances and the company doesn't fail to surprise with incompetence afterwards too. This is partially my indirect rant about the incompetent organizations and companies I happened to be part of ;)
