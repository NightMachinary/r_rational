That make me curious. May I ask what you felt was the "conclusion" I was building for?

Truth to be told: I didn't continue the story precisely because I no longer had any clear "conclusion" to reach, at least not as far as I could see. The original story was outlined to reach this specific ending and that's why I ended it there.

I admit that I had further plans for the story when I brainstormed. But, I doubt these "future ideas" would be things that the readers really expect/predict...
