Back to the main serial after a long bout of rewrite/re-edit-itis. The description of Doc's helmet is a bit of bonus horror for readers familiar with control theory, and can be safely read as techno-babble by everyone else. Since it's been so long since the last regular chapter, I included a link in the intro to the last chapter on Earth (Chapter 43), for those who want to refresh their memories. Enjoy!
