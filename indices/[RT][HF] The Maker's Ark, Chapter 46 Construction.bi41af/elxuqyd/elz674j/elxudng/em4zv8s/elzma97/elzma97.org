I like the story but a lot of the mental state babble goes over my head and it seems there are hundreds of issues that are need to be addressed which tends to sap the tension of the scenes as they way they are treated seems very alien,everyone is an expert. talking about things is good but having some i feel like i need to have a diagram to understand what the issue with some characters would b nice to have some show of whats the problem. Also Flicker's harem seems to keep growing despite the fact she has many problems with here current relationships seems like a coping mechanism. I feel like the stories getting very anime.with the current plot-line of the alien relief it seems the rest of earth has very little say in things as they are a more advanced race who know better and there ideas need to be implemented n earth .it all seems like the fears of mutants and supers controlling the world as a ruling class are starting to be realised. I relay like the story but it seems like things could easily get out of hand
