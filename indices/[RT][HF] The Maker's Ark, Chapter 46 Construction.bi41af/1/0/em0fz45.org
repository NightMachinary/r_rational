I have starting material for least three short stories, a probable novella, and a couple of sub-plot seeds for the next book just in the material I ended up cutting from this chapter because, although cool, it did not advance the plot enough. But you will probably eventually get to see some of Learning's interactions with the Primly Certain (one of the ships still in Earth orbit) and a bit about the Grs'thnk philosophy for warship AIs (They really, really want to avoid anything that might want to become a Berserker or deathbot.)
