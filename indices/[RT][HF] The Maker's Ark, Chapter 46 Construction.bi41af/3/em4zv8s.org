100% minor typo, but it looks like one of the hazard alert notice IDs is missing a value:

#+begin_quote
  #+begin_example
      Subsystem hazard alert notice 008153867929:  Action–defer.
      Subsystem maintenance alert notice 0081538627930:  Action–defer.
  #+end_example
#+end_quote

The first has one less digit than all of the others, looks like it should be 00815386*2*7929 rather than 008153867929
