Making a super strength/speed army introduces significant personnel management problems. How do you ensure that they're all loyal, and what do you do if they aren't? Unless he wants to spend all his time working with them - and he wouldn't, because an army like that, while useful, is hardly a solution to every problem in existence - then that would not have good ROI. And he already has an army of Orange Lanterns, which are much more versatile.

Lex Luthor is much more important to an uplift project than a super-scientist is. Yes, science is important, but DC Earth has already invented loads of tech that just needs distribution, and for that, you want a top businessman. The areas that really need new research are usually centered around magic, and both Paragon and Renegade /do/ bring experts on board for that.

And I don't understand the reference to his Lantern Corps. In both timelines, he certainly is actively involved in leading them - not micromanaging, but he's there for them, and he makes sure that they're doing what he wants done.
