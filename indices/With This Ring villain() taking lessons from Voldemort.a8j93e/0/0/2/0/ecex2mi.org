Wouldn't a rushed approach to granting yourself super-intelligence have similar risks to a rushed artificial intelligence?

What would happen to your body if you artificially increased your muscle mass without altering anything else - bone density, connective tissue, blood volume, lung capacity? Now consider what is likely to happen if you increase your cognitive speed without changing anything else about your thought processes.

The SI has improved baseline memory (perfect memory while actually wearing his rings), a high tolerance for temporary ring-accelerated perception (mostly for combat), and I think the author has indicated that he's gradually and mostly unconsciously accumulating small refinements. But he's already surrounded by people with stratospheric IQs, and yet Reed Richards remains Useless.

It's the application that's needed, and for that, he needs to be good at using his rings (for transport and construction and transmutation and self-defence), he needs to connect with the right people and get them on board and talking to each other. And that's where he has spent his time. Investing time in improving his brain is less of a priority when he can make a truce with the Sivana family, outright recruit Vril Dox, and get Captain Cold to be non-hostile and on a path vaguely in the direction of rehabilitation.
