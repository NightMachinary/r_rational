  I'm not sure what kind of power he's refusing?

More serious transhumanism, for one. He's making slow changes, but he's being a lot more conservative with it than I would. I mean, he's still got nearly baseline human cognitive capabilities! If I were in his position, I'd be spending nearly all my free time on (ring aided) research into human neuroanatomy and cognition, so that I could safely re engineer my brain piece-by-piece to become a superintelligence. Really, no matter WHAT your goals are, that's a sensible decision, since being more intelligent will help you achieve them.

From a Doylist perspective, it makes total sense he wouldn't do so, since writing a superintelligence well is nearly impossible without being a superintelligence yourself. And from a Watsonian perspective, I can write it off as him just being much more afraid of who he is changing than I am. But it's certainly not the choice I'd have made, especially now that he has a soul.
