I'll put my hand up here. Knew almost nothing about DC before reading WTR, still know very little about anything that's different to Young Justice, except that I did watch the recent Justice League movie and was very disappointed by some of the things they got horribly wrong - like their depiction of Mother Boxes. But I've read the entirety of WTR at least three times and really enjoyed it.
