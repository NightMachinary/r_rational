Well I have a long backlog. Once he established his own central power battery it seemed kinda like it was "mission accomplished" and the rest of the fic would just be a meandering power wank. Also I don't read the DC comics so none of the space characters I had any knowledge of, which you generally need in order to appreciate fanfic.
