I mean, yeah. So the main character keeps getting more powerful but what compelling conflict causes you to want to read the story? Spacebattles has a hundred power wank fics with no conflict, what makes one want to read this one? The pattern is typically : SI gets inserted into some world of fiction, usually worm. SI has an absurdly broken power that is good from the start. SI in secret builds an ever vaster empire and has no meaningful setbacks. Author quits the story.
