I mean you read a few million words of this author to get that far and you decided he was going to fuck it all up there? You got through the almost a threesome, the Kon romance, the maybe hitting on zatarra, the part where everything turns into a Greek play and that is what gave you pause? Zoat is not afraid to experiment with things that might annoy the readers which is a p big deal compared to most authors and fics I've read. He's developed something that makes me stick around for the Long haul.

In any case, I get the feeling you don't read a lot of fic and that's ok. But for an author that you like, if they're good, they'll make it easy to understand what the characters are. Zoat helpfully provides links to comic books in many chapters when introducing new characters. I've learned more about DC from him than in the shows I've watched. But if you are getting started in the fic hobby you might want to give fics where you trust the author but don't know the fandom a chance. That's how I got into Naruto stuff. I had watched the show but not that far. I read enough fic to understand what happens for the rest of the plot. And it opened the door to more fic and more crossovers.
