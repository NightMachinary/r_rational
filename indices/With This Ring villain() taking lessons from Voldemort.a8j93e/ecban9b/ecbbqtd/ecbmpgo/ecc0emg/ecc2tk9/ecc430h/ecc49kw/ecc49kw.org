  We find out that some angelic(?) Entity has been deliberately stopping Earth's tech level from increasing which is exactly opposed to Paul.

I don't remember this part. But yeah, finding out the cause of the absurdity of comic tech levels would be interesting. Since, you know, they don't obey anything like the rules in our universe. Where Tony Stark and Batman can develop in secret absurdly advanced tech only other supervillains can access, instead of every major government. That the batmobile doesn't just fail to work from 100 different software bugs that would never be found in testing on just 1 prototype and however many coders you could have working in total secrecy.
