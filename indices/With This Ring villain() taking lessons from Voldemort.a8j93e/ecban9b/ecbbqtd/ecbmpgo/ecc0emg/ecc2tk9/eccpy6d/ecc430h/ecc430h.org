Which is not really how with this ring works or what it is about. It is almost never about Paul trying to win some fight. He almost always has a trump card which we learned from the after action report with ophidichan -- that wasn't even his last resort if aliens we're about to wipe out earth.

His concerns are larger. Usually winning fights within some parameters say no civilian casualties and convincing the opponent their philosophy is flawed.

But I think the real wtr idea is that super powers aren't being applied properly. That if the super tech was being used right humanity would be uplifted. The pieces where he talks to the Belle reve prisoners are a great example esp Leonard snart. Snart could have made millions fixing global warming bit he Rob's banks -- poorly. And that's what makes this chapter so interesting. We find out that some angelic(?) Entity has been deliberately stopping Earth's tech level from increasing which is exactly opposed to Paul.
