  Paul would be more effective at just about everything if he were smarter.

The thing is, he doesn't necessarily have to make /himself/ smarter. He's operating in a comic book universe, where there are people around whose innate genius cannot readily be replicated, but a power ring can do a lot with the fruits of that genius.

He gets much better ROI by focusing his efforts on recruiting these people, rather than doing a half-baked job of imitating them. There's no way that 18 months of study could have given him enough insight to bring his intellect up to the level of, say, Dr Thaddeus Sivana Sr. And if he had focused all his efforts on /trying/ to do that, then he would have missed his chance to build a working relationship with the Sivanas.

Yes, Vril Dox was able to create a prototype boom tube with his ring. And /because the SI has Vril Dox on board, he doesn't have to work that out for himself/. He can let Dox do it, because Dox is much better suited to the job. And once Dox has worked out the details, that information can be distributed to everyone's rings, and everyone will reap the benefits. Meanwhile, if the SI had been focused primarily on enhancing his own intelligence, then Dox would still be sitting in prison being illegally studied.

And there's a lot more low-hanging fruit yet. After recent events, he may well be able to recruit Zauriel and thus greatly advance his magical research. Research that he wouldn't be good at himself, no matter how smart he is, because his soul structure isn't right to use the local magic.

Of course, being smarter /is/ useful. And if one of the many hypercognitives comes up with a safe and reliable enhancement method, /then/ I'd expect him to take it, and I'd be disappointed if he were too timid.
