Improved intelligence helps with more than just inventing shit. Reed Richards is Useless only applies thanks to Boss Smiley, we now know, and Paul would be more effective at just about everything if he were smarter. If nothing else (and there'd be a LOT else), he's be much more effective with his ring. Vril Dox managed to use his ring to recreate the functionality of a boom tube on his FIRST DAY ACTUALLY USING IT, IIRC. Now, Paul has little need for boom tubes thanks to his gimmeporting, but that's almost certainly just the tip of the iceberg of what could be done if were intelligent enough to do so. Also, I see no evidence that improving his raw processing power would be in any way dangerous, and if it is, he can just undo it. Besides, I DID say to spend time doing research into neuroanatomy and cognition first; sure, it'd take time upfront, but it'd save him time in the long run, and while early on I could see him not wanting it strongly enough to be able to use his ring to aid the efforts, that should have long since ceased to be a problem thanks to his orange enlightenment and 'want the ends, want the means' mode of operations.

And I'm not even saying to jump into everything all at once. He STILL hasn't even done that amygdala upgrade that we know by now is quite safe. He could at least reach peak human intellect. He's passively making small improvements, sure, but he's spent two years there now; that's enough time that he could have much more than minor improvements if he put even a tiny amount of effort into it.

Besides, he hasn't been afraid to fuck around with his mind in NON-enhancing ways, like lowering his testosterone production way back when (sure, he eventually turned it back up after realizing his mistake, but it proves that he's not actually that afraid of tampering with his mind, just of actually improving it for some reason).
