  I find it a little weird that the MC keeps refusing power for no apparent reason.

I'm not sure what you mean. The Paragon timeline decided against using Venom Buster, but I think the Renegade timeline makes it clear that that would not have been a simple upgrade; it would be a shift of direction.

He recently integrated a bunch of demon magic into his soul, which would have allowed him to wield demonic magic (unlike earthly magic, which he doesn't have the right arcane bits to use), opening up new opportunities. However, given the clear emotional and mental drawbacks, I think ditching it at the first opportunity was entirely understandable.

OTOH, he has collected a whole bunch of mundane and arcane technology. His power armour has phase shifting, invisibility, kinetic barriers, alchemical healing potions, and harnesses for several arcane rifles and a god-killer sword. He has specialised ammunition for fighting magic users, demons, force fields, or for non-lethal attacks. Not to mention the variety of constructs he uses.

I'm not sure what kind of power he's refusing?
