Another way to consider it is: the Paragon character has two orange rings, reflecting his greater mastery of his own desires and how they fit together into a larger picture. The Renegade, by contrast, has an orange and a yellow. He too has goals, but he often achieves them by being big and scary.

Professor Quirrelmort is primarily attuned to the yellow, I think.
