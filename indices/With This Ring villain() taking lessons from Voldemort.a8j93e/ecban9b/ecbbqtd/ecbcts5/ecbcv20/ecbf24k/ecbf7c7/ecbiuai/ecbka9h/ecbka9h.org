Something to do with Mass Effect, the game had two separate morality system for your choices in game so rather than one slider where both good actions and bad actions affects the slider, in this case being renegade and selecting paragon choices would not reduce your evil/renegade reputation and vice versa. In this case, just because the renegade does more good than evil does not affect the red timeline's reputation as he's established himself as evil. That's how I understand it, I have never played the games though.
