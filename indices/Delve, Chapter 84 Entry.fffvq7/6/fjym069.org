Could anyone point me to where people do theorycrafting for Delve? I recall a very in depth sheet with different build proposals, but I can't find where those are explained/discussed?

Actually it looks like one person's build proposals: [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1yAjPOX1M8ymatBaEgNWaZ-Ddov_G9-AQZyxAZvEHZao/htmlview]]

Edit: Also does Rain's armor have no durability limit? Will it keep building durability forever as long as it has mana and is in the dark?
