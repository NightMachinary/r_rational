Yep. You don't even get anything for subsequent months except avoiding the punishment. Some authors try to do a bit extra for patrons but I have yet to see an attempt that doesn't have some kind of issue that hurts the author's own business - for example the bonus content can segregate the paying and f2r communities, hurting conversion rates.
