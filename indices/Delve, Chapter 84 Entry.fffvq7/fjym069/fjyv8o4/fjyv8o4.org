i also wondered that but is a no, it has 2 enchantments, one gives it the max durability, something on the order or 15.000, and the second one is slowly "healing" it up to that max. once he reaches it it will stay at that. so far the armor has been building up to its potential. also once it is full it will finally be able to hold charge. right now is using it to heal itself
