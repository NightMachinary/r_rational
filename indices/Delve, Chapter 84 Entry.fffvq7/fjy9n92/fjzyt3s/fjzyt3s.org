This chapter slightly turned me around on Velika. She's acting like an Isekai protagonist, doing funny shit just because she can and not really understanding the effect she has on other people.

Except since she's not the protagonist it just comes off as stupid and dorky and a little mean.

I've seen these kind of scenes about protagonists in other stories, but it's never really resonated with me how disconcerting it is to be around someone who can easily kill you and your whole family... and then to add on top them being lol-randum-XD.

But this time? I totally get it.
