I just can't get around the whole awakening system. Seems so pay to win. So does every enchanted armor maker you see have a noble backer? They can be a wizened old man, master of their craft, but they gotta bite the bullet and go to a dungeon/wilds to find a blue under escort in order to level up? Will there craft only be improved by the max amount of their level but not by the creative "skill" they possess?

We saw the citizen mage use chanting for his spells. Was he following a system skill to chant or was his chanting created by his own creativity therefore his own "skill" provided his increase in his power?

Can a level 7 beat a level 30 with "skill" alone not necessary by his system build? We learned that martial expertise/instinct can come from a skill. We also learn that training can increase your tolerance/synchronization. So the more talent/skill you have means the more stats you have than the average other person your level? Is there a level 7 with same system build and skills have more stats than another similar level 7 because they are more talented. I would be very happy if that is the case.
