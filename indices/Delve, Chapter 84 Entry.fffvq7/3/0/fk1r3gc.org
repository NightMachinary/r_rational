To be fair, from what we've seen, the martial classes get pretty "magical" the higher you go.

Halgrave is a basic bitch warhammer build, but during his fight he basically turned into a massive golem wielding a hammer heavier than a mountain.

Velika is a swordswoman with no magic to speak of, but can speedblitz through the entire Watch.

There was that one archer Rain awakened; he was fairly low level but he was already doing things that IRL archers couldn't. At high levels, I would imagine he could duplicate his arrows mid-flight, coat them in different elements, make them follow enemies, etc. Not to mention any equipment he might have bought as well; I imagine there would be magic bows that automatically generate arrows if supplied with Stamina/Health.

Basically, martial classes are not at all similar to what you can do IRL.
