  I just can't get around the whole awakening system. Seems so pay to win. So does every enchanted armor maker you see have a noble backer? They can be a wizened old man, master of their craft, but they gotta bite the bullet and go to a dungeon/wilds to find a blue under escort in order to level up? Will there craft only be improved by the max amount of their level but not by the creative "skill" they possess?
#+end_quote

You don't get awakened without participating in killing a blue, and the only people with magic seem to be awakened so...yes. Every enchanted-armor maker either lucked into a very low-level blue that they could kill with mundane skill (and therefore have a very low level cap and low number of Skills), or they have a friend or family member or patron who took them hunting/paid to have them taken hunting. Depressing, but that's how it is.

As to advancement, people who take the Worker class can no longer level through combat, so presumably crafting classes in general gain experience by crafting.

  We saw the citizen mage use chanting for his spells. Was he following a system skill to chant or was his chanting created by his own creativity therefore his own "skill" provided his increase in his power?

I think he said that he didn't need the chanting, which suggests that it was merely an overlay on the normal system.

  Can a level 7 beat a level 30 with "skill" alone not necessary by his system build?
#+end_quote

Define "beat"? If you're talking about combat, almost certainly not in a straight fight. From what we've seen, silverplates are effectively demigods, untouchable by mere mortals. Even if you poison the person or ambush them, a level 30 simply has so many stat points and so many skills that they probably can't be one-shotted by any means a level 7 can bring to bear. That's my opinion, though. There's probably some very niche circumstance where it could happen -- for example, a level 30 Legendary-Dynamo Rain wouldn't have put any points into Strength, so he would still have a tiny number of HP and be relying on his armor, ring, and skills to keep himself safe. If a level 7 caught him unsettled in the bath, and Rain was not wearing his ring, and he wasn't using Force Ward, and he wasn't using the healing aura, and the level 7 killed him before he could turn on any of those things....

If you mean in non-combat terms, it would depend on the contest. A level 7 Worker-class blacksmith could certainly make better armor than a level 30 Light Mage.

  We learned that martial expertise/instinct can come from a skill. We also learn that training can increase your tolerance/synchronization. So the more talent/skill you have means the more stats you have than the average other person your level? Is there a level 7 with same system build and skills have more stats than another similar level 7 because they are more talented. I would be very happy if that is the case.
#+end_quote

So far as we have seen, no. Your stats are determined by the number of stat points you have, which is determined by your level. Synchronization relates to how much you get out of the stats you have, but a level 30 will always have bigger numbers.
