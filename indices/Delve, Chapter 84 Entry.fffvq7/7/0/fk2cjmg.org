Stat boosts have a limit; each stat can only be boosted upto 10 times your level, and your overall boosts can at most add upto 10 times your level.

So, Rain can, at most, increase one of his stat by +180 points. He could also raise two of his stats by 90/90 or 100/80 or 120/60, etc.

You get the point.
