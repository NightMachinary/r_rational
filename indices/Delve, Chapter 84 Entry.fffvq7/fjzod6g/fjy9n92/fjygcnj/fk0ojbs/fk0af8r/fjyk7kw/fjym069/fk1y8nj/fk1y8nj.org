Do I understand correctly that unless you want to unlock new skills, you don't really need to kill blues and raise your cap?

Seems that +Stat rings are reasonably cheap and available, and the only limitation concerning them is the "soul strain" that can be trained without raising the level cap.

Already Rain has the cheat ring that potentially gives him more stat points than his level does, and nothing prevents him from wearing more rings (even the cheap +10 ones).

The good strategy at that point seems to farm Tels to buy more +Stat rings, meanwhile training the soul, until he has enough survivability from Str, enough damage from Focus and enough resistances from Endurance to withstand his own offensive auras.
