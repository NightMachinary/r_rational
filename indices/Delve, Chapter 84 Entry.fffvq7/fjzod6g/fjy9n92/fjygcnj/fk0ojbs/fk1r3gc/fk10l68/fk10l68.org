Archer in particular seems like a really bad choice. Not only are you on the wrong side of "Linear Fighter, Quadratic Wizard", but you're a ranged-only class and probably get demolished unless you can reliably keep the enemy at range...which is not a thing that can be done.

That said, I think "fighter-based class that isn't useless" can be an interesting challenge for an author. In my LitRPG I'm starting the protagonist off with a mostly-physical-based initial build (to the extent that one skill is a build) partially as a challenge to myself. He's a reasonably smart dog and will end up grabbing some mage powers later on, but that's his starting position.
