Enjoyable chapter, but it leaves off just as things are getting exciting. Still, it was nice to see Rain being in charge for once. He spends most of his time in a party each of whom is as powerful or more powerful than him, and definitely more experienced. Here, he's the knowledgeable one bringing the newbies along. Now if Vee would fall in a well, everything would be great.

(For the record, I find Vee an annoying person but an excellent character and an interesting antagonist. I'm looking forward to her getting her comeuppance but that's not the same as wishing she were not part of the story.)
