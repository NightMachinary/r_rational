Rain's math this chapter is pretty silly; at a net mana regen of -0.005/s, keeping Purify up costs a total of 20 mana an /hour/, which he can regain in under two seconds of Focus'd Winter.

It makes sense to be using Force Ward at times in battle, and Winter when he's not at full mana, but his claim that he can't afford Purify because of the mana drain or that he's “/not going to be able to keep this going/” is wrong. Given this is a Chemical element dungeon, spamming Purify seems like a good idea.
