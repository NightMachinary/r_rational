  I was pretty disappointed with the second trilogy though. I have hope he can redeem the whole thing with the final book, if the assholes at his publisher ever decide to actually release it. I heard its been finished for years, just waiting for publication.

There have been a lot of rumors on it but no one really knew what was going on.

What we do know is that the final manuscript has been split into two and the first part /The Great Ordeal/ has a release date. So the end is nigh

I'm actually more invested in the end of this trilogy. It's been like a great big metaphysical detective story and I want the reveal. Withholding Kellhus also spared us some of his more annoying traits.
