It's been a while since I've read the books(5 years!) so my memory is fuzzy, but I recall that the whole thing was too grimdark, I had trouble relating with the new cast of POV characters, even Achamian, and the plot was progressing too slowly. Everything that's happening is merely a prelude to the second apocalypse, which will be in its own trilogy(IIRC). A lot of plot threads seem very trivial with that in mind. It's like this whole trilogy is suffering from "middle book syndrome", basically.
