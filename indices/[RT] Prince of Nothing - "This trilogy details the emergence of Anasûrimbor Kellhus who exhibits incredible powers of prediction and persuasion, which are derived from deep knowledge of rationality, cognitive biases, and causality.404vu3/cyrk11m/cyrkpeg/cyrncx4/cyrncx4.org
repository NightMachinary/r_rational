Ah, I'm glad that's the case. It's been too long.

I agree that it was the right choice to remove Kellhus as a POV character, but not because I found him annoying or anything. I actually think he's one of the best written "super genius" type characters I can think of.

No, by removing his POV the author was able to really emphasize how alien and utterly inhuman he is, as well as enabling my favorite aspect of the new series; I really enjoy the mystery revolving what his goals and motivations actually are--- I'll leave it at that to forgo any possible spoilers.

What's your problem with Kellhus? And what did you think of the new series, thus far?
