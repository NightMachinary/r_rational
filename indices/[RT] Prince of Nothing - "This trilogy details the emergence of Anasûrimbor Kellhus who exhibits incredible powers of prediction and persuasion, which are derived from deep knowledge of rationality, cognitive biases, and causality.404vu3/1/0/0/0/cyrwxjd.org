  What's your problem with Kellhus?
#+end_quote

I just...didn't like him. I was fascinated by his outlook in theory but he's kind of a dick and easy to root against, especially when we get into his sermons or he starts fucking with actually likable characters.

Removing his POV and leaving everyone in the dark about why he does what he did made him infinitely more tolerable. It also cut out more didactic elements of his character (the above-mentioned sermons and lectures) which had ran their course.

  And what did you think of the new series, thus far?
#+end_quote

I enjoyed it a lot. I don't really think that there's a new element I didn't like. The Skin-Eaters, Mimara, the issues with the Gods. Well...maybe Momemn is shaky? I'll wait to see how that ends.

May I ask what turned you off it?
