I tried starting the first book and found it poorly written, overly obscure, full of things which happen for no rational reason, full of things which make no sense and people acting in /extremely/ unreasonable ways, and also mildly offensive (rape, pedophilia etc).

At the point I got to, after a prologue with gratuitous pedophilia, some guy sets out on an important mission (leaving behind some mystical order which then commits mass suicide -- or do they? It's *cryptic*.) without any supplies, or a map, or any idea where he's going. He then wanders along in the wilderness for an unreasonably long sounding time, while apparently in some kind of drug haze, without doing anything like trying to figure out where he's going or finding food or shelter. He then gets found by some hermit, who he proceeds to think he's much more intelligent than (despite not being intelligent enough to have a map, supplies, a destination, or wilderness skills) and manipulate. At that point I quit.

Did I not get far enough? Or is this one of those things where the author is so obscure that people who don't really understand it (because there is nothing /to/ understand but cryptic nonsense) feel moved to praise it (as seems to commonly be the case with highly rated movies by directors like Nolan and Lynch)?
