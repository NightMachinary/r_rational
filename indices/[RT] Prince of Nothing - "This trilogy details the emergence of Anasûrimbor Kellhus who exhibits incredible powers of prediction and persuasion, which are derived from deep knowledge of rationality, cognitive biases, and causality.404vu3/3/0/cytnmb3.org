  At the point I got to, after a prologue with gratuitous pedophilia, some guy sets out on an important mission (leaving behind some mystical order which then commits mass suicide -- or do they? It's cryptic.) without any supplies, or a map, or any idea where he's going. He then wanders along in the wilderness for an unreasonably long sounding time, while apparently in some kind of drug haze, without doing anything like trying to figure out where he's going or finding food or shelter. He then gets found by some hermit, who he proceeds to think he's much more intelligent than (despite not being intelligent enough to have a map, supplies, a destination, or wilderness skills) and manipulate. At that point I quit.

They don't give him enough food because the maps are literally 2000 years old and the scale has been lost. (And him dying might not be a tragedy for other reasons that aren't obvious early on)

He doesn't know what to do because, again, it's a hermit order that's been within the walls for millenia. He finds the outside world discombobulating as a result.

The whole issue of just who died is not cryptic at all, it's quite clearly everyone that was contacted for reasons that are gone into.

I mean, I fully understand the criticisms about the prose and how the work has some hard to read elements but these early "issues" strike me as the least of it.
