The ability to appear wherever you want seems pretty useful for the short time frame ones. Not a lot of security precautions out there that can handle someone suddenly popping into existence.

Ten seconds - Pop into existence on a semi truck driver's lap and jackknife it into a crowd.

One minute - Same thing but with a plane and a building.

Ten minutes to a year - Pop into the White House at night and steal the nuclear football, with the goal of inciting a nuclear war. (I don't think you really have a great chance of pulling it off, but the potential death count is so high that, in terms of expected value, I think this still wins)

Decade - Use your healing powers to convince people you're a messianic figure, run for president of the US, then incite a nuclear war.

Century or more - Use your healing powers to convince people you're a messianic figure, run for president of the US, then push for policies to improve general public welfare and decrease access to birth control. Transition into a public figure with the same goals once you're done. Count on natural human lifespans to do most of your work. Maybe make a play at a nuclear war when your time is up.
