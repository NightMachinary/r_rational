For these, I think the way to get the most deaths is by spawning in a hospital nursery and going on a murder spree on infants since you don't have the time to get weapons or use them on adults.

Or maybe spawn in a shooting range, take a gun from someone and start killing. Depending on the people at a range vs. the security of a hospital it's a bit of a toss-up.

Spawn in a room where guns are kept, maybe in the house of someone who lives alone and doesn't lock them properly, and go on a rampage in the streets.

Or maybe you'd have enough time to cause a plane crash if you spawned in an airplane cabin and tried to kill the pilots. Maybe punching them as hard as you can could at least render them unconscious?

Plane crash definitely. A plane crash into a city if you can choose the right plane.

I don't think you can do more than a plane crash even with this extra time. Even if you manage to kill some people after regenerating from the crash, the police or some authorities are definitely going to stop you.

Now I think the best choice would be to spawn somewhere far from modern civilization to get away from police. Maybe near an uncontacted tribe and be a serial killer murdering them one by one. You could also combine this with a plane crash with a plane close enough to a suitable region.

You might also be able to spawn in a lab experimenting on diseases and release them into the public? Although there's the problem of getting past security.

Now the goal is to get as many people born as you can while also striving to lower average lifespan. Run as a politician maybe and make policies supporting fast food chains? Something in that line.

I'm pretty sure by this point you'd just have to wait a while until you can make lots of copies of an AI and then kill it over and over again. Maybe make a popular video game like Sims with actual simulated sapience but hide the fact from players.

Or if AI turn out to be impossible, genetically engineer a sapient species with a high reproductive rate and very short lifespan.
