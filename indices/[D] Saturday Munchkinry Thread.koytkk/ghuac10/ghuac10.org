You are a supernatural entity that feeds of death, with a catch. You know and are aware of your lifespan, which is always a fixed, set limit. It cannot be ended earlier or later than that point, though you may be restrained or damaged to the point of immobility. One thing that differs you from humans, however, is that all parts of your body can regenerate, so the loss of the limb can, eventually, be recovered from. This regeneration isn't sped up from the human norm, however. You can choose where you are initially born, though you appear for all intents and purposes to have come out of thin air. You have one goal: to maximise the number of deaths experienced by sapient beings that occur within your lifespan. Deaths that occur before or after don't matter to you at all, only deaths that happen during it. You are the only entity of your kind, and you know this. Apart from this, you are essentially a normal human being. You feel pain, but only care about it incidentally. You can be augmented as a human would, are about as smart as an average human, and have basic knowledge that a thirty-something human would have in order to end up in the position where you are initially born, as well as the knowledge described here. The final important note is that for all intents and purposes, you resemble an un-aging thirty-something year old human to outside observers, no matter the tools they use. At the end of your lifespan, your body and mind will irrecoverably perish.

Given all this, how do you maximise the number of deaths within your lifespan? For sake of argument, I've got 12 different potential lifespans here, but I'd suggest just looking at the most interesting ones. These entities do not coexist.

- Ten seconds

- One minute

- Ten minutes

- One hour

- A day

- A week

- A month

- A year

- A decade

- A century

- A millennia

- One million years

Finally, for a bonus round, let's say that you are in the position you are now (as a regular old human) and are aware that some time in the next ten years, each of the previously mentioned entities will be born, though they will be unaware of your knowledge. Do you change your life at all knowing they exist? And if you were determined to minimise their impact, what would you do?
