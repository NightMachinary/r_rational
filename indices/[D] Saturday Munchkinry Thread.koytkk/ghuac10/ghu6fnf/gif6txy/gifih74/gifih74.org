Shallow agreement;

The ability to force anyone you look at to agree with you, the form the agreement takes is up to you (what words they use to agree), when people agree with you they don't consciously change their mind about your opinion they just say whatever you wanted them to say.

Munchkin: use this power to become the ruler of as much as possible e.g. country, world, humanity as a whole. I think it'd be interesting to see how your strategy changes due to the time e.g. picking a medieval setting, modern day setting or futuristic setting and seeing how your strategy changes.

Reverse munchkin 1: The person using this ability is an American politician, you are a logger living in a remote part of Canada, you are aware who has this power, how do you stop their world domination?

Reverse munchkin 2: A cat and mouse game, much like death note, scenario, you both have this ability, and are both aware another person has a similar ability, but you don't know exactly how their power works or who is wielding it. How do you achieve the munchkin and reverse munchkin 1? I was thinking the ideal time setting for this would be modern day so that the opponent munchkin can have a variant of the ability that uses touch as opposed to having line of sight, but since this is more obvious and requires close contact they also have the ability to use their ability on illustrations of people that are visually accurate enough to be recognisable (therefore enhanced effectiveness on well known faces that are more easily recognised and attributed to them, more paintings of them, more tv appearances, etc.) and the modern time setting would give them greater access to these things but using other time settings would be interesting too or playing with the variant ability against the default/standard one.
