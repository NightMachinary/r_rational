Controlled respiration;

The user can generate heat from anywhere on their body at will, the way this heat is generated is respiration, high temperatures require large amounts of respiration therefore the user needs to be careful that they do not use too much of their body's resources, heat themselves up so high that their body sets on fire, etc.

The above can be seen as a common side effect of using the ability carelessly but can be used to the user's advantage.

The user has a very efficient fat storage capability that can store fat with 100x less space and weight than normal fat cells.

The user has blood cells with 100x greater oxygen carrying capabilities and lungs with the ability to hold 100x more oxygen and 100x faster absorption rate from the lungs to blood cells.

Respiration can be aerobic or anaerobic.

Heart, veins, capillaries, intake and exhale of air in a breath, etc. Accommodate these physiological changes so that they don't break or get damaged under the strain (if you utilise this ability to run for a very long time then muscles will be damaged as normal, this protection only ensures living won't kill you, will not protect you from the ability's use) and you appear like a normal human being externally.

Edit 1: Reverse munchkin: A medieval time period, you are a loyal knight in England under oath to protect your liege and his lands, you also serve as his advisor. A strange new pretender to the throne has risen up, you've heard stories of people and homes he's touched igniting in flames, he's a skilled swordsman and his strikes sometimes possess inhuman strength and he fights for long periods of time as if his stamina is endless, those who are lucky enough to land a hit, ending up seeing his blood on their sword, end up watching their sword burst into flames or exploding and his injuries immediately close back up. He has taken over a small plot of land previously owned by an allied kingdom, all 50 remaining knights were subdued, some out of fear, some out of respect, some like his meritocratic approach to governance and some bloodthirsty who strive to assist in his domination of England. Your liege commands 500 knights, including you, you have no allies or enemies at the moment and there is just one small kingdom in between you and the usurper, the small kingdom is currently terrified and has only 100 knights. The usurper doesn't wear a crown as they believe that those who provide benefit to his claimed lands and goals should be rewarded proportionally so even though the usurper is hot headed and they could die, the peasants have the best chance at moving up in the world and holding titles under his rule so desertion is a possibility, the main reason lots haven't yet is because only one place has been captured so they haven't proven they are strong enough yet to warrant peasants risking their life and joining him, they believe they are safer on the defence from him than on the attack for him at present. Using your position as advisor to your liege and as a knight, guide the kingdom to safety. The usurper does not make truces and won't stop attacking until the current ruler of the land they are conquering is dead and the populace is under control, once subdued they live a pleasant safe life though, kind of like Nilfgaard from the Witcher.
