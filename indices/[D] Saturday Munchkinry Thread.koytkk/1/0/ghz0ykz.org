I'm assuming the objective in your edit is about beating the dude? Because if not making a job application for becoming his knight seems a good path.

If that's not tenable because of your oath, sending someone else to make said job application that decapitating the bloke in his sleep sounds hard to heal from.

Or juat spread as much propaganda against him among the peasants as possible to ensure his isolation, and to try to turn the small kingdom against him, which may also serve as reason for them to seek an alliance with your kingdom against that usurper.

If you're leading an actual fight against him, his views on meritocracy imply some degree of empathy, slaughtering anyone vaguely allied with him en masse to piss him off without having to fight him to both stress him out and bait an ambush would work, just keep up the slaughter from a number of spread out knights told to split up and flee on horseback if he tries to intervene, since 1 sword can only do so much if no one is trying to fight him.

For the ambush, usurper's been setting other things on fire, but not himself and not directly breathing fire or anything, so leading him somewhere you can encircle him and then set everything around him on fire could work. Alternatively, stamina and a super strong sword arm is mismatched against a deep enough pitfall trap. Oil the sides and base of a pitfall trap, lure him in, then set it all ablaze.
