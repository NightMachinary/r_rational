Yes the objective of the edit was to create a reverse munchkin scenario :) I shall edit it to make that clearer.

By the way, the reason he goes for meritocracy is because he sees people as tools rather than that he has empathy, instead of only allowing people born in certain families to do stuff for him he prefers using whoever works best for the particular task at hand and encouraging them to work harder for him and gain their loyalty through rewards. :)
