*You can give people the sum total of your knowledge and skills, by high-fiving them.*\\
Once high-fived, they instantly know every piece of textbook/encyclopedic knowledge you have (not your personal knowledge), plus all your skills, ATOP of their already existing knowledge and skills.

If there is a conflict between what they already know and what they learned from you (like, say, conflicting scientific theories and definitions) they will remember both, but it would be up to them to decide which is more correct.

EDIT:

They do not realise they gained new skills/knowledge unless they try to access it.

NOTE: Knowledge here is not defined as objective knowledge. It is simply the sum of information you have, whether it is right or wrong.

Munchkin:In your lifetime, improve the life of humans and the progress of science to the point that life these 5 goalposts are acheived: a self sufficient colony on Mars, renowable sources of energy provide most of the power, human lifespan is extended to 130 years in good health, global warming is prevented, general cure/therapy for cancer is invented. Achieving personal or societal immortality is an additional bonus goal and means to extend your time to achieve the goalposts.

Reverse Munchkin: you must stop such person from succeding. You are not given knowledge who they are, and have to find out. They know you are coming to stop them, but do not know your identity either. Neither of you can kill, imprison, or harm the other, this is a gentlemanly game of wits. Reverse munchkin wins if by the time of the natural death of the munchkin, the no more than 2/5 goals are achieved by humanity. To help the Reverse Munchkin: he receives a power to give one year amnesia to people he slaps (they forget the slap as well). This power does not work on the Munchkin.
