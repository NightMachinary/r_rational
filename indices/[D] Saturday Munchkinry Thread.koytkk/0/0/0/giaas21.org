  I think the way to get the most deaths is by spawning in a hospital nursery and going on a murder spree on infants since you don't have the time to get weapons or use them on adults.

Kinda hinges on whether you count newborns as sapient. And if they do, wouldn't some other mammals count too? If pigs did you would have a much easier legal way of doing this, and could even make money off selling the sausages.
