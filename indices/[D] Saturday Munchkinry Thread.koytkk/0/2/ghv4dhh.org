Are we also allowed to choose /when/ we are born? Obviously, for most of these being born later is better than being born sooner, since that makes the population higher and the background death count (independent of anything you get up to as a nascent death god) higher. For the ten second lifespan in particular, the biggest choice is finding a 10 second window where a natural disaster is abruptly killing a large number of people. But for any of the ones less than a day, you'd want to time things so that you appear around 11AM UTC+8, since that's when the most deaths are happening per 24 hour period, simply as a matter of demographics.
