Imagine how surreal this situation is for Annad. He's sitting there trapped, with his life on the line, while two self-admitted demi-gods have an ethical argument about the value of his life and why it is or isn't okay to brutally dismember him.

I appreciated how sensible Annad was as well. Too often characters in his position are set-up for an exercise in justice porn and only are allowed to realise how out of their depth they are until they've already thrown their life away. Annad actually has some sense of self-preservation.

  “Oh, but /I'm/ not allowed to engage in bouts of violence,” said Nephthys with a pout.

  “Of course you are, when the situation warrants it,” replied Rossa.

  “No,” replied Nephthys, shaking her head. “Because every time someone comes along with some moronic plan to do harm to me or the people inside me, I'm told that I should exercise /restraint/, that I should just hold them in place for questioning --- questioning which, I might add, is never the way that /I/ would do it, which must never start or end with dismemberment or physical violence.” She glared at Annad. “Even now, this thug, you would think less of me if I sliced him up.”

One of the funniest examples of petulance i've seen: Bethel feeling hard done by because she doesn't get to inflict dismemberment on anyone.

  Valencia was trying her best to be good, and most days she thought that she was doing a damn sight better than most people were, no offense meant.

There's been theories that Val is secretly evil and that she lived an entire fake life in the doomed timeline pretending to be good just to throw everyone off. I think her entire POV this chapter puts that to rest, with the above line being a good summation.
