We had a tripple-parentheses aside in the /first/ non-Joon POV chapter to let us know that he was writing it after the fact. There's no good reason to keep reiterating that every single time a non-Joon chapter happens. From context, It seems clear to me at least that all non-Joon POV follow this general rule.
