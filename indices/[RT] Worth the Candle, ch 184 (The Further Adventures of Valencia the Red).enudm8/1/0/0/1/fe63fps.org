The exact quote from one of those triple parentheticals is:

#+begin_quote
  this is a recreation of sorts, me working backwards from information that I didn't have at the end of the last chapter, and won't have at the end of this one. The thing is, if you learned it like I learned it, it would be a drawn out, incomprehensible mess, so this is a little bit of poetic license and extrapolation on my part in order to present something coherent. I hope you don't mind.
#+end_quote

I had taken that to imply that the whole work is a retelling by Joon who is using poetic license with information others gave him after the fact to fill in chapters from other people's POV. However, it looks like you are correct that those triple parentheticals only occur in Amaryllis chapters, so you're right that we don't know if he's the author for the non-Amaryllis non-Joon POVs. And naturally, if he isn't, then we're just getting Valencia's perspective and it would disprove the Valencia-is-evil idea.
