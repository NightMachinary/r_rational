There's 'capable of violence' and there's 'capable of standing up to an entire organization willing to destroy your livelihood, that has an indeterminable amount of entads, and is /starting/ with thugs willing to destroy trees with their bare hands'. Chances are Annad is considerably more dangerous on the violence scale compared to the random person on Aerb, who is still considerably more capable of violence than the average earthling. I mean sure, someone could maybe hurt or kill Annad, but then there's his two bodyguards, and then there's the implied worse people he works for. They're just shopkeepers, not soldiers.
