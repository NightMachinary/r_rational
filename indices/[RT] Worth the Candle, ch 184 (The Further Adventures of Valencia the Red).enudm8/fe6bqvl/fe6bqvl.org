I'm torn on liking this chapter. Like another post mentions, I love when stories explore the philosophy of situations that can't exist in the real world. On one hand I like that it's an entertaining dialogue in the socratic meaning (dialectic?), but on the other hand it feels cheap. It's like the argument was put in as a strawman instead of an authentic part of the story.

Val says that the protection racket exists because of a gap in society, but that's not really the case for protection rackets. The protection rackets is the quintessential example of crime that you can /actually/ deal with by cutting off the head. Prostitution is something that can occur anytime a trade of sex for resources is economically beneficial, and drugs means that the law is always fighting against the supply/demand curve making it continually profitable. Even opportunistic crime can be a result of poverty, which is solved by fixing the rest of the world.

But protection rackets require organized groups capable of physical force, which are /known/ to be capable of physical force, to which there is no alternative force able/willing to stop it, and the people must know that nobody will stop them. If you take out any of those elements (eg by killing the face of the operation in the city), the racket collapses. People stop paying because you no longer appear invincible, you can't /actually/ fight everyone because that would bring in the real authorities, and without the income you can't maintain your force. By wiping out the heads, you do a huge blow to the operation. The solution really works. We were arguably so successful at dealing with organized crime using this model that it handicapped us when other models of crime took precedence (eg the war on drugs).

Val should know better. Perhaps she's lying to Bethel. However, Val also discusses why she's not lying in her own POV, so it wouldn't make sense to do so. Bethel only gives the weakest strawman counterarguments; she's just setting up the pins for Val to knock down.

What furthers the feeling of a straw man is that Joon's Uncle is described as having 'fantasy of retribution and justice' which is later paralleled with Bethel having the same view where she's shown to be wrong. Except that this is actually part of the solution in real life. Protection rackets had a harder time taking hold in America and were always weaker in part because of rogue actors like Joon's Uncle who get angry and handle the problem themselves when people like Annad come knocking. You can walk in and extort a candy shop in New York, but trying to do the same in Nashville just gets you shot. (Fun historical note, the first conviction in New York's Sullivan Act which made concealed carry illegal in NYC, was a man defending himself from a protection racket.)

Which brings me to why this situation feels inauthentic. Annad is too weak and nowhere in Aerb has the population been shown to be helpless. Every other locale we've been to has had plenty of people who could just kill him. I think /literally/ every locale, even when Joon and the gang aren't looking for it. City in the desert? Plenty of mages and an active guerilla war. Cranberry bay? Random strike teams in the street. Nondescript suburbs? Avatar of Goodness is patrolling around. Take a train? Heavily armed frogs with spirit weapons. Go to the library? Uther's last living knight wielding orbs of annihilation (I guess that's a special case).

How did Annad possibly survive for years to get a reputation as a strong guy? He gets caught in a second, then doesn't try anything to escape, and his enforces are just people with muscles. If he'd tried this in Li'O then the next time he came around to collect he'd die from his skull being vibrated by the shopkeeper's cousin or something. We aren't given any background on why Orrangush seems to be uniquely weak such that somebody who is so helpless can make a living from violence. Hell, maybe even plain bullets would do the job. And /if/ Annad has some secret capabilities not shown in his POV that make him bulletproof and unassailable to the martially inclined in the city, it calls into question Val's solution of turning him for her gain, since he could potentially be strong enough to cause problems.

Anyways, I like the idea of this chapter in theory, exploring how power interacts with ethics, but I feel like in execution the philosophical side of it is really weak. It doesn't seem to have the effort or verisimilitude put into it to make it either an interesting parallel to real life or a believable situation on Aerb.

Val running a candy shop is super cute though.
