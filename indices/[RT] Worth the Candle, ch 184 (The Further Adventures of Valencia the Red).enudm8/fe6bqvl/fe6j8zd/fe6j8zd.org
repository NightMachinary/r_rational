  Which brings me to why this situation feels inauthentic. Annad is too weak and nowhere in Aerb has the population been shown to be helpless. Every other locale we've been to has had plenty of people who could just kill him. I think literally every locale, even when Joon and the gang aren't looking for it. City in the desert? Plenty of mages and an active guerilla war. Cranberry bay? Random strike teams in the street. Nondescript suburbs? Avatar of Goodness is patrolling around. Take a train? Heavily armed frogs with spirit weapons. Go to the library? Uther's last living knight wielding orbs of annihilation (I guess that's a special case).

You understand that Joon is special, right? Most people wouldn't run into a specialized foreign strike team in the streets of Cranberry bay even once in their life. The whole point is that random (and not so random) encounters are thrown at Joon and team constantly. They're not /allowed/ to not get caught up in this sort of thing for more than a week or so.
