  It is my belief that removing leadership is an effective measure and that history validates this view. Once we started using RICO, we basically shattered organized crime in short order after half a century of trying. I can't speak to the conditions on Aerb, but IRL American organized crime was empowered by prohibition then existed because of organizational inertia until we finally broke them with leadership decapitation.

Thia is a systemic change you are describing. Remove the economic source for the criminal activities (prohibition) and create new laws to catch them (RICO). The analogy I would use would be one of soul magic and spirit ironically enough. Changing the system (spirit) doesn't immediately change the state (soul) of it, hence why even after prohibition it took time and work for the system to break the situation it had been in.

Here we see the opposite, killing this one guy does nothing because the system will just restore it without the systemic changes. To compare to the example you used, yes a RICO like systemic force would fix it, shooting one guy as a vigilante cop wouldn't.
