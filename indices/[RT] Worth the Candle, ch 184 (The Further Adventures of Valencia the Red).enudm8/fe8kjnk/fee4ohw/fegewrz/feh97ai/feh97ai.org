Well, she has a few advantages: she can see what any demon is doing at any point, she can read a demon's memory if she kills them, and she can hire an Empire's worth of consultant to help her as long as she doesn't mind the infosec risk.

So she could, theoretically, start a civil war that could seriously slow down Hell's efforts to track her down, by sending messages to a few specific demons and telling them "I will absolutely, definitely kill you, unless you gather your army and overthrow the government". (though doing so loses the benefit of anonymity)

She could even kill one of her generals (or their advisor) every so often and browse its memories to make sure they're not coordinating to overthrow her.
