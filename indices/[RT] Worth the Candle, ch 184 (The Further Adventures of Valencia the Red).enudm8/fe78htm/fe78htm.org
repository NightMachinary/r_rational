Before actually reading this, I want to say that I saw the chapter posted some time before going to sleep, and continued to have a dream where I read it, didn't see any mention of Valencia in the whole chapter proper, and ended up at the author notes in the end which said that you merely named this chapter this way to troll us. It was a surreal and disappointing experience.

On the positive side, not only am I now literally dreaming about your story, I can now also look forward to a chapter that is invariably better than my "first read".
