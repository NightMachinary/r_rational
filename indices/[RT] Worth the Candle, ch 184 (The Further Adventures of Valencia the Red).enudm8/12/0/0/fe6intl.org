Yeah, currently it's at 5 billion. It was 20 billion during the time of Uther.

Hmmm, my numbers might be way off though. Just read Aerb is only 30,000ish years old, but then again Celestar and her populations existed before it and cities like Cidium have existed for potentially billions of years so sapients have existed for a longass time. No idea how to guesstimate it now.
