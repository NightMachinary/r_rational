  We know from Juniper's narration that when the story takes someone else's perspective it's based on what they told him after the fact.

I don't believe this is true. IIRC we have had two quasi-POV chapters from Amaryllis that are based on what Joon believed happened after the fact and both chapters have triple parentheses comments inserted by Junper, which none of the non-Amaryllis POV's contain.

If all non-Joon POV's were after the fact recounts by Joon, for example, that would mean that the first POV of this chapter from Horus was retold by Joon. That's not impossible (Val could for some odd reason provide Joon with a plausible recount of what was going through Horus' mind) but it would be unusual.
