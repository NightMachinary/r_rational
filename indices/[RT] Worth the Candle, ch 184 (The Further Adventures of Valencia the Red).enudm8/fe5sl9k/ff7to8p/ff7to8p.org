Completely agree when you commented that they could be powerful I think of so many fantasy and d&d stories where local tough guys don't get the hint when they shouldn't be the stupid just because there are the local tough guys doesn't mean they aren't aware that they are bigger fish in the sea and sometimes they visit the pond.

You see it so often in fantasy TV and books in The Witcher in dungeons and dragons when it comes up and tries to rob a demigod and even when it's clearly obvious the demigod isn't even completely or remotely frightened or any historical reaction the thug just continues just so the hero can murder and talk to them at their hearts content and seem morally justified
