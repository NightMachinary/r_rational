  “Morally speaking,” said Nephthys, looking over to Rossa. “Why should this man live?”

  Rossa folded her arms, frowning. “All people deserve life.”

I'm reminded of an exchange from Date Night:

  “Fenn,” I said again.

  “Oh,” she said, turning back toward me, “I guess I have an ethics question.”

  “The fuck?” asked the guy with the dagger.

  “I thought you didn't want me teaching you how to be good?” I asked. [...]

  “Well Mary and Val aren't here -- that was a fucking joke, I'm not taking lessons from Val, don't look so aghast,” said Fenn. “Is it better to kill these guys, or should I just be trying to disable them?”

Not only is the parallel interesting, this time Val actually is the one teaching morality.

  The hells had their own magics, their own physics, and they had ways of reaching Aerb, if they had cause to. 
#+end_quote

I wonder if the hells could help in keeping the Void Beast away? They have just as much interest in not dying as Aerb does, they have many times the population to work on the problem, and their own magics that might help as well. It's been stated that they don't unify well, but the Void Beast seems like something they might do so for.

I love Bethel's glee at someone coming in to try to extort them. There was that line in one of the Sound and Silence chapters about Bethel seeming nearly giddy at the prospect of someone trying to break in, and this is a fun example of it.

Overall, very nice chapter.
