The infernals don't work well together, for one. I forget where it's mentioned, either statements from AW or somewhere in the story, but internals don't particularly care for each other, and it's rather difficult to get them to unify. If they did unify, the population disparity would mean they could easily conquer Aerb militarily, which Amaryllis pointed out.

Second, mortals don't all go to a singular hell when they die. When they die, they go to the upper hells preferentially, with a probability peak at the 500th hell with a long tail down from there. Even if an entire hell could agree to honor an agreement like that, an individual mortal isn't likely to end up in that hell. It would be complicated and costly to find an individual person out of all the hells that they could end up in, and then arrange for them to be transported to the place that made the initial promise. Possible, but complicated enough and with enough chance of failure that most mortals wouldn't likely be willing to risk it, even if devils weren't already known to be perfect liars and sadistic manipulators.
