totally, very good response. there's definitely evidence the devils are not trustworthy and bad at coordinating - the interesting question is /why/ - other than authorial/DM fiat, based on their inherent character.

Devils are apparently VERY smart and crafty, capable of long term planning and manipulation of humans if given the opportunity, and also immortal.

I'm not talking about them trying to convince a group of cultists to bomb a hospital - I'm talking about devils tempting Kings and Emperors with promise of personal immunity in return for systemic changes and political influence.

A coordinated effort among devils to maximize the influx of souls would look more like a successful Nazi Germany or USSR than a few scattered death cults. And wealthy, powerful people - who have a strong chance of also being selfish - would have strong incentive to cooperate if their safety in the afterlife could be guaranteed.

Devils wouldn't have to offer amnesty to large numbers of people - just the right people.

And the current system - where a large portion of the population is getting bottled - is cutting severely into their income. If they were actually smart and self interested, they would be organizing a response on the same scale as systematic bottling to combat that problem.
