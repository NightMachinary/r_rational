I think your operating under the assumption that what we've seen of the world from Joons POV is the norm. Joon is a nexus and he is surrounded by immense power but that power doesn't necessarily exist everywhere. Your average shop keeper isn't going to be a vibration mage, or any kind of mage and he might not even know any mages personally.

And while Annad may personally not be very powerful, he might belong to a group with powerful individuals. Say you shoot him, that just gives his bosses reason to make an example of you by sending a velocity mage to smear you into paste. Just like how a diplomat might not have power, he still represents it.

  Val says that the protection racket exists because of a gap in society, but that's not really the case for protection rackets. The protection rackets is the quintessential example of crime that you can actually deal with by cutting off the head.

She also say's someone else will take their place. Sure, you can continually cut off the head, which is what the police are ideally supposed to be doing; continually expending effort and resources to capture and imprison individuals who resort to violence and intimidation to profit. But what she's saying is that such men exist because society allows them to. Such men exist because in a society with poverty, people with no compunctions about violence and no other prospects will resort to that kind of behavior.

A systemic solution is remove the motivations for that kind of behavior like creating a post scarcity world or to a lesser degree, create great economic prosperity and abundant opportunities.
