I don't agree with you about the dynamics of threatening for money. It doesn't need an organized group capable of violence that everyone knows no one will do anything about. (If it did, it wouldn't happen all the time. That is a super rare situation.) It needs a target (a person who cares), and asset (the thing the person cares about) and an attacker (a person who can threaten the asset).

The attacker doesn't need to threaten the target, they need to threaten the asset. Stores are a classic asset, because they can't run away or defend themselves. Reputations are another. Careers a third.

The target being personally fierce is not relevant to this deal. Your Nashville and NY examples are equally helpless if they care about their stores. They can pay a small amount to the attacker, or lose a big amount in their asset. The only thing the Tenesee guy's belligerence gets him is a third losing option, going to jail for murdering the kid who delivers the threat.

Bethel and Val aren't immune to Annad's boss' threat because they are able to defeat him. They are immune because they don't care about the asset (in this case, being able to remain in the city and operate a candy store).
