  But protection rackets require organized groups capable of physical force, which are known to be capable of physical force, to which there is no alternative force able/willing to stop it, and the people must know that nobody will stop them.

I think the point being made is that physical force is cheap. If you get rid of one band which projects physical force as a means of intimidation, another will take its place. That's why it's said that States exist to exert a monopoly on violence: you can't end violence entirely, but you can make it so that anyone who uses it without authorization is punished.

So, the problem here isn't that there's a violent band of criminals, it's that a monopoly on violence isn't being enforced. There's no State, or an ineffectual one. To fix that, they need a group capable of inflicting violence in order to claim that monopoly for themselves (for the benefit of the people of the city, of course). I wonder where they can get one of those...
