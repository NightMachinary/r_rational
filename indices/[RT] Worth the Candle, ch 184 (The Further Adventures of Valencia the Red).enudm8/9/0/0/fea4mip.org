Somewhat tangential, but I love that a lot of magics have almost no combat utility, but are extremely important for their mundane utility. Warders, steel mages, and bone mages have all extensively changed how Aerb works, but none of them are particularly useful in a fight (bone mages being a minor exception, but they're mostly medics). In a lot of other media, these magical schools usually have a primary focus on combat, and it's usually the most visible part of magic to the reader. Tournament style things are super common to showcase magic, even if "how much can you help to make a sword?" is in a ton of cases more important, even to a military, than "how much can you defend against one?".

On the other hand, there's flower, pustule, and gem mages, where you really have to stretch to find an economical non-combat use for their magic.
