  Val says that the protection racket exists because of a gap in society, but that's not really the case for protection rackets.

  But protection rackets require organized groups [...] to which there is no alternative force able/willing to stop it, and the people must know that nobody will stop them.

You can probably see how I think those two statements would be at odds with each other, right? Besides that, Valencia readily admits that Bethel could simply kill them all:

  You could become the entity that keeps the gap closed by killing anyone who steps out of line. You could kill everyone with the temperament and training to fill that gap. But that requires time and resources, resources that you've already said you're loath to spend.

We might disagree on either the framing or the results here, but in my view, killing one person at the top creates a power vacuum, and unless there's some /persistent/ alternative force, you do temporary damage to the organization which will heal over time, unless there's some systemic change as a consequence of that decapitation. Even if you eradicate the organization entirely, that likely doesn't mean that no equivalent organization will come into being.

All Valencia is suggesting is using Annad as the counterforce.

--------------

Regarding power levels, Annad is mentioned as having a warder, and you could probably assume that he's got other mages on staff in some capacity or another. The groups that the party has fought so far are relatively above strength for their locales, but the closest example is probably Aumann, who had himself (gold mage), a revision mage, a still mage, a warder, and a velocity mage ... but he was also the most powerful man in Barren Jewel, owned a lot of properties and businesses, and in a place where there's not much expectation of law. (But Barren Jewel is also special for other reasons, and part of the reason that Aumann has more forces is because he's not just at risk from other people in Barren Jewel, he's at risk from forces around the empire that might want to take over his profitable factories.)

Most people aren't mages, and most people who /are/ mages aren't combat mages. I think bone mages are the most common, being roughly as common as physicians, but it's pretty rare for them to do anything but the same thing that physicians do, and most would be crap in combat. A handgun is enough to kill ... well, I could make a list, but the answer is "a lot of them", especially if you get the drop on them. Part of that is because most of the utility that magic provides /isn't/ combat utility, it's just that we mostly view Aerb through the lens of people repeatedly engaged in combat with one another.
