The world building doc has a few mentions of the gods, but not a ton. The most relevant information is that they aren't native to Aerb, coming from some other place. Clerics exist, and have powers, but Joon only said that clerics are different on Aerb than they are in D&D.

But yeah, only bits and pieces, not even enough information to fill half a page across the entire text.
