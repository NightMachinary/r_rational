All quotes about Aarde (excluding further use of the his name in the spell):

  Spell discovered: Aarde's Touch!

  Amaryllis stared at my lit finger. I stared at my lit finger. A small, blood-red bar popped up in my lower right field of vision. When I released the mental sense of pressure I was placing on my fingertip, the flame went out. Neat.

  “Who is Aarde?” I asked.

  “A god,” Amaryllis replied.

  Someone, somehow, convinced Aarde to get off his butt and confirm that there was no living thing left in the entire zone. I don't know who got the god to owe them a favor, but that was what they spent it on.”

  The gods all claim to have “arrived” around 30,000 BE, though they refuse to say where they had been before that time. Invreizen describes Aerb as being “thawed out”, Karakter describes it as a “fracture”, Skaduwee says “a lightening”, Aarde refers to it as a “mudslide”, and Truuk has never told the same story twice. These variable descriptions are difficult to reconcile with each other, though it's possible that they arrived in different places on Aerb, or perhaps came at different times.

So we know basically nothing about the gods besides their name and how many there are.
