It's a believable claim though, at least in the sense of rape. There was no physical interaction between Uther and her, just the hologram thing she was projecting.

The only parallel between that and rape is the feeling of helplessness when someone more powerful makes you do something you don't want to do. But without that sexual element, it's literally not rape, it has more in line with having a police officer or authority figure abuse their power and position to order you to do something you resent.
