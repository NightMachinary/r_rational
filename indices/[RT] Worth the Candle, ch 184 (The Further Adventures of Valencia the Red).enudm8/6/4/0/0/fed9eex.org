I'll try to find a link & quotes tonight but juniper in musing about his world building and his grimdark depression after Aurthur's death talked about how hell's power source instead of the big bang was suffering. You being tortured makes crops grow and food taste better, presumably deamons more happy and vital too, so the hells maximize your suffering, not out of malice, but simply following the best path to it's insentives. The opposite of this, the heat death black hole would be any paradise free from suffering for a non sadist (the Omega hell if it keeps the deal will have strong insentives to corrupt the paradise holder into a sadist and thus mitigate thier Superfund site by eventually making everything else (staff and services) be filled with mortal suffering so there is a steady background level despite the one hedonic abberation.
