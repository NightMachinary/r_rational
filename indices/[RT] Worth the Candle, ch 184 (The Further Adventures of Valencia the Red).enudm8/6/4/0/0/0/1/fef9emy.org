The last line suggests each hell has it's own way to profit from suffering:

  Hell was an ecosystem, and every part of that ecosystem fed on mortal suffering in one way or another, usually indirectly by following incentives. All the mortal species regenerated in the hells, which made them the ecological equivalent to the sun, the source of all life and energy.

  Some of this was my design. We'd done a campaign inspired by Dante's Inferno, and I'd done my best to make justifications for why hell looked so suspiciously tailored to producing suffering. I'd had more of a flourish to my design, as I hadn't really felt the need to be grounded and wanted big set pieces, but some of what I had made had been lifted directly, and even if it hadn't been, I could recognize my own fingerprints, even if I was certain that my fingers hadn't been the ones to make them. The hells were, in some sense, my sort of hells, hells that didn't really care about you and only tortured you because there was something in it for them. Infernals made people eat gross stuff because that helped make their own food taste better. People were farmed for their blood, muscle, skin, and bone, to within the limits of their enhanced post-death bodies to withstand such things.

  I felt my stomach churn. Hell #321 wasn't even one of the really bad ones. Deep down, the rules got harsher for mortals.
