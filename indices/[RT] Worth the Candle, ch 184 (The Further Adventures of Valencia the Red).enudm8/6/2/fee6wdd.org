Aside from what others already said, the story actually mentions this when they discuss the Couch Potato (the monster that mind controls people through TVs, one of the reasons the library has been shutting down tech developments).

  “Cultists,” nodded Raven. “*Not like those that worship the infernals though, because there's every indication that the entity is forthright in honoring the promises he makes.* There have been scenarios where knowledge of the entity was presented to the world at large, as you suggest, in the hopes of mutual cooperation. The result, every time, was a race to the bottom as the nations of the world attempted to be the first to get on the entity's good side. World population undergoes a precipitous drop once the entity has its toehold, until eventually the last one percent of survivors live in something approaching a paradise for a decade or two before the entity is brought to immanence. From there, it's a paradise with bodily sacrifices. The contorted writings of those living in that world are something to behold.”

This suggests that infernals do make these kinds of deals with cultists every now and then, but they usually don't keep their word.

While it's not explicitly mentioned anywhere, it's pretty clear from the in-story hints and the worldbuilding docs that infernal society is terrible at coordinating, which makes it bad at following its own incentives.

Like, in this chapter, when we hear about a demon being asked to pay taxes to contribute to the effort to stop /the only thing in the universe that could possibly threaten it/, its immediate reaction is to plan tax evasion.

So we can imagine that some infernals managed to, say, build a safe haven of eternal okay-ness and used it as an incentive to control a cult that did various horrible things in their name; and that the place lasted about 200 hundred years, until the devils who built it lost a civil war or something and some infernal gangs (who did not control the government, and thus did not benefit individually from the cult's continued activity) broke in and abducted all the cultists, and started torturing them forever.

That's beyond the fact that anybody callous and desperate enough to, say, bomb an hospital for infernals is probably not going to be very good at anticipating the consequences of their actions.

(on the other hand, one of the dragons mentioned they had good relations with infernals, so maybe /they/ have some sort of amnesty deal going on)
