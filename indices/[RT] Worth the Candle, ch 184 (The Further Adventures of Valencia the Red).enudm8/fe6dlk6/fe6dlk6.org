Huh, 2 and a half trillion infernals. That gives me an idea.

So it's estimated 100 billion humans have existed over all of history. The number of sapients across Aerb's history must be 100x that at least if not more, especially considering mass manufacture of souls and other magical fuckery. That puts us at 4 sapients per infernal.

Not enough to overwhelm them, but I'm thinking at a certain point there will either be enough to, or failing that, exceed their capacity to torture. Like, say there were 1000 mortals per infernal; there'd be so many that many of them would manage to escape the attentions of the infernals and live a relatively peaceful life out in the hells.
