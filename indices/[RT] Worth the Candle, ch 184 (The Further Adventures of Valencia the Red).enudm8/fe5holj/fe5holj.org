I always love chapters of Worth the Candle like this, because I think that they drive at the heart of one thing that Fantasy as a genre does better than every other genre and medium: the relationship between power and ethics.

In every other genre, and in the real world, the ethical restraints that are placed on people are always in the context of their personal power, which is, relatively speaking, minimal. Even when you look at someone extremely powerful, politically speaking, the strength that they wield is qualitatively different from what Bethel wields, or any other extremely powerful person in a fantasy story. Being able to order an assassination, or an extra hundred bushels of wheat, is in a moral sense not the same as being able to summon a city-destroying meteor or whatever other ability the overpowered protagonist of the day has access to. A State or Commonwealth has different duties from a person, but what happens when a single person wields equivalent or greater power? How do their duties transform? What about their limitations? And what does that say about people as a whole?

I guess what I'm trying to say is that the relationship between power and ethics is a major part of the human condition, and it's a relationship that only fantasy can explore to its fullest degree--- even though so few fantasy stories actually exploit that ability. So I'm especially glad to see it in a fantasy story that's actually good.
