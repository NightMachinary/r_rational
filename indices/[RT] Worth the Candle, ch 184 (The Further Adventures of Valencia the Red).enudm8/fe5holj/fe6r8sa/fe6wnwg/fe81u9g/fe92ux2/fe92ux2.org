There's nothing in the laws of physics that says that those chains of accountability have to be there, though. As far as the laws of physics are concerned, you could give someone a button that, when they enter a latitude and longitude and press it, a nuclear bomb is sent to those coordinates and detonated.

Those chains of accountability that are there are entirely of human design. They've been put there specifically /because/ people worried about the destructive power of nuclear bombs.
