I think were there only the one aside, in the very first non-POV chapter, and never after, then this would hold. As it is, between the first triple parentheses aside and the second, both in the first and second Amarllyis POV's, we get POV's from Val, Pallida, Grak & Bethel, all without such. It could still be a coincidence but i think there is a strong argument otherwise.
