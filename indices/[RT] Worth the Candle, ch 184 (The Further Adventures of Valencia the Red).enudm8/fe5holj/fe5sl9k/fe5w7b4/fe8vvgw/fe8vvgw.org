I think at a certain point, there is no playing "the long game" in an evil way because the limit towards infinity is that you behave like a good person to facilitate cooperation. There's a point where evil becomes inefficient, and thus stupid.

So it could argued that unless wiping out the human race is one of Valencia's short term goals, any conceivable ultra-long term goal would have her acting good. Even if you do your evil in secret, a thousand or a million evil acts with a 0.00001 % chance of being found out do add up.
