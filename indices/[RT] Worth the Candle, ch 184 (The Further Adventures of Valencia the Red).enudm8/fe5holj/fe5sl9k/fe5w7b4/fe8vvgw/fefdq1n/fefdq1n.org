How does this viewpoint interact with the existence of socially acceptable evils and socially unacceptable but good behavior?

Should a potentially immortal agent of power with long term goals always do what seems objectively moral to them (minus risk mitigation) because they might be judged for past evils in the future? Or should they rather behave like a positive example of whatever given moral norms of their time and place?
