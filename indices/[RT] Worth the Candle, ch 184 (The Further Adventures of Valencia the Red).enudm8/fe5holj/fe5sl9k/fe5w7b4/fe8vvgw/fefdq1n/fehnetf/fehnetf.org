Not every moral choice is an efficient choice, but most comicbook evil choices are inefficient when it comes to reaching complex goals that require the research and resources of many people over a very long time span. Basically, if you want a certain level of power you cannot be pure evil, because that is self-destructive. You can still be pretty immoral without being outright evil though. You want to be immoral enough to be efficient, but moral enough to make people want cooperate with you and not kill or backstab you.
