  There's been theories that Val is secretly evil and that she lived an entire fake life in the doomed timeline pretending to be good just to throw everyone off. I think her entire POV this chapter puts that to rest, with the above line being a good summation.

Oh, that. It required Val to have a... peculiar state of mind. Selfish, but at the same time completely selfless towards Valencias-from-other timelines. It was silly even then.

I'm more interested in her interjection about poisoning candy. Why did she undercut Annad? Was her remark basically self-indulgent, a result of deformation from infernal over-exposure?
