    Valencia was trying her best to be good, and most days she thought that she was doing a damn sight better than most people were, no offense meant.

  There's been theories that Val is secretly evil and that she lived an entire fake life in the doomed timeline pretending to be good just to throw everyone off. I think her entire POV this chapter puts that to rest, with the above line being a good summation.

Technically I'd argue that it doesn't. We know from Juniper's narration that when the story takes someone else's perspective it's based on what they told him after the fact. Valencia could still be pretending to be good at that point in the future just as she might have been pretending to be good in the doomed timeline. She's playing the exceptionally long game.

That said, I don't really believe she's secretly evil. I just don't think it's completely ruled out yet.
