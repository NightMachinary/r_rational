It's a lot more work and a /lot/ riskier to use the Death Note as a data source.

First, you need the name of your victim, which (if it was secret) leaks information about your sources. Second, that data has to travel to you in the physical world and can get traced.

1 in this case revealed details of his supernatural abilities and limitations. Kira came up with a plan to solve 2 and the author let him get away with it, but in a world with so much surveillance you're risking catastrophic failure with any amount of precautions.

(It also revealed that Kira cared about Ray - which cost him dearly in bits of anonymity - but so does Valencia's method wherever she picks a non-random victim.)
