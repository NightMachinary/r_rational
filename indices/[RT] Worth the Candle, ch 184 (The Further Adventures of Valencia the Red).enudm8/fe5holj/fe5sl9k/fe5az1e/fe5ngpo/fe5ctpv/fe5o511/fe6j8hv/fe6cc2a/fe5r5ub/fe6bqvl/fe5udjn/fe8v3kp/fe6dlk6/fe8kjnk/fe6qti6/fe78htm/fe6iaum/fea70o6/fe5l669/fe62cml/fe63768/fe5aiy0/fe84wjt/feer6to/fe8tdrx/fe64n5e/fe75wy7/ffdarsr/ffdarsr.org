  Ever since the theory had been brought up that she was gaining an infernal's skills absent their attributes, she had been wondering what was going on at the game-mechanical level. [...]

  There were two attributes that governed the ability to withstand stressors, Poise for withstanding social pressure[...]

This sounds awfully familiar.

  I didn't attack him. I couldn't break the peace, not over this, it would be assault by anyone's definition, and it would fuck things up for Amaryllis if I was wrong.

I think [[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/egl22m/rt_worth_the_candle_ch_177183/][all the outrage in the last thread]] about the capture missed something.

Look at Respec, ch172:

  This time, I had friends and allies around me, plus as much information about the underlying mechanics of the system as Reimer could give me [...]

  Reimer's interpretation of “effective skill” had been that it was just the base number, meaning that it would be multiplied by my abilities, rather than by whoever's abilities I had borrowed from, at least for the purposes of Symbiosis. Taken that way, my nine in Flattery was really useless, because Symbiosis would push me up into the mid-twenties. The same applied to pretty much all of the social skills I had retained.

What if Reimer was just /wrong/ about how it works? There's a whole scene about them talking through multipliers and target numbers. What if he misremembered, or it's not "taken that way", or the rules of the game layer are not a fleshed-out version of the rulebook Reimer remembers?

I think the capture is best explained by something along these lines, that Joon screwed up his social skills and we're in for a few chapters of him putting his foot in his mouth before he figures it out. Hopefully he does it before he completely runs out Solace's patience.
