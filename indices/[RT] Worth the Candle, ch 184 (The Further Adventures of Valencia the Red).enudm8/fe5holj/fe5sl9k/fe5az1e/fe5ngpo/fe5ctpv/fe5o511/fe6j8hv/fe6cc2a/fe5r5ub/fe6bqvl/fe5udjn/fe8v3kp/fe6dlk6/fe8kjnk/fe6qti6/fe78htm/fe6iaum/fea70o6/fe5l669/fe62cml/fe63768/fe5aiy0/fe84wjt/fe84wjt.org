Val's and Beth's conversations about their ideal world reminded me of [[https://twigserial.wordpress.com/category/story/arc-5-esprit-de-corpse/5-04/][Twig]]. Especially, how would they react to Helen presenting her ideal world? (Spoilers for Twig from hereon out).

  “Everything that isn't necessary to getting what we want is gone,” she said, eyes closing, as if she was vividly imagining. “There's an abundance of it all, thanks to science. Food is everywhere and it overflows and there's nothing to worry about because we have and we want and we take. We're, and by we I mean people, we're everywhere and we spill over into one another and we're all knit together, physically and mentally. It's an exquisite landscape of things that don't ever run out to see and touches and tastes and smells and mating and eating and mindless fighting and eating-mating and fighting-eating and fighting-”

  “Okay,” I said, interrupting. I paused, then when I couldn't think of what to say. “Okay.”

  Helen reached down to her plate, used a fingertip to wipe up a bit of frosting, and popped it into her mouth, sucking it off.

  “Okay,” I said, still at a bit of a loss for words.

  “That's a mental image that's going to be with me forever,” Jamie said, dropping his head down until his face was in his hands.

  “I don't see where ethics come into that world,” I said, more to see Jamie's reaction than out of curiosity.

  “No,” Jamie said. “Don't-”

  “The closer you get to perfection, the further you get from ethics,” Helen said, as if it was common sense.

Helen's similarily non-human to Bethel, but coming at it from a more... predator-like direction. She was purpose-built to be a killing machine who gets up close and personal, while Bethel was never /intended/ to be anything but a house. Their background with regards to their "creator" is a little similar, though, what with Helen being made attractive to Ibbot's precise sensibilities, and her not respecting or liking him.
