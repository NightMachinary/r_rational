  Most of the time RICO it's used more for political statement to show "this is really bad" and then gets thrown out by the judge and only the real charges are looked at.

There are two reasons for this.

The first reason is that RICO is very complex. Charging someone with RICO requires "(1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity." ([[https://www.justice.gov/jm/criminal-resource-manual-109-rico-charges][Source.]]) Each of those components has a specific legal meaning that would take a page to fully explain.

The second, more important factor is that RICO, unlike many other federal laws, is both civilly and criminally enforceable. In addition to the federal government, private entities can file RICO lawsuits. Frequently, these lawsuits are filed by somebody with a political axe to grind - there have been RICO lawsuits targeted at protestors against the DAPL, the Republican National Committee, legal marijuana dispensaries, and the financial sector. These lawsuits have a low probability of success, but the objective of plaintiffs in these cases is to harass, not necessarily to win.
