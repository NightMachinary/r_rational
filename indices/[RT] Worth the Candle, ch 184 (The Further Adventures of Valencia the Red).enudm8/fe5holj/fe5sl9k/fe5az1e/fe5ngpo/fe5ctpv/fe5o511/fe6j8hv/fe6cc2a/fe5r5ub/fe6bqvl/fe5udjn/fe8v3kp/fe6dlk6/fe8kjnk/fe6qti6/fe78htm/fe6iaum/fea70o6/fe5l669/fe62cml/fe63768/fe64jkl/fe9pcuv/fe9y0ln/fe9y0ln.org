I'm sure Arthur is more than capable of escaping from a bottomless pit; he's done it before. A black hole might work though, albeit at the cost of the rest of Aerb being destroyed. As far as "nothing" goes though, void weaponry seems like the clearer choice there. But if Fel Seed could be killed with void weaponry alone, you'd think someone would have done it by now. Maybe the void beast?
