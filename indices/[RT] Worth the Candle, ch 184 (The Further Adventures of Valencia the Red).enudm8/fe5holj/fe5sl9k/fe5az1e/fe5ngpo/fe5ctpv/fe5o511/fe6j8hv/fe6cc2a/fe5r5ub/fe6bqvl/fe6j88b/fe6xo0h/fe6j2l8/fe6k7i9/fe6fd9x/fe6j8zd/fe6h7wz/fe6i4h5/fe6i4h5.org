Lets say for the sake of argument that Annad is uniquely strong - Good enough of a fighter to subjugate a local territory but not quite able to play at Joon & Co tier. He's rare and powerful enough to take on the 1/20 event that someone he tries to extort is friends with a couple of mages and tries an ambush.

In that case, it's fruitful for Bethel to kill him. As a rare resource not easily replaced, it means he's not like some random thug they filled in who is just big and can break legs. Next time they go extorting with the 2nd best enforcer instead, they end up dead because /that/ guy can't handle dudes with 1-2 entads.
