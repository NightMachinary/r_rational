  killing one person at the top creates a power vacuum, and unless there's some persistent alternative force, you do temporary damage to the organization which will heal over time, unless there's some systemic change as a consequence of that decapitation.

We definitely disagree on how the world works in this case.

It is my belief that removing leadership is an effective measure and that history validates this view. Once we started using RICO, we basically shattered organized crime in short order after half a century of trying. I can't speak to the conditions on Aerb, but IRL American organized crime was empowered by prohibition then existed because of organizational inertia until we finally broke them with leadership decapitation. I do not /at all/ believe that if you had a Deathnote in 1933 and removed the top 500 mobsters that organized crime would just spontaneously generate again in America. (Nor does Val's statements make it seem like there's some Aerb prohibition analogue causing an unusual amount of crime.)

Yes, removing leadership causes a power vacuum, which also means that there's opportunities for infighting and a succession crisis, like with Carlo Gambino. That's probably a good thing if you're like Bethel, wanting to punish crime but not particularly caring about reducing overall deaths. Yes, inconsistently applied it means these organizations can recover eventually. But just because the organization /might/ recover years later doesn't mean it's ineffective.

As an aside, my assumption was that Aerb gun ownership / combat capability is much higher than even American standards. They're generally more prepared for disasters than most, and they have to deal with stuff like giant monsters appearing with hordes of antimemetic things you need to fight. I just assumed everyone has a couple guns (and maybe a sword or two, it is Aerb) and a high percent of the population has a CCW. Thus why it's weird to me that only 3 people without seemingly amazing combat abilities would be sufficient for a shakedown. That couldn't rob a Texas diner, let alone how I imagine an Aerbian one is kitted out.
