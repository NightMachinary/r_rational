oho. and why hasn't THIS been abused before by someone? One would think if commerce with the afterlife were possible, it would be exploited by both sides. Soul-Reapers on Aerb hired by demons to kill specific targets and let their souls transmigrate, in return for cushy spots in the afterlife. Influence traded with politicians, and so-on. Infernals would be the strongest lobby on Aerb. If they were willing to part with torturing some individuals, they could own the world!
