[[/u/cthulhuraejepsen][u/cthulhuraejepsen]], is there any way I can give you money and get physical books of this story?

I know that I can use a print shop like lulu or something else and then just toss money to your patreon, but I was wondering if you've ever considered something official. Eg, self publishing to Amazon, and then using Kindle Direct Publishing to allow us to buy legitimate copies from Amazon.
