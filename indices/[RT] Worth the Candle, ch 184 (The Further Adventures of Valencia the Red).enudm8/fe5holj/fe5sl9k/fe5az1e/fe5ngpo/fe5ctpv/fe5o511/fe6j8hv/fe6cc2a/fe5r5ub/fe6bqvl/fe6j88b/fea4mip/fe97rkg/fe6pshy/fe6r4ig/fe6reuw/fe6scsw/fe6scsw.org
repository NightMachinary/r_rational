  RICO (which is basically the doctrine of going for the leaders). So at least that systemic change didn't actually fix the issue.

RICO is a /systemic/ legal framework that enables it to go for leaders. You were the one that brought up the momentum of the criminal organizations from prohibition. My point is again that you are discussing a systemic change (e.g. people are still brought up on RICO charges today) to show why a non-systemic change (Val and Bethel killing some people before they leave town and never come back) should work.

  But IRL the St Valentine's Day massacre (7 people) caused the gang to never recover, so 3 people including a leader doesn't seem particularly ineffective.

Sure but they lost the territory to other organized crime. The repeal of prohibition meant there was less criminal activity to go around, so when these gangs took hits like the loss of their leaders they ended up dying (notably it took 7 years for the gang to actually die out after that). The point being that killing the leaders didn't really change the system, just the players.
