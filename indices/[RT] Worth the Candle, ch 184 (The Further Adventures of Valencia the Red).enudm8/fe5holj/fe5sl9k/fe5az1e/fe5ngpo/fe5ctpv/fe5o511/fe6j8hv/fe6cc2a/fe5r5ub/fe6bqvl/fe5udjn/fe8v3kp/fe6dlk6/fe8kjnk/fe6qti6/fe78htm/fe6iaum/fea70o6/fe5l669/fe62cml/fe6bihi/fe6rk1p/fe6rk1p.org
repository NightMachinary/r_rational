From my view and the commentary Valencia has about it afterwords I think she meant "all of the above" with the word "rape". In that discussing the specifics of it gets messy, but certainly everyone can agree Uther raped Bethel in one way or another. Whether from the human-sexual viewpoint, the entad-feeding viewpoint, or the emotional-abuse aspects. She chose it carefully because any of those viewpoints are valid and she can choose the path to go down as needed in the specific situation.
