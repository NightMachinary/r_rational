I agree that was my impression. This chapter does seem to imply it's possible though, and if it is merely matter of organisation, there would be massive incentives on both sides to make it work. Eternal reward for the mortals when the alternative is infinite torture or, in the best case, a CHANCE at mere non-existance is invaluable. The internals would have an incentive to keep their promises since results are verifiable via inferniscope. The ultimate result should be the worst possible hegemony, where the powerful farm souls on aerb for the demons in exchange for eternal reward. The "middle class" of employed enforcers are kept in line with the promise of being bottled, with the dim hope of progressing up the chain. It's an inverted religion, where the worst tyrants are rewarded and the innocent poor suffer forever.

Edit: in fact, demons could even short circuit this by issuing a mandate that non-anima be respected and left unharmed. Any that hurt non anima would suffer additional torture, while those that helped them are rewarded.
