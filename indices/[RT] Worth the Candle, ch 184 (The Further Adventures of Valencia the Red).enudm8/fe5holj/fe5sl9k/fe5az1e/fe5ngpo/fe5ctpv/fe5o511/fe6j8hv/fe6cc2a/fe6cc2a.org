On a completely separate note, I'm DMing a WTC-inspired PNP campaign starting this week. I included lots of the magics we've seen (flower magic, velocity magic, library magic, and wards were either not put in, or excluded). I used a version of D6 so modified its practically homebrew. Super-excited to see how it works.
