Errr, there was a 40 year gap between removing prohibition to RICO (which is basically the doctrine of going for the leaders). So at least that systemic change didn't actually fix the issue.

I may be underestimating this organization in particular, since the guy who's the face of the operations is operating low level. But IRL the St Valentine's Day massacre (7 people) caused the gang to never recover, so 3 people including a leader doesn't seem particularly ineffective.
