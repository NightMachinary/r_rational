Annad seems to do a decent amount of research, and has an unspecified number of unknown entads (admittedly, he never tries to use them, which does make it look like they're not very powerful). While it's possible a shopkeeper's cousin can take him out, it's fairly unlikely.

Moreover, most people (even trained soldiers) do not immediately jump to murder as a solution. That shopkeeper's cousin would probably try to talk to the police or make a non-lethal show of force, which allows Annad to come back later and ambush them with more goons.
