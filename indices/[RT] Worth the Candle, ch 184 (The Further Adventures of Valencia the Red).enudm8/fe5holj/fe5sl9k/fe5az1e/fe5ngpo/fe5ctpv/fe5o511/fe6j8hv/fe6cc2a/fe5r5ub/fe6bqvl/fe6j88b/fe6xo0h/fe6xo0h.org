  Annad is too weak and nowhere in Aerb has the population been shown to be helpless. Every other locale we've been to has had plenty of people who could just kill him. I think literally every locale, even when Joon and the gang aren't looking for it. City in the desert? Plenty of mages and an active guerilla war. Cranberry bay? Random strike teams in the street. Nondescript suburbs? Avatar of Goodness is patrolling around. Take a train? Heavily armed frogs with spirit weapons. Go to the library? Uther's last living knight wielding orbs of annihilation (I guess that's a special case).

All of these are examples of the GM messing with Juniper /specifically/. I think that what we're seeing here is the sort of power levels that one naturally finds when one is not hanging around in Juniper's vicinity.

  He gets caught in a second, then doesn't try anything to escape, and his enforces are just people with muscles.

On the contrary, he /keeps/ trying to escape. He looks for any gaps in the ward surrounding him (which should be almost impossible to put there). He yells a warning to his muscle as soon as he can.

The fact that Bethel just effortlessly no-sells all his attempts to escape doesn't mean that he's not trying. He's just completely and utterly outclassed.
