I suppose it would either be a different story if the devils could coordinate effectively, or the hells would need to have significantly less power than they do now. You wouldn't get a mostly peaceful world with 1940's tech if there were literally trillions of hypercompetent immortal sadistic social manipulators that could reliably affect Aerb and coordinate with each other. Aerb would be "hell 0 but with some technicalities", not something qualitatively different from the hells.
