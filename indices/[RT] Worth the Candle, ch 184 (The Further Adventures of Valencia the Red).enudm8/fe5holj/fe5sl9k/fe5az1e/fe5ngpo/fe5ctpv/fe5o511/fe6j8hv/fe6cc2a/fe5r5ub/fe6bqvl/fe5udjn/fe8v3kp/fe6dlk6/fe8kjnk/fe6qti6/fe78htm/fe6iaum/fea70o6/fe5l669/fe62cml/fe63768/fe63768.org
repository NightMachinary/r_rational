I have a theory for how Joon knows Fel Seed's weakness: His weakness is not some/thing/ that he knows, but some/one/ that he knows, explaining how even when immune to mental effects Joon didn't know what Fel Seed's weakness was. Maybe Amaryllis, but it could be a number of different people. Could even be Arthur if the "Arthur is Fel Seed" theory is wrong.
