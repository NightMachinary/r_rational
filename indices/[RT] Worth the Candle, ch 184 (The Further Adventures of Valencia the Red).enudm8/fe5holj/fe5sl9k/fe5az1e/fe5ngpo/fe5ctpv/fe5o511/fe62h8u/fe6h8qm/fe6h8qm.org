None of their answers really worked for me.

Giving everyone infinite resources doesn't really mean much since no one is capable of making everything they need nevermind the loneliness.

Even if people have infinite resources and land, they'll choose to live close with others in cities and countries and such. The idea of 'no one doing having to do anything they don't want to' is just impossible since you pretty much can't have absolute freedom in any group larger than an individual.
