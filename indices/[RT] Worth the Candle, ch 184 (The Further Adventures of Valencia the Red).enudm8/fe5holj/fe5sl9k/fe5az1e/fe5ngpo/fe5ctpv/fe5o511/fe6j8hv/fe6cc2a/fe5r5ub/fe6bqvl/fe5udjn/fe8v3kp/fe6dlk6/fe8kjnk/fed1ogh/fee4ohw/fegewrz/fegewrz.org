It's far more skewed than that... but the other way, IMO.

The most useful aspect of a Deathnote, by far, is the fine-grain control on the victim's actions, up to days at a time. In fact the killing aspect is entirely trivial in comparison. We're talking remote-Geass level of power here. That's one thing Valencia does not have on Infernals.

Contrast this lack with how the Infernals can (and do) torture new arrivals for intel, and can offer a reverse Pascal's wager benefits for further intel from the still-living, too. Plus, half of them have the same near-mind-reading skill that Valencia has exhibited so far. Even with their alleged degraded incentives for cooperation among them, they have *huge* advantages over L, Interpol and the FBI/CIA/etc.
