I wonder how many of them are the mass manufactured ones and also what those mass manufactured souls suffering is like.

Do you think it's worse to torture someone who has lived a full life as opposed to a blank slate without any experiences? If the manufactured souls are just like, developmentally stunted and barely conscious, I'd just put soul manufacture into absolute overdrive and try to inundate the Hells with overwhelming volumes of them.
