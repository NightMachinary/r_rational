I mean, Annad got literally locked in place with telekinetic force unable to move beyond speaking. It's quite possible he and his goons were otherwise competent fighters just not prepared to deal with that level of power. You can easily be good enough to take dudes with 1-2 entads or basic blood/bone magic, but not able to do squat against being full body TK restrained. Fighting Bethel from within is pretty much an Uther tier adventure.
