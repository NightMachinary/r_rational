Trying to infer the circumstances would be a major source of enjoyment for me as a reader. I might go so far as to skip most the initial exploratory phase; trying to figure out what the character has figured out would be interesting.

As for how others handle it... I'm not sure of many series that have a protagonist jumping multiple times. Perhaps the TV show Sliders?

Actually, the book series Otherland has several virtual worlds that the characters get thrown into. If I remember correctly the protagonists tend to join or get captured by locals who can explain things. When they first transfer they usually have intense action or confusion, inferring some of the more bizarre rules and perhaps losing a party member. Later the rules are explicitly stated by someone local, or explained from one protagonist to another if it is a protagonist figuring things out.
