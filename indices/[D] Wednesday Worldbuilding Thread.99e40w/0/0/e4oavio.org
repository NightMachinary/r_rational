It probably depends on how long each act is. The ratio of exploration and world-building to the plot-relevant narrative should be just enough that the reader is interested enough in the protagonist's exploration but won't get bored from too much detail. How much detail is too much is subjective, but I conceptualize it as 2 degrees of separation: the first degree is details that the protagonist directly experiences/interacts with, the second being details that there's the /potential/ of being later relevant.

More metaphorically, [[https://youtu.be/v98Zy_hP5TI?t=11m59s][Brandon Sanderson talked about the illusion of the iceberg]] (skimming through again, he has a lot of great advice for your situation starting from the iceberg analogy). So enough worldbuilding that the environment feels real and complex enough that the reader feels like the protagonist, i.e. just dumped in the setting and figuring out what the immediate priorities are. I don't think it's a big worry if your character is /reacting/ to unknown situations because unless you start huge exposition dumps, there's going to be a natural info bottleneck.
