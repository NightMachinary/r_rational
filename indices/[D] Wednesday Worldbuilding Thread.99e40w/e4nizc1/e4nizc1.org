I've been contemplating writing a story that is divided into three acts. Each act takes place in three different 'worlds' that the protagonist is thrown into and at the beginning of each act, he has to take the time to learn about the environment.

The part I'm wondering about is how much detail or time should I spend on the initial exploration phase. Because I have a decent amount planned out, but I don't know how much I really need to put in. Most of it I can just save for later in the story to introduce as they become relevant, but I also want to give the reader a sense of the circumstances/places the protagonist is dealing with. There is also the issue that this type of event is repeated three times in the story. Perhaps it would be fine since I'm improving the protagonist's ability to react to unknown situations throughout the story.

How do others handle this?
