If you have the time and skills for a project such as this one, maybe you could contribute to (or fork, I guess) efiction.org and add the features you feel are lacking. It's already widely used by fiction archives, and it's also well-known by ebook managing tools such as Calibre (by way of the FFDL plugin).
