Rational Kingdom Hearts.

A multiverse where "Light" and "Darkness" are actual types of energy that correspond with thoughts and emotions, largely misconstrued (though with fair reason) to be "Good" and "Evil," especially when regular people get consumed by Darkness and start turning into heartless/mindless monsters.

Brings up the question of "qualia" in the Nobodies, most of whom seem to be agentless husks, but a rare few who claim that their hearts/qualia are gone, even while they still feel vestiges of emotion and act with some semblance of agency and consciousness.

Sora, Riku and Kairi are rationalists whose world is one day sucked into the Darkness when Riku, believing that "Dark" deeds can be done with positive outcomes, agrees to go with a mysterious stranger that thinks they will corrupt him (and probably do, for awhile).

Organization 13 is trying to study the "soul" and perfect cloning/immortality by way of mind transfer to new hosts: Ansem is the well-intentioned extremist who wants to spread this magic-tech to all, Xehanort is his "pupil" who just wants to perfect it for himself and clone his mind into 13 powerful bodies, so as to better summon the X-Blade of legend, said to be capable of opening the TRUE Kingdom Hearts, where all hearts/souls/minds are said to be born from and return to after death, perhaps with good intention of setting them "free."

One of the things I thought of going into before I decided on Pokemon. Would be really interested to see what others might make of it.
