Power Rangers. Options include the rationality-focused approach (pick smart rangers, give them enhancements), or the "make the universe coherent and the characters non-stupid" approach, which is more fun but runs the risk of turning into a "dissect how the magic works even though it probably isn't that important" ramblefest.

First and foremost: the US Military is not going to ignore heavily armed aliens conducting combat operations on US soil, let alone near a heavily populated area. Rita does not repeat her Bicycle Ride of Doom from the first episode, because people with ICBMs tell her not to, and amost of her monsters move their battles into the desert/mountains on the grounds that they're looking for Zordon's Command Center.

Likewise, Zordon does not ignore the benefits of a high-population, heavily militarized species that is likely to side with him over his enemies. (Canon hints that he did not ignore the US military as a resource: see "Chase into Space"). However, his trumpcard is the power coins, and it turns out that the morphing technology is designed for meat brains (no morphing Alpha, who is not a superintelligence in this fic), and can have nasty side-effects if the rangers are too physically mature (hence, teenagers instead of the Navy Seals). The entire reason the Rangers have secret identities is so Zordon does not need to deal with the fallout of recruiting child soldiers from a population that is being very kind by not bombing him into oblivion. Rita could defect, here, and give this information to the public, but without Zordon as her excuse for invasion, she'd have to actually try something a little more subtle (like spreading her religion or something*).

The Machine Empire has long since conquered the majority of their light cone, and part of Lord Zedd's motivations is to /not/ get converted into paperclips (or Cogs, whichever the ME needs most at the time).

Canon portrays Zedd as skeptical of Rita's religious beliefs (She invokes spirits such as Lokar, the Wizard of Deception, and the Ghost of Darkness; Zedd refers to them as her creations, and there are subtle differences in their approaches to conquest/destruction that hint at different value systems). I bring this up because there is clearly something interesting at work with monster creation (Zedd explicitly requires an avatar for one of his creations at one point, and Scorpina once created a rock golem with a snap of her fingers), but also because The United Alliance of Evil revels in nominal "Evil" (The Machine Empire is explicitly part of the UAE, but the UAE contains numerous other aliens, monsters, and giant lava demigods). So, I have no idea how I'm going to handle that, but I'm guessing there is a (somewhat justified) religious aspect to it, and "Evil" is a mistranslation.

* But if anyone wants to write the version where SMART! Rita defects, gets Zordon in trouble for making child soldiers out of US civilians, and becomes a cult leader, much to the chagrin of Zedd when he comes back to check on her, go for it. It sounds like it could be hilarious, awesome, or both.
