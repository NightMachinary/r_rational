  The Anti-Spirals and their terror of the Spiral Nemesis had forced a retreat, but they had been overreliant on sheer brute force. Lordgenome knew better: pressure /at a point/ was power, force /applied intelligently/ was power, like a drill. The Anti-Spiral had allowed him to keep a mere million humans alive upon the planet, but that was all he needed to maintain a viable gene pool and plenty of raw material for engineering.

  People ask, "Why do you fight? Why do you kill? Why do you destroy?" And if he but succeeded, those people would know the answers, and live. /That/ would be humanity's bliss.

  His call reverberated down through the atmosphere, across the entire planet that had no idea what they faced.

  "FOOLISH HUMANS!" he bellowed, "TREMBLE before this absolute power!"

  Little could be heard over the sound of the atmosphere making its room for the reentering Cathedral Terra. His army of Beastmen provided not only a way to enforce his regime upon the surface, but a testing and proving ground for modifications to the Spiral races and the Gunmen alike. Soon, he would begin his training regime for the human race that had been so foolish as to flee into underground shelters. The Spiral King Lordgenome chuckled to himself in his throne, resting his chin on his spare left hand.

  "RISE from your knees to grasp the overwhelming hope and potential before you! To follow the path of the SPIRAL KING!"

  "To the heights of life we shall rise once more, my foolish tribe," he muttered, and flicked off the microphone.

(Well /that/ was inevitable.)
