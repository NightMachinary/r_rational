  "Fairest and Fallen, greetings, defiance, and... may I ask why you're shaped like a cat-rabbit-mascot-thing*?"

  "...Ok, no response. /<Callahan's Unfavourable Instigation>/, and don't come back."

  ...

  Dream Team:

  - Kaname "Godoka" Madoka - those who serve the Powers, themselves become the Powers. Sometimes literally.

  - Takamichi "Ace of Aces" Nanoha - for anyone wanting friendship by the terajoule (or exajoule, or...).

  - Nita Callahan - known /Sailor Moon/ cosplayer. No nickname, because names have power.

  - Taylor "You could take her" Hebert - she of many +minions+names, with space-whale-magic powers. (You couldn't take her.)

(Oh, did I mention this is set in /Worm/? Fortunately Humanity has plenty of bullshit-space-magic of it's own to fight Zion, so it still won't be a darkfic.)

  Dragon is one of Spot's siblings, so the whole "Ascalon and St George" thing is a non-starter. Tohu/Bohu is behind Dark Manhattan, and sealed away (with Lung for good measure). Leviathan is taken out by the Song of Twelve. Behemoth by the Four Treasures of Ireland. Ziz heard a cryptic prophecy ('the moon is no dream'), and left to investigate instead of trolling Earth. Sailor Moon 'purifies' Ellisburg, and probably the Birdcage too. Contessa finds that every path seems to lead to an unusually recalcitrant Transcendant Pig, and begins to wonder if the universe has a sense of humour (it does). Coil kills Madoka and discards, and Akemi Homura shows him his mistake.
