I'd argue that progressive politics is inherently confused about the meaning of the term, "religious freedom". You're not freeing anyone by forcing them to coexist with people they fundamentally disagree with and removing their rights to act on their beliefs. People are far more free if everyone can go live in homogenous societies where the ruler agrees with them, but this would require Exit-based political participation, another concept progressives seem to be fundamentally opposed to.

  Besides which, that totally tosses aside the question of which, if any, religions are actually true.

Agreed. This is about cultural continuity, not epistemology. I'm cultural Catholic, but epistemically irreligious. It doesn't change anything.
