  The story of how Lex Luthor ended up in the Gotham City correctional system was a long one, and if questioned, there was a very low chance that he would have admitted to making any mistakes. The story of how the city decided to put all their prisoners on a ferry was a long one that would no doubt be the subject of numerous hearings and court cases, no matter what ended up happening. And the story of how the Joker had planted a bomb on not one but /two/ ferries was one that was probably longer than the other two combined.

  "The Joker seems to think that he's being clever," said Lex to the prisoners and guards. He stood over the bomb, which was ticking merrily away. It had taken some talking to get to this point, but now they were looking at him as an authority, and that meant that there was plenty of time for a monologue while his brain worked at the problem. "He's trying to prove something, I suppose, about the depravity of man. If they blow us up, it proves that they're no better than we are. If we blow them up ... I suppose it's a vindication of the justice system, and I don't see how that helps him make his point, aside from getting a lot of people killed. And if neither of us blows the other up, then he just kills us himself and makes his point that way - that in the end, it doesn't matter whether you do the right thing or not, you die by the actions of a maniac anyway."

  Lex pointed out a part of the bomb. He had been very careful to keep himself to a visual inspection, and counted himself lucky that most of the mechanisms were exposed. "There. It has a number of fail-deadly mechanisms in it. The point would be subverted if we simply disabled the bombs." He frowned slightly as he stepped around the bomb. "At any rate, it seems that the Joker read something about the prisoner's dilemma, or perhaps simply arrived at this game on his own. There are a number of differences, of course. For one, there's no incentive for cooperation. For another, there's no penalty for defection. The dominant strategy, from a game theoretical perspective, is simply to press the switch as soon as humanly possible." He shot a dark look at the tall black man who'd thrown the switch out the window. "Of course, game theory is about reducing human decisions down to their core, and stripping away the ability to come at the situation from another angle. You begin talking about trolleys and tracks, and most people will ask for more details before they accept that the situation boils down to simply pulling or not pulling a lever. Throwing themselves in front of the trolley, running to untie the people, and what have you. A sensible thing to think about, but not so great for science." He reached forward and yanked out one of the wires from the bomb. A collective gasp came up from everyone around him, and despite the fact that he was sweating, Lex put on his best grin. "Don't be too excited, that was only the part connected to the timer. The receiver for the radio signal is closer to the center, and I can't get at the wire without tripping the mercury switches, which would kill us all. The Joker is more of a planner than you might expect to look at him." He looked to the guards. "I'm not saying that I would have pressed the switch, you understand. It would be just like the Joker to rig the bombs up to explode when either switch was pressed, or something equally moronic. He would find it /funny/. But I've bought us some time while the other boat contemplates whether to kill us. No doubt they're holding a vote or deciding who has to be the one to do it. Stupid, but at least more sensible than simply throwing the switch out the window."

  "We can't do anything about what they decide," said one of the guards. "Hopefully they make the right choice and figure out how to disarm their own bomb."

  "Hope is for idiots," said Lex. He looked to the ceiling. "We need to tear out those wires. I think if we still have a few minutes I might be able to make a crude Faraday cage."
