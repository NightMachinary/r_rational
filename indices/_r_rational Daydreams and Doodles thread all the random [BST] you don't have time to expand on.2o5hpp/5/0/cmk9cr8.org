"A multiverse where "Light" and "Darkness" are actual types of energy that correspond with thoughts and emotions, largely misconstrued (though with fair reason) to be "Good" and "Evil," especially when regular people get consumed by Darkness and start turning into heartless/mindless monsters."

Isn't that already canon? They're both clearly energies that can be tapped into, although Darkness is generally easier to harness and more powerful at the cost of being corrosive to the user.

There is a certain discussion to be had about the organization's nobodies, certainly, although the answer seems rather obvious. Even as early as Chain of Memories, it seems clear that they are driven by emotion to some extent. It seems that it's primarily positive emotion that they lack, leaving them with emptiness and sorrow. They act out their past emotions, desperately trying to rekindle how they felt in the past.

Your idea about Organization 13's new goal is a good one, but even in canon, one thing that struck me about Organization 13 is how utterly EASY it would be to paint themselves in a sympathetic light to Sora if they gave even a bit of effort. "Hey Sora, we've lost our hearts, we're in constant pain. We need to complete Kingdom Hearts to be whole again. Why don't you come to our castle, and we'll summon up some Heartless for you to defeat (in a series of small, manageable groups) until that happens. They're a mindless menace anyway, don't you want to get rid of as many of them as you can?"

Lastly, something would seriously have to be done to ramp the difficulty curve. Because when you think about it, Kingdom Heart's multiverse seems absurdly easy to optimize.

First you have all the utterly abuseable magic, technology and resources from the disney worlds (Lilo and Stitch's alien tech, Alladin's Genies, etc). Really, the worlds could definitely use some exchange between them, it'd allow for much improvement of quality of life.

Second, you have Ansem the Wise's technology, which is incredible beyond the likes of which the world has ever seen. He seems perfectly capable of bringing about utopia all on his own (one might note that he was responsible for making Radiant Garden a paradise) He can: 1: Upload and create backup copies of minds (and hearts) 2: Simulate at least a whole town, including its people. 3: Is seemingly capable of bringing parts of his simulation into reality, effectively allowing him to create anything that anyone could ever need.

Third, all you need to do is gather 7 strong hearts of light and 13 of darkness, have them clash, then just like that you can basically become God.
