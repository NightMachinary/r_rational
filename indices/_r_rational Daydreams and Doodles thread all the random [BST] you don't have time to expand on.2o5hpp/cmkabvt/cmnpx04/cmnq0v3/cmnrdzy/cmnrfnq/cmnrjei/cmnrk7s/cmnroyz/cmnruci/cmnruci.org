Austria-Hungary naturally dissolved into its ethnically constituent parts. The Holy Roman Empire, however, was mostly unified into a single, centralised country despite having little common heritage, two opposed religions and completely divergent interests. In the Holy Roman Empire, all imperial subjects were guaranteed religious freedom by the edict of the peace of 1555 - "Cuius regio, euis religio". Radicals tried (and suceeded in) removing this basic freedom by having people of all faiths pretend they can coexist, by ensuring that everyone has the superficial freedom of believing what they want, while nobody except the secular government has the right to act on those beliefs.
