I'm recently thinking about Worm-fanfiction where Panacea read HPMOR (or something similarly-inspiring) and decided to get creative, get back at Tattletale and save world in a process. Because her power (total control of living matter) is, IMO, horribly underthought - she can copy people (including parahumans with powers intact), brainwash with touch, solve world hunger via worldwide bacterial culture, cure every disease including death and possibly even create living starships. And instead she just heals some people, gets attacked by antagonists, breaks down emotionally, makes mistakes and gets into Superjail.
