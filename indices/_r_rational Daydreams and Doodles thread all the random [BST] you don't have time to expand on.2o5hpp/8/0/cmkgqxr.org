I know very little about Naruto, but it's totally fine to destroy the tone of the original series, so long as you let people know going in. You can rewrite /The Chronicles of Narnia/ as a teen drama, and while a lot of people won't like it because it destroys what they enjoyed about the original, there will be an entirely different set of people who always wanted to see disaffected youths walking through a land of whimsy. People like genre shifts if they're done well, because it can breathe new life into something that's already well known.
