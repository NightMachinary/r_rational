Okay, so I wanted to try and write a rational!/Naruto/. Not with particularly innovative protagonists, but ones who are both heroes in the classic sense and who behave like real people. The problem is the antagonists. There's Orochimaru (who wants to learn the secrets of the universe and rule as a god), Pain (who wants to end all suffering in the world via nuclear deterrent, a decent goal for any antagonist). Every other antagonist falls somewhere in between those two extremes, and no amount of retconning and worldbuilding can make either of them into entertaining villains.

Pain's powers include creating and controlling gravity fields, building absurdly powerful automatic weaponry/biological enhancements, energy absorption, instant death touch along with the ability to read minds like [[http://twilightsaga.wikia.com/wiki/Aro][Aro]], summoning armies of giant mutant animals/instant troop movement, a field of omniscience via the rain, redundant zombie bodies proof against mental tampering, and unlimited resurrection. If there is a way to make that list more palatable, I can't find it; every one of those powers is gamebreaking. Even in cannon, Pain has a critical shortage of common sense not once (he still had his friend's corpse by the time he learned Raise Dead) but /twice/ (killing Hinata for no sane reason, rather than using her as incentive for Naruto's cooperation), and even taking the most convoluted route to success imaginable, he nearly wins anyways.

Orochimaru is a little more workable, provided he doesn't have an immortal zombie army. I will confess that without access to Hashirama "Cheated on his character sheet" Senju, Tobirama "Munchkin" Senju, and Minato "Thousand Master" Namikaze, he's really not a very interesting character. Despite being a genius, he makes so many tactical blunders that it's almost painful. Since's he more of a sociopath than Josef Mengele, I can't think of any goals he might have that would be... interesting to write about, that don't end with unmitigated slaughter.

I won't even touch anyone who comes after Pain.

The main problem is that /Naruto/ lends itself rather well to superpowered fighting, adolescent drama, and a few other themes, but not so much realistic international conflict between people who can teleport, control minds, shoot lightning and breathe fire. I considered shifting the focus of ninja training from battle to assassination, but that obliterates the tone of the original series. It's... kind of hit a dead end. Any ideas?
