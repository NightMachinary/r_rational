Yes, there is much under utilization of abilities going on in Naruto. But that goes for both sides of the conflict. If you make both sides more intelligent I don't think it's really a foregone conclusion that one would win out over the other. Still, it would require a ton of thought, it's hard to even know where to start.

Orochimaru's focus on obtaining infinite knowledge seems like a pretty interesting pursuit if you ask me. I don't see how not having overpowered zombie slaves makes him an uninteresting character...but you're right in that Edo Tensei has to go. Way too abuseable.
