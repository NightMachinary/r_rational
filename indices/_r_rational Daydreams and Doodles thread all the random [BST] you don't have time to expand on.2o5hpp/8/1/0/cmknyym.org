It is, but I was thinking of a dilemma along the lines of---

•If he doesn't need to interact with Konoha in any way, there's no conflict.

•If he can't obliterate or permanently cripple Konoha with acceptably low risk to himself, he won't, so there's no conflict.

•If he can, or if he just abducts Sasuke with no fanfare whatsoever, there's no conflict.

I don't think either of them make serviceable obstacles for the protagonist, hence why I scrapped everything and started something else.
