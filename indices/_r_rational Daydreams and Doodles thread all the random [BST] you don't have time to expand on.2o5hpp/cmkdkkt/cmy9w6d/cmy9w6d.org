I've had the same problem! I'm working on such a thing myself, and other than a terrifyingly intelligent "AI-in-a-box" Kyubi (and yes I know Lighting Up The Dark touches on this already), I'm having a hard time finding an external threat.

Orochimaru and Danzo both have some potential if you tweaked them... the only problem is I hate both of them and don't want to make the attempt. :)

The only other thing to add - if you search ff.net for "smart naruto" you find a gajillion pieces of crap. Intelligent use of abilities alone won't be enough to get your fic to stand above the rest.
