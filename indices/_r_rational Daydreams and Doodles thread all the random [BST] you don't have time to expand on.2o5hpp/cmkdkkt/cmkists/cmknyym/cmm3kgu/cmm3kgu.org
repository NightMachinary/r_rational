Rational actors can still have motivations which are inherently irrational. In fact they should, they're still human.

You can have an Orochimaru who utilizes rational-fu in order to create actual workable plans. While still having him driven to attack Konoha because in his eyes, it wronged him.

Regardless, you can make Konoha the aggressors too. It is in their best interests to take down Orochimaru. One does not leave such a large potential enemy on the game board.
