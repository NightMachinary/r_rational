Another [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULhuewfzw04][anime-related]] doodle, this time definitely leaning to the absurdist comedy:

  Everyone took heart as the first rays peeked over the mountains. Stroheim breathed deep for the first time in what seemed like years.

  "We got him!" Smokey exclaimed, "The sun's coming up!"

  Cars' army of zombies screamed as the UV rays in the dawning daylight liquified their flesh and then burned them into dust.

  "The vampires' weakness..." noted Speedwagon, /almost/ calmly. He clenched a fist as he realized. "Cars' weakness is the light of the sun! We're saved..."

  Everyone let out their breath. They were saved. Cars was dead. No vampires, no zombies, no Ultimate Life Form, and the Red Stone of Aja preserved.

  Then Jojo noticed.

  Cars stood among the vibrant rainbows cast by the field of crystals in the light, his chin tucked down, his arms spread wide, his hair waving and fluttering in the early-morning Mediterranean breeze.

  "No!" Smokey gasped. "Cars is -- !"

  "He's turning his back on the sun," exclaimed Speedwagon, "and bathing in its light!"

  The Ultimate Life Form looked at them for the first time, and laughed the slow, deep laugh of the victorious.

  "Dear God! This is bad! Terrible!" Speedwagon stuttered.

  Cars only laughed more.

  "The Ultimate Life Form embodies the powers of each and every living being. All lives gather as one. And..." Cars breathed ecstatically, "How beautiful its shine! Truly the most wonderful thing I have ever beheld... I have finally, finally tamed the sun!" He opened his eyes and laughed again.

  TH-TH-THUMP.

  Speedwagon panicked. "He... he's invincible! He has no weaknesses! I fear not even the Ripple will work! He's immortal! Unkillable! Unmatched!"

  Now Cars was licking his lips with a slow WRRRRYYYYYYY.

  TH-TH-THUMP.

  "This is the birth of the perfect life-form, the Ultimate Being, Cars!"

  Stroheim was whispering to himself. "It's my --"

  TH-TH-THUMP.

  "Wait," puzzled Speedwagon, "What's that sound! Where is that sound coming from! It's as if someone else is arriving, approaching from behind Cars!"

  "TAME, AM I!?" cried a feminine voice from the distance, approaching rapidly with each TH-TH-THUMP.

  The creature charging at Cars was difficult to look at, as if some malign mish-masher of life forms had crossed a muscular white thoroughbred horse with a child's idea of a royal queen. It was an ivory winged unicorn, with a mane and tail of what looked to be pure Ripple energy, clad in golden armor, horseshoes, and jewelry. And, if its strange mostly-human facial expression could be read, /it was angry/.

  "MY HEART RESONATES WITH PLASMA! HEAT ENOUGH TO FUSE HYDROGEN INTO HELIUM! MY BLOOD'S BEAT IS THE BURNING DAWN! SUNLIGHT YELLOOOW OOOOOVERRRRDDUUUUUURIIIIIIIIIIIIIIVEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

  The Ultimate Life Form could not actually survive being consumed by a 5500 degree-Celsius spear of flame.

This was basically formed out of the free-associations my mind did when it saw Cars, remembered the name of the First Jojo's special attack... and /completed the pattern/.

For a further riff on Jojo (further into the same storyline as before):

#+begin_quote
  It was all down to luck now, thought Jojo. He'd known enough to raise the Red Stone of Aja into the path of Cars' Ripple burst, and that had netted him a volcanic eruption -- help from the Earth itself. He had thrown Cars off the rock, and just had to hope space would take the abomination that was the Ultimate Life Form. /Something/ had to come flying up and impact him, push him to escape velocity, /something/.

  Jojo saw his severed hand come flying up -

  And Cars dodged it effortlessly.

  "Was that really supposed to be your plan, Jojo?"

  Joseph's mouth gaped ajar. "Yes, yes it was!"

  "Well too bad!" announced Cars, "Being the Ultimate Life Form means I'm /superintelligent/! I did the kinematic calculations for this entire little /scene/ of yours five minutes ago!"
