I tried writing a ghost story for NaNoWriMo, but I ran into trouble very quickly. While the plot was very simple with the protagonist dying and investigating the rules of the afterlife with a dark rational living antagonist, there was just too much world-building to do to set-up the rules of the after-life.

The protagonist dies, drifts around as a mindless ghost until he passes a scene where the people are extremely emotionally charged. He regains full consciousness and deduces that it means ghosts need emotional energy to function. However, there is the drawback that his personality will match the emotional energy absorbed most often. For example, a ghost who constantly absorbs anger becomes a wraith, or a vengeful spirit. Different types of ghosts correlate to different emotions.

The protagonist's answer is to hang around large groups of people who are calm, since he doesn't need strong emotions, just to be around a lot of people to dilute the "emotional" overtones for the underlying fundamental energy. Which means he spends his time haunting college classes.

The antagonist is a person who can see ghosts, and knows about the emotional energy aspect. She has deduced the fact that if a ghost will absorb the emotions of many people, then when only one person is around multiple ghosts, the ghosts "attack" each other which breaks the ghosts down into energy which then can be absorbed by any living person for an increase in health. She believes ghosts aren't truly sentient and wants to find a way to use the health enhancement to help others.

It's a story where the protagonist has to be careful to not have his personality overly influenced by outside forces and faces someone who's ideology matches his, but has conflicting goals.
