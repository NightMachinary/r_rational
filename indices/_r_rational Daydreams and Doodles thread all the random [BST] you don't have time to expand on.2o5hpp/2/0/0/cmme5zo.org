The scene I have in my head for the end is Draco and Hermione nervously getting ready for her to be introduced to his parents after the conclusion of the Second Wizarding War. Sort of a "there are a lot of things to work out, but we're in it together" type of thing. It's a story about a broken person becoming less broken. Mostly I'm tired of tragedies. I don't know, odds are that it will never get past the point of being a bunch of scenes.
