I've got a bunch of half-finished crap sitting in my drafts folder. Now that NaNo is over I have some time to look at other things. But I don't just want to post half-finished crap willy-nilly in case some of it can actually be made to work as a story. So, a summary of things that are kicking around but that I'm not actually working on:

- I've got a short story about the Chinese Room, from the perspective of the Chinese room, that takes place mostly as a dialog between a man investigating the room and the room itself. But there's no conflict, and while it's a decent enough exploration of the idea, it doesn't go anywhere. In the story, the room sits at a walled border between the kingdoms of Leshwin and Amar. A representative of Amar comes to speak to the room, thinking that the slot for papers goes to an embassy office, but the room protests that it doesn't even speak Lesh, and only has an interest in Leshwin to the extent that it needs Leshian people inside it following the instructions (written in Lesh) in order to remain conscious. The representative of Amar is incredulous, and eventually goes to investigate ... and that's where I've stopped, because there didn't seem to be anywhere for it to go. I have no idea what a proper resolution would look like.

- I've got another short story that is mostly a conversation between an AI and someone acting as a gatekeeper. That one is more or less done, and can be found [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/18Xa3GTfnw4dWr1hkkc090Xl90UoSStBX5fVTtytrjME/edit?usp=sharing][here.]] It's just not very good. Someone else with more of a grasp on the issue is invited to edit it and /make/ it good, but I was a bit hampered by the fact that none of the AI wins that I'd seen were terribly convincing to me. The dialog also needs work to have a better flow, but I didn't really see the point in working on that when the arguments seemed weak.

- For a while now I've wanted to write a time-looping version of the Flash where the loop only lasts for a handful of seconds due to an unexpected nuclear explosion. It would have to be set early in the Flash's career in order for there to be things for him to learn about how the Speed Force works. Of course, the Speed Force is just absurd, so there'd have to be a balance there. Mostly I liked the kernel of the idea but couldn't figure out a way to execute it.

  He slowed time down as soon as he was back to life again. Three weeks ago, that would have sounded like insanity to him, but after the accident had happened he had spent nearly all of his time testing the boundaries of what he could do. Time wasn't actually slowed down, it was just that his brain was going so much faster that everything seemed like it was moving through molasses. He'd caught Iris in mid-blink. People's faces weren't meant to be stopped at random moments, and a decent amount of the time, especially if they were talking, they just looked silly. Iris was beautiful in that moment, with her eyes closed. She looked like she did when she was sleeping, utterly at peace with the world. Then her eyelids began moving upwards again, and she looked like she was about to sneeze.

- I have a Hermione/Draco fanfic that was supposed to be a meditation on what racists actually think. It was going to be the /American History X/ of Hermione/Draco fanfic! But then it just ended up being veiled commentary on race, and after that it ended up being the standard angsty romance between star-crossed lovers, and I don't know. Here's an excerpt:

  “Does she admit that her kind are overwhelmingly predisposed to violence, crime, indolence, and stupidity?” asked Lucius. He continued on without waiting for an answer. “I would wager that she does not. She, like others of her kind, would insist that she has a right to enjoy the fruits of wizarding society even though she was not born of it, and I have little doubt that she has designs on the destruction of our race through the further pollution of the bloodlines.” Draco's father took a sip of elderflower wine before continuing. “You must always remember that mudbloods are not truly wizards or witches at all, they are simply muggles who have managed to steal or chance upon some modicum of magical power through interbreeding. They have persistently poor scores in the N.E.W.T.s and O.W.L.s for that very reason, though Dumbledore makes every effort to keep that fact from the public eye. This ... Granger.” The named dripped from his mouth. “She succeeds only because of the intermixing that has occurred. Her inferiority drives her, and she works four times as hard to be half as good as a wizard like you.”
