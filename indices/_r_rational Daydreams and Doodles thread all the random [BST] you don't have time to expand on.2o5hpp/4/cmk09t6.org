Zombie-apocalypse scenario where eating brains adds computational power to a zombie, making it smarter. And they can eat brains of each other.

Of course, they keep humans for brain farming, and eventually the whole planet is again repopulated with humans and there is only one super-mega-smart zombie left. The Last Question or MLP:FiO ensues.
