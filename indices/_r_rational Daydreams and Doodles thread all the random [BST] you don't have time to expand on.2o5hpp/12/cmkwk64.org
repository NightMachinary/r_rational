Oh, so many...

Rational Yugioh GX, centred on Syrus, trying to work out how this whole "magic card game" thing works.

Rational Naruto, centred on Orochimaru having successfully conquered Konoha during the chunin exams, trying to munchkin the village into a military force which can beat Madara (in absence of plot armour, Hagoromo ex machina powerups, or any other shonen bullshittery).

Harry Potter/HP Lovecraft rational crossover.

Rational DBZ, centred on Gohan trying to work out how to create a stupidly large number of dragonball sets to wish everyone immortal (and Kami being supremely unhelpful and not telling him how it's done).

EDIT:

Niccolo-sensei: instead of Kakkashi, team 7 is taught by jonin sensei Niccolo Machiavelli.
