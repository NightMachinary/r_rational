- /So many/ crossovers with /Young Wizards/. The setting integrates with basically anything, and lends itself beautifully to stories with a genuine clash of values (anything from black/white to grey/grey) rather than stupid non-communication.

- Harry Potter AU in which the POV generation (and ok, others too) is actually competent. I mean, we see all these amazing things done by parents, Riddle, Dumbledore in school and then the trio just muddles through when they /know/ someone is trying to kill them? Note: /Forging the Sword/ is pretty similar, though I'd skip to later and just open with competence porn.

- High-stakes, competent magical girl megacrossover. Similar to /Haigeki/ or /Battle Fantasia Project/, but focussing on collaborating with the power of <friendship/love/magic/warm fuzzies/pink dakka/whatever> to protect Earth from all the many invaders instead of constant darkness.

- Post- /Narnia/ story in which four teenagers have all the memories, skills, and charisma of legendary royalty... and a country that needs help. Partly-done by the [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/8533][/National Service/]] series.
