Hmmm.

U-V is missing. Does "Valley of the Shadow of Death" have a meaning in Truman's world that it doesn't in ours?

It's also interesting that Meryl and Marlon, his canonical wife and best friend from the movie, don't make it past eleven in this world. It makes sense that expecting kids to lie to their "best friend" for years on end might be traumatic for them.
