How do you go about designing religions?

For my current project, I just took six things that seemed distinct enough and worked from there, trying to go backwards to find the roles that these six things would become proxies for.

- Knives
- Cups
- Keys
- Hearts
- Slugs
- Leaves

Society gets divided up into six (unequal) pieces, and each thing gets its own piece, which helps to build up an iconography that extends beyond the simple visuals.

- Knives - combat, obviously, but also anything related to cutting, division, splitting
- Cups - drinking, obviously, but also gathering, collecting, and sharing
- Keys - privacy, solitude, personal space, but conversely, also opening up to people
- Hearts - vitality, health, also sex
- Slugs - death and decay, things that are slimy and gross, but also in some respect, fertility and rebirth
- Leaves - growth, farming, plants, becoming wiser and more mature

There are a lot of gaps there, but I think that's good, because it means that there are certain things that the society places their focus on, and allows a bunch of square pegs to be fit into round holes, which is usually interesting. One example would be the topic of law and governance; is it Knives, because of the division and monopoly on violence? Or Cups, because it's about gathering together and sharing? You can make arguments either way, and have characters make arguments in-text, which adds texture to the religious aspects.
