It doesn't, though.

Don't get me wrong, it's an excellent greentext, but it doesn't answer OP's question, which is "how can I make skeletons have agency that will make them into a believable villain skeleton army rather than being mindless tools" - the point of that greentext is that the skeletons are mindless tools.

If OP is looking more generally for "a campaign idea for my skeleton minis" then it'll do nicely, but that wasn't the thrust of the question.
