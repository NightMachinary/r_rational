Cjet's 4 & 5 are a nice campaign setting, but the skeleton maximization horde is bleakly horrific. I think you should work the 'conquer death' motivation in there as one of the propaganda stories the horde uses to weaken resistance to their plans and even encourage cooperation. The horde can have a name for collaborators like 'goodflesh' vs those who oppose them (presumably the players): 'badflesh'.
