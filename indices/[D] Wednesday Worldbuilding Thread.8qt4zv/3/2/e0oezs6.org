How about if wars in this world are kind of like sports are to us, and skeletons are just mindless, disposable troops that nations or cities pit against each other to settle disputes. The winning army getting only marginal benefits and a morale boost for their living populace.

The general and maybe lieutenants would be the actual stars, there to direct the skeletons tactically and strategically. Well-off people pay to have their dead relative's bones in prominent positions with fancy armor, so they can point it out to their friends on the magic screens.
