Normalized necromancy.

Corpses can be animated with their former souls. The souls are generally capable of doing whatever they did in their former lives. Everyone has a bunch of skeleton ancestors walking around helping them do stuff. The living only make up a minority of any given population. Zombies aren't used because flesh still rots, and rotting things stink and are gross.

Some motivations for a potential skeleton army:

1. A special kind of preservative is used to keep the bones strong and from rotting anymore. The skeleton army is running out of their source of preservative. They are conquering and trying to find additional sources of the preservative.
2. A tyrant conqueror has figured out he can get a whole population's worth of fighting skeletons by just training everyone for a few years in the military and then letting them go about their lives. But if they ever need to be called up in death to fight, the whole population can be used, instead of just a few trained soldiers.
3. A courtier gets really good at playing court politics. When he/she is raised as a skeleton, they manage to take over the court. They now have an undead monarch that has to preserve the current level of technology and way of doing things, or risk losing all of its power.
4. A new religion springs up that believes in giving people a final rest after they have died. They go about destroying all skeletons they can find. People using the skeletons can't let this keep happening. They band together to bring about a massive army to kill off the new religion.
5. Continuing from the 4th motivation listed above. They kill off the new religion, but don't stop there and start killing off other populations that don't use necromancy.
