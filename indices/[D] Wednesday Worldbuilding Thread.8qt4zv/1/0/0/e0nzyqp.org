Ooh yeah, that seems like the broader umbrella term and can occur without any intentional manipulation by the targets of prophecy. What I'm looking for is examples when prophecy twists are the result of individuals steering fate in a direction more fortuitous to themselves -- twisting their own prophecy, so to speak.

Of course, Fate might not appreciate being twisted, so they might have to sidle up to it slyly and give it a comforting shoulder-rub before it notices, so it's ok with accepting the less disastrous interpretation. In my head I picture it best embodied by asking what Havelock Vetinari would do upon hearing a prophecy entailing his involvement.
