Well, but prophecies fucking you up because of some unintended meaning is a trope too; this is the flip side of that. It can be just done for fun, as a parody/lampshading of the trope, or it can be exploited for a deeper meaning, such as in a story about the importance of proactivity vs. passive acceptance of fate.
