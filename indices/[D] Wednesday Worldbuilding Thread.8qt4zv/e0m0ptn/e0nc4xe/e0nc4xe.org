Is there a "named" trope for something like advantageous prophecy subversion? i.e. a list or collection somewhere that I can read about instances where it's been used in fiction? By this I mean exploiting ambiguity in the wording of prophecies for outcomes that are to your benefit (or neutral), where at first glance they might be interpreted as to your detriment (in worlds where prophecies are demonstrably true and inevitably fulfilled).

For example, say you're a genre savvy king in in generic fantasy world â„– 43178 and on the very moment your first son is born, a bolt of lightning carves the words "*/your son -- the one just born -- is totally gonna kill you/*" above your throne.

Instead of doing something silly like ordering your noble and trusted knight to drown the child in a distant river away from prying eyes, you instead raise your son with love and compassion and devoted paternal care and otherwise rule your kingdom justly and pragmatically and with excellent medical services, and then on your eleventy first birthday when the toils of age have robbed you of your pleasures and strengths, your son wisely euthanizes you, having after lengthy and thoughtful deliberation agreed with your own proclamation that your own life is no longer worth living (and if your son could please discharge you of the duty you still feel).

Or maybe you invent games where "kills" are a possible moves and play with your son, or teach your son cardiology and have him carefully induce cardiac arrest until you're clinically dead and revived, or train your son to be an amazing ruler that totally kills it in the ruling-stuff department, or play-act some famous tragedy, or your son helps you achieve nirvana -- the death of self, or you train your son but not yourself in the art of rap battles and challenge him frequently, etc. etc. etc. you get the idea.
