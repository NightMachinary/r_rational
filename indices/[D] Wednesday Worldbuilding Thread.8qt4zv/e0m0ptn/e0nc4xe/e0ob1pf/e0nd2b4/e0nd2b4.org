Skeleton army. Why?

This is for a tabletop rpg I'm running. I have a whole bunch of skeleton minis, and want to use them. But I also want the villainous skeleton army to have a believable or possibly even persuasive motivation.

I don't want the skeleton army to just be a weird form of mindless weaponry.

What if all skeletons are alive and the free skeletons want to liberate their siblings from their meat prisons?

Perhaps skeletonization is the most reliable form of immortality and the skeleton armies want to conquer the world so as to make the ritual near ubiqitous and end death?

Maybe the skeletons are just seeking to capture fertile land so that they can let their cows graze freely and get as much milk as they need to keep their bones strong.

Or becoming a skeleton robs you of the ability to feel pain or tiredness so the skeletons have a belief system that fleshy people should be treated like children and cared for until they die and join the skeleton workforce. So the skeleton army is trying to overthrow the feudal system and convert the peasants to their way of life.

Any other ideas?
