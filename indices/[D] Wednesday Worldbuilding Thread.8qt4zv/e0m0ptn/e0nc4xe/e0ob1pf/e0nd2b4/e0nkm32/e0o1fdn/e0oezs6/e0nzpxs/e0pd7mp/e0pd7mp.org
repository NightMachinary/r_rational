I like cjet's overall idea the best, but your human farming description is creepy/interesting enough that I might want to include it too.

Here's what I have in mind. A catastrophic variant of the skeletonize spell is cast. Typically the spell embues the skeleton with a mind which closely matches that which the body possesed in life, but with desires slightly twisted towards fulfilling the goals of the caster.

This miscast ritual was meant to make the skeletons more obedient by instilling a hypercharged and hyperfocused version of a single goal. Because the caster was thinking about raising obedient skeletons by using the improved ritual, Skeleton Zero is accidentially imbued with the desire to do the same.

Then like a magical prion disease, this version of the ritual spreads. The tainted skeletons have all the knowledge and skills that they gained in life, but have a single terminal value: make more tainted skeletons.

And thus the horrors you mentioned with the human farming and whatnot. The skeleton maximization horde might even be clever enough to pretend to be peaceful or to sneak agents into crowded areas for a coordinated ritual strike.

If the outbreak is not contained, all usable biomass may someday be converted into spooky scary skeletons.

Yet the only army numerous enough to stand a chance are the accumulated centuries of the Dead King's legion.

/Begun the Skeleton War has./

I probably won't run a campaign that lasts long enough for that to come up, but hey, I can dream.
