I mean if it's arbitrary, it's arbitrary, but this can quickly become “this random god now saves everything”. In order to prevent that, the easiest thing that I think can apply are one of 2 things.

1. This is what makes your protagonist special. Anthorpic principle. If your protagonist didn't have it, we would we listening to someone else's story.

2. Use it to hinder you character. Not always, not constantly. Maybe once or twice (over a long enough period of time).

I think these are the only 2 justifications for this.
