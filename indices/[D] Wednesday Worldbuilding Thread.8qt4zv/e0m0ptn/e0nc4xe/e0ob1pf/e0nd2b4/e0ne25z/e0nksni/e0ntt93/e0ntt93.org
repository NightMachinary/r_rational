Not every mystery needs to be solvable by the reader or characters. Given that, I would argue that the only reason that the author needs to have a solution is that it really helps for the sake of consistency.

Further, the mystery shouldn't be driving your plot, characters, or reader interest if there is no solution. At most, the mystery should get characters into trouble, but never get them out of it.

In the case of boons granted by an erratic god that all the characters in the story don't believe exists ... I sort of question the utility of having a god at all.
