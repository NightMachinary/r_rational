I posted the following to the previous Wednesday thread, but I was like two days late to the party, and only got one reply, so if it's alright I'm gonna try my luck again here, when people are still looking.

My question revolves around the definition of "solveable mysteries". For example, suppose there's a world in which an unknown and half-insane god grants people boons. He doesn't grant them to everyone, but to a select few based on insane, eclectic criteria that may even change over time. It's so nonsensical that it may as well be random, and since the god is unknown, people think that the boons are random.

My question is this, should the author of this world and the story that takes place in it know the criteria that the god uses? Is it not rational anymore if the author doesn't, and maybe even decides to treat such a thing as random?
