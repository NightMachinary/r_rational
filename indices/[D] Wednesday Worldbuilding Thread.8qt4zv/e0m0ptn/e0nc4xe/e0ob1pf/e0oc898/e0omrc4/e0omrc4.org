  Hrm. If entertainment and drugs are the only viable occupations then does that mean that entertainment and drugs are the only viable things to back a currency? Meaning that the only thing that you can buy with money that you make from entertainment or drugs would be more entertainment or more drugs?

I was thinking "yes", because the AI manufactures everything for free, although that leads into questions of resource scarcity. I'm trying to think of how to justify the AI being a good enough cultural engineer to avoid that.

  I would think that there would be some room for "human certified" goods and services that the AI hasn't touched,

I'm broadly lumping those things under "entertainment", because if the only reason you want something is because a human made it, then you don't really want the thing, you want knowledge that a human made it for you. Aside from that, the AI is basically straight-up better at everything than a human would be.
