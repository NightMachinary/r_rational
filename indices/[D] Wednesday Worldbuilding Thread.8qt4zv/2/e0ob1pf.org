I've come up with a story idea recently, heavily inspired by a combination of the /Uglies/ series by Scott Westerfeld, and /Friendship is Optimal./ Long story short, the singularity happened. The AI-god we got out of it is actually very well human-aligned (not perfectly, but much better than, for example, the government.)

Of course, the AI's creators weren't idiots, so they hardcoded some restrictions into the AI. The most foremost being:\\
* No wireheading.\\
* 1st law compliance (don't harm a human, or allow a human to come to harm)

Ironically, as it turned out, the /humans/ weren't particularly well-aligned, because the AI now completely refuses to independently generate any sort of entertainment or psychoactive chemicals. No beer, no coffee, no generated movies, no antidepressants, etc. This isn't too much of a problem, because the AI still lets humans make all that stuff, but it leads to a conflict with 1st law compliance.

The AI isn't quite so strict about the "nor allow one to come to harm" part (it normally tries to respect free will, even if that's the free will to harm yourself.) But it refuses to allow people to /stay/ dead. You can kill yourself, but it'll clone your memories and grow you a new body.

There are obvious navel-gazey internal conflict that that'll cause, but with regards to the actual plot, it means that people who /want/ to work really only have two industries left: entertainment, and drug dealing. Can you guess which one the protagonist will involve themselves with?

So what I wanted to ask is, what do you think the economy of this setting will be like? What would you personally do?
