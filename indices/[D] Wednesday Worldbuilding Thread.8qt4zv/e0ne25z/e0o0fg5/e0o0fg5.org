I think you could have a nice conversation about true randomness vs. deterministic but stochastic processes. There are some relatively simple processes that exhibit stochastic behavior, so it could be possible for the protagonist to discover the underlying rules and gain great power thereby despite the random seeming nature of the outcome. Some processes have islands of stability where the process seems to be tractable before returning chaos. Just being able to predict such islands could be quite empowering.
