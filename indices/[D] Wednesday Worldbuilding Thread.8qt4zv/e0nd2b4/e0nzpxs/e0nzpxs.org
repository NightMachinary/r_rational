Perhaps the skeletons have a low grade telepathy and/or hive mind thing going on. The skeletons experience the hive mind as bliss, and want everyone to join. They see non-skeletons as barely sentient fleshy eggs, that will one day hatch and join the Collective. The Collective works to optimize the production of strong new skeletons, and intervenes when the flesh eggs act contrary to this purpose (eg the horror of cremation, the slaughter of children, large numbers of elderly, banning of necromancy, etc).
