Hrm. If entertainment and drugs are the only viable occupations then does that mean that entertainment and drugs are the only viable things to back a currency? Meaning that the only thing that you can buy with money that you make from entertainment or drugs would be more entertainment or more drugs? Or convert between the two? I would think that there would be some room for "human certified" goods and services that the AI hasn't touched, plus also secondary services and goods revolving around entertainment and drugs, e.g. aggregators and reviewers, advertisers and agents.

FWIW, I would find the story of an entertainer working within that kind of economy to be more interesting then someone producing or selling drugs, but it's all about execution.
