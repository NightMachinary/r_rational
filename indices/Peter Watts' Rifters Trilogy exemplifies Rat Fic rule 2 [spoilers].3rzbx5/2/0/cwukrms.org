Most of the characters, not all of them. For example, the whole situation with Achilles in /Behemoth/ would never have happened if Alice had just trusted the corpses, or at least Rowan.

And if the team responsible for training the smart-gel in /Starfish/ had been let in on its purpose, then they might have foreseen the problems before Yves Scanlon did.

The rifters themselves may have gotten pissed at being sacrificed for the greater good, but then again, the reason that they had to be sacrificed was because they couldn't be trusted to react well. Ken Lubin and others were cleansed of Behemoth, so that could have been done if the Grid Authority had felt that was a safe course of action.

At the very least being upfront about it might have had an effect on the whole Meltdown Madonna thing. Clarke was pissed at the beginning because she misunderstood the GA's motives. She got pissed about other things, granted, but she only found out about them because she was already on the warpath.
