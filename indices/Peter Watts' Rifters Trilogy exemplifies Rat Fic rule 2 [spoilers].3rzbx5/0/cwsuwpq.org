Rifters is a great series! I remember I read the first one after randomly checking out of my local library as a kid, and I think got my hands on the second as well, before getting confused and distracted and never finishing the series. More recently, and as a more conscious Peter Watts fan I read all three and am glad I did.

I highly recommend anybody thinking about trying Watts out give a listen to [[http://www.rifters.com/blindsight/vampires.htm][this faux-evil-corporate presentation he did about domesticating vampires to use their abilities to our advantage.]]

It's about 20 minutes long, and I think it's great. If you agree, Peter Watts is the author for you should check out the novel that the above ties in with, available free online: [[http://www.rifters.com/real/Blindsight.htm][Blindsight]]
