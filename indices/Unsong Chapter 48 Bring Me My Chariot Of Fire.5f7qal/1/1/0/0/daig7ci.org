I doubt saving others' souls would be much stronger a motivator than saving lives. We don't see people lining up to donate to buy bednets. Saving your own soul is a strong motivator, which is why Celestial Virgin offers to take people to haven. The full US economy would be much weaker if it were communist. I doubt even Gadriel could manage it, but if she can, that's up to her.
