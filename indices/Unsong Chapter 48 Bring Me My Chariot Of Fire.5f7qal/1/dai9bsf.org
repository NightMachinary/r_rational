So, new justifications time!

This justification for who goes to heaven is better but still weak. If a problem is too hard, look for a new solution! Space Elevators! (Watch out for calling it Babel-related, though) Teleportation! Mass spaceship industry! Ask Sohu for something! Put name-factories more everywhere, and hope for the Space-warping, Mass-Enhancing, or Fabricating Names!

I'm sceptical that the capitalist approach could, in the short run at least, match nationalising everything.

Speaking of which, has anyone tried the Kola gambit yet?
