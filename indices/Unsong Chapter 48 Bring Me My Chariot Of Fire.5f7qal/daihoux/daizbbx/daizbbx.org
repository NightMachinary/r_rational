See [[http://unsongbook.com/interlude-%D7%9E-miss-american-pie/][INTERLUDE ×ž: MISS AMERICAN PIE]] for details.

Main point seems to be the chorus:

#+begin_quote
  So bye, bye Miss American Pie\\
  Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry\\
  Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey 'n' Rye\\
  Singin' this'll be the day that I die\\
  This'll be the day that I die
#+end_quote

From the interlude:

#+begin_quote
  Chevy = tribe\\
  levee = Levi (the priesthood)\\
  good ole boys = the Cometspawn?\\
  whiskey = /uisce beatha/ = water of life
#+end_quote

John says "They drove the comet to the priest, but the priest would come up dry.", which isn't quite Aaron's interpretation. I don't think Chevrolet made a Comet, but Mercury (apparently owned by Ford?) did.

There probably is a justification that Aaron would be able to decipher to fit it to the Comet King thing, but he preferred the Jesus interpretation (which is sort of half-right, if the Comet King is another saviour figure). I, for one, don't really know how to justify it.
