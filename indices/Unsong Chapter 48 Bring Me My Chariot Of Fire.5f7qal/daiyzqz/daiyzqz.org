Since Captain Nemo has been speculated in-story to possibly be the Comet King, the Unspoken Plan Guarantee now indicates that Captain Nemo is the only person who can't be the Comet King.

So what about Malia Ngo - could she be the Comet King? Strange magical powers, insists she's one of the good guys, etc etc. Maybe the Other King cursed the Comet King to seem evil, and that's why Ana got a sense of wrongness around her?
