Based on [[https://www.google.com.au/search?q=site%3Aunsongbook.com+oracular][this google search]], it's occurred in the page for seven chapters. Some of those instances are in comments or just random uses of the word "oracular".

[[http://unsongbook.com/chapter-2-arise-to-spiritual-strife/][Chapter 2]] has the full poem.

[[http://unsongbook.com/interlude-%D7%92-cantors-and-singers/][Cantors and Singers]] has the standard excerpt.

[[http://unsongbook.com/chapter-21-thou-also-dwellest-in-eternity/][Chapter 21]] has very similar text to Cantors and Singers.

Ditto [[http://unsongbook.com/interlude-%D7%97-war-and-peace/][War and Peace]].

And now this chapter, so 5 times total.

It's definitely a leitmotif at this point.
