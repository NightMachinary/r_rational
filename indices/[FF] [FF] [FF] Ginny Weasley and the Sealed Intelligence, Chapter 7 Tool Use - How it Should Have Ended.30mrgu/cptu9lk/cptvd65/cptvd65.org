You're probably right. Honestly, it doesn't even need the list on the inside of the book - Hogwarts Library books most likely don't even have that. And then the explanation of Hermione having already read the book because she's Hermione still makes the perfect cover-up, so Harry's Time-Turning wouldn't be apparent. I mean, what he did here still isn't even close to being impossible-without-a-time-turner like The Incident With His First Potions Class, and The Incident With The Remembrall.
