Not great. Only 52 submissions accepted a year. Word length limit: 2000.

On the other hand, if you have an in with the editor (like the people who will actually be accepted will) that's a few hundred dollars for maybe a couple of days hard writing and editing...that you have almost zero chance of earning by emailing that address.

Hmm.

So really, more of a standard open-call (slim) chance to get published than a way to make real cash monies fast.

Just as impossible. But do it anyway. But don't quit your day job.
