I'll have to think on this. Normally ideas are cheap and it's all in the execution, but I'm not sure that I have any ideas in my scrap pile that can fit into a story of 2,000 words or less. Maybe I'll dust off one of my old stories about a fiction-writing robot, but that might be a little too meta.
