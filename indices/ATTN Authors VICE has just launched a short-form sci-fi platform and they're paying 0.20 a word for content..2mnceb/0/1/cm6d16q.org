That depends on how big Terraform gets. At 0.20 a word and opening with huge names like Doctorow and Sterling, things are looking good. If you get published by them (and they earn a strong reputation) than you have a very nice credit to put on any CV you send to a publisher when you try to get your novel published. It could, potentially, help. As a way to eventually make money by writing novels.

No one makes livable money writing short fiction.

(and actually, even income from novels is very rare, but at least that's in the realm of possibility)
