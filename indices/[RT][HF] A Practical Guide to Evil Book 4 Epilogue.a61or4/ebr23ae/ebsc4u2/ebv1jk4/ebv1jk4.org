Unfortunately, the very reasons for Alaya making a good Chancellor are also the ones that woukd ensure that she inevitably betrayed and supplanted her Tyrant. Because she focuses on political realities, she would become increasingly frustrated with the limitations imposed by Amadeus or Catherine or whoever else was on the throne. We already saw this conflict play out at Second Liesse. Amadeus and Alaya disagreed and came into conflict. If she had been Chancellor, that would have been exactly the moment she decided to betray the Tyrant of Praes.

Also, I think we (the fans) need to be more consistent in our use of the terms "Name" and "Role". Adjutant is a Name, but he fulfills the Role of "Right-Hand Man". Captain and Scribe are Names, and they each fill that same role. "Plucky Comedic Relief" is a role that might be filled by, for example, the Bumbling Conjurer. I believe ErraticErrata has been pretty consistent with those terms in-story.
