  Finishing on a high note, we settle the most important round of the character contest: Dread Emperor Irritant vs Dread Emperor Traitorous vs Grandmaster Ouroboros of the Order of Unholy Obsidian (unrelated). Link to vote.

The weird thing is, Malicia would probably be a better chancellor than Emperor. She focuses too much on political reality, and lacks long-term vision. In a way, I think the best possible outcome for team evil would be Catherine as Empress Victorious, Malicia as Chancellor, and Black as Black Knight or General. (Which, why the fuck is Adjutant a [name - edit], but General is not?)
