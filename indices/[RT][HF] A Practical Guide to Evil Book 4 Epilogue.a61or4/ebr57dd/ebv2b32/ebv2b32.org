His Role, currently, seems to be some blend of Person-Shaped MacGuffin, and Not-So-Helpless Damsel. Maybe a bit of The Mole worked in. He's gonna be setting things up so that when the Big Damn "Heroes" show up to liberate him, they'll find that he already has a plan in place, picked his own cuffs, escape route planned, and some critical secret gleaned from his time as a captive that will prove to be they key to bringing down the Heroes.

At least, that's the Role. But Amadeus has a tendency not to play his assigned Role the way it was intended...
