Maybe a white knight? It would be a massive surprise, totally against his character, but could also be the most practical move. How better to counter the knight championed by justice than to become a claimant? Don't think this is it, but I wouldn't be totally surprised by it either. Personally still leaning closer to the idea that Bard meant the Dread Emperor's seat.
