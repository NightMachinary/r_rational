This epilogue makes it abundantly clear that Black is the better character with the better story.

That has been what is kind of disappointing about Book 5 and Book 4. We were waiting for Catherine to get more like Black. Use the power of institutions instead of her name, become story and plot savvy, instead she has become more reliant on her magical powers and just trying to BS her way through the story.
