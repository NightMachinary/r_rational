So he was the diplomat representing Bellepheron in the Free Cities. Tyrant twisted a story around well enough to get him a Name, Hierarch, and elected him the leader of the Free Cities in a time of war.

Hierarch, being from a ridiculous democratic society, hates that he has a Name and is effectively a dictator, so he doesn't do much and Tyrant kind of rules in his stead a lot.

Bard pops up at the end of book 3 and talks to Hierarch saying she was the one who created the Name in the first place by accident. This gets Hierarch into a rare fit of pique (he gets them on occasion as he can pretty much see everything going on and he has a fair set of ethics to work off of, twisted as they are by Bellepheron).

Hierarch basically indicts Bard with a host of charges and sentences her to death. This decleration is so powerful she pops out of existence (like she does when she dies) and we don't see her again til much later.

I think he's got a ridiculously powerful name and a ridiculously powerful belief system and he's slowly developing into a counterpart to Cat in that he's pretty fucking pissed at the Gods Above and Below. He recently decided to pursue justice against the Choir of Judgement, so that will leave a mark on the Heavens.

I think he and Cat are going to be powerful pieces in getting the Accords signed and operational.

Also, I think he's hilarious. Just perfectly pissed off at his situation and the various laws he cites show a democracy run amok.
