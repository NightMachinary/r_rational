Bard wants Amadeus to Claim the name of Chancellor, apparently ? I hope he claims Heir or Squire instead. The narrative specifics are unclear but either should align him back with Catherine, who's already stated she intends to rescue him.

The /mistake/ alluded to must be that dhe's letting him know Cat is alive and well. Bard did not say « She is dead » which would have been the optimal way to present it in context, but instead « she got killed again », and there is a heap of implications there Maddy could not miss.
