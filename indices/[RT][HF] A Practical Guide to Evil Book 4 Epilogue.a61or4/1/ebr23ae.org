So Bard is offering Black the chance to climb the tower which I half want him to pursue and at the same time fear for him if he does.

I don't know if by mistake Black means his past refusal of the title of Dread Emperor or Bard trying to pit him against Malicia but either way I am nervous and excited for Book 5 Black.
