I personally think that he's going to get the role of a hero/antihero.

The "What do you think what is right?" and "How far are you willing to go?" makes me think of what he thought heroes were, a necessary evil.\\
Actually, that's kinda what Tariq thinks of heroes are too... unnecessary suffering and all that.

Anyways, it'd be hilarious if he turned into a hero.
