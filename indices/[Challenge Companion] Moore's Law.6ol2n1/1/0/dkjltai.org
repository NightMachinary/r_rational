It's really hard to say, because whether or not Moore's Law is holding is of incredible importance to the people who make these chips, and to the people who are stakeholders in those companies. There are IIRC four major companies that fight this propaganda battle year after year where they'll declare Moore's Law to be slowing down or dead in order to provide spin as far as their product offerings go.

So far as I know, there's no lead-up to a new technology at the moment, which means that there's at least two generations below 10nm that will use technologies and materials that are very similar to what's used now.

The [[https://www.semiconductors.org/main/2015_international_technology_roadmap_for_semiconductors_itrs/][last ITRS report]] was from 2015 and contains the most unbaised information, but it's two years out of date now.
