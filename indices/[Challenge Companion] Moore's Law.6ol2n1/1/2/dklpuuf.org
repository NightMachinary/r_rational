MooreÂ´s law is going to die to Moores other principle "And the factory that makes them will cost twice as much". High-end chip-foundries are getting really obnoxiously expensive to build. There are couple of doublings left before it reaches the point where they just cant be financed without waiting a few decades for the world to get sufficiently richer.. but not all that many. Which will probably result in a lot of effort into better chip design (because you can make a new mask without building a new factory easily enough. ) and then after that a focus on more efficient programming.
