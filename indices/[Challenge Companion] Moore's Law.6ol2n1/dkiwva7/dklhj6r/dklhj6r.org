If I recall correctly, we are hitting a wall, in a sense. We can still keep making chips smaller and smaller, but heat is now a major problem because making chips smaller makes them denser, and denser = more heat in less space. You can use liquid cooling, but that only goes so far.

There is a new technology though, sort of. The idea is to just give up on making super computers, and instead just use computer networks. So instead of having one super powerful computer do whatever you need to do, you figure out how to distribute the workload to a bunch of weaker computers. With enough weak computers working together, this can actually be much faster. That's why a lot of the computers you see nowadays come with GPU (which is kinda like a bunch of tiny computers in your monitor), and multiple cores (which is kinda like a bunch of computers inside your computer).
