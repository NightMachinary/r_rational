  You could maybe argue that one person has better tactics than the other

I think [[/u/eaglejarl]]'s whole thesis here is that one person having better tactics than the other is not a thing "maybe argue[able]", but absolutely the case. Maybe that's what Jake /is/; he sees the world from an extradimensional perspective. He has the overhead view of the maze of character abilities and can trace a route through, whereas the characters inside the world don't get that.

This is definitely the case in our real world, that outcome-focussed and process-focussed thinking is dramatically different. Most accountants (for example) will diligently complete your tax return based on the definite fact of what you earned and spent, and will tell you what tax you must pay. They will be accurate and correct, and basically do nothing that a sufficiently capable computer program couldn't have done better. A /really good/ accountant will assess your tax position a couple of months before tax time, and tell you how you can act to minimize your tax; they'll look /through/ the process to optimize your result. They'll /work backwards/ from the desired result, to determine the inputs that need to go into the process to get that result.
