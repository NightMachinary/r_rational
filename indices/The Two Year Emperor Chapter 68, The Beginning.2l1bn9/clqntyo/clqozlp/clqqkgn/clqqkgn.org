Hmm. To what extent does this matter, though? If she's a 20th level wizard (for example), does she know how to properly apply 9th-level spells? If a 20th level fighter, having never personally picked up a sword, how does she use that +20 (at least!) BAB?

I suppose that's the major question that this fiction is exploring - that the capability to do a thing does not necessarily imply optimal strategic application of doing that thing.
