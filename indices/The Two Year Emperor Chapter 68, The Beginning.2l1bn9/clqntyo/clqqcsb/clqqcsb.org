It's a combination of a couple of things: unconscious social expectations (mousey young women are not combatants and do not become legendary figures of power) and category stability. Jake and the others have mentally filed Suze in the category "Jake's secretary", and it would take a conscious effort to notice that she could be reassigned. So far, they've all been too focused to think of it.

Of course, the fact that Suze is too unassertive to ask for it doesn't help either.
