Well, they have the same number of experience /points/, but that isn't necessarily the same as the same amount of life experience. Yes, any two 20th level fighters are equally good swordsmen, but casters are different. They may not have access to the same spells, they may have different /numbers/ of spells (due to differing Int bonus), and one of them may be cleverer about how to apply them -- or just have used magic in combat situations more often and therefore picked up tricks from other people.

Even if Suze were a 20th level wizard, she wouldn't necessarily know how to apply her magic effectively.
