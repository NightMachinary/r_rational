Phew, last minute drop. I spent most of the week writing the novelette for the first stretch goal on the Kickstarter...which, I fully recognize, will cut no ice (Icefi?) with 2YE readers. I got so absorbed that I didn't realize I hadn't worked on 2YE until this morning. /blush/

Anyway, here we go -- big things are starting.
