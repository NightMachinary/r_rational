How did no one see /Mindscrape/ coming? I mean ... the obvious solution is to have a trusted confederate /Mindscrape/ you to remove the details you don't want known before you go up against someone that you suspect might use /Mindscrape/ on you.

(Of course, it's possible that they /did/ do this, and left all the other stuff in order to convince Afi that he has them dead to rights, but that seems unlikely. I guess I'll need to know what the plan is, but giving away secrets that didn't need to be given away seems bad unless there are more layers involved.)
