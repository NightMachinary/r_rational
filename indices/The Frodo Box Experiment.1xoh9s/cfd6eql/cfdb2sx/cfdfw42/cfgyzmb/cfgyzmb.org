Meh, by the time Sauron is not just competent but /a hypercompetent Power/ there's not much to salvage. The whole setting - let alone story - only makes sense in the tradition of heroic epics and mythology, which is what Tolkien was writing. In a more modern 'serious fantasy' tradition, it just wouldn't work under the weight of the cliches (many of which it codified, yes).
