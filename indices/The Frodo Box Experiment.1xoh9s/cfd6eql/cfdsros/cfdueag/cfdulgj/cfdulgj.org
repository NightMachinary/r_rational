By the way, that's what I would do, were I Frodo.

Apparently, Elrond doesn't like to think about painful things, prone to procrastination and takes pleasure in an escapism. Also, elven rings are mostly free from Sauron's influence, and are responsible for preservation of Elven lands in their current half-utopian state.

Something like that probably will do:

"You don't have to rely on my words only. Use Vilya to tell whether I am lying, or something --- I dont' know about what Vilya can or cannot do, but I sure we are able to invent some way to check my words and shield the wearer of Vilya from the influence of One. We should think about it later, maybe next month, because firstly we should attend to much more urgent matters. The defense of Gondor is important, whether I am lying or not."

What about long-term? I should, now and again, hint at beautiful future that is to come, provided Sauron is defeated, leaving Three Elven rings intact and free. That will bite off Elrond's attention; if done right, elf will spend more and more time daydreaming, letting his guard down.
