Maybe it's because I'm not a native speaker, but I found part about winning Elrond confusing.

What exactly Frodo's words should accomplish? What /"now +Lothlorien+ Rivendell was not seen as already lost but had to be decided to sacrifice"/ even means? Also, wouldn't someone find this abrupt change of topic (from unreliability of source to the fate of Rivendell) suspicious?
