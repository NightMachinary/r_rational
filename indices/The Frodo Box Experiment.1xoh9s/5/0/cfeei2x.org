This was great, thanks for writing it.

A few comments: If the Ring makes its wearer practically omniscient and unbeatable like Frodo in this story then why did all the previous wearers lost it at some point? This should be explained somehow. Frodo isn't very extraordinary and Sauron seems to be better at instrumental rationality so if the Ring really is /that/ good then Sauron shouldn't have been able to lost it in the first place. Is it because the Ring still can't control everything and some things are just up to chance, or the Ring has predestined everything and Frodo just happened to be the best candidate to wear it for a long period of time, or the Ring is lying even to Frodo in this story, the Ring is nothing like it told to Frodo and the ring-wearing immortality is not a foregone conclusion?
