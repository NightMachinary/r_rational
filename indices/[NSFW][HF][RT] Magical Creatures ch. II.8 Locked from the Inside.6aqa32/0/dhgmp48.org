Reading back a chapter that I missed (somehow?)

#+begin_quote
  “That is not how gravity works! That's not even how artificial gravity doesn't work!”

/How did I miss this sentence!/ <3

[edit] I continue to utterly adore the level of worldbuilding that's gone into this.

#+begin_quote
  There are two layers, one thick, one thin, in the place in the dismissal that makes her mouth flow with nectar, and I know what they do. I've been, to this point, only stretching the thick one, but now I take the thin one and pull it to the limit.

How's the saying go?

"There was a point where we needed to stop, and we have clearly passed it. So let's keep going and see what happens."

[edit] Jesus Christ. You give a nerd /one little finger/ of technical knowledge of a magical system, and ten minutes later it's a fucking singularity. /Literally/.

  It's likely, I realize, that my life starting from that moment in my bed onwards is probably now composed mainly of sexily ominous.

Bwahaha.

[edit]

#+begin_quote
  So, a good lower bound on the power of love is about fifteen hundred simultaneous Apollo launches or, about twelve times the current peak power output of human civilization on Earth.

HAVE I MENTIONED I LOVE THIS STORY SO MUCH--

[edit] And now they're being cute again. This is <3. Just <3.

#+end_quote

You know, it's the little touches that make this story. And the big, aggressive touches. A lot of touching, really.

[edit] Okay, that was sweet.

Um. Is this just going to keep escalating? This has basically been an unbroken series of momentous and shattering reveals. I think the story has to get grounded in the next part or else it's gonna lead to burn-out. If you were editing this for a book, I'd tell you that you need to space it out more.
