Yes. It's gotta be both evening and balance, given the sex-positive, lust-focused, single-sexed but complexly-gendered succubi. And that contrasts neatly with son of atoms, given that he's from the land of mundane physics. Also, this gender thing probably explains the flip-flopping between child and daughter.
