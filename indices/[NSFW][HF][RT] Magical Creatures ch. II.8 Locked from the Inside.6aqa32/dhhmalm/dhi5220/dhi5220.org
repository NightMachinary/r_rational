I think "son of atoms" is supposed to be "son of Adam" and "daughter of even" is supposed to be "daughter of Eden". It's a clever twist on biblical names except atoms and even are English words. It doesn't make sense that people misheard two English names for two Hebrew names. I mean why would the succubi have been speaking in English centuries or millennia before modern (or maybe Old) English appeared? Or maybe it's a hint about something funny going on language and the reason Blue can understand others isn't due to magical translation, but because everyone really are speaking English.
