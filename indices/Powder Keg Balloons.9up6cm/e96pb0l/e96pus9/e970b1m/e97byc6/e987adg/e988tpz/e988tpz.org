I do understand your point about making the gnolls distinct. They should not be just humans in fur. Gonna add that to my to do list. Thank you :)

I also would have spent hours figuring out how the time ring works, the mana stone, and the satchel. I would also have talked everyone's ear off asking them questions endlessly, about ALL the things. I'd get all the information I could out of them and more. My issue is how do I convey that to the reader without info dumping them with several chapters worth of information from the start? People would get bored, there's only so much world building / info dump they can take. I'm all ears as to suggestions :)

There are no children in that cave through chapter 4, as I far as I recall. And the group was small. The three that came into the cave, got followed and that's how they were attacked. I don't know if they had guards, maybe those three were the patrol. The narrative is first person - so the only information the reader gets, is what the main character sees / hears. Regardless, it doesn't mean if you have a guard / patrol / alarm system that it's 100% effective, especially against a group of rogues.
