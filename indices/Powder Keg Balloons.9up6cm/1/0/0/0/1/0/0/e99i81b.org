Actually thinking about it, let me amend my statement. I think you could make a full fantasy world with magic and gods and time-stopping: Give the world custom physics much like how a game does, and abstract away all the smaller details. Eg. instead of biological processes for eating, make the body a black box where food goes in and energy comes out, with a simulated layer to appear like a real human. Do you think that would work?
