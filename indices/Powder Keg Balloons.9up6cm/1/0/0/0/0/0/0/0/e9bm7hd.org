  You'd also expect children to grow faster, humans are very slow growers and long lived, that wouldn't be the case for most other intelligent animals.

I would feel that if we're running into these aliens /in interstellar space/, then probably we're post-humans and they're post-whatevers and we're both extremely long-lived because we've engineered ourselves to be that way. (And neoteny seems to be a natural consequence of such engineering, so maybe both we and they are "slow growing" as well.)

If we're finding these aliens in a pre-space-travel form on their own worlds, however, then sure, they can have different behaviors (incl. traits like "doesn't live long enough to develop language" that might even prevent them from ever achieving space-travel.)

  we are one of the only species where females don't signal or show any signs they are ovulating

I have a personal hypothesis that this would happen to any species successful enough in its niche that their sexual selection has entirely dominated the long-term adaptive process over any natural-selection effects. (I.e., any species that stops dying of natural causes before mating, will inevitably evolve toward whatever maximizes the chance of reproductively-fit genes being passed, however costly in regular natural-inclusive-fitness that behavior is. Like, say, by evolving such big-brained children that they can only be delivered by C-section!)

Only a personal hypothesis, though :)

In all, though, I agree; excellent points.
