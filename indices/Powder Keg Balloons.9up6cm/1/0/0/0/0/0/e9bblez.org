  Humans have universals of our species, i.e envy, music, marriage, etiquette, aesthetics... Applying too many them to non humans is flawed and makes them look like humans with fur and dog heads.

I've always believed that a number of "human universals" are really "sophont universals"---things that any intelligent + tribally-eusocial species will /inevitably/ evolve as game-theoretic equilibria in natural+sexual selection. (Or, sometimes, something even a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociality#Presociality][presocial]] species will end up doing.)

For a clear-cut example of something we /can/ observe on Earth (but which isn't really thought of as a "human universal"), humans manage to---through a combination of physiological and behavioural mechanisms, in the average case---bear equal numbers of male and female children. This /could/ be described as a "human universal"... except other Earth species also do it. It's an adaptive trait of a supercategory of which humans are one member species---in this case, that's "K-selected species where organisms of the species have one of two sexes assigned randomly at conception by gene mixing." Any species that fits those criteria, ends up with one or another implicit behavior to balance the sexes of their children (e.g. selective miscarriage, expulsion from the nest, etc.) to exactly the degree required to balance out whatever /natural/ ratios of lifetime pre-mating risk the organisms of each sex have.

For another example, "revenge-seeking behavior" is an elementary game-theoretic building block for cooperation, whether among humans, animals, or AIs. So, you wouldn't be likely to see any tribally-eusocial species that /hasn't/ evolved to become enraged and vengeful/uncooperative at an unfair deal.

(Of course, if you /aren't/ writing a tribally-eusocial species, you can make them weirder; and if they aren't even precocial, you can make them as crazy as you like. But at that point, you're writing something it's /very/ hard for humans to have much empathy for. This is true even when the species exists in real life! Base an alien species on crows or dolphins and they're already pretty bizarre; base them on the real-life behavior of any truly [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitary_animal][solitary animal]] and you'll have something that really only works as an opaque antagonist.)
