I'm new to this subreddit. I have been working on a LitRPG story that is rational. I specifically wanted an intelligent protagonist, an engineer, who would be driving the plot through creative use of modern day knowledge in an otherwise medieval society. Yes, they have magic, but (hopefully) one that is restrained by general application of laws of physics (no infinite sources of energy, no perpetual motion.)

Maybe you can keep me honest and point out where I have gone wrong with respect to keeping the fictional world â€˜realistic' as far as laws of nature, and rationality. Thanks.
