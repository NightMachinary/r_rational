I personally really enjoy seeing a character go through the experiments. "Experiment 1 showed me that the time stop device could only be used for a maximum duration of 10 seconds." "Experiment 13 showed me than it has a minimum cooldown of 1 minute." Blah blah. I'm not a writer but I've read interesting breakdowns of experiments going through the thought process of the protag. For example The Waves Arisen had a few scenes that did that decently.
