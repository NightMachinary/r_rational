Humans have universals of our species, i.e envy, music, marriage, etiquette, aesthetics... Applying too many them to non humans is flawed and makes them look like humans with fur and dog heads. It's a world building issue mostly.

As an aside, a rational agent would have spent at least a couple of hours figuring out everything he can about his time stop item pretty much as soon as he had the chance. What's the cooldown, are there charges, does it actually stop time or does it freeze his immediate surroundings..

There are many problems and I only read up to chapter 4. Here's the one that annoys me the most and basically set's your plot in motion. Those gnolls seemed to be living there for a while and in a not small group seeing that there were children and a specific hiding spot for them. But they had no guards, patrols, alarm systems or anything really, I mean they were ambushed in their own cave, that's a bit much.
