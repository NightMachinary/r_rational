First of great comment..

You are correct but many of the humans behaviors happen because we have some fairly unique characteristics. Take for instance breeding, we are one of the only species where females don't signal or show any signs they are ovulating.

This leads to some very specific mate acquisition strategies and social behaviors, because of how our brain thinks and rationalizes instincts we have institutions, laws and customs built around it.

In dog like intelligent agents, you'd not expect marriage, females get a fertile period this changes their behavior and males behavior to her by proxy.

Relationship related jealousy for instance wouldn't be a thing, males would care little about who fathered each specific pup from a female. Even if they are potential fathers.

You'd also expect children to grow faster, humans are very slow growers and long lived, that wouldn't be the case for most other intelligent animals.

This has tremendous implications for their cultures, maybe because of their faster growth and lowered time available to learn language has to be inborn and universal among the entire species. Is complex and abstract language even possible for them ? (remember for most of the time humans have been around we didn't have language, but we were still 'intelligent').

If for instance there were many children per gestation as is common in nature, you'd expect their packs and familial structures to work differently.

Sharp claws and teeth would lower life expectancy substantially. They'd have to be fast learners to compensate for their shorter lives..

How does societal administration work? Is there an alpha big dog that calls the shots, or is there a female coalition that controls breeding and therefore society ?
