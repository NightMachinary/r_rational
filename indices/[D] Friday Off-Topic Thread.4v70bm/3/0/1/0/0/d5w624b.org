  I'm interested to know, what are some of your favorite comedy movies and books? How would you compare them?

I bother to seek out neither literature nor video that's /focused/ on humor, since I've had such lackluster experiences with the genre. Off the top of my head, I remember finding particularly funny [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6466185][the /Harry the Hufflepuff/ series]], /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183][Harry Potter and the Natural 20]]/, and /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106][Seventh Horcrux]]/ (as well as a few short /Friendship Is Magic/ crack-fics) in literature, and /[[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0412142][House]]/, many /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three_Stooges][The Three Stooges]]/ short films, and some /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurel_and_Hardy][Laurel and Hardy]]/ short films in video. Out of that list, I'd /very tentatively/ estimate that the /The Three Stooges/ films are the funniest and /Seventh Horcrux/ is the second-most-funny.
