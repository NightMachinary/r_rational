  It seems like it would be fair to say your favorite non-written comedies center around witty dialogue (for House) and slapstick (for Three Stooges/Laurel&Hardy)?

I guess.

  Have you ever enjoyed any Charlie Chaplin?

I don't think I've seen any Charlie Chaplin movies. Your description does, however, put me in mind of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buster_Keaton][Buster Keaton]] in /The General/ and /Steamboat Bill Jr./, which I enjoyed. Yes, that's a style of humor that's different from the humor in /Seventh Horcrux/, while still equivalent to the latter in quality. Still--how expensive were the stunts in Keaton's films, when compared with the negligible sum that the writing of /Seventh Horcrux/ cost?

  Think of facial expressions that have made you laugh, or body language that an actor did that was particularly humorous.

For facial-expression humor, [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL34C1F26D03F5F9B8][the Half in the Bag series]] (humorous movie reviews, bookended by humorous skits) is the only example that comes to mind. In my opinion, however, the reviewers' mugging at the camera is a /very/ minor component of the show's humor, in comparison with their intentionally-exaggerated tones of voice. Even in this example, whether or not the cost of constructing and maintaining a studio and props is worth a few funny facial expressions is, in my opinion, highly debatable.
