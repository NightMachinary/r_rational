  Still--how expensive were the stunts in Keaton's films, when compared with the negligible sum that the writing of Seventh Horcrux cost?

This is a good point, but a different point than the one I was making. I definitely agree that as a matter of pure cost-per-laugh, movies will likely always be more expensive than any written story, in some cases astronomically so. Same goes for other genres.

But the experience itself is still unique, regardless of cost effectiveness, and that has its own value to many people, and its own premium. Besides which, you're generally paying a fraction of the difference in seeing a movie vs buying a book (putting fanfiction aside for a moment), so the cost-to-laugh for the consumer is likely not an issue, while for successful movies the scale of its popularity makes up for the cost of production.

As for free fanfiction, I guess there's an equivalent in free online videos. I've always enjoyed this video as a clever bit of dialogue-less humor.

There are other examples that can be used, but the unique blend of body language and music/sound accompanying the action makes it very hard to duplicate that particular experience through written word.

It likely cost the producers far more to film and edit than it did to write it. But I think there would have been something lost in translation to even the most imaginative reader. As an aesthetic experience, visual/audial media can present very unique moments compared to the written word, just like the written word can in different moments.
