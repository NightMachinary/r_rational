Subtle implications can be made in books, but I would argue that certain implications can be made much more elegantly and powerfully in visual medium, to the point that I can't think off the top of my head of ever seeing equivalents to them in books.

Take comedy again as an example. As demonstrated to some extent in the linked video, most movies rely almost completely on dialogue and absurd events or obvious visual gags for comedy, because they're written as screenplays, which have access to all the same things books do, just without narration. A great director can inject comedy in tiny things, subtle absurdity in quick movements and camera shots and sound effects, that just can't be done with narration in a book. Or at least, I've never seen it done well.

I'm interested to know, what are some of your favorite comedy movies and books? How would you compare them?
