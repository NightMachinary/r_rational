  I think you underestimate the impact that audio and visual stimulus can have

I don't deny that visuals /can/ have an impact. For example, I consider the opening scene of /[[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0811080][Speed Racer]]/ to be /at least/ as awesome as [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644/27][the fight between Sakura and the Zombie Combo in /Time Braid/]]. However, these are /outliers./ When the /average/ orgy of visual effects and the /average/ literary action scene are equivalent in impact, and the visual effects are significantly more expensive than the simple words, spending extra money on visual effects doesn't make much sense.

The same response can serve to counter [[/u/DaystarEld][u/DaystarEld]]'s contribution. In my opinion, subtle implications can be made in books just as well as they can be made with movies.
