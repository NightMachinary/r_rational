To build on this, have you ever seen the youtube channel [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FOzD4Sfgag][Every Frame a Painting]], [[/u/ToaKraka]]? It does a great job of showing how, in the hands of a competent screen writer and director, visual and audio can communicate a hundred thousand subtle and meaningful ideas in ways that are unique to the medium. The above linked example goes to a video on comedy, but he has a ton of others to show it in other ways too.

The key word there of course is /competent,/ which might be better phrased as "exceptional." I know many people who like Abrams as a director, but personally I've found him mediocre at best. He's never "wow"ed me with his directing, for all the fancy visual effects and cutting edge CGI.
