I was dragged out to see [[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2660888][the newest /Star Trek/ movie]] in a theater. I disliked it less than I disliked the other two reboot movies (for which I /also/ was dragged to a theater...), I think--though, at this point, my memories of the other two movies are /quite/ fuzzy.

A thought that crossed my mind many times in the course of the movie was that it was a gigantic waste of money to have a zillion fancy visual effects when I wasn't enjoying /watching/ the movie any more than I would have enjoyed /reading/ [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/263012][a random /Star Wars/ novel]]. I can visualize the /Enterprise/ just as well as I can visualize the /Millennium Falcon/--a zillion enemy-of-the-week fightercraft in swarm formation as well as an endless fleet of coralskippers coordinated by a yammosk--James Kirk as well as Corran Horn. Once the basic images have been established--once the reader has something on which he can base the vision of his mind's eye (maybe nothing more than a book's front cover and back cover)--expensive sounds and images are no longer necessary.

(I've seen people on this site make jokes about how GIF files are the new silent movies--but where are all the totally-silent, impeccably-subtitled, feature-length animations in GIF style? Sigh...)

Where, /exactly,/ is the boundary between "troll" and "attention whore"?

Options...\\
- A troll /lies/ to get [[http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/you-here-s-your-you][(You)]]s, while an attention whore is /perfectly truthful./\\
- A troll comments with the /intent/ to split the community into factions of a flame war, while an attention whore just wants to get /recognition/ for himself and doesn't expect his actions to have any major effect on the people with whom he's interacting.

Do other differentiations exist?

[[http://www.fimfiction.net/blog/656630][A funny note on the occasional problems of using a website superior to FanFiction.net]]: Try comparing [[http://www.fimfiction.net][FIMFiction.net's default front page]] to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/anime/Naruto][the default front page of FanFiction.net's /Naruto/ section]].

(When I checked the latter page, I was somewhat surprised to see /several/ non-English stories--Indonesian, Spanish, and Portuguese. The numbers do check out, though: FanFiction.net has 281k Naruto stories in English, 41k in Spanish, 39k in /Indonesian,/ and 12k in Portuguese. How often do you hear about /Indonesia/ in contexts other than "largest Muslim population in the world", "giant forest fires blowing smoke to neighbors", and "hurricane/tsunami target"? I, at least, found it somewhat interesting.)

I have a few fanfiction ideas on [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4098737][my FanFiction.net profile]], if anyone wants to use them. Just last week, Facebook's "On This Day" feature reminded me of an idea that I posted two years ago to that site, but had forgotten!

(Some are more complete than others. Contrary to what you might expect, barely half of them are based on /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644][Time Braid]]/. ;-) )

[[http://i.imgur.com/FqiO2vu.png][Editing webpages before taking screenshots of them]] really is /quite/ fun.

[[http://i.imgur.com/HY8D3pX.png][Never take a screenshot at face value!]] Only [[http://archive.is][archival sites]] can be trusted.

(I wonder--are there people who manufacture totally-fake 4chan screenshots for easy karma on [[/r/4chan][r/4chan]]?)
