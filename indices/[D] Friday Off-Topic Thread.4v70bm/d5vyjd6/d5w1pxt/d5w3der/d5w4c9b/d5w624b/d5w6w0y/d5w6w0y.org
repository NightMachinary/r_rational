Hmm, so maybe I've been going about this in the wrong genre if those are your favorite comedic movies/shows. I was going to make some direct comparisons between, say, the comics of Scott Pilgrim vs the World and the movie, or the book Big Trouble and the movie, but it seems like it would be fair to say your favorite non-written comedies center around witty dialogue (for House) and slapstick (for Three Stooges/Laurel&Hardy)?

Actually maybe I can do it this way after all. Think of facial expressions that have made you laugh, or body language that an actor did that was particularly humorous. Have you ever enjoyed any Charlie Chaplin? In particular I'm thinking of the way he runs, which always makes me grin, or how he turns corners with a kind of skidding hop on one foot, one hand clutching his hat as the other holds his cane.

Sure, you can describes these things through the written word... I just did, at the most basic level, to put some kind of picture in your head and communicate the basic idea. But I'd contend that the exact mannerism of Charlie Chaplin could never be captured by words alone in as short and effective a way as he can portray it on screen, robbing him of many unique aspects of his humor. A split second of movement that can take a paragraph to describe is often much funnier visually in the context and moment you see it in, compared to the written word.
