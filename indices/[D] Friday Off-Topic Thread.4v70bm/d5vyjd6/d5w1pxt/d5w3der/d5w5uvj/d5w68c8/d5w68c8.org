  Many would not be able to generate an entire movie in their heads based on a printed story plus a front and back cover.

I myself can't claim to have a better imagination than what's necessary to generate a single cartoonish freeze-frame image at a time. Still, even a fleeting glimpse (mostly copied from memories of Sasuke's fight with Deidara in the anime) of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644/22][Cursed-Seal Sasuke sheltering himself with his wings from Sakura's assault in order to form hand-seals]] is /very/ satisfying.
