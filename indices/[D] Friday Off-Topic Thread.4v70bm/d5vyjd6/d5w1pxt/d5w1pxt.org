I think you underestimate the impact that audio and visual stimulus can have, or possibly just experience it differently from other people. A well-shot action sequence uses a vocabulary and grammar that works on a largely subconscious level, and which other mediums have only partial access to. The methods of invoking a feeling of, say, claustrophobia are completely different in film and prose.

Edit: I just realized I'm repeating Marshall McLuhan's "the medium is the message".
