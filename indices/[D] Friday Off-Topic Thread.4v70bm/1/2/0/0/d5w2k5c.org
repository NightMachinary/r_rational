In Ryuugi's "The Games We Play" Jaune primarily levels wis.

In "The Gamer" Han Jee-Han primarily levels int.

They both have trouble depicting increased intelligence, but again, I'm not certain what Int is even supposed to mean in The Gamer. It legitimately barely seems to be more than a magic stat, at least for Jee-Han. I mean I guess it's fine if Jee-Han isn't /supposed/ to get smarter with int boosts.
