That's actually a reference to how at least some (MMO)RPGs work. The default scripted response is to inform the player whenever they manage to push [[http://imgur.com/a/amnkG][the ever-so-slowly crawling]]^{1} experience bar over the edge and get a Level Up, so if you manage to kill mobs [[http://imgur.com/a/9SU78][that are significantly stronger]] than your player character, it's possible^{2} you'll insta-jump through several levels at once.

So players get classically conditioned to salivate at those delicious multiple Level Up notification lines,^{3} written in that sexy status message font and colour.
