Over on the [[https://discordapp.com/channels/196309529850281984/196309529850281984][Discord]] that about 20 or so people from [[/r/rational]] are on - mainly for pen and paper D&D games - there is a game seeking players. The plan is for there to be between 2 and 3 parties of 4-5 playing either Don't Rest Your Head, Don't Lose Your Mind, or Dragonball Z Fusion, depending on player vote. We've got around 5 players so far and the relevant channel is called unk-looking-for-group. Players who are interested please register your interest.

Also the channel somegodssomewhere are interested in more players to play The Fragile Gods of Somewhere. More information may be found in the appropriate channels.
