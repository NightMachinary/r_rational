I watched /Atlantis : The Lost Empire/ again after 15 years, and wow, this movie really isn't as good or profound as I remembered. The basic story is about an expedition to find the sunk city of Atlantis, lead by a mercenary whose face screams "Going to betray you all for money in the third act", a bunch a quirky international first-class experts in demolition/mechanic/archeology/etc, plus two hundreds crew members. The unnamed crew members start dying ridiculously fast and the expedition loses their giant steampunk submarine and most of their supplies, but after a while they finally make it into Atlantis. The local king immediately decides to kill them for trespassing and being rather obviously looking for trouble, but her daughter convinces him to let them rest for a day, then kick them out, and in the meantime asks for the archeologist's help finding the forgotten secrets of her civilization (though how they could forget anything even though they all have eternal life is beyond me). So the greedy capitalist leader of the expedition turns out to be a greedy capitalist and decides to steal the power source that keeps the atlanteans alive, go back to civilization and make loads of money. The main characters refuse to help him and get left behind, but they find Atlantean warplanes and go get the power source back, killing what's left of their fellow crew members in the battle (but who cares, their lives can't be worth anything since we don't know their names, right?). The main characters then go back to civilization with a bunch of worthless yellow metal the atlanteans had lying around, and thus become filthy rich (except the protagonist, who stays with the natives).

My main problem with this movie is that it made me feel incredibly sorry for the nameless crew members, but never followed up on it. More than a hundred redshirts die when the Leviathan sinks their submarine, and they're given a brief sort-of-funeral, then are never mentioned again, and the expedition continues without a hitch. None of the survivors mention loosing a friend or a brother, they're all perfectly content to follow the expedition's leader even when his orders get them killed, and in the final battle, none of them goes "Wait, I actually /don't/ want to die to help exterminate an ancient civilization for money". And at the end of the movie, when the main characters go back to civilization, no one seems shocked that they're the only survivors of an expedition that started with two hundred people. So even though I really liked this movie as a kid, I'm having a hard time remembering why. :p

As an aside (and not a bad thing in any way), it's funny to realize years later that the main character (Milo) is so completely Disney's Daniel Jackson. Polyglot archeologist who discovered an ancient super-advanced civilization through reading old texts, check, no one believes him (or his grandfather who said the same thing), check, is approached by a mysterious powerful expedition who believes him and needs him for an expedition, check, has trouble integrating with the military crew, check, befriends the locals first, check, stays behind with a native girl while his friends go back to civilization and pretend he's dead, check.
