I've been mainlining these in background at work and I will second the endorsement.

The bad: They are a little trope heavy and formulaic and there are some annoyingly 2 dimensional background characters.

The good: The story is often solvable, not sure if always but often. You have an great exploration of [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessSuperpowers][magic is useless]] in Dresden's finances. A rational but still emotionally irrational protagonist who knows his flaws and tries to deal with them. [[#s][Bob]]
