I have collected some information about the [[http://orangemind.io/post/rick-and-morty-writers-room][writing process on Rick and Morty]], I think you guys will find it interesting. Also I have just launched a [[http://blog.digitalmind.io][blog]] about AI and Deep Learning, I think you will find it interesting as well. I'm actively learning about the subject, and I'm planning to post everything I know.

Also, can somebody recommend some good rational urban fantasy?
