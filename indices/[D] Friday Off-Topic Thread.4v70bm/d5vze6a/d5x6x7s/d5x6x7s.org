My rationalization about their treatment of all the nameless mooks is that none of them are actually on an archeology trip. No, that's what Milo is on a trip for and as a slightly unreliable narrator that's what we see the other travelers as. Instead they are a group of people who would have been in prison for several years and are sent on a foolhardy expedition in exchange for not going to jail. Milo's backers are not actually super-powerful mysterious people who believes Milo unlike everyone else. No, his backers were people who don't want to have to house criminals for years and if Milo finds something, great! But otherwise everyone either dies or are released when they return. This explained why everyone apart from Milo seemed like a group of criminals and were willing to follow such an obvious bad guy (every other potential leader were equally shady and was a worse choice). Also, no one's going to /really/ mourn the passing of criminals.

The language thing is explained by the fact that writing systems slowly changed over time and no bothered to retain knowledge of how to read the older writings because royalty were the only ones allowed to see the engravings and even they only ever visited the engravings a handful of times in their lives. Therefore it went from a father who knew how to read them (barely) to a lazy son who pretended to be able to read them well enough to get out of the boring and "unnecessary" duty of learning how to read the carvings. Then the father died abruptly and then the son realized that nobody knows how to read the carvings well enough to teach him. They may be immortal, but that doesn't mean they can't die of something other than old age or that they can perfectly remember every skill they have learned.

Remember that this was what I thought was going on when I watched the movie as a 6-7 year-old. So I don't actually know if this makes sense in context of what we see in the movie.
