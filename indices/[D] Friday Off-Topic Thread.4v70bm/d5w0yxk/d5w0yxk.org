I just stumbled upon [[http://kissmanga.com/Manga/The-Gamer/Vol-001-Ch-001-Read-Online?id=174343][the manga]] whose fanfic [[http://rationalreads.com/?#/works/104][The Games We Play]] got shared here a while back. (I do not recommend the fanfic either.) Decided to give it a chance. Reached the part where the protagonist levels up for the first time and /puts all his points in Strength/ and dropped it in a hurry.

In the words of [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/06/02/and-i-show-you-how-deep-the-rabbit-hole-goes/][Black]]:
