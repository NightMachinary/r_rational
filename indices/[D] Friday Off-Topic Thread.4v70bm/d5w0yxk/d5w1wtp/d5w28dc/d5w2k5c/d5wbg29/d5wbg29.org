Int gain is a somewhat nebulous concept anyway. What would it mean for you to be smarter without actually knowing more? Increased working memory, greater ability to recognise cognitive biases that you already know, or perhaps simply the speed of your mental processes?

Stories that feature characters getting smarter usually take the Sherlock approach---they gain the ability to perform magical abductive reasoning (I wanted to just write "abductions", but that meaning of the word is decidedly less common) and an eidetic memory, even of things they saw /before/ the int upgrade (and, most often, never explicitly saw at all).

Actually modelling somebody's thought process and what they would get stuck on is really hard. We're poor predictors of our own future behaviour, let alone a stranger's.

One part that frustrated me about The Games We Play was that Jaune levelled int and wis so high that he effectively became psychic. That's not to mention his absurd perceptive abilities, which just kept getting closer and closer to omniscience unless the plot required him to not notice something. So Ryuugi mostly skipped illustrating his thought process and just outright handed down declarations of truth from on high.

Honestly though the thing that most frustrated me was the writing. Usually a few times per chapter he'd use the same conspicuous phrase or word in proximity. And the chapters which seemingly existed just to show off how badass the characters were ("It's apparently a tradition for large groups of ninja wizards to cause wanton destruction in a battle at funerals, so let's do that."), especially when those characters added almost nothing to the larger plot.

Oh and why, whenever Jaune levels more than once, does it say "Your level has increased by one!" multiple times? Why not "Your level has increased by 7" or at least don't specify "by one".

Eh, I could gripe about this story for a long time. It needs a brutal edit before I'd recommend it.
