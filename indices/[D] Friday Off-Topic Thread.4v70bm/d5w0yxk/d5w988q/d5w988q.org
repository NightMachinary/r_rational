Agreed on The Games We Play. It's pretty slow-paced, but the real problem is that Jaune is completely out of character, even considering the INT and WIS boosts. Which is fine IMO when, like in HPMOR, the character getting replaced is boring, but I felt like the new Jaune in this fic was less interesting. I prefer Ryuugi's Prytaneum, where Percy Jackson retains his most important character traits.
