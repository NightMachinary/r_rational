Where can I find a good naruto canon timeline? I'm mostly concerned with events that happened before the start of the show/book, covering the time between the founding of the villages and Naruto's birth. Here's one that starts when the birth of the Sannin [[http://img03.deviantart.net/ff11/i/2012/065/5/e/naruto_timeline_sketch_by_jesterry-d4rwdhg.jpg][(link)]] but seems to have some confusion about some things (like when Orochimaru flees Konoha) and doesn't go back to the founding. This one [[http://img04.deviantart.net/6828/i/2014/069/5/d/rough_naruto_timeline_by_silver_queen-d79n3cc.png][(link)]], written by a prolific Naruto fic author, seems to be the best I can find. What do you use when you write Naruto fic?
