I remember a writing parable.

A writer was going to write a novel. They decided that they would just write the "exciting" parts first and then go back and do all the "boring" parts afterwards. After writing all the exciting parts, the writer looked over their work, and decided to publish the novel as it was.

I believe the moral is: if even you the writer find a particular part boring, then why are you even including it in the story? Either it's necessary, in which case there must be a way of making it interesting, or it's not necessary, in which case why even include it?

You're writing ratfic; you can assume some intelligence on the part of your audience. Just tell us a certain thing happened, let those of us who care about some particular detail speculate, and then you can come back later and either confirm the speculation you find most interesting or use what we come up with as a starting point and go back over that part in a flashback later.
