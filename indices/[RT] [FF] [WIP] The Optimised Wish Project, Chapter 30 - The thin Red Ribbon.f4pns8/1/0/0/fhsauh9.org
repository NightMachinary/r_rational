Hmm, that's a cool idea when looking for directions to push the story into - btw I even have story dice I could use for that - but what I am thinking about is more just actually mustering the mental strength to stay focused and start writing words at all. I usually know well enough what must happen, but if I'm in bad condition my brain will just go dum-dum and I will even have a hard time finding the right words (this usually following a day of intellectual work on either coding, paper writing, physics theory, or the worst option of all - office politics and project management).
