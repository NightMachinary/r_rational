Ah, you're right, the flowing fist the girl uses at the end to block the opponents' shot and then send it back to them! I think that was inspired by tai chi? Anyway it probably lingered somewhere in my mind and affected the way I wrote that scene, the concept of dissipating the kinetic energy of the projectile by partially going along with it is very much the same.
