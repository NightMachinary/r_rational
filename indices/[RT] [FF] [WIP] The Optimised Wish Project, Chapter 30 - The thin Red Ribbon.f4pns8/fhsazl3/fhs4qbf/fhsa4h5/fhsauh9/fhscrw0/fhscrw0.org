For that, I generally use my wife pushing me into writing. She frequently really wants to find out what happens next, I want house cleaning, kisses, dinner, or some errand. We do a lot of trading. Recently I was miserable and said I wanted 3 things to resolve some minor point about a missing arm of a just found doll of a Canal Control system, because it was ALREADY going to be repaired later and so surely the specifics of the one doll arm didn't matter.

But she apparently really wanted to know, because she did all 3 things just for me to write a scene about the group, exhausted and grumpy ( I was channeling my own emotions) tracking down little clues until they found the one remaining doll arm to make repairs cheaper.

I don't know if â€˜Marry someone who likes your writing' is generalizable advice, but it really does boost writing output for me.
