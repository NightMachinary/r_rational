Ouch, that's not really doable for me either.

I've got a girlfriend, we live together and we both write, but our styles and tastes couldn't be any more different. She probably hasn't read a sci-fi or fantasy novel once in her life, it'd likely bore her out of her mind, and she in fact just doesn't like reading in English as she finds it tiring. She's often surprised that I can write in it as my main language at all, despite not being mothertongue myself. She's read some of my original stories, but concerning this or other fanfictions, she's often not nearly familiar enough with the setting to be interested or able to appreciate them either. Conversely, I do read sometimes what she writes, but it's not much my cup of tea. Very non-rational, in fact - often mood driven rather than plot or character, sort of stream of consciousness stuff with a strong magical realism bent. Very descriptive and with rather purple prose. I give her my best opinions but I've sometimes told her perhaps she'd be better off finding someone else to have them read her work because I realise I don't exactly give off an aura of enthusiasm when talking about it, but I can't help it. I don't think she's bad, in fact I think she should be more confident and spread it around more, get some good feedback from people who DO appreciate the genre - it's just that I very much don't.

Good for you that you can, though! That sounds fun.
