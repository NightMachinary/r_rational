I know I'm doing that a lot, but I don't want to go overboard with it. To avoid confusing both the readers and myself.

To be fair, I think that style of writing would be much easier to handle if I was writing a novel to be published in one go. Then I could go back and forth, fix things if I realise they don't work with what happens later, and so on. In that perspective, non-linear narration becomes only a matter of reshuffling a story that you have all the time to plan in a very traditional, linear fashion. The same does not hold here - of course I have a decent plan of the whole story, but the devil's in the details sometimes, and once a chapter is out, it's set in stone for my purposes.

(says this right before writing Chapter 32, which again will feature /massive/ flashbacks...)
