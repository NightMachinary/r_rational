I can see how writing serially as opposed to block publication would be harder since you're stuck with whatever you've already shown the audience. In the /So You Want to Be a Wizard/ series, the author had been writing the series for literal decades and some technological advances made certain things obsolete, so in the most recent book she invoked an Author Fiatâ„¢ and proclaimed that the series now takes place in 2011, so she doesn't have to worry about tech creep anymore.

It's okay to say, "Hey I've thought of a better way of doing this but my previous posts have me stuck in a corner, so I'm retconning this that and the other thing. Sorry for any inconvenience, and I'll try not to make a habit of doing this". If you're upfront about it, I'm sure most of us readers would be understanding.
