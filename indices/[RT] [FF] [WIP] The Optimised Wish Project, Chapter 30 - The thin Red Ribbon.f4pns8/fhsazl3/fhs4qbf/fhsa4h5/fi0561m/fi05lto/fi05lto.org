I mean, the chapters I'm writing right now are slower for me because they require a lot of thinking about who's where, multiple parallel events, and often that means I need to focus a lot on things happening and people talking rather than getting to fly a bit higher and more free in terms of prose or concepts. That said, I can't really say "ok, let's just jump to when [...]" as it would just make no sense. I think the example of that parable works only depending on what your novel is aiming to be. Any plot-driven story needs some sort of connective tissue to keep it together - not to mention, a story can't be on overdrive 100% of the time or it would get exhausting, readers need some breathing time, you have climaxes and then lulls to recover from them and set the board for what happens next.

Perhaps part of this is also the problem with writing a fanfic and posting it live. If you find out that maybe after all you could have pushed the story in a different direction for maximum writing enjoyment... it's too late.

  You're writing ratfic; you can assume some intelligence on the part of your audience. Just tell us a certain thing happened, let those of us who care about some particular detail speculate, and then you can come back later and either confirm the speculation you find most interesting or use what we come up with as a starting point and go back over that part in a flashback later.

Hmm, I see your point. I guess maybe that could be applicable for some things, but if I went too far with it, there just would be no story at all. I already don't spend whole chapters simply describing people training or doing research (see what I did with Chapter 27, where that had been what I had originally in mind), but right now I don't feel like I can skip too much material without making the story feel disjointed.
