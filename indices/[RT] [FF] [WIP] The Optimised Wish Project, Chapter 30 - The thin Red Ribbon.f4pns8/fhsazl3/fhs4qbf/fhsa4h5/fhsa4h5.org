You could try using a randomized writing system. Say the situation is such that after the Red ribbon chapters, Goku is sparring with Yamcha, and they're supposed to both be talking about Bulma... but there's writing block on how the conversation is supposed to go.

You set up some emotions on a die, and then set up a separate success/failure die for each. I rolled using my system, and I got: Goku: Happy, successful Yamcha: Flat, successful

So the conversation goes well in general, but Goku will come off as happier. Maybe Yamcha is still regretting he's not dating Bulma, not enough to cause him harm, but enough for him to chat with Goku about it. Goku focuses on how much help Bulma has been providing in training, and Yamcha shrugs and feels he probably has a point.

Running that exact same system with a different set of rolls: Goku: Berserk, successful Yamcha: Curious, successful

It's a full moon, and Goku is pissed that Bulma is still prying about his Giant Ape transformation, since she said she wouldn't and he only got control over it once. Yamcha is curious to see how it goes, since he hadn't promised that. Goku sighs, goes outside, transforms, and then proceeds to resume sparring with Yamcha in Giant ape form, forcing Yamcha to go far more heavy on dodging as he watches Goku's moves.

One more time: Goku: Sad, failure Yamcha: Curious, successful

Yamcha is surprised to beat Goku in a sparring match, since he'd expect it to be the other way around. Apparently, Goku is miserable after finding out from Bulma processing reports from her Mark 2 system that he killed 440 people while fighting Red Ribbon. It's a very large number, easily more than some entire villages he went through early in his journey. Yamcha can't console him himself, but he thinks Bulma may know, so goes to get her.

Anyhow, not that any one of those 3 is the right direction to go in particular, but it definitely can help you to push past a blank page.
