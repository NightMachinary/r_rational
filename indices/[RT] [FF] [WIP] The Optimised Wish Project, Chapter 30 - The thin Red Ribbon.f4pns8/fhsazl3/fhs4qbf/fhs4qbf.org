Slowest update yet I think. I'm really quite out of it these days. Out of curiosity, do you have any specific techniques/ways to get into the writing mindset? I enjoy it when I manage it and it's actually a great way for me to take my mind off anything that's stressing me out at a given time - it's just that if I am stressed out, or worried, or tired, it's very hard for me to ever get to that point, and often end up focusing on more relaxing and brainless activities (like gaming). I assume I'm not alone in that, but it's frustrating nonetheless. I've tried just putting myself in front of the page and forcing myself to start writing, but it usually only ends up stressing myself more, and not producing anything. Perhaps it works best if I leave the work at a point where the continuation is really obvious - like midway through an action scene - so that when I pick it back up I have an easy hook, but it doesn't come natural to do that because of course when I am in flow I just want to see what I'm doing wrapped up well.
