What works for me sometimes is skipping ahead to a part of the story/chapter that I'm excited about or can easily visualize. Even if all I'm doing is setting a scene, or writing stilted, basic dialogue, or even "outlining" each upcoming plot point, it's still progress that can help jostle things free and make it easier to write more when the mood hits.
