Thanks for the new chapter, I continue to enjoy this story a lot :) I don't know if this is in the cards, but one thing I'm really looking forward to is Bulma augmenting herself to become a powerful fighter akin to the +androids+ cyborgs. No reason to let Dr. Gero have all the augmenting-human-fun, especially since Bulma is so much more ambitious and focused on the bigger picture in this story.
