I mean that scenario is still possible just a bit less likely nowadays. It's just not possible to know if someone has burakumin ancestry based on the family name or based on look. So, instead people would find out based on where the people lived (the so call dowa chiku). Background checks were often conducted by companies to determine if someone came from such an area and not hire them. There was a company that used to sell a book listing all of the names and locations of dowa areas and that was used in private investigations. Since then, the Japanese government has forbidden publication of any maps listing those areas, of list of dowa people and of background checks which makes it difficult for someone to know that someone who moved out of those dowa areas has burakumin ancestry.

And since people usually go to the school near where they live, kids who live in a dowa area would tend to be at a school with a sizeable population from the same area.

Zainichi are more easily bullied because of their name, it's easy for other kids in the school to know that they are zainichi. Another group that gets bullied are "haafu" (japanese pronuncation of Half), they are kids with one non-japanese parent. It's getting a bit better in big cities but still a huge problem (and of course, Japan doesn't have any anti-discrimination law).

Anyway, also wanted to chime in that I really enjoy your work and look forward to each new chapter :)
