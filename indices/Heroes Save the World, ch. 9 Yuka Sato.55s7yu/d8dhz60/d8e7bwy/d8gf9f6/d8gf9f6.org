For what it's worth, the cultural diversity in your story is (currently) one of the more compelling aspects to me; it's hitting a lot of the same parts that I really like about Animorphs and The Reckoning (seeing events from many distinct perspectives and how they affect those characters differently).

For the cultures that I'm not familiar with, I probably wouldn't notice smaller inconsistencies, but any and all research that goes into making those more and more accurate is greatly appreciated.

Keep up the great work!
