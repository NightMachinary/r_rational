One small note, usually burakumin would tend to live in a d≈çwa chiku area and go to the same school so bullying is a bit more limited. They do face strong discrimination and even coming from a dowa chiku neighbourhood can make it more difficult to get a job but a lot of the discrimination come from older generations.

On the other hand, second or third generation koreans (Zainichi) who were born in Japan, only speak Japanese and have no ties to Korea are mercilessly bullied and are also heavily discriminated against.
