Thank you!

Yuka would probably have more or less the same scene if she were zainichi, since they are also stereotyped as criminals (IIRC they are often thought to be connected to the yakuza, yes?). It is interesting to me, though, that if she were haafu then we might see /most/ of this chapter play out as it did, but depending on the stereotypes and insults involved she might not have had the same response to her actions.

That could go very badly...

I'm glad that you're enjoying this. Kudos are the fuel on which my writing-engine runs.
