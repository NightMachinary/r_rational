Thank you! I was really worried about whether it would go over well to have these side chapters that didn't have obvious connections to the main narrative, but I felt that it was important to cast a wider net and let the reader get a sense of things as they're happening across the world.

Also, they're really, really fun to write. Writing pieces of a longer narrative is fun too, but it's something else entirely to write these little nuggets, and I like that I can do both.

I am also very happy with the comparison to The Reckoning, since that's one of my favorite stories on this subreddit. >:]
