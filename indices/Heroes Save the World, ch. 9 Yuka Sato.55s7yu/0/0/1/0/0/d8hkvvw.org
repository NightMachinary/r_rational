Honestly, where we're at in the story this far, I assumed the background is still being established, so I don't yet feel like any characters we've been introduced to yet is necessarily a side character (though you'd obviously know better than me), especially since none of them have met or interacted directly yet.

Regardless of whether they are central to the main plot or not, I agree that showing the perspectives of the wider world as events unfold is valuable, and will continue to be of interest to me.
