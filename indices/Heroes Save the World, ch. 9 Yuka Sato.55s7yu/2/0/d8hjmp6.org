Oh dear. "For now"? How ominous! >:P

I watched some of Heroes but didn't finish the first season, so I can see what you're talking about but can't say for sure how long that will last.

Thank you for the criticism. It's always good to get that sort of feedback.

Tense weirdness is something that I've noticed too. In later chapters it's mostly been "Well technically the tense is correct but it confused a beta at first so let's figure out how to change it anyway," but if you notice anything else then I'd love to find out about it ([[/u/alexanderwales]] has an app on his wordpress that makes it a lot simpler to inform the author of a typo, but AFAICT you need to be spending money to have your own site to use it).
