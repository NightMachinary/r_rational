If you take the premise seriously, it becomes far more insidious. Yudkowsky is just an average peasant in the system, and the propoganda was successful. There is no dissent because the "Very Serious People" are the only ones who debate things. (And they successfully propogandized to the populace that they are the coordinators and that's ok, and they're doing a good enough job that no one's revolting) Like, the Quiet Cities sound kinda horrible actually, basically concentration camps for the 5% of people who can't contribute to society, even if they're well made. And starving people if they have kids and then become depressed?

It's not worse than IRL, but it's definitely no freedom-loving utopia. Heck he even outright says it:

This is practically a classic "Brave New World" scenario. Especially notable is the whole "if a city-state materialized on Earth it'd immediately try to build WMDs and hold the world hostage" which is basically a coordination failure in and of itself. But yeah, it's nothing special and the AMA formst isn't the best for making engaging reading.
