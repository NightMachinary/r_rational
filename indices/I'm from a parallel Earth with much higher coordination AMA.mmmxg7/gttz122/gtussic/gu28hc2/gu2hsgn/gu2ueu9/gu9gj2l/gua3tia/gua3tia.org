The thing here seems to result from a difference in understood background reality (portion of pathological unhappiness that's genetic) and, on your part, a failure to internalize that Dath Ilan /isn't Earth/. No, really, it isn't. When you read about any one factor, you shouldn't be understanding it in the context of Earth, you should be understanding it in the context of Dath Ilan.

The entire state of society is set up to help people flourish. To help them be /happy/. From plopping everyone in one city to paving the sidewalks with bouncy material so people's knees don't hurt to adding mile tall cranes and wires everywhere and making housing modular so people can live with their friends with low rents to painting those cranes and wires blue so they don't interfere with views as much to installing fucking laser bug zappers on every corner so nobody gets annoyed by mosquitos. Reading about Dath Ilan and not inventing reasons to hate it but just paying attention to what's /actually there/ reveals a society /vastly/ more conducive to happiness than ours. For fucks sake, the attractive people voluntarily veil themselves so that when people have unattractive partners they don't feel disappointed! There are hundreds of /actually different/ places a person can shop around between to find one that makes them happy, and Dath Ilan is rich enough that they can actually afford to do that, and in fact have a whole system of infrastructure set up to make moving easier! A ridiculous amount of effort has gone into making Dath Ilan a place conducive to happiness. You just ignored that so you could shout about how Yudkowsky including one particular part of that massive edifice in his hypothetical society composed of people /actually very different from Earth humans/ made him a monster.

I'd also like to mention that, if I end up married to someone else who has severe problems with depression like I do, I'm not having children. Outside that specific circumstance, I'm undecided. But you don't instantiate people who have a solid forty percent chance of experiencing existence as torture until they eventually manage to kill themselves. That's hilariously unethical.

I can adopt.

Don't invent new facts about the program to be displeased by, read about what's /actually there/ and then criticize /that/ instead of making something up. Governments in the conventional sense /don't exist/ in Dath Ilan. Nobody is being shuffled through a system they don't want to be in, here. You don't sign anything away in the future. You just, if you have children, stop getting free money. You apparently have problems with that. Well, fine. That's not unreasonable. After a few generations of actual adoption of the norms behind the plan, which you'll get in Dath Ilan but not Earth, you'll end up with vastly fewer people born who experience existence itself as roughly equivalent to being burned alive, at least in terms of what they will do to escape it. But you will also, even in Dath Ilan, be leaving some number of people to die, and be paying some number of people to not have children they would have wanted to have, on pain of having to work if they have kids.

Importantly, they all /grew up knowing this/, and reading between the lines, the stupidest of them would probably be smarter than average on Earth, and so it's already a cultural touchstone that /of course/ having kids means you don't get to opt out of civilization! You've just made a bid that what civilization needs is /more people like you/.

If you can't work /for dispositional reasons/, there are largescale charities set up which have tried to /build cities that people like that can be happy in/. But these charities don't want to result in there being a massive underclass of people who can't work for dispositional reasons, which is what happens if you give depressed people free money, build entire cities optimized for their happiness, and then, predictably, they move there, because they can't be happy in cities optimized for non-depressed people, but maybe things will be a bit better in a Quiet City. So, they say, “we'll stop giving you free money if you have children.”

If you compare that to the way people too depressed to work get treated /on Earth/, they come out vastly ahead. You, uh, probably don't know how that is. People don't like learning about it, since it's unpleasant. But if you can't function on Earth, you're kind of fucked. If you're lucky, you'll get on disability somewhere. But getting on disability is a Kafkaesque nightmare, and it's a small enough amount of money that you might be reduced to eating beans and rice for thirty years. Or cat food. Oh, and you're literally /not allowed to save money/. If you do, they kick you off. And, crucially, our civilization is /sufficiently poor/ that it actually can't afford to be much better than that. Oh, somewhat better, sure. But not /much better/, /everywhere/. We could afford to, specifically, make it better for people on disability. And the bit where it's a nightmare to get on and we kick people off for saving money could just be removed. But we couldn't make /everything/ that much better all at once, without completely collapsing under the load. Dath Ilan maybe could, and you can argue should, that doing otherwise is a mistake. That its too coercive to be worth it, and /maybe/ it would be acceptable if everyone got enough money to be fine and you could get /more/ if you agreed not to have children. I'd actually agree with that myself; it's probably enough to get the benefits they want without leaving anyone to starve.

But, importantly, In a world with /actually different/ culture, things are going to be felt to be different amounts of coercive. Earth humans don't have a compulsive need to commit arson such that they can't be happy without burning things down, so we feel free to punish arson with jail time. However, if people /did/ feel that compulsive need for arson, jailing people for it would be inhuman. We'd have to retool all of society around allowing for it, but that's what we'd actually do. In Dath Ilan, they have an actually different culture. If you, as an individual, explicitly offered to an average depressed Dath Ilani, to /personally/ give them money in exchange for not having children while they are still receiving the money, they would be /insulted/. Not because of your condition on helping them. But because you thought they were so /irresponsible/, so /unethical/, that they might create people who had a statistically higher than normal chance of experiencing life as torture. In that cultural milieu, different things are appropriate.

That isn't Earth? You don't see a way to make Earth culture more like that? Eliezer's description of Dath Ilan is not /supposed/ to be a description of things Earth should do to be better, and he literally says that. Some parts are supposed to be things we could lift out wholesale, like non-bespoke housing specifically constructed to be modular and moveable. But he specifically signposts those. The rest of it is worldbuilding of an interesting foreign culture filled with, from our perspective, geniuses. It is more than a little disquieting, since that's how you /actually feel/ when confronted with a /genuinely/ foreign culture. This is really basic “understanding other cultures” and “doing Sci-Fi worldbuilding well.” Their different culture has had the predictable /massive/ negative consequences that follow from its specifications, and he actually discusses those himself, and even the version of himself he's roleplaying, who's /from/ Dath Ilan, thinks Dath Ilan is /too much/ like itself, and would, upon encountering Earth, predictably have a /massive blow-up/ about all the ways they'd screwed up.

Oh, and regarding the bit about roleplaying, I think you must have started writing your response before my edit, where I specify what I think about that whole thing. In short, I think Eliezer is "merely roleplaying" in the sense that this isn't an instruction manual for how to get from Earth to utopia, so criticizing it for failing to provide sufficient instructions is a mistake. Similarly, when people criticize a lack of detail in certain places. Both /would/ be appropriate if it was an instruction manual, or not medium-effort messing about. I mean, sure, there are gaps. Point out that its medium-effort messing about and so there are enough flaws in the description that things would need to be fleshed out out before people could use it as the setting of a thousand-word science fiction novel, sure. Just don't completely dismiss it as worthless drivel the author is an idiot for writing since it doesn't include an instruction manual.

Honestly, a part of my defense of this is that, as a depressed person, I read about Dath Ilan's treatment of people like me and thought "god I wish I was there instead of here." As a result, I'm somewhat annoyed when people talk about how monstrous they would be for horribly coercing me by being /vastly/ better to me than I'm damn sure the people criticizing the horrible horrible coercion would be. Most people would, at best, do just enough to satisfy their own emotional state, and then stop bothering. They might give me money out of their own pockets regardless of whether I had children, but I wouldn't bet on it. They damn well wouldn't build the people like me Quiet Cities. Maybe I'm wrong about that, and you say you've dealt with some of the same things I have, so it isn't like everyone in circumstances like mine would react like that.

But could you at least treat it as evidence that I do, and not just dismiss it as blind tribalism?
