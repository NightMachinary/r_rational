So, eugenics as it has typically been practiced over the course of human history is considered terrible for /damn good reasons/. The history of eugenics is the history of forced sterilizations and mass murder. So it makes real sense to read about something that can be described as eugenics and have alarm bells go off in your head.

On the other hand, there are plenty of things that are technically eugenics, but are also unambiguously good. Gene therapy that cures genetic disorders is eugenics. Embryo screening for debilitating genetic diseases that will kill your child before they reach ten is eugenics. If we figured out how to create pills that made people smarter, and also altered their genes so their children would be smarter, and then did everything possible to subsidize them so anyone could afford them, because it would be /wrong/ to have that kind of lifechanging technology and restrict it, that would be eugenics.

The "eugenics" in Dath Ilan consist of two pieces. The first is that they have different ideas of how well you should be positioned before it's responsible to have children, including that you shouldn't pass on genetic disorders that are going to debilitate them, which, in this version of reality, apparently is thought to include a genetic predisposition to depression. The second portion is the one and only enforcement mechanism that Dath Ilan has for this. The mechanism is that nobody has to work if they don't want to, as long as they don't have kids. Nobody is forced to do anything. Nobody is murdered. And that matters.

I have depression. It's not that bad, as far as depression goes, anymore. But there were entire years of my life that were quite literally torture. I remember on one occasion, long after my depression had gotten quite a bit better, I got a cut so deep you could see bone. It hurt. A lot. And I remember thinking about the fact that it hurt less than just existing did, during the worst years I had. My mom has it worse than I do. She spends most of her time in that kind of state. Every single one of my siblings has problems with depression. I wouldn't be shocked if more than one person in my family ended up committing suicide. The benefit of Dath Ilan's system is that fewer people suffer like I used to, and my mom still does. The cost is that once you've had kids, you don't have absolute freedom from having to work anymore. Whether that's worth it is something you can disagree with. It's not something so obviously foolish that you should greet it with ridicule and mockery.

EDIT: And the part where people here are treating it like something it's not is the bit where they criticize Eliezer for not laying out a clear sequence of steps we can take to move from here to Dath Ilan. That's ridiculous, since he's not trying to describe a system easily reached from here, and in fact he says so himself. Similarly, when people react to /the character he is roleplaying/ expressing a lack of knowledge about something, and respond as if this is /Eliezer the actual person/ failing to fill in all the details on his utopia blueprint, when he isn't trying to create a utopia blueprint at all, because this is medium-effort fucking around he did on April Fools.
