E.Y. has this to say on education /"Yup! Sex Teacher is a very different concept from High-Grade Expensive Professional Sex Worker. Your sex teacher is definitely not more attractive than your average partner will be, for example."/ So ignoring all the massive, massive sociological and psychological problems with this.... if someone is doing or coaching a physical activity all day, they will probably be fairly attractive than someone that has to ride a chair for a living. What a joke.
