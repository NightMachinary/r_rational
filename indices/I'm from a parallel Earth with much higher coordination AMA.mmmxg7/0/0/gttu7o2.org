"people will be assigned work that suits them."

--uh, in my opinion it can be really hard to figure out what kind of work suits someone

"trust me, it will work, cuz that's how I designed it. Oh also did I mention that people who are too depressed to work will be sent to The Happy Place, where they aren't allowed to have children because then they might dilute the gene pool with their Depressed Gene?"

I also like the part where Yudkowsky explains that the +Rationalist Philosopher Kings+, ahem, /Very Serious People/ can be trusted to decide everything through public debate, because they actually have no power at all, even though they seem to decide everything??

Frankly, this is about as useful as reading a facebook debate, because /surprise/, that's what it is.
