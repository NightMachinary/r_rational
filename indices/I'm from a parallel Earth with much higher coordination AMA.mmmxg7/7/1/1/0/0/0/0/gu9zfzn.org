The cost is that in Dath Ilan I have the option to stop working /whenever I want/ and retire from society. I just barely managed to crawl my way up from a hell I lived in for half a decade. But I still /remember/ what it was like to be there. I'd have given up my /legs/ for that. And if I do retire, the price /isn't/ anything permanent. I just have to leave and go to work if I want to have children. If I pulled myself back together in Dath Ilan, which I would have, since it would have been /way easier/ with unconditional actually adequate support, I wouldn't have lost anything. I might face some cultural disapproval if I decided to have children, but on the other hand the condition as written is "are" unhappy, not "were" unhappy, so I'd probably be fine.

It would be far better to have been born there, than here. And unless you think abortion is horrifically unethical, you don't actually have a leg to stand on when you act like making it less likely for me to be instantiated is an atrocity.

The rest of your comment is, as far as I can tell, entirely responses to your own inventions, not corresponding to either the text or reasonable interpretations thereof.
