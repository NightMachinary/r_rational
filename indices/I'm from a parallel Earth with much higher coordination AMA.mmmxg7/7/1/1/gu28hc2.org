I'll fold this into a single comment:

[[/u/Restinan][u/Restinan]]:

Indeed. When I read comments like that, I feel like they've been written by teenage trolls.

  If it's supposed to be a joke
#+end_quote

It's a joke in the sense that Eliezer isn't really from dath ilan. It's not a joke in the sense that dath ilan is meant to actually work that way if it were a real planet.

#+begin_quote
  general lack of seriousness
#+end_quote

What I said was:

#+begin_quote
  content-free/low-effort/(borderline) rude comments
#+end_quote

There is a way to write casual comments which fall into none of those three buckets (as opposed to writing comments that fall into all of them).

#+begin_quote
  There's nothing here that really seems to engage with actual issues and problems that I can relate to or discuss.
#+end_quote

People who were discussing it with Eliezer on Facebook /did/ find something in there to discuss, so consider that you not finding anything there to discuss might be about you.

#+begin_quote
  everyone here read the same thing
#+end_quote

One of the top commenters "only read about a fifth," and I wouldn't put much stock into others reading much more. Of course, they have no obligation to read it - but let's not pretend they're actually responding to anything specific in there (which, I'd imagine, would be rather hard since /they haven't read it/).
