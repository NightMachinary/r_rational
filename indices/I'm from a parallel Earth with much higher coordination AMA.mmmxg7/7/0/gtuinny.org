eh, I think the general lack of seriousness in this thread is a simple response to the general lack of seriousness in what was written. The way Yudkowsky brushes over actual questions of economics, political authority, and human nature is just way too glib to take seriously. It just comes across as a cute, rationalist fantasy-utopia where everything works because at some point everyone on planet Earth decided to share the exact same values.

Maybe I am super biased, but the whole thing just feels very surface level? There's nothing here that really seems to engage with actual issues and problems that I can relate to or discuss. And when someone raises an important question like, 'how can a society convince the majority of people to want to work towards a greater good and a collective set of values and ideas, without relying on some form of authoritarianism or propaganda?,' Yudkowsky just ignores it. He's not interested in answering deep, thorny questions, and instead the majority of what he's writing boils down to "all of the rationalists will determine a maximally optimal solution to society's organization that happens to be remarkably similar to how I personally think the world should be organized." It's rather tiresome and at best mildly amusing, which is why I think people are responding in a similar way.
