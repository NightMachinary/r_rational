Yeah, the number of people here spewing vitriol over an April Fools joke that they clearly didn't even bother to actually read is mildly concerning. Maybe actually read the post, instead of hallucinating an entirely separate post to dunk on? The premise is that Dath Ilan is a society that would generate Eliezer as an average person, and Eliezer, as an average person, doesn't properly understand how it formed. The post isn't Eliezer's version of the Communist manifesto, it's Eliezer roleplaying someone talking about an alternate society they come from but only sort of understand, like a randomly selected modern transported to 1650 trying to explain the modern world. It's an April Fools joke, not an instruction manual for utopia, and acting as though it's trying to be the latter instead of the former so you can point out flaws in the manual is ridiculous.
