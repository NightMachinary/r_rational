The cost of Dath Ilan is that you are not allowed to exist there. Because the thing causing you pain is "obviously" hardcoded inside you, and can not possibly be environment-related.

Because pain is not a useful signal that sometimes works wrong. It is the thing that we, as a civilization, should work hard to make ourselves blind to. Isn't that the most rational thing, to willingly ignore painful things?

So the /possibility/ of you must be crushed. Haha funny joke Eliezer.
