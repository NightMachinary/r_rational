Most utopian projects have some sort of social critique, whether we are talking about Bacon's /New Atlantis/ or [[https://www.google.com/search?q=the+world+if+meme&sxsrf=ALeKk02slcAW8T5HIQBQJqJS2l6Uy8IONw:1618251773668&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj7-4DRqfnvAhVZGVkFHdp7DOkQ_AUoAXoECAEQAw&biw=1280&bih=644&dpr=2]["The World If..." memes]]. That's how I approached this, and whether that is the intended interpretation is something we disagree upon. I do contend that the way this is framed as simply being due to "higher coordination" (an issue which EY happens to have written an entire book about, it seems), as well as being a transparent retread of EY's personal opinions ([[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/gvA4j8pGYG4xtaTkw/i-m-from-a-parallel-earth-with-much-higher-coordination-ama?commentId=aqabziEo6vuA35Jjc][as others have pointed out]]), is what led me to that approach.

If you can read this as pure fiction, I say go for it. I think my issue was more with commenters who thought it was "disturbing" that people weren't taking the writing seriously, implying that this text held some deep value, especially when it haphazardly plays with rather disturbing ideas with little regard for external realities.
