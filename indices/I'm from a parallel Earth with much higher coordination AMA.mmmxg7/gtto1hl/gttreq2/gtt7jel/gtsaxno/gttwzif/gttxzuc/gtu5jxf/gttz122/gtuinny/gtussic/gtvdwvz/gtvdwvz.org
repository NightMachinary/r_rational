If it's supposed to be a joke I think some of it might have been lost in translation to a blog post (medium is the message, McCluhan-style).

You're on Facebook, you follow YD and you see this post on April 1st. You obviously get the context and that Eliezer is just up to some good old fashioned memery.

You're on Reddit, on April 8th, on a subreddit called [[/r/rational]] but really more about webnovels. You find a blog post by someone called Eliezer Yudkowsky, who you know a little bit about but not that much. The blog post is super long, about some weird rationalist utopia/dystopia and the whole thing feels shallow and nonsensical so you don't think it is worth your time.

I think that's much closer to what's going on here. I don't think people didn't read it or are "hallucinating" anything---everyone here read the same thing, I don't think it makes sense to discount reactions as anything other than honest reactions.

Frankly I don't really understand the joke myself. I get that he's role-playing as a denizen of rational-land, but however you spin it, it is pretty much just YD role-playing as himself. Maybe it would be funny if I was on facebook and I could browse through it absentmindedly, maybe asking a silly question myself, but turning it into a blog post makes it feel like I'm supposed to read the whole thing, which is rather tedious. Like the act of turning it into a blog post implies there is something to be gleaned here, so I think people were expecting more than a joke consisting of 10k+ words.
