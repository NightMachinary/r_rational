I thought the logical inconsistencies in the text I quoted were relatively clear, but I may have made a mistake by neglecting to explain it fully. To be sure, the type of eugenics we are discussing here is one where individuals have their reproductive rights taken away, either by sterilization or other means. Gene therapy or embryo screenings are categorically different, I don't think it makes sense to bring these up as examples of why we shouldn't be extremely skeptical someone suggesting eugenics as a rational project.

First off, EY's principles for this program makes no sense. Happiness isn't an inheritable trait, and neither can mental illness be fully attributed to genetics. My estimate would be that any genetic disposition for happiness would be at about 50%, the other half consisting of societal and environmental factors. That is my /charitable/ estimate here. The problem is, if EY is trying to create a happier society, why would he suggest eugenics to solve something that isn't fully a genetic problem?

The second issue here is something you obliquely mentioned. "No one is forced to do anything," so what's the problem? The problem is that this is a program explicitly directed towards people who are too sick (due to any reason, whether genetic or not) to work and support themselves. Poor, mentally ill people who need state assistance. In EY's world, you don't get help until you've given up your right to have children. On some level it makes sense: the whole point here is that EY doesn't want these people to have children, so just give them the choice between starving and giving up their reproductive rights. It's also coercive and cruel. Worse, it's ineffective. Plenty of people would be shuffled through this system who don't even have genetic defects, yet would be forced to give up their reproductive rights (and I refraining from saying sterilized, though historically this has been the most effective way of enforcing this). If the aim here is to maximize happiness, I don't see how this is especially effective at anything besides manufacturing cruelty.

So in short, EY's idea builds off illogical principles to justify a "rational" eugenics program that is laughably inept and unintentionally cruel. I think that is something that we can laugh at for how ridiculously stupid it is.

But then, I would be making a crucial mistake. For I have ignored that EY was /merely roleplaying/ and I should never have taken his ideas so seriously. However, regardless of whatever veneer EY decides to coat his writing with, the point remains that EY is intending to share Good Ideas. The purpose of the post is that he is describing an "Earth with much higher coordination," ie, how Earth would look if it followed EY's personal, rational principles. You obviously agree with me here, for otherwise why would you bother to defend the merits of EY's eugenics program if it was just an elaborate form of roleplay? Trying to play both sides here (it's only a serious idea until you take it too seriously) is weak rhetoric and reeks of double-think and tribalism.
