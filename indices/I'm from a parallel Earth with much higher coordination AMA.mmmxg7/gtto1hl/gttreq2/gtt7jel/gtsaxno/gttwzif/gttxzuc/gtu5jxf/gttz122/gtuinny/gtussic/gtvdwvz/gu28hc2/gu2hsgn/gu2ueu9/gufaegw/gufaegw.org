To complement Restinan's explanations/comments, here is my answer:

  I understand now that there is a certain jokey-ness within the post ... So is the text a joke or does it merit serious discussion?
#+end_quote

The joke is Eliezer not actually being from dath ilan, not the social practices in the text being jokes.

I feel like dath ilan maybe deserves a serious discussion in the context of dath ilan, not necessarily in the context of Earth.

  [T]he type of eugenics we are discussing here is one where individuals have their reproductive rights taken away, either by sterilization or other means.
#+end_quote

Here we'll have to agree to disagree (namely, I don't believe that not supporting someone unless they don't have kids constitutes "having their reproductive rights taken away").

#+begin_quote
  If someone calls something trash, but admits they only read a fifth of it, that is a way of indicating that the portion they read was trash.
#+end_quote

Right. And if A reads 20% of something, B reads the entire text and C says that A and B have both read the same thing, I'd consider C's statement misleading.

#+begin_quote
  So is the text a joke or does it merit serious discussion? It feels like intellectual plausible deniability, an excuse for ignoring valid criticism.
#+end_quote

I noticed two specific pieces of criticism in the comments here - the supposed eugenics (which I wouldn't counter by saying "it was a joke," so that part's fine) and the Very Serious People deciding "everything" despite having no power (that I /also/ wouldn't counter by saying it was a joke - there I think the answer might be that the people who wouldn't listen to them would find themselves on the receiving end of the rest of the society penalizing them for that, once it inevitably turned out they were right (but maybe someone else will correct me)).

#+begin_quote
  I think my issue was more with commenters who thought it was "disturbing" that people weren't taking the writing seriously, implying that this text held some deep value
#+end_quote

  I'll just say that the proportion of content-free/low-effort/(borderline) rude comments in this thread disturbs me.
#+end_quote

Notice the difference between your interpretation and what I actually wrote.
