I understand now that there is a certain jokey-ness within the post, and already suggested that some of that intent may have been lost in translation of medium and audience. Most people here approached it as some form of speculative fiction, I think, above anything else.

What I mean by seriousness is engaging seriously with the ideas in the text. I agree that most people aren't doing that here, and are rather dismissive and /maybe/ derisive. But again, EY is not some budding writer making his first foray into an intellectual space, he is a professional author & researcher; I think that warrants different standards. You may also disagree with me here, but in my personal opinion I don't really see a problem with mocking a piece of writing that seems to imply that eugenics would be part of a rational, optimized society:

  *Yudkowsky:* One of the things I'd expect people from this world to find relatively off-putting is that dath ilan has comprehended that happiness is heritable and they teach a sight that extends over generational times and thinks ahead to the equilibrium; so it's understood that, except in very exceptional circumstances, if you're unhappy on average for any reason, it is your duty to the next generation not to have kids who might inherit this tendency.

  So the number of people who go to the Quiet Cities is more like 5% than 15%, because those who would have otherwise been the parents of people who went there did not have kids. And the rest of the world is mostly happy, because transmitting constitutions that can be happy in a civilized world is itself a solvable coordination problem.

  *Ben Pace:* (Sad react, but glad the people are able to look at sad things and take appropriate action and deal with it, and I respect those ~10% of people who do this a great deal.)

If this is part of the joke I don't find it particularly funny. It makes me wonder whether EY thinks that I shouldn't be allowed to have children due to my personal struggle with happiness and mental illness. It's distasteful, and I personally have no interest in responding seriously to a text that posits that eugenics is a sad but "appropriate action" to take. It deserves to be mocked, called drivel, and generally laughed at. That is my opinion.

In fact I find it rather disturbing that the people on Facebook did find something worth to discuss here, but I guess that is just a me-thing. There is a weird contradiction here, with the Facebook discussion being quite serious, yet on Reddit people are overreacting to an April Fools joke. So is the text a joke or does it merit serious discussion? It feels like intellectual plausible deniability, an excuse for ignoring valid criticism.

I didn't read the whole thing, but I believe my criticisms are pretty specific to the portion I read. If someone calls something trash, but admits they only read a fifth of it, that is a way of indicating that the portion they read was trash. A criticism for one QnA doesn't become invalidated because you didn't read the entire QnA.

Sorry to bombard with the long comment. Just wanted to share my perspective and why I personally don't find anything disturbing about EY getting some snarky comments. You seem chill, hopefully this doesn't come across as passive aggressive, tone is hard to read sometimes. Cheers,
