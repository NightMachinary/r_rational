What is described sounds less like abortion and more like /de facto/ sterilization of a subset of population. And since this is grounded on (what I believe to be) mistaken beliefs about how depression works, I do find it hard to justify ethically.

But even if they are right, and they actually live in a universe where depression is mostly caused by hereditary biological factors, I still think they are making a mistake here. Because removing our ability to feel extreme cold is not the same as being warmer. Pain, unhappiness, are signals that something is wrong, and they are selecting the individuals that are least able to feel these.

It seems easy to /pre mortem/ this idea, especially when you are used to thinking about self-modifying intelligence.

Edit: I realized that things are less clear cut if you are a hedonistic utilitarian.
