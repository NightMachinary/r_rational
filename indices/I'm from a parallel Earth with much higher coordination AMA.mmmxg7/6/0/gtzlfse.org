I'd disagree; none of the stuff about physical infrastructure (moving houses, roads in tunnels) ever made any sense whatsoever. I guess living in SF distorts your sense on urban design, but actual solutions look more like (politically difficult) regulatory fixes rather than fancy infeasible tech (which would fwiw be politically even harder).
