Is anyone who /hasn't/ watched Log Horizon willing to read over the first two chapters of my LH fanfic to tell me how intelligible it is? I'd like to appeal to the general [[/r/rational]] audience alongside LH fans, but at the same time, I'm writing a continuation fic, and those tend to require more knowledge of the source material.

If all it requires are some extra descriptions (because I tend to be rather sparse on those anyways) I'll try to tailor it to the general audience, but I don't want to have to insert any more exposition than I'll already have to as [[#s][semi-spoilers for LH]]

Reply to this post saying so or PM me for details.

(And to clarify, I'm doing my best to make it [RT], although not [RST].)

edit: and because people who haven't seen log horizon probably don't know what it is, it's one of those "gamers trapped in the game world" stories, but with a focus on worldbuilding (because it's an actual world now) instead of getting out. And it's not just a few players, it's literally tens of thousands spread out over the entire planet.
