If you lose your wallet (for whatever reason) and carry cash, you lose that cash. If you just carry plastic, you don't take any sort of financial loss (at least if you report to your bank/credit agencies quickly.)

Personally speaking, I carry cash because it's actually more convenient than debit for the sorts of small purchases I make, but it's not like there isn't a comparative risk.
