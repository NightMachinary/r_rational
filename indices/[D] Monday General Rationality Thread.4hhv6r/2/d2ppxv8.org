Do you carry cash? I'm asking beacuse I was recently working on a Starbucks when their card reader went down, and I'd estimate that 2/3 of people /couldn't pay/ after going through the drivethrough (the store gave them their drinks for free when that happened.)

I'm curious because I see peactically no downsides to carrying cash, and variable but at least significant upsides, but a lot of people don't carry cash anyways, and I don't know why.
