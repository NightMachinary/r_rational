My primary use for cash is when I am out with friends and we don't want to split the check somewhere (like a drivethrough), or tipping at a restaurant. I don't use it as my first choice of payment method because a lack of logging makes it harder for me to tell what I used it for when I review my finances.

I don't usually go out of my way to acquire it though, it's usually just when I'm paying for groceries and the card machine asks if I want cashback, I'll check how much I have in my wallet and usually grab a 20.
