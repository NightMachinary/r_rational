The downside to having cash in your wallet isn't carrying it, but getting it. Basically, everywhere that I shop accepts credit cards. When I bank, I do so via the internet or mail-- set up my deposits, pay my bills, write checks for credit card bills, etc. I literally do not enter my bank or use an ATM on most months.

Looking at my budgeting spreadsheet, an example of transactions I had in the last month included:

- Groceries, paid with credit card
- Gasoline, paid with credit card
- Some dining-out expenses, paid with credit card
- Some entertainment and subscription expenses, paid with credit card
- Some checks deposited or written, for rent or transferring money with friends, all deposited using electronic internet deposit
- Paycheck, deposited directly
- Paying down credit card for the month
- Some money transferred between friends using the Venmo banking service
- A check written to my landlord for rent
- Other expenses and purchases, such as some stuff at the drugstore, a new video game, all done with cards or checks

Basically, unless I specifically seek it out, I don't actually end up using cash for anything. I haven't used an ATM in several months. I do carry about a hundred dollars on me, but if I instead only had twenty dollars on my person, or no dollars, it would have no impact on my life. Going out of my way to go to an ATM is the cost, rather than carrying the cash in my wallet.
