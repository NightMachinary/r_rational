I think you just hit a major point. I have been interested in the overlap between "Magic" and cognitive therapies to reduce cognitive dissonance and cognitive therapies to reduce cognitive dis intense. One of the techniques they mention a lot in a term they call shadow work is visualizing the difference subsumed parts of your personality as their own separate agents and by giving them a name and a form they don't affect you on a sub conscience level anymore you would address them and become more capable of addressing them in the moment. I think that Tapas are another manifestation of this and as you pointed out the brain is capable of having multiple running operating systems of personality in its Hardware at the same time.
