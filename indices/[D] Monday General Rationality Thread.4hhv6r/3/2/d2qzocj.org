Something similar to this, is that I've found that your brain can simulate /at least two entities capable of passing the turing test/. The reason I know this is from lucid dreaming, while in most dreams I find the npc's are pretty low quality you just don't notice because you're not lucid. In lucid dreams however, npc's can actually be convincing enough that even with full lucidity they are seem convincingly like real people even when you know they aren't. Obviously the processing for the npc's is all subconscious, but as far as I'm aware for a sane person it's the closest thing you can have to having 2 entities in your head at once.

This scenario always struck me as odd, because there must be quite a lot of processing going on internally, to simulate both your mind, but also the output from the other entity, which appears indistinguishable from if it had come from a real person.
