Yeah it would, I've always hoped shared dreaming tech became a thing. Mainly because I would actually be way better than most people at controlling things.

As for input, well at the very least we know that stuff outside your dream can influence the content of your dreams and that in REM you can send information out by moving your eyes in code if you're totally lucid. The eye movement thing is actually one of the experiments they did to confirm lucid dreaming.
