I was part of that community a while back (tulpa.info and the chat). Woo and pseudoscience (especially bad psychology) abounded; there was a subsection of the forum that was pretty /x/-oriented who did magic with psiballs and telepathy.

It was mostly roleplaying from what I could tell, along with some very interesting meditation techniques. There was one guy who claimed to have the entire cast of K-On! in his head. Typical mind, though. It might be possible to do in some form given certain conditions, but everything in that community is pretty unfounded.

I think it could be quite similar to the Hollywood version of mind palaces. I'm sure it's possible that some people have conceived and memorized entire coherent visual spaces in their head and can recall it eidetically, but I am certainly not capable of it, despite my burning desire to have a mindscape.
