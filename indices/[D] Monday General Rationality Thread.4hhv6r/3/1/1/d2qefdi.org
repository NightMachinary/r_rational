I disagree. For one thing, it's a really easy and common thing to become someone who has only a very basic relationship with your normal mental state. From personal experience, when I've dreamed, I've noticed that as often as my dream self is basically my normal waking self, it's also normal for it to be some random character that fits in the dream.

In what sense is something like that still me, that has completely different memories and goals from my waking self, and in what sense is it it's own being? I would argue that both interpretations are right, to a degree, since when you're inside the dream, you usually won't be able to bring you own thought processes into the equation, but you can still see how it's templated on you.

So while there may be a lot of woo and nonsense, there can be a mechanism for a truly novel personality to take root in your head. Sure, there's the woo and nonsense to object to, but you have to remember that inside the human mind is literally the one place in the universe that that kind of thing actually works.
