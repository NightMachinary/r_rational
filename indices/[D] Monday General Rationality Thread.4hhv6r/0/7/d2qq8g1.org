Closely, but only occasionally. I use mint to keep track of all expenditures, and a spreadsheet to keep track of my investments. I only really go through it in detail once every couple of months though, with the exception of any 'high spending' alerts that mint might bring to my attention. I find that this is more than frequently enough to keep a good understanding of my savings rate and projected finances, while also not requiring much of my time. If I find that over the last few months I've spent more than I'd projected, I'll figure out how that happened and course correct.

At this point, I'm more often surprised by the growth of my assets than by unexpected spending.
