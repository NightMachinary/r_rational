  How much do you track your finances?
#+end_quote

Not very. Mostly out of laziness and lack of immediate need, I guess. I tried using [[https://www.youneedabudget.com/][YNAB]] for a little while but didn't get much from it. I don't make a lot right now, though, so the consequences of any inefficiency now are likely to be small (grad student stipend is $20k-40k per year, depending on what I do or what sort of funding I'm on, and my wife makes a similar amount).

Mostly money's deposited into my/our bank account(s) automatically and we use a variety of credit cards to buy groceries or toys, pay rent and utilities, travel, etc. (well, rent requires a check, but we use credit cards to make almost all other purchases). Card balances are then automatically paid in full every month. Every few months I'll check how much is in the bank and make sure there haven't been any weird purchases. Depending on the time of year, we'll give some to various charities (a few k, though I do it over fewer transactions to avoid having more fixed fees) and toss some $ in investments (e.g. max out Roth IRAs for the year and put whatever's left into a taxable account, leaving enough in the bank to serve as a ~3 month emergency fund).

Every few weeks I'll check up on investments (a fairly aggressive lazy portfolio made up of index funds) and credit scores, since it's fun and a little addicting to see how the numbers change through time.

I don't really give much thought to finances and tend to buy random stuff as desires strike. But I don't want for much, so it's worked out well so far.
