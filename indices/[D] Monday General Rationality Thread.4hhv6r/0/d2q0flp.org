How much do you track your finances? I keep a spreadsheet that tracks my monthly outlays and expenditures and categorizes them by type. Every month, I examine my credit card and bank statements (and reference receipts if need be) and enter in all my outlays and income.

Each page in my spreadsheet is a month, and at the front of the spreadsheet is a page with [[http://i.imgur.com/X5ebWet.png][graphs]] and a page with tables. This lets me identify trends in my spending and saving. Basically every dollar that I gain or lose is tracked in some way, though small cash transactions between friends are not.

Since I started doing this a couple years ago, I've become more careful and conscientious about my spending. If I spent too much one month, I am aware of it, and I also know how and where I spent too much money. It has helped me build savings.

Do you do something similar? If so, how?
