I found getting a firm handle on my finances to have been hugely beneficial. Less stress over money, always knowing my exact situation, long-term retrospectives and planning.

Learning basic accounting (double-entry bookkeeping) was a bit of a hassle, but I can't imagine going back to the fuzzy, ad-hoc, reinventing-the-wheel-poorly "accounting" I was relying on before.

If you are programming-inclined, I definitely recommend ledger-cli. There are plenty of alternatives if you aren't or just don't like it for whatever reason.
