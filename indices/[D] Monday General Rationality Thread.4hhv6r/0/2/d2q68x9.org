I do spreadsheets too. I really just need to better account for the occasional bout of bipolar-inspired "let's buy something i don't really need" and my actual expenses will finally look like my planned expenses ten months out of 12. As it is, I just make sure that things on the balance work out.

(It hasn't helped that I was robbed recently, which kind of threw things out of whack right after I came up with the New And Improved Financial System that I think will finally make Actual Expenses look like Planned Expenses ten months out of twelve)

I really wish that Amazon had a function that prevented you from buying something instantly and made you wait. This is obviously not going to help /them/, though, so I won't hold my breath.
