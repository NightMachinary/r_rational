Yeah, the two downsides I can see are:

- whenever you lose your wallet, you lose the money in it, and

- money that is sitting as cash in your wallet can't be used for anything else.

The first is a small downside because (frequency of losing wallet * amount of cash * how bad losing money is * risk aversion) is quite small in most cases. The second is usually small because it's a small amount of money.
