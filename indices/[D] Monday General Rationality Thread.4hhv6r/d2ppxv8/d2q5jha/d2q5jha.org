I tend to carry around $50 in my wallet at all times (which I don't think I've ever lost, at least not permanently -- it's occasionally been misplaced for a few days, but has always turned up soon enough). I go to plenty of places that don't accept cards and cash has been useful to have on those occasions (e.g. a lot of local parks have ~$5 entrance fees and don't have card readers, especially when you pay fees by putting money in an envelope, depositing it in a metal cylinder, and putting the corresponding ticket on your dashboard).

I also make use of the brilliant strategy of squirreling away $10-$20 in various bags, compartments in the car, electronics cases (e.g. in my cell phone), etc. in case I lack small amounts of money when it's needed, forgetting it's there, and rediscovering it years later.
