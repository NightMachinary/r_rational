[[/u/Jurily]] That's really interesting, thank you for letting us know. Out of curiosity, how long have you been practicing as a medical professional? Have you published anything on these theories? I'd be interested to read some of your work -- do I need to subscribe to whatever journal you published in, or is there a free version?
