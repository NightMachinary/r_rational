In my continuing adventures in depression, today I have started on Sertraline which is an antidepressant. It's making me feel weird as shit, which so far is an interesting if frustrating experience. My ability to put my thoughts into words coherently on the first try is at 50-70% of normal. Apparently I'm in for 3-6 days of various types of crapulence before I can expect to see benefits, and should discontinue use if I develop toxic epidermal necrolysis (don't google image search that lightly). Huzzah!
