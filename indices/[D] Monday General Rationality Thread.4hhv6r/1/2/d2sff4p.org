SJS/TEN is super rare, you should be okay. The fact that they warned you about it is a good sign. Sertraline is one of the firstline meds and is effective for many people though I personally couldn't handle the side effects and switched to an SNRI. Your mileage may vary. Best of luck, this stuff is difficult and i hope it goes well for you.
