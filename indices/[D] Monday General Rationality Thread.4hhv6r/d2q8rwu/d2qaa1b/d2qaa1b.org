I believe that people have experiences that they feel and describe in a way that comes out as Tulpas. I have friends and family who are highly religious, and they also describe rarely hearing a voice in their head that is not their own. They believe this is the voice of god. They pray in an imaginative way and imagine God speaking back to them. Sometimes, this comes true.

I don't have, nor have I had, this kind of experience before. It seems like there is something that's possible in the human mind that's like this. If you are in the right frame if mind, you can believe you hear someone speaking back to you. It would not surprise me if what my religious acquaintances view as the voice of God is the same phenomenon that Tulpa users experience.
