I just discovered something called [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Tulpas/wiki/faq][Tulpas]], what do you guys think of this whole thing?

If you peel away all the woo and nonsense, there seems to be a kernel of truth that you can set up mental models with enough fidelity that they don't feel like "you". From what I understand, this happens to writers some times. Apparently authors spend so much time fleshing out characters that they can metaphorically ask the character questions and get surprising results.

The reason I'm interested personally is because I've read about [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/20r/city_of_lights/][the benefits of treating your separate and sometimes conflicting desires as their own agents]], but I've never really been able to take advantage of the technique. It feels strange to me when I try, like I'm trying to fool myself. It seems like something that has a lot of potential though. If you're getting surprising answers, it's allowing you to think it ways you wouldn't normally and that seems pretty exciting.

Does anyone have advice or personal experiences to share?
