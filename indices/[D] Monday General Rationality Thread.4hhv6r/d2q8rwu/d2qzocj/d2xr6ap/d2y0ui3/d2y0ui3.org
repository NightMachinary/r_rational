Yes, but they are still doing the processing to figure out what responses work separate from your conscious mind.

Since they can calculate what responses sound good to you it doesn't seem like they would be incapable of doing the same processing against someone else. The responses don't need to be perfect, just good enough to pass as human. So I'm not sure it would actually be that much harder to convince someone else of it's fidelity.
