If I understand what Tulpas is, there's a story on Sufficient Velocity where the main character does basically what you're talking about, and I'm pretty sure the author does it themselves.

Basically the author does a self-insert fiction story where they die and are cryonicall frozen, and wake up in a post-singularity world, where they may be the only rational/sane people left any more.
