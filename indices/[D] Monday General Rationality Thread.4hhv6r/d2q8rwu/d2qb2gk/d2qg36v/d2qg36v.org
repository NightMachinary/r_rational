  but it does not require some kind of separate independent entity living inside your head.

Oh absolutely, I strongly agree that the claim of "separate conscious entity" is a mistake. I posted here because I could be wrong, but I think it's an interesting kind of mistake that might point to something useful.

The part that does seem true about the whole thing is that the mind is capable of promoting a passive mental model to an active one. I think the real trick is making the practice of asking "what would X do?" so habitual that you do it automatically, perhaps even subconsciously once you get to the point where you expect to get an answer. It tidily explains everything that people write about their experiences with "tulpa".

The reason I find this all interesting is because I wonder what could be done with this information and some smart choices. I could see it being used to force some good habits on yourself, especially if it can help you remember to use rationalist techniques that you know. Or maybe you can use it to develop qualities that you want like curiousity and gratitude.
