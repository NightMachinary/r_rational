The problem with tulpas is that if you strip away the woo and nonsense, you're just left with basic human empathy and storytelling, which isn't all that exciting or novel. I think the "surprising answers" thing is just an extension of empathy and a modeling of another entity's thoughts, but it /does not/ require some kind of separate independent entity living inside your head. This is already a well-worn trope: "Think, think ... what would X do? /Gasp!/"

That's not to say that I think it would be useless for therapy, since what you're doing is attempting to isolate and examine thought processes. But the tulpa thing, while interesting, seems to be almost entirely constructed of woo.

I'd be happy to see someone attempt to steelman it though.
