One strategy if you're having self-control problems with internet purchases is to create a ritual for yourself. For example, if you are sure you want to buy something on Amazon, you write down the item on a piece of paper you keep on your fridge. Also, write out the URL, by hand. Then, at the end of the week, you buy any items on that piece of paper that seem like a good idea still.

Adding a couple trivial barriers might be enough to help.
