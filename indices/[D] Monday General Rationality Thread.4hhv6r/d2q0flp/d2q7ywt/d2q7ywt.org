I've been meaning to start doing this but really i want to figure out a way to import my monthly bank statement into Excel... I've seen programs like YNAB or Mint that are able to do this, and while I'm not comfortable using those (Mint has been hacked multiple times for example, and doesn't work well sometimes because banks loathe it's querying whereas YNAB is otherwise basic but is switching to a subscription-based model), I want to see if I can get that functionality.

For now I've just been tracking savings, Roth IRA, etc., and have goals based on those.
