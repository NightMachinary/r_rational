And things just keep accelerating in pace. Jesus. Within a matter of weeks, this war is probably going to be over one way or the other. Competent Yeerks are scary as /fuck./

One thing I'd recommend is finding a way to make the Interlude work as it's own chapter. Perhaps using arcs like Worm, or make the interlude Chapter 9. The interlude packed a lot of meaning into a small space, and people are very likely to just skip over it when archive reading if it's not it's own chapter. And it needs to be read at least twice to understand it.

You've read Worm; imagine how the short chapter would have gone if it had been part of a larger chapter. Nowhere near as impactful if you weren't reading the story when the original short chapter was posted.

I wonder how far Erek's programming goes. Presumably, the Animorphs wouldn't be able to share any attack plans with Erek if it involved the plan of violence. But is infestation violence? Would the Chee be able to use a small amount of violence to prevent a large amount of violence? (Forcibly disarming someone to stop them killing?)

And Rachel clearly knows some disturbing stuff now. The hospital being a major infestation push is the third worst. The school might be the second worst, but I'm sure the worst is yet to come...

This is going to be interesting. And...now I have to wait two weeks for the next chapter! Argh!
