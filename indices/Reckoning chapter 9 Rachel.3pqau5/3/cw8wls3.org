Great work so far!

I'm still clinging to my initial problem with a rational!Animorphs story - I don't see how competent Yeerks can possibly lose. The story should be over in 2 weeks with a total Yeerk domination of Earth, if they just do the minimum obvious thing - go to Washington D. C., take control of all of it, do likewise for other important capitals, within 2 weeks they should effectively rule the world's governments.

I'm not sure if it was explained in the story yet why they chose this city vs. the above plan.
