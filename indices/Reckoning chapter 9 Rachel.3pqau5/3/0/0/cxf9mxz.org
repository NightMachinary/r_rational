I always thought this was the other way around. There are way too many different ways the invasion can fail for the Animorphs to loose if they play their cards smart : incompetent/corrupt leadership, heavy dependence on expensive centralized architecture, overwhelming low numbers, brewing civil war, fighting people who have a cube who can give them permanent superpowers by touching it (without expending any resources), etc... the factors favor the Earth massively.

There's nothing preventing the Animorphs from going semi-public and telling the military about the invasion, without triggering an immediate orbital bombarding as a reprisal. Once the military is onboard (shouldn't be too hard, morphing powers give the protagonists all the credibility they need), they can discreetly send troops to the Pool, maybe smuggle a nuke in for extra insurance, then go public and threaten to blow the Pool up to even the odds during negociations. If the numbers are anything close to canon, the Yeerks can't afford to loose it. If they decide to go for open war anyway, the american military still has an overwhelming numerical advantage over the Yeerks, so even if they take heavy casualties, they'll win eventually, even without factoring international help.

That's basically what happens in canon, actually. In the alternate timeline where Ax immediately goes public, the Yeerks are eventually defeated by the human militaries, with heavy casualties. And in the main timeline, things quickly go downhill for the Yeerks once their invasion is reavealed (the military root its moles out, the main Yeerk pool is blown up).
