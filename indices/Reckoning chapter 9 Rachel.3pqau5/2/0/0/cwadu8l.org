Optimized Wizards/AI > Optimized Fighters, though. Even being hobbled to being unable to cast any damage-dealing spell doesn't outweigh vast technological superiority. Someone needs to explain to Erek that institutional poverty directly harms a vast majority of humanity and then maybe we end up with instantaneous post-scarcity society? (Probably not, but it's worth a shot.)

Also, their original weakness of shared memory (and thus ability to insert new records into the insecure system) doesn't seem like a "stupid" or easily avoidable weakness and thus would be likely to continue to exist.

On top of all of that, the Howlers never actually came to Earth, so short of direct interference, we might get to just ignore them for the time being. (Yeerks + Howlers, on the other hand... that would likely be bad, so hopefully that doesn't happen.)
