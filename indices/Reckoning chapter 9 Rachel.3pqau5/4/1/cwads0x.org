A few years ago I found a collection of all the books in ebook form and read through them all. They hold up surprisingly well even when read as an adult, and have some pretty mature and interesting storylines (David, Visser One, the Auxiliary Animorphs...). Reckoning does a good job of compressing a lot of the action, but I would still recommend the original books.
