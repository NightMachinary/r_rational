About 3 years ago, I was a big fan of the SCP wiki (I still am, but my fandom is much more tempered now).

And during that time, I created a character with the help of a professional artist.

We brainstormed the character and the universe, and decided on a setting similar to "The Real" from [[https://artists-at-the-ready.deviantart.com/][artists at the ready]]- a setting containing a 'fictional' universe, where there are 'judges' who portal-fantasy the artists into "the Real", who then, using some object on their person, summon their 1-3 OCs. Holy shit you /have/ to read the [[https://sircyodnad.deviantart.com/art/Intro-Page-Zero-365363027][winner of tournament #3's story]]... Here's my [[https://sircyodnad.deviantart.com/art/Round-5-Part-5-459234584?q=sort%3Atime%20gallery%3Asircyodnad&qo=1][most convincing reason why.]]

The idea for my story was that all fiction exists in their own multiverse. Established fictions have more solid barriers, pillars. Some times, fanfiction and bad tropes start to get mingled with the multiverse. When this happens, [[https://le-mec.deviantart.com/art/MagnusVonKilroy-462560125][Magnus von Kilroy]] and his crack team of (also fictional) troopers go in and try to fix the problem, by going to the source and fixing it. He's armed with:

Chekov's Gun, Occam's Razor, and Reality Anchors (which remove all non-real influences like magic, curses, etc for an area. A dragon would biologically function, but if it's not correct, within that anchor's range, they would land on the ground and not be able to move/fly because of bad anatomy....)

Never went anywhere with this fic, but if you like it, I hope you come up with something interesting in its vein.
