Anyone up for brainstorming spells? I'm working on a system whose spells (1) are usually minor and even niche in utility and (2) require rituals to perform (meaning that there's set-up involved in casting magic and you have to plan ahead). I've got ninety or so spells so far, some pretty good and some pretty bleh, and I'm hoping that the subreddit might get me thinking in directions I haven't considered yet.

Examples of what I've got so far:

- Drop individual thoughts in someone's head (nothing more complex than a couple of words, so this is best for emotions or very simple concepts), once every few seconds for as long as the ritual is performed.
- Notice if someone is doing that (or something similar) to you, or has done so recently.
- Call animals (mouse-sized or larger) to your location, with extra work to fine-tune it what you're calling (usually down to a particular species, but one magician uses it as a lost pet finder). The animals aren't controlled by the spell, just called, so beware of calling e.g. bears. The ritual must be performed for as long as it takes the animal to arrive, and the animal will not forgo food or sleep, or enter into danger, to answer the call (so expect delays if it isn't reasonably close already).
- Temporarily revive a dead person in order to ask some questions (but be quick about setting up, because you're talking to a decaying brain, not an immortal spirit).
- Transmute blood into a multicolored substance that doesn't really have any practical purpose, but makes for a hella neat oil paint.
- Immediately learn where your keys are.
