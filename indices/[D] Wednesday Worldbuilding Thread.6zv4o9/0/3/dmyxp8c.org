- Temper a piece of steel. Takes a few hours but if you know what you are doing for it can make the most of a piece of metal or much easier to ruin the temper on an item. While I like crafting/industrial magics that aid or replace a crafts person their use in a game can be limited. Dry wood, harden clay, fix cracks, connect/cut two pieces of similar fabric, and so on can be game relevant examples.

- Control Fire. Can control a fire to make it burn hotter or colder using more or less fuel respectively. The fire can also be directed like it was in a moderate wind. The effect lasts until the fire burns out or the ritual is stopped. But by adding small amount of specially prepared powder can cause colour changes, images to appear in the fire, to burn with no smoke, to be extinguished, or other magical effects. Each effect takes its own unique powder. The larger the fire the longer the preparation required.

- Preserve food. A set of symbols drawn on an object to preserve the organic materials within, the final rune seals the object and will be broken when it is opened. Most commonly used along side other methods of preservation as it extends the shelf life by half. Some magical ingredients cannot be used with it as it changes their nature while other alchemical recipes require such treated reagents. While it is the same ritual to preserve a body for funereal rites most people are not aware or do not talk about the overlap.

- Drive out vermin. Spread the smoke from incense over an area by walking through it. Once all the incense has burned small animals and insects will be driving from the affected area and will typically flee some distance if able but are only prevented from returning until the incense has dispersed. It can be used anywhere but wind will quickly disperse the smoke rendering it ineffective or requiring large quantities of incense to be quickly burned.

- Find north. An object will align itself with north as it floats. It must be able to freely move such a leaf floating on calm water or a feather falling in still air. There is a companion ritual that lets you set a large object as a companion by inscribing runes on it so you can choose to have it point there instead. The ritualist either needs a specially prepared "needle" or a copy of the central runes from the companion.

- Cure a specific disease. Each disease requires a different ritual. An example might be to draw water from a blessed well each day at noon to wash yourself and then throw the water into the ocean at midnight. If any water is spilled or uses that bucket other will contact the disease as well. Best to burn the bucket once done.

- Create a ritual area. Designate an area to confine a ritual to. Draw a circle, scatter ashes, sprinkle holy water, cast a spear into the middle of a battle field, travel a path while bleeding between dusk and dawn, or what ever. There is a lot of room to play around with this one and likely a number of variants for different groups and uses. Possible effects 1) other spells effects are stopped from entering 2) rituals conducted within it can expand to cover the whole area 3) Rituals cannot affect or leave the boundary 4) only those permitted can freely use magic. I took inspiration from Shawdowrun's wards and D&D's Guards and Ward spell.

I had an image of a wizard running down a path in the woods trying to cover all of the ways to his home dripping blood before he is caught. Then being able use other rituals to hid that path from others, scry his enemies along it, call up the plants or animals to attack travelers on the path, and otherwise use it to defend himself.

- Lose an object - If a person has an object on them they will lose it. Forget to pick it back up, put their keys in an odd place, or dropping something while fumbling in their pockets. This can be targeted at a particular item you are familiar with, can see, or just to make a person generally forgetful about a few items of opportunity. The target will be forgetful of or maybe not recognize the affected object until shortly after the ritual ends but another person can remind them about it normally.

- Calm an animal

- Protect you from the sun or keep you warm. Spells for general protection from the environment.

- Crate a ping. Set a specific condition or name a person and when it is around you you know it has happened. A specific ritual or effect used against you, that asshole Bob is near by, the fire had gone out. You don't know any specifics, just that it has happened within the limitations of the ritual.

- Break a spell. Stops a spell from current effecting you and gives some protection from that spell affecting you again in the near future.

- Spell resistance. Makes a talisman that provides some protection to you from spells and breaks when it fails to protect you. The stronger and more magically resistant the materials used to make the talisman are the better it works. The maker can choose to shatter at any point and time that they wish to. Or maybe it protects you from everyone but the maker.

Do you use sympathy and contagion in you system?

- A ritual to see if an antidote will cure a poison, it does not tell you what the antidote is only if the ones you have on hand will work. Takes a minute or two to start but once going can check different cures quickly.

- Was a particular weapon used to make a particular wound? The connection between wound and weapon lasts a couple of weeks for an inanimate weapon and a dead body but less for living tissues, if cleaned or disturbed, and can be broken by ritual cleansing.

- Keep a person alive. Connects a person to a living organism such as a tree or their bodyguard so they share life. You will last longer and be tougher but are still most definitely mortal. This can be one sided in a recipient/donor setup so the recipient does not suffer over much from the donors injury or shared equally between them.

- Write a victims name and a curse on one side of a tablet and you name and grievance on the other side and place it in the drink. This can be as general as a well or as specific as a wine jug. As long as the victim has drunk from it, the tablet remains in place, and the spirits that govern these things find you grievance true the victim will be cursed.

- Rituals to cleanse yourself or break you connection to a specific item so things do not trace back to you.
