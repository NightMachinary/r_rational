If many people know about the ritual and it is simple, it is in practice almost useless, since you don't know who sent you back the color, and jumping back might only undo a few seconds.

A big council of mages can probably put enough weight behind their intended use of the spells to gain enough divinatory information to pump enough money out of the stock market to keep running.

If the world starts out casting more of the first spell than of the second, but eventually starts casting more of the second than the first, that will keep time trapped around the point where they are cast equally much, until the world is outcome pumped into casting the first spell more, but from the perspective of the "last" timeline this is just another Fermi paradox, perhaps with some bits in the past that are about as important as Prophecies.

The setting might be /warped/ to look different than it otherwise would, but the average citizen or protagonist might not think about it much, much like IRL most people don't care about AGI, even though our setting is about it.
