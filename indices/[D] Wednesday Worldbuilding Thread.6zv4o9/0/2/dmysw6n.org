- Place in your mind the optimal route to a destination within a short distance (optimal as conditions are RIGHT NOW), probably on foot or horse
- Place a magical "cryptographic" signature on a piece of paper or flat surface, identifying the person who cast it (or whatever alias they use)
- Send trash to the local trash dump, probably requiring a source of heat as input
- Determine when blood was last spilled in a given location
- Create a signal that will be placed into your mind (or someone else's) at a specified time/date. Like a reminder notification, or delayed information transmission.
