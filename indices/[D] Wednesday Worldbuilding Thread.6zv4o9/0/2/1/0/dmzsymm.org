If you wanted to make it less powerful, you could make it only work on yourself.

However, I think there's a distinction between "very useful" and "very powerful". Doing this to someone else is basically no different than setting up an email that will be sent to someone at a particular time-- the contents of that email might be extremely important, but it's not a difficult or complicated thing to accomplish.
