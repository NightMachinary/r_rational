Yeah, it's really useful. It's notes you can't lose, or forget, or leave behind somewhere and someone else find.

But you know, I do basically that on my phone every day, and it hasn't made me superpowerful or anything. Nor does it take a lot of effort. I really think there is a difference between "really good" and "really hard to do", and this falls into the first category but not the second. The OP put "speak with a recently dead person by accessing the memories in their decaying brain" as "relatively minor", and there's no way a system of magic requires more work for a delayed message than to animate a entire brain's worth of neurons.
