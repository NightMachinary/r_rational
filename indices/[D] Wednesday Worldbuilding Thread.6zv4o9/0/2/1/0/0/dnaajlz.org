Ok Brain-google, remind me to head back and retrieve the magic sword of destiny which is the only weapon that can stop the evil dragon and save the land. Because I have attention problems and without a reminder I might forget to retrieve the magic sword until it is too late and the kingdom will be DOOMED. I would let someone else handle the quest to defeat the dragon and save the land in my place, but I am the only one capable of wielding the magic sword of destiny because it is magically tied to my bloodline and I am the last surviving member of my line so no one else is qualified. What do you mean, reverse engineer the sword and make copies? The magical sword of destiny kills anyone who touches it who isnt part of my bloodline. Yes it does, it's a defense against greedy thieves who might try to steal the sword. I know it's barbaric, this sword was forged a very long time ago and their ethical standards back then we're different. I would reverse engineer the sword myself, but I don't know how the sword will react to that and we don't have enough time! The dragon's undead hordes will be attacking the kingdom of light in only a week, and if they fall there will be no kingdom left that can stand against the dragon and his forces! Not to mention the crown princess will be either dead or married to the dragon by then.

How do I remember all this? I take mental notes! And the reason I don't forget them is because they're magically preserved mental notes!

Tldr: you underestimate the power of automatic reminder setting in a slightly more realistic medieval fantasy world. You think if LoZ were real that Link would remember every single McGuffin he needs to collect without writing it down on that inventory page he's always carrying around? Or without Navi to remind him?
