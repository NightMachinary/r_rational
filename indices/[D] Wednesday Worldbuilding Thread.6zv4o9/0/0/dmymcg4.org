- Appear in the dreams of everyone sleeping in a several mile radius. However, their memories of the dream will usually be vague unless they wake up while it's ongoing.

- Turn lead into gold coins stamped with the enchanted runes of a bank. You can use this as currency, but the runes will instantly alert the bank, and you'll eventually have soldiers trying to arrest you for counterfeiting. Creating gold without the runes is easy, but as a result, isn't used as a currency except in distant lands where the spell is unknown.

- Take a spirit from limbo, and trap it in an animal body. You can't specify which spirit, but most were alive in strange alternate universes, so if the resulting intelligent animal is cooperative, you can often learn about scientific or magical discoveries unknown in your own universe. Most familiars are created with this spell.

- Restore ruined buildings and furniture to the height of their grandeur. Restoring entire large buildings is very time-consuming, so you'll sometimes see wizards living in single opulent towers emerging from the ancient ruins of a palace or temple.

- Continuously perform a ritual that allows you to go about your daily life- eating, sleeping, working, even performing other magic- but which constantly requires some very strange behaviors and complicated taboos. While performing this ritual, you won't age.
