Well, as a reader, it's hard to tell what the system allows or forbids. The fireball 4x4 runes seem like they could easily be turned to firing a spray of flaming gravel, like a napalm shotgun. Or it could be a shaped charge tungsten jet (pure metals seem easier than wood or multi-element rocks).

Would that be more or less expensive than the basic fireball?

Sprays of acid also seem favoured. One line of water, one of earth, one of velocity, say a 3x3 square. Most acids are pretty simple.

Since velocity is an element, what else is? Is, say "rot" an element? What if I draw a 3x3 spiral of rot? Does that give me a death touch spell?

For that matter, is "death" an element? What about destruction, or light? Useful lasers are actually pretty low power, just high organization. Can I draw one line of light, one for velocity (or maybe one for position) and aim a bunch of laser at my enemies eyes?

Can spells be mostly or completely predrawn? It might be difficult or too time consuming to draw a fireball as the dragon is swooping down on me.

If position is an element, multiple casters could get together and draw a big square of earth and position and drop city-killing rocks. That's a lot of power for a small group and there doesn't seem to be any sort of surveillance spells directly available.
