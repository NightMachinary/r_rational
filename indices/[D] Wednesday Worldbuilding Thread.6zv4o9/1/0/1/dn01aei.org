  If position is an element, multiple casters could get together and draw a big square of earth and position and drop city-killing rocks. That's a lot of power for a small group and there doesn't seem to be any sort of surveillance spells directly available.

Since metals are simpler, and size of the created object probably increases cost it would be better to create a rod of tungsten or something similar [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_bombardment][in the space above a target]]. Anyway my point is that if you can use this system for teleportation or creating objects at a specified location away from the caster then it means this setting is going to be dominated by WMD's.
