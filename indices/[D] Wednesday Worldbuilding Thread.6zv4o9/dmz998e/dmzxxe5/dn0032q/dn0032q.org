The caster can make any material they want, but has to be very familiar with the material and how it reacts to basically everything. You can't just say "make me acid" you'd have to know either be very familiar with the acid and have a strong concept of what the acid is, or you could create the ingredients for the acid in the same space (would have the same restrictions on the ingredients). Basically, a student couldn't look at some acid in a vial and create it, but someone who cleans glasses with acid daily would be able to create the cleaning acid.

I should have been more clear element wise, elements are basically things that make up the universe without being composed of other elements. Death, life, rot, etc would not be elements since they don't actually exist, they're just concepts. I'm still waffling on time, it really should exist, but it would be really powerful. If it did exist it would be extremely difficult to use. Position does not exist, all creations materialize very close to the rune in any medium less dense than the created material. Velocity is really kinetic energy.

Also, something I forgot to mention, a line can not be parallel right next to itself, it has to have a different element between it and itself. Can't make a massive square out of just one element.

Spells can be prepped for a while, but each line of a rune that has not been completed drains some energy over time. You couldn't hold 99% of a rune to massively heat something right in front of you constantly, though you could hold it for 5 mins pretty easily.

You are right on with the casting time being an enormous issue. Anything larger than a 5x5 gets pretty difficult to cast. There would be two different styles of casting: large runes with explicit effects for when you have time, and smaller, faster runes for combat.

Also keep in mind that energy still limits a spell no matter how efficient the rune is. You couldn't mimic a volcanic eruption no matter how large of a rune you used, that just takes too much energy.

You can have multiple people for a large rune, but each person has to understand exactly what the part of the spell they drew does. You couldn't just have them mark out lines and complete it yourself to use their energy.
