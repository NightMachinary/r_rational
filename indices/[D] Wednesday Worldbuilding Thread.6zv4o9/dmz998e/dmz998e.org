Thinking of a magic system where spells are cast by drawing runes onto objects. The runes act as a conduit for the magic, the caster provides the energy but the effect is limited (not completely determined) by the rune. The closer the rune matches the effect the more efficient the spell is. The exact nature of the effect is determined by the casters intentions. The rules for runes:

Must be composed of colored lines representing spell elements. The lines can bend at 90 degree angles but can not intersect any other lines, including themselves. Each elemental line can only be used once in a rune.

Must create a perfect, filled square. The square can be any size larger than 1x1, though 2x2 runes are usually inefficient.

The effect of the spell is limited by the type and amount of each element used; this is limited by having spell effects that don't match the rune be inefficient (energy usage to spell effect).

The runes are drawn by finger, and must be drawn on a reasonable flat surface. The elemental lines are just glowing light that fades after the spell is cast.

"Rituals" are possible where multiple casters contribute to a large rune, the spell will take energy from each of them proportional to how much of the rune they drew.

There are many elements, some used more than others. Heat/fire, water, earth, air, velocity, and light and thought are the most commonly used.

A typical fireball spell would be a 4x4 with two 3x1 lines of earth and velocity (create a rock and throw it away from the caster) with fire surround them (10 long line of fire/heat to heat up the rock and set it on fire). A master caster would be able to make the rock out of a flammable solid that they were familiar with. Complex materials like wood are extremely difficult to create, but not impossible.

Thoughts on this magic system? Ways it could be abused?
