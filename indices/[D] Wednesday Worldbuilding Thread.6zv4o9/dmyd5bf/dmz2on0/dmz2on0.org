- Become pseudo-synaesthetic, with senses not being mixed once you experience them, but in the experiencing itself. For example, you might see scent trails in the air rather than simply perceiving smells as colours, or gain 360Â° vision by swapping your senses of sight and touch and "seeing" through your skin.

- Determines the shape a plant will grow into over time. Doesn't make it grow any faster, but saves you the trouble of binding it into a shape, and grants finer control to boot.

- A charm which prevents insects from stinging/biting you for a duration.

- Makes your teeth supernaturally hard and sharp, and strengthens your jaw. Biting people is still an inconvenient way of attacking them though.

- Seals a door/window/other sort of portal in a closed position with force equivalent to a mundane bolt.

- Lets you perceive an illusion overlapping another person which displays what they looked like when they were younger.

- Temporarily makes a material less brittle, preventing glass/ceramics from shattering easily, among other things.

- Render a container airtight.

- Decrease the heat conductivity of a piece of ice.

- Gain a birds-eye view of your immediate surroundings at the same resolution as your regular vision.

- Imbue a piece of paper with a simulacrum of life, allowing it to move about and follow a limited list of simple instructions. The paper is only articulated along folds made in it when the spell was cast.
