- A spell that slows down how fast fluid flows through a pipe. (Don't use it on people's veins. Unless that's why you're using it.)
- Flips every coin in a small area exactly once. (Think tabletop simulator, if you've played that.)
- Instantly drenches someone in sweat. Difficult to aim.
- Identifies every book on a bookshelf with something wedged between the pages, by throwing those books on the floor.
- Causes both the target and the caster to have difficulty distinguishing left and right.
- Makes something fall up temporarily, but the ritual involves dropping something heavy and thus the spell doesn't violate the conservation of energy.
- Causes all of a target's clothes to average their cleanliness. (Great if you spill ketchup on yourself, but you'd best still do your laundry.)
- Transfers the carbonation from a fluid to another fluid. If the second fluid doesn't have a decent capacity for dissolved gases, get ready for a mess.
- Gives you a tan, but not an even tan.
- A spell that is cast on an individual. When cast on a woman, it reveals the time since she last ovulated. When cast on a man, nobody wants to tell you what it reveals but it often says â€˜less than twenty four hours.' On some people (children for example) it does nothing.
- Randomizes your hair color. Can only be cast once per day.
- Teleports small change on the ground into your hand.
- Transmits the force of a punch a short distance.
