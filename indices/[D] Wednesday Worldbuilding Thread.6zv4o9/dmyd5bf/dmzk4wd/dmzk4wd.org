- A basic illusion, clearly distinguishable from reality because only the outlines of the object are visible (like a wireframe). Won't fool anyone, but useful for a mage who needs a visual aid or to draw runes in the air. Fades over the course of several minutes (depending on humidity) or pretty instantly if it comes in contact with water. Theoretically lasts forever in a vacuum (or literal zero humidity).
- A null ritual. It does nothing, but it remains a ritual (albeit a brief one). Always succeeds.
- Another null ritual. Also does nothing. Always fails.
- A ritual that specifies two other rituals and succeeds if and only if exactly one of the two specified rituals succeeds (i.e. it fails if both rituals fail or if both succeed).
- A conditional ritual. You would need to first perform the conditional ritual, specifying the conditions; then the (a) ritual; then the (b) ritual. If the conditions are true, the (a) ritual activates; if the conditions are not true, the (b) ritual activates. (One of the null rituals may be used as either (a) or (b) if desired). Conditions are limited to what could be discovered by scrying (i.e. can't depend on anything magically shielded or that has not yet happened). It also can't read thoughts very well.
- Scrying. As long as the ritual continues, you can observe an image of the target in a bowl of water. Sound is not included (but you can attempt to read lips). The target image cannot move, relative to the ritual. (Not-so-wealthy merchants entering into sensitive and secret negotiations will often do so in a moving carriage to prevent being scried on. Wealthy merchants will hire anti-scry spells. Wealthy paranoid merchants have anti-scry wards placed on their carriages.)
- Anti-scrying; no scrying spell can target inside the area of the ritual. Scrying spells targetted outside the area can still look in; this is therefore usually extended to an area a little bigger than a sealed room.
- Charge transfer; electrons are magically attracted to or repelled from the target, causing it to develop an electric charge (and the surrounding area to develop the opposite charge). Famously used to defeat the Invincible Black Knight in a severe (nonmagical) thunderstorm.
