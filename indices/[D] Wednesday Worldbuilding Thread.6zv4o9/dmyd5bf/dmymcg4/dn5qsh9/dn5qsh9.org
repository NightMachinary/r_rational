  Take a spirit from limbo, and trap it in an animal body. You can't specify which spirit, but most were alive in strange alternate universes, so if the resulting intelligent animal is cooperative, you can often learn about scientific or magical discoveries unknown in your own universe. Most familiars are created with this spell.

I like this one. I feel like it has potential as a self-insert uplift fic. You travel to a fantasy realm and have the goal of getting them to industrial age or further, but are hindered by being a rat or something.
