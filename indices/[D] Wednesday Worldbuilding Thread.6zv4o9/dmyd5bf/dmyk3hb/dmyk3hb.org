Do you need line of sight for the first one? How do you specify the target? Do you have to/can you even specify a target for the second one?

Spell ideas:

- Save the current state of the universe, or receive Red or Blue.
- Destructively restore the last state anyone saved, sending them your choice of Red or Blue, or know that no saves exist in the past.
