Quite nice, a mashup between assembly teleportation and the existence of an afterlife.

Though I'm a bit iffy on the zombies; didn't add too much (the Buffets are nice), and symptoms of aggression seems a bit contrived.

Although why aren't the Buffetts zombies all zombies? (if they're using N2s five times a week, wouldn't they all have progressed Mover's Sickness?)
