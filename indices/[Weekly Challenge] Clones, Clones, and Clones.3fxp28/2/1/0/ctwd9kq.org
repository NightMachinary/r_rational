Yes! Thank you! That's what I was going for.

On the surface, you just have Square, Sam and Noah explaining New-C's new lot in life, with a little hint of danger at the end.

But if you look deeper, it's the start of a fairly complex narrative, even if you ignore the changes up above.

Pangea. Why do they call it that? It's an iconic, historic name, what does that imply? You have the threat of the Ragged, wild infected that vary in sanity and biology (although, just to be clear, it wouldn't get as crazy as Resident Evil's advanced zombies, but there'd definitely be some superhuman strength depending on the type)

Then you have the clones. It's made clear that there are bunches of rich people down here and they tend to form communities. Who better to get along with than yourself(ves), for those who are able to do it. But that comes with its own problems, depending on how unhinged/selfish/narcissistic the originals are. And it also depends on what kind of day they were having when they stepped through the N2. Also, what does that imply for the middle class and poorer clones?

And lastly, the Naturals. They're brought up exactly once. But they're the people that come down the normal way. By dying. What does that imply about who's actually down here? Are people immortal here? Could you go find Alexander the Great, Hannibal or Jesus down here, if you really wanted? ;)

I tried to cram a lot of things into the background, to really make it clear how deep the implications of the N2 and the soul's existence is in this world.
