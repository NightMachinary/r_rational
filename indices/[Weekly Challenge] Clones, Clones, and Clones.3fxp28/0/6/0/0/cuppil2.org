Hm, I'm not satisfied with this answer. Something as simple as "The Allfather is an impostor" doesn't need anything else to be understood. On top of that, the rogue ended up giving the MC the information in a really roundabout way that is far harder to be interpreted correctly.

You're also talking about "memetic subversion" here as if it's some abstract science fiction stuff when in your story the memetic hazard was something really straightforward and easy to understand. Everyday logic should apply.
