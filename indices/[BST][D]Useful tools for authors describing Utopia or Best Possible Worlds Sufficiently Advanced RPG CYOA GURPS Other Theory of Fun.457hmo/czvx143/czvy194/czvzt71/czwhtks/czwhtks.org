Most of shadowrun is too low tech for singularity stories but the Renraku shutdown shows a malevolent AI being far less imaginative then you might expect from harder Sci-Fi. Eclipse Phase is a TRPG that has some core themes of transhumanism and horror so I would expect some other AI related dystopias in that.
