  As an example, what are some of the values that Iain M. Banks' The Culture would have, using Sufficiently Advanced, or perhaps whatever GURPS uses when describing sci fi settings in a social and moral way (and what DOES Gurps use to do that)?

GURPS's treatment of societal freedom isn't any more nuanced than [[http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/MSRD:Equipment_Basics#Restricted_Objects][the D20 system's]], with a very similar system of "Control Rating" for societies and "Legality Class" for equipment. On the other hand, GURPS does have slightly more complicated technological ratings, which can be applied on a per-sector basis (e.g., TL7 in general, with TL8 medical science and TL6 transportation):\\
- TL0, the Stone Age\\
- TL1, the Bronze Age (3500 BCE)\\
- TL2, the Iron Age (1200 BCE)\\
- TL3, the Middle Ages (600 CE)\\
- TL4, the Age of Sail (1450 CE)\\
- TL5, the Industrial Revolution (1730 CE)\\
- TL6, the Mechanized Age (1880 CE)\\
- TL7, the Nuclear Age (1940 CE)\\
- TL8, the Digital Age (1980 CE)\\
- TL9, the Microtech Age (2025 CE)\\
- TL10, the Robotic Age (2070 CE)\\
- TL11, the Age of Exotic Matter\\
- TL12, the Age of Miracles

I don't own /[[http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/Ultra-Tech/][GURPS Ultra-Tech]]/, which covers TLs 9 through 12--it probably contains more detailed information on what you're looking for. Certainly, [[http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/Ultra-Tech/toc.pdf][its table of contents]] points to a sidebar titled "Superhuman Minds and the Singularity", at the very least.

In reference to morals/values, that wouldn't manifest much more clearly than an AI character's having the negative trait "Social Stigma (Valuable Property)", or something along those lines, IIRC.
