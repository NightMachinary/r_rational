This is the entirety of the sidebar btw: "Volitional AIs with intelligence equivalent to a human genius are possible at TL10+. If created, they build better hardware or software for themselves, resulting in the evolution of AIs whose intellects make humans look like dumb animals or insects. These beings might be able to advance science and engineering to a point human minds can no longer comprehend -- a technological “singularity.” In such a society, super-intelligent “AI gods” may rule civilization -- or they may remain aloof from lesser intelligences. Their works may be used to justify the existence of superscience technologies (e.g., FTL drives or wormhole networks) that people can use, but do not understand. Such entities can serve as a posthuman alternative to the ancient, wise, and long-vanished “precursor” races that appear in many space opera settings. Of course, this scenario is by no means predestined! It's just as likely that superhuman AI is difficult or impossible to achieve, or that sapient AIs would be built with strict restrictions to prevent their evolution."
