My general thoughts on utopias: focus on characters. If there are characters with interesting relationships with each other, it doesn't matter if there's no huge conflict. People still need things to do, and utopias still need to experience change, and stories set in utopias often rely on these things, but they seem most utopian when they're about the characters.

Think of themes and story categories that don't need the threat of serious harm to their characters, or major upheavals of the world order - sports, travel, romance, growing into adulthood, exploring the past, moving into a new town, studies of character and occupation, group rivalry, exploring the wild, undertaking a heroic task.

Eschewing events or characters of grand Significance is unpopular in sci fi, but not at all impossible. You could write Player of Games without anybody's life hanging in the balance, or set Catcher in the Rye in a time without death.
