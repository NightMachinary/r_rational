Try the "Noblebright" page on the 1d4chan wiki. And when you have to trade off the two aspects, try to trade off little bits of bright for lots of noble: the top trait of dystopias and false utopias is being extremely grim, in the sense that the characters/people have little to no causal influence over the course of their own lives. Grimbright isn't usually a true dystopia, but it would be both a crappy place to live /and/ is usually very boring to read/watch.
