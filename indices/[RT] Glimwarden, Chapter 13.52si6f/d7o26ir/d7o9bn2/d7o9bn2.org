Yeah, this chapter has Philip doing or seriously considering some really unsavory stuff, including:

- Hiding the destruction of another town from the authorities. Reporting it might have prevented the crisis at Healer's Lantern or at least helped catch the perpetrator.

- Hiding the imminent arrival of refugees from the authorities.

- Attributing a highly valuable contract (feeding the refugees until they're housed) to the friend of his political ally, without having the official authority to make that decision.

- Planning to encourage and take advantage of the upcoming hostility between Light's Hollow and the refugees.

- Generally being a dick to his father by taking other his duties.

There's nothing outright evil in there, but it's really not something you want to see from people with political power.
