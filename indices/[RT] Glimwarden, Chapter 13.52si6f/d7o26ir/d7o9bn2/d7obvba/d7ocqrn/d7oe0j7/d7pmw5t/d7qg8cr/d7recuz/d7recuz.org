You mean the 0-4 times a year? Yeah I am pretty sure they do. It even almost makes sense to. Sorry to start the sarcasm, I really am not an expert on this sort of thing, but having good and frequent checks is irrelivant to the question of if they check more after a plane crash. Which just seems like it would be very bad idea not b to do from a reputation angle, and not obviously a bad idea from a saving lives punt of view.
