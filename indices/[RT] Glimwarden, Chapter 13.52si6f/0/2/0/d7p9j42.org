It might just be you. I wanted to draw them not only as I saw them, but also incorporate something of how in-universe characters see them. Melanie is the curmudgeonly old man in the body of a teenage girl, Sander is the guy who does stupid heroic things, Philip is the cool and calm guy who looks heroic.

I cringed a bit when Philip told his mother he liked his father more and made her cry. It might be obnoxious, but no one in Light's Hollow knows about it, and I wanted to draw Philip in the way they know him, and how he wants them to see him.
