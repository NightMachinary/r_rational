Apologies for the delay. I've been spinning my wheels while writing, which is never a pleasant feeling. I wouldn't quite call it writer's block, as it's more borne of indecision and second guessing than anything else. (I'm still hoping to wrap up the first book by the beginning of November so that I can take a break for NaNo without having to come back to a bunch of open threads.)
