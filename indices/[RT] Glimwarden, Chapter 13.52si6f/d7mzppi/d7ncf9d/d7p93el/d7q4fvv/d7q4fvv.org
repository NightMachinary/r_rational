I think [[https://quadralectics.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/177a.jpg][this]] is close to what I picture, but with thicker gray bricks and a simpler style and a little taller, with a few small windows to let in light for the workers and a bright, reassuring light on top. The outer lanterns have statues on top of them, carved from different types of stone (sometimes via the help of a glimwarden). In my mind they're much like light houses, partly because I love light houses, but in terms of practicality they should probably be more squat with the upper portion being more ornamental and holding only the light and the alarm system.
