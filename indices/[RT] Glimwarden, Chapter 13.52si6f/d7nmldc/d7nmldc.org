It's funny, Melanie was the character I liked the least when the story started, now she's my favourite. Both because she grew on me and because I'm starting to dislike Philip and Sander, for different reasons.

By the way, I take back everything nice I said about Philip. Divide and conquer? Really? You're an asshole.

Otherwise, I'm glad this story is starting to tackle the "Immigrants with nowhere to go need to integrate among people with fundamentally different beliefs" issue. It's a currently relevant, complicated, super important issue and I really look forward to see alexanderwales' take on it.
