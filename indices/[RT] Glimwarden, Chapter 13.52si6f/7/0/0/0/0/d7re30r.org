I just don't care weather he or his foes win because there is no..moral stakes?

I don't so much mean I can't root for him in that rooting for him feels bad or is morally wrong, but rather I just don't have the emotional investment. Instead it feels like watching something mildly gross like someone washing toilets.

I also find it difficult to keep who I want to win in fiction and real life separate the more difficult the more human they are, and while he is a fairly evil human he is very human. I can read stories where I am hoping the protagonist loses as long as the author isn't treating them too stupidly but if I don't care who wins I can't.
