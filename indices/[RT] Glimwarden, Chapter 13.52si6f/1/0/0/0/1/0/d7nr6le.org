I use a program called Scrivener for writing. It's got a compile function that turns the text into an epub, PDF, mobi, etc. During National Novel Writing Month, when I finish my ~1,667 words for the day, I just click "Compile" and target HTML, then transfer the file over to my site. So the CSS and HTML are all auto-generated, with just a few tweaks done via a .bat script between generation and posting. (It's basically the only way that I can manage the pace NaNo requires and still be posting it online every day.)
