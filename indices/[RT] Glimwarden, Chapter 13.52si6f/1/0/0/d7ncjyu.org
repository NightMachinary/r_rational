Not really a series, just logical divisions of the serial. In 5-6 chapters there will be a point where I can definitively say "this is the end of this first section". The current plan is for between 3-5 "books", with the story being maybe half or two thirds of the way through the first book. (Assuming that I can hit my deadlines, there will be break between Book I and Book II during November, since I'll be working on finishing /The Dark Wizard of Donkerk/ then.)
