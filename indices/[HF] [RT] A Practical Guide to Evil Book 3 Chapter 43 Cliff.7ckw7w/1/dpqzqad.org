You'd think I'd be getting tired of the "Haha, these heroes have no chance, we will win soon!" quotes by Dread Emperor Something Something, the He-Died-Immediately-After-He-Said-That, but I'm not. All these quotes are so fun.

Also, I'm not sure what the nature of the ambush they set at the end? They're going to burn the 15th somehow?
