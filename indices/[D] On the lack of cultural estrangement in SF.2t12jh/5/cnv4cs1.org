[[http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YDL2CY?btkr=1][The Mote in God's Eye]] by Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle have the same problem as mentioned in the article. But! It has a very alien, alien species in the book and it's the book I point to whenever I'm asked (I have never been asked this yet) for an alien species that are truly different from humans.

Anyone else have other books that involve alien aliens? Or alien humans?
