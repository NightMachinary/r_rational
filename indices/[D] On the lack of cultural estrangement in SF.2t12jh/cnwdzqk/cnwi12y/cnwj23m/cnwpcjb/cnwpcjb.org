As [[/u/alexanderwales]] said, the problem isn't that weirdness is weird, it is that the author chose a very fraught and painful topic to exemplify that weirdness. Particularly because the author is discussing a harm largely falling outside his own demographic.

It isn't hard to be careful about things that hurt real living people. No-one can be so obtuse as to not see the cultural detritus an idea like future progress = legal rape will invoke. Like future = legal holocaust, or future = legal ethnic cleansing. Just ...why? There are so many other options.

There is an inferential gap, sure, but it was the author that misjudged it, badly enough to be called on it.

And it is spelled Yudkowsky.
