  problem isn't that weirdness is weird, it is that the author chose a very fraught and painful topic to exemplify that weirdness

/All/ major cross cultural clashes are lined around topics which are fraught and painful for at least one of the cultures. People adapt to the funny quirks in mannerisms of other cultures quite quickly - true cultural estrangement is centered around moral issues which necessarily involve lots of emotional pain. I challenge you to name one that isn't.

Like I said before, that's the /entire point/ of a "memory of disaster".

  It isn't hard to be careful about things that hurt real living people. No-one can be so obtuse as to not see the cultural detritus an idea like future progress = legal rape will invoke. Like future = legal holocaust, or future = legal ethnic cleansing. Just ...why?

This is a fair criticism of why one should not do things like that...

  There are so many other options.

..but this is not necessarily true. I don't think there can be cultural estrangement without some degree of painfulness, some degree of /objection/ to what you are seeing depicted in this society.

Again, I'm /not/ saying that Yudkowsky is above criticism. *I'm saying it's hard to write about a futuristic society in which all involved are quite happy doing something that people feel is deeply wrong, without opening yourself to the same criticism you and [[/u/alexanderwales]] are giving Yudkowsky right now*. It is hard to create a sense of true cultural estrangement without invoking pain and negativity from readers towards the work itself.

There is a /necessary/ trade off here between invoking (valid) criticism of your decision to depict this particular future and giving the reader an authentic feeling that this future has truly left them behind.

Imagine yourself as a 1950s conservative, reading Heinlein, and then complete that sentence. These people felt /deep seated uneasiness/ against these depictions just as real as your own. (The only difference is, Heinlein really did believe in what he was writing, and that's arguably an important difference. But if you are morally obligated to write utopias that you would /actually/ want to live in, you're not estranged. It's the difference between "The future has left me behind" and "the society has finally caught up to me".)
