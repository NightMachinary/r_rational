Pain and negativity should be targeted to people who aren't already buried in it. It is no benign act to use a currently oppressed group as a plot device in a way that harms them.

For example, the cultural wtf could come from a babyless-by-choice society, where the entire society feels that depriving a living being of sapience for a decade is immoral and risky, when science can just skip the whole thing with accelerated development and optimal learning algorithms.

There is no current blue-green war among members of our society about the morality or immorality of child rearing, there are no disenfranchised people who are harmed by their inability or ability to rear children (note: not ability to get pregnant, that is definitely something people face discrimination about around the world).

But it is still a weirdtopia. Also note how well this fits with the plot of the story and the revulsion towards the baby-eaters, rather than being massively out of place.

Or a common scifi trope, where society requires augmentation of the members. Weirdtopia, but there is no modern analogue apart from a marginal relationship with disability and people with disabilities would benefit by those sorts of future tech. Hell, you could take it further and posit a society where each person is optimised for a single type of thinking with nonexistant skills in others, but society copes by outsourcing all other requirements. That is a weird but utopic vision for many people with cognitive impairments.

If you have to make it about sex, a society of asexuals is plausible. Or of a-romantics. Or of pansexuals. Or robo-sexuals. Whatever. Confronting for many readers, but doesn't reference a current harm common in our society.

My personal position is, as with the whole "I need to prove my evil character is super evil" plot line, the good rule of thumb is /don't make it about rape/.
