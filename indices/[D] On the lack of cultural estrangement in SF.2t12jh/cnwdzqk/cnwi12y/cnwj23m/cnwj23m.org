  There are a ton of questions that get raised by this premise, and none of them are even remotely explored.

Your comment of illustrates my point. With a truly alien culture, everything has to constantly be explained and that would break the story. Anyone who goes to a foreign country will immediately be bombarded with weirdness and there is no "author" to sit down and nicely contextualize it. No one /can/ contextualize it to you because no one understands your point of view in the first place. The feeling of "cultural estrangement" is a sense of hopelessness, that you will never understand these people and they can never understand you.

I'm not necessarily defending Yudkowski's choice of including that into the story - I'm explaining /why it's hard/ to write alien words. It's a fairly subtle line between writing alien societies and causing a negative reaction. If your story isn't /explicitly about/ an alien human society, if you have other things to deal with in the plot and don't feel like explaining the alien culture in detail, you can't just casually drop an alien human society in there without causing an uproar.

  There wasn't a deeper point about consent, morality, boundaries, or emotional pain, because the entire text was a handful of paragraphs which didn't touch on any of that.

The text doesn't teach you the concepts, it's true. The phrase "memory of a disaster" has a /lot/ of ideas packed into it, and there's a lot of inferential distance that isn't bridged. "Memories of a disaster" pretty much explain 70% of cross cultural misunderstandings, once you wrap your mind around the concept.

I think it only makes sense if you've /already/ spent time thinking about consent and culture. I had read Helliwell's anthropological work on the Gerai's lack of understanding of how rape was possible before reading Yudkowski's story, have spent time thinking about how humans respond to scarcity and pain, and I'm pretty familiar with culture clashes due to being bi-cultural myself, so I personally perceived the entire meaning immediately, even before reading the explanation. But it's true that I didn't /acquire/ the meaning from the text - I had already explored the concept he was exploring, and if I had not I would not have gotten it, and that's arguably a weakness in writing.

That's the thing: it's really hard to judge the true distance of the inferential distance between yourself the author and your average reader. It's not like no one else could possibly have gotten it - Yudkowski just failed to estimate the total ratio of people who would get it to people who would not.
