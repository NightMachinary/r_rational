  Remember Yudkowsky's redrawing of the boundaries of sexual consent in "three worlds collide"'s human utopia? It was only a fictional universe, but people were on the edge of getting fairly upset and quite obviously failing to understand the deeper points about consent, morality, boundaries, and emotional pain that he was making. And those were lesswrongers, imagine how the general population might react.

The bigger problem with that was that it was such a throwaway idea, given two lines and not at all fleshed out. It /wasn't/ a redrawing of the boundaries of sexual consent, at least not in the story itself. There are a ton of questions that get raised by this premise, and none of them are even remotely explored. There wasn't a deeper point about consent, morality, boundaries, or emotional pain, because the entire text was a handful of paragraphs which didn't touch on /any/ of that. You only get into that other stuff if you go read the author's commentary on what he meant, which ... is a sign of a problem in the writing. /Especially/ since the world is like reality unless noted and this difference didn't come up until late in the work.

It's totally fine to have a future where things are different and alien - but when they're tacked on like that, of course it's going to get a negative reaction.
