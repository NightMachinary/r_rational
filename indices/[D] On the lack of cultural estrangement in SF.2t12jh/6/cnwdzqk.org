The trouble is, that a vision of the future is implicitly taken as an /endorsement/ of that future unless otherwise stated. If you write a truly altered culture which is not explicitly a distopia, your own culture will reject it - much as the faraway past might have rejected a depiction of the present.

Remember Yudkowsky's redrawing of the boundaries of sexual consent in "three worlds collide"'s human utopia? It was only a fictional universe, but people were on the edge of getting fairly upset and quite obviously failing to understand the deeper points about consent, morality, boundaries, and emotional pain that he was making. And those were /lesswrongers/, imagine how the general population might react.
