Nah, wasn't edited in.

Child rearing is often outsourced, for people who work full time for example, but those people are not socially discriminated against. Nor are people who can't afford childcare or have a preference to do so, looked down on for having a stay at home parent.

But you can imagine societies where either occurred. In fact, historically a mother who left home to work faced some discrimination and that is certainly true in some parts of the world and among some demographics still. The opposite would be fairly novel, or at least I can't think of examples.

Completely different issue to growing a foetus.
