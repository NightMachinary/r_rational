  Pain and negativity should be targeted to people who aren't already buried in it. It is no benign act to use a currently oppressed group as a plot device in a way that harms them.

...again, I don't disagree.

  Again, I'm not saying that Yudkowsky is above criticism. I'm saying it's hard to write about a futuristic society in which all involved are quite happy doing something that people feel is deeply wrong, without opening yourself to the same criticism you and [[/u/alexanderwales]] are giving Yudkowsky right now.

Your Weirdtopias are not doing something that I feel is deeply immoral or have any strong gut reaction to. You haven't skirted the trade-off, you've simply chosen a certain position on the tradeoff spectrum: You choose to eliminate gut level moral dissonance from the literary repertoire in exchange for not risking creating pain and not risking the possibly dissemination of immoral ideas from your fictional society to the real world.

I'm not saying I wouldn't make the same choice. I am only acknowledging the existence of the trade off.
