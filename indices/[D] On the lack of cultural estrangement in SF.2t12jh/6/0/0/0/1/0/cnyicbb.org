  People have their future worlds feature slavery and genocide all the damn time; the difference is that they're obviously drawing on our own culture, whereas Yudkowsky used different lines than current gender norms.

I guess my main argument is that he didn't - he didn't really draw any lines at all. Given the seriousness of rape, and the fact that it's still legal in some parts of the world (mostly marital rape), I don't think that the reader can be faulted for thinking that was what his characters were talking about. Here is the entirety of that section:

  The Confessor held up a hand. "I mean it, my lord Akon. It is not polite idealism. We ancients can't steer. We remember too much disaster. We're too cautious to dare the bold path forward. Do you know there was a time when nonconsensual sex was illegal?"

  Akon wasn't sure whether to smile or grimace. "The Prohibition, right? During the first century pre-Net? I expect everyone was glad to have that law taken off the books. I can't imagine how boring your sex lives must have been up until then - flirting with a woman, teasing her, leading her on, knowing the whole time that you were perfectly safe because she couldn't take matters into her own hands if you went a little too far -"

  "You need a history refresher, my Lord Administrator. At some suitably abstract level. What I'm trying to tell you - and this is not public knowledge - is that we nearly tried to overthrow your government."

  "What?" said Akon. "The Confessors?"

  "No, us. The ones who remembered the ancient world. Back then we still had our hands on a large share of the capital and tremendous influence in the grant committees. When our children legalized rape, we thought that the Future had gone wrong."

  Akon's mouth hung open. "You were that prude?"

I mean, there are women being raped in India and Saudi Arabia /right now/ with no legal recourse. It's a very logical parallel to draw, because that's how some parts of our own society are (and historically, that's even more the case).
