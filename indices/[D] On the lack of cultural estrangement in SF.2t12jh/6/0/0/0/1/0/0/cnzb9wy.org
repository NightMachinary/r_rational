Right, but the slavery/genocide universes always have the characters talk about the Evils Of Discrimination - the dominant narrative surrounding slavery/genocide in our culture. Even when it doesn't really make sense, which is often the case with species featuring wildly different psychology to humans.

Anecdote - I've had people yell at me for suggesting that maybe JK Rowling had intended Hermione to be /wrong/ about the best way to deal with House-Elves. They had read her as the heroine virtuously telling off the evil racists, biding her time to force them all to be free offscreen after the books ended. They were pretty shocked at the idea a book might have "slavery" /not/ be a clear-cut evil, and maybe the best approach to help house-elves /wasn't/ the fist thing that jumped to Hermione's mind.

Eliezer, on the other hand, did /not/ have his characters talk about The Evils of Misogyny (which is the dominant narrative surrounding rape in our culture.) Which makes the /Protagonists/ the bad guys who the hero should be lecturing, and the lack of this an endorsement of Evil.

... with that said, I might be wrong about this, seeing as I doubt a lot of his readers read that comment outlining how he had imagined the lines surrounding sex/rape were drawn in this culture. Maybe if that had been included, if the Confessor had actually /tried/ (and failed) to explain, reactions would have been different. I might be overgeneralizing from laziness to necessity.
