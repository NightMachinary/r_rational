Some good examples:

- Anathem by Neal Stephenson

- Czarne Oceany by Jacek Dukaj (it was supposed to be translated to English, but I can't find translation anywhere, here is summary [[http://www.terminally-incoherent.com/blog/2012/02/10/black-oceans-czarne-oceany-by-jacek-dukaj/]] - it is deliciously strange and has record novel ideas per page ratio)

- Algebraist by Ian Banks (at least the Dwellers species)
