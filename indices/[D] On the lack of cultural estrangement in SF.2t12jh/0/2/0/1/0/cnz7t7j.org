I would agree that that was the point of the aliens. Despite that, to me they don't feel like actual aliens that would have really evolved. Instead, they feel like plot devices created by authorial fiat in order to serve the needs of the story. There's nothing wrong with that -- it's an author tract on the nature of utility functions and morality, presented as entertainment in order to make it more digestible. It succeeds admirably at its goal and is also a fun read. It's not trying to provide realistic worldbuilding and so it shouldn't be judged on the basis of whether or not it does.
