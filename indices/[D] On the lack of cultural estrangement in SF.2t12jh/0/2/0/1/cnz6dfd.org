I think the point was to have each species serve as a clear object lesson: that you can tweak just /one tiny thing/ about humanity, and end up with something that humanity would fundamentally hate, or something that would fundamentally hate humanity. Not that there will ever be an alien species that is only different by /one tiny thing/---but it shows that we don't need /big/ differences in utility functions to end up in a "considering the Other a plague and trying to wipe them out from the universe" situation.
