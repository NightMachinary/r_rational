Read /Dune/ if you want to actually feel culturally estranged. I suspect one of the reasons cultural estrangement isn't done more often in "futuristic" fiction is that the author doesn't want the reader throwing the book across the room shouting, "YOU'VE BACKSLID ON EVERYTHING BY HUNDREDS OF YEARS!"
