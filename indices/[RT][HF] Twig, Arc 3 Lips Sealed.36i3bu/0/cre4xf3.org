Okay, I'm calling it now: /Twig/ is every bit as good as /Worm/, and from here can only get better.

Wildbow has made some huge investments in the cast these past two arcs, and has prepared some devastating drama for the future as the Lambs approach their expiration dates -- and with another timeskip this chapter, that doesn't seem too far off -- not to mention Sly's knowledge of Mary's not-code. The prose is simultaneous brisk and /dense/, with more plentiful and better humor than most stories.

I am so very happy with where this story can go, it's ridiculous. There is no longer any reason whatsoever to pass on this one. It will be quite the ride.
