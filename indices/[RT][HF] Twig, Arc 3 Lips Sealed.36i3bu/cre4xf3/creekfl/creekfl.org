Absolutely.

Where Worm feels like a television series, or a very long single novel. Twig comes across as a series of movies or the traditional, episodic serialized fiction popular in the magazines of the era when this story is set. The dime novels Jamie was trading for back in the first arc are an even closer match.

Delightfully, and unlike either Worm or Pact, this allows the tension to ratchet up... and then /release/ on a regular basis. The sense of dread and despair that soaked both of the previous works is not nearly so strong here.

The world is bleak and crapsack overall, but the worst doesn't last long and our focus tilts back towards wit and fun soon enough. Slime and shadows at the periphery, adventure front and center.
