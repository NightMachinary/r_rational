The viewpoint character of /Twig/ is named Sy. He manipulates people by thrusting unpredictable circumstances over them and making the path of least resistance /his/ way. He views humans under stress as a bunch of billiard balls, rebounding chaotically, and has a terrifying intuitive sense of how to make someone break in precisely the right way.

Thus, Sychology.
