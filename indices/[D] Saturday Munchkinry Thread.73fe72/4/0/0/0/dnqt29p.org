/Pact/ works on story logic. People who behave in ways the spirits approve of get ahead, and I have neutral karma instead of Blake's horrifically negative amounts. It's risky, and possibly a long-term project, but in a universe where existence is slowly being drained away by demons, not fighting demons would nag at me way too much - and making contracts with them is less smart by virtue of the short term (personal karma loss) and long term (universal degradation) consequences.
