That's not really all that well as it looks like at the first glance. It is kinda cool, sure, but pretty dangerous in the long run.

Muscle control leads to strains and heavy joint stress all the time. You need to be very precise with muscular groups to not dislocate something. It may be better if you get familiar with how limbs move (I mean we usually move them subconsciously, not controlling every strand by one), build some mass, keep joints in good health, all that. Though if you do not overuse it, there are some benefits, and overall tone is much better.

Turning off pain turns into habit, and combined with previous one, it is not a good thing. Luckily, in modern society there are not many situations where you need to clench teeth and keep going, if you're not a soldier or boxer or something. Though thinking of it, you can be pretty good martial sportsman with pain tolerance and trained overcharged strikes. Bonuses for keeping calm all the time or going into primal rage at will.

Emotion control is very nice, though the main problem is (as I think) that emotions are just reactions of your personality to external stimuli. You can suppress them constantly, but that leads to a whole lot of bad stuff, starting with neuroses.

Changing your personality helps with that, but it goes pretty deep and you got to be very knowledgeably about yourself. To change how you feel about particular person, for example, requires you to understand what do you like and don't like about them, where this likes and dislikes come from, how they interact with each other and so on. Sure, you can just hardwire the feeling of euphoria to this person, so you will be exctatic all the time while interacting with them, but if you had any negative responses to start with, it will backfire pretty much the same as the suppressed emotions.

Speaking of euphoria, luckily it is not exactly possible to accidentally slip into nirvana, because there are some limiters on amount of happiness hormones produced and then brain recalibrates itself so experiences lie in some range, so after a while it evens out. But I bet with some amount of effort you can make yourself into an eternally happy vegetable. Not really a good use of those abilities, sure.

Some may say that changing you personality so that you have completely different reactions (and nice, stable change requires altering a solid part of network) is turning into another person entirely, like you die as yourself and all that stuff. I prefer to think that if I have continuous memories, I remain the same person, and even more, that many possible versions of personality constitute some "meta-ego", and current personality is just one of the configurations. Well, it really helps to have self-imposed utility function that you keep constant through changes, so you don't lose track completely. Memory altering is a thing too, you'll be at least changing emotions associated with said memories to help with personality editing, but I don't need to point at dangers of this.

Full attention focusing looks promising, if you can forcefully induce state of inspiration when you don't see anything else and work on problem with your maximum potential, you can achieve a lot, but I think it depends on your talent and skills and such, so it will be more or less useful for different people. But I bet this mode is very taxing and mentioned sleep deprivation won't really help with keeping you healthy.
