I'd probably continue doing exactly what I'm doing, just more efficiently, and try not to kill myself by forgetting a decimal when experimenting with important systems. I guess it would be a blessing insofar as I could just ignore my newfound control and leave everything on autopilot until I /really/ need it, and I could still e.g. dull pain to the point of a good painkiller without all the harmful side-effects and not remove it completely (like, I have a few niggling injuries but not really what you'd describe as chronic pain, and acute pains I can dull for a time until they'd fade on their own). I guess there'd be a temptation to self-wirehead or disappear up my own ass in to some transcendental, nirvana-lite state, so I'd stay away from exploring those options. But anyway, even with perfect mind-muscle connection I'd still be far inferior to extremely dedicated, drug-enhanced athletes (and a lot more likely to injure myself); even with no stage fright I'd be far below the world's most charismatic orators; even with super concentration ability I'd still lack the raw talent, experience, and dedication to match the best of the best at their chosen fields, etc.
