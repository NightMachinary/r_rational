So far, people don't seem to think you can do much with this power. I disagree. Things I came up with after a couple of minutes of thinking:

1. Make lots of easy money being a lab rat for neuroscientists and psychologists. Become semi-famous in this way.

2. Use my focus and emotional control to bootstrap myself up to an Elon-Musk-level work-ethic.

3. Learn the basics of magic and stuntwork, and become rich and famous by performing David-Blaine-esque feats of endurance. Whether or not this works depends on how much your body can adapt to doing impressive feats. Maybe even with total control and lots of practice, you just aren't cut out for David Blaine's line of work. In which case, focus on 4, 5, or 6.

4. Exploit the market of lonely people by starting a lucrative friend-for-rent business, with your comparative advantage being that during your time with a client you /genuinely/ care deeply about them. If you're not good-looking, maybe use some of the money you made being a semi-famous labrat and/or stuntperson to invest in cosmetic surgery. If you're up for it, you could even make loads of cash being the world's most sought-after prostitute (there would definitely be people into it even if you're only average looking).

5. You're basically the perfect romantic partner for the same reason - no matter who you're with, you can genuinely think of them as the sexiest person on earth. Use this and your previous fame to marry a rich person, if you can.

6. Use your focus and emotional control to try and develop the world's best memory, using standard mind-palace techniques. Win the world memory competition every year and collect the cash prize. Combine your memory with your Elon-Musk level work ethic and become a super entrepreneur.

7. Or, avoid all the above and instead use your complete self-control to become the world's greatest spy. You would be the world's best liar, and also deceptively strong.

If absolutely none of this works for you, then yes, you can just go on and continue being a slightly better version of yourself.
