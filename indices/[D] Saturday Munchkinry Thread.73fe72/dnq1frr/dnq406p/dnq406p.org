Check the 10000th bit for whether it has been set. If yes, read the first 10 KB as ASCII text and follow instructions. If no, spend a week designing a strategy, turn it into 10 KB of ASCII, find out how many bits of it I've already written into the table, and write the next bit.

I expect that the strategy I would end up with after the first week would take into account the following:

- Tactics like above allow arbitrary communication out of a loop iteration.
- Experiments on the laptop are in order. Can table contents be queried other than one bit at a time without influencing the world other than through query outputs? How large/infinite is the table adress space?
- Breaking the laptop turns the loop infinite. Checking the 10^{ludicroust} bit early in each iteration prevents this, but might stop other strategies from working past that mark.
- Every second that has not been exactly replicated in a previous iteration is one in which some idiot might hook up a random number generator to a CPU and spawn an AGI that takes over the loop. Try not to bring about exponential amounts of original time.
- As always, the endgame is to bring about an FAI. Contact everyone who has a potato code and organize a Mother of Learning.
