  You are virtually guaranteed to get convinced by the researchers that you should trigger an emergency revision three times in a row before the messages get long enough to matter.

How so? I realize we're never getting to the point of ending the loop by the combined text taking more than a week to read (I had something about this in the post originally, but I removed it because it was a bit rambly), but I figured we'd at least get some good insights before ending the loop. Is there a reason the shortest message that can convince me to end the loop is necessarily shorter than the shortest messages that give us useful new insight?

  You just put, not an AGI, but an outcome pump in a box and told it to come up with the shortest FAI design or reason to break protocol it can convince you of.

I'm assuming this goes horribly wrong somewhere, but I don't see where exactly. Sure, in an infinite search space there are infinite ways of making me break protocol in some horrible manner, but I don't see how they should be shorter than the shortest insights in FAI design. HPMOR's "Don't mess with time!" isn't going to cut it here because I know that string comes up regardless of whether or not it is a good idea to mess with time.
