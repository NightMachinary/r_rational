Gah! Ok, that makes the problem much harder, since now you need to gain the consent of all of humanity in order to use the crown. And you will need to use the crown since it is the only known way to combat the heat death of the universe.

Perhaps once a decade, get all of humanity to move to safe locations while you use the crown to generate mass energy?

For privacy, you could give people boxes that lock from the inside with a password required to open from either side, so they lock themselves inside the boxes before you put on the crown, and the fact that copies don't gain information from their hosts ensures the copies can't get out of the box and so people have peace of mind knowing their replacement copies didn't do anything.
