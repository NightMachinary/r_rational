I deliberately didn't specify what constitutes human in the original post, because I couldn't come up with a good definition (shockingly, the story didn't delve into the specifics of whether embryo's are effected by the crown), but I feel that if an embryo is developed enough to qualify as human for the crown then it is probably developed enough that mass harvesting them is unethical. [[/u/Gurkenglas]]'s homo potatus could work though.
