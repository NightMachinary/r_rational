If you are trying to be moral about it (which I was indeed), I am a little sceptical that you can do enough good with the wealth redistribution of what amounts to 7 billion cases of petty theft to offset the massive amounts of property damage caused by each use of the crown.

That said, this:

  If you grow out your hair and then tie it around your face as a mask, would the copies come into existence with their hair in the same hairstyle? If so, that's probably your best bet, then cut/dye your hair afterwards.

is a brilliant idea. Just to be safe you'd want to conceal from the world that you are growing your hair out in the months before you put on the crown, but that can be achieved.
