You can't wire money, but you can steal physical goods/money. Set up a number of specific points located across the world, either based on GPS coordinates or landmarks or something. Then put on the crown. Every copy of you figures out where they are, where the nearest location is, and where the nearest valuable goods/money are. Maybe it's just whatever's in their wallet, maybe it's a nearby store with now unguarded goods, maybe they work in a bank and have access to some money not under combination lock. They take all their stuff, and go put it in the location (bury it or place it in a P.O. box or storage shed that you've prepared ahead of time). The idea here is they can walk/drive to the location relatively quickly, then return to their original location after a preset amount of time, when you take the crown off. Then you can go around gradually collecting your loot from all of the locations.

If you want to be moral, you could do the same thing but only stealing from previously designated people/places that do unethical things and then use the money for good things.

Alternatively, if you wanted to be more subtle, you could set up a website ahead of time and have your copies go and type in their credit/debit card numbers, personal information, usernames/passwords, or any other information that they can find written down either in physical folders or on their computer (if it's not password protected, or they're already logged in). This way nothing would be missing until you steal their identities potentially months/years later.

Also, I think the assassination could be good if you have a way of identifying, say, members of ISIS even after the switch.

Security footage could be a problem. You could try to have everyone cover their face immediately and try to look around for cameras that caught the change, but I doubt every single one of them would get caught. It would be obvious to everyone that something had occurred given that everyone in the world lost time, and they would only need a few cameras that you didn't notice in order to get a good look at your face. The best solution would be to find a way of temporarily altering your face as much as possible in a way that would be copied. If you grow out your hair and then tie it around your face as a mask, would the copies come into existence with their hair in the same hairstyle? If so, that's probably your best bet, then cut/dye your hair afterwards. Otherwise, you could try to make your face swell up from bee-stings or some sort of chemical, such that the copy people look nothing like you will after you heal.
