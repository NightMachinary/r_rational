I don't remember ever reading a power here and going "/What? What???/" over and over like this. Well done.

Study up on critical skills like doing the job of a pilot or power plant operator in medias res. Strive to understand warning signs in any language.

Do pregnant women turn into a copy of me with another full-grown copy of me bursting out of their stomach?

Using it for longer than a few minutes the first time might break whoknowswhat system that was not designed to handle me. A minute might be enough for most versions of me realizing that this was a terrible mistake to shout that message to whomever nearby has a smartphone so they can post it to twitter or something. Study up on /swift/ error reporting and switching keyboard languages. Some of those pitiable, soon amnesiac versions of me might be able to cobble together some writing-based cooperation with those pitiable critical people they just bestowed narcolepsy upon.

Taking it off immediately pits the world against me. Giving them less than a few minutes at a time /might/ be able to stop knowledge of my identity propagating too far. I suspect some military or clique of hackers would be able to improvise some protocol I don't understand.

Sleep deprivation is a thing. Taking 8 hours of continued control after 16 hours for the world to intermittently prepare for that might be okay, but it would be easier to have a copilot to swap shifts with me.

In fact, this crown might be better suited to some other person. Knowing that FAI is critical is well and good, but maybe this is important enough to find someone who /also/ speaks all the languages and has all the worldkeeping skills and whose face is known to none and who doesn't burst all the clothing every time he appears. Time to raise a prince?
