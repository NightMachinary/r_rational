Every use is going to cause a lot of accidental death. Pilots, surgeons, drivers, extreme sports fans would all die in droves. The only permissable use would have to save more lives than it cost, which basically boils down to war (counterintuitively). War is declared, the crown is used, one side now has no ammo and all their advanced tech is destroyed.
