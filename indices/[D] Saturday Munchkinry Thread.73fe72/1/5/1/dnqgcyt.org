I mean, I can think of /some/ scenarios where use of the crown seems fairly unambiguously warranted, e.g. the world is minutes away from thermonuclear armageddon and you(s) assume direct control to sabotage all the missile launches, or something.

But using it under present circumstances even for a fraction of a second, I feel, would 1) overwhelmingly make you out to be the most famous person in the world, given the huge number of high resolution + live feed + remote backup video cameras trained directly on faces doubtless active at any given time, and 2) result in some huge number of deaths and at minimum billions in property damage, as copies of you fail to make the split-second decisions involved in operating heavy machinery (cars included), resulting in crashes that kill you, and when the crown is removed and people find themselves teleported into burning wreckage... I suppose you could ready yourself for split second decision making, but that jerkiness would probably not go so well for everyone undergoing surgery, as surgeons find their scalpel-holding hands teleported minutely right, severing some vital whatsit or other...
