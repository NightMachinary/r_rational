This is from a school play I had to perform a long time ago. The story itself was sadly more interested in beating us over the head with the moral than in exploring the societal/metaphysical impacts of the power in question, but I think it makes a good optimization target.

You have access to a very powerful magic artifact: a crown that when placed on a persons head turns every human in existence into an exact copy of that person until the crown is removed. You do not have direct control over your copies; they are exact duplicates of you at the moment the spell takes hold, but start diverging immediately after.

*Notes*:

- The copies do not gain the skills or knowledge of the people whose body they are inhabiting.

- You do not have a psychic link or other special method of communicating with the copies and the memories of the copies are not merged back into yours when the spell ends.

- People retain no memory of what happened while the copies were inhabiting their body, no subjective time passes for anyone but the bearer of the crown.

- There is no time limit on the use of the crown, nor is there a limit to how often it can be used.

- Your clothing, including the crown itself, is not copied along. Note that this will make it difficult to conceal your identity afterwards as your face will be on every security camera on the planet.

- When the spell ends everyone turns back into their original body as it was when the crown was used (including wounds, diseases etc), but they are not teleported back to their original location.

- If a copy dies while the spell is active they remain dead until the spell ends, after which the original body is restored in the location of the corpse (or the nearest empty space to its centre of mass if the body is no longer in one piece).

- If the person wearing the crown dies, the spell ends immediately.

- There is a speed of light delay to the effect of the crown, so you can't use it for FTL signalling.

Considering the power of the crown I'm having trouble coming up with good exploits for it. Anything that requires passwords or biometric identification is out, so you can't just wire a bunch of money to an account of your choice (and this would likely be detected and reversed as soon as the spell ends anyway). I suppose you could assassinate a bunch of people if your copies can somehow identify the person whose body they are inhabiting, but I'm a little sceptical about how much good you could really do by just killing a bunch of specific people, especially if it is going to be very obvious afterwards that it was murder.

Also worth noting is that, depending on your definition of such things, you may be committing suicide approximately seven billion times every time you use the crown.
