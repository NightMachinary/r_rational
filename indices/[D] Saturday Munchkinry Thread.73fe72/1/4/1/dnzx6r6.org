  the odds of you being the person wearing the crown will be one in 7 billion

  you will die pretty soon once the crown is taken off

That's a fascinating view of identity. I can see how it would create interesting, and very different, reactions to an upload or simulation problem. Hm.

The crown wearer would have perfect continuity, while other instances of myself might be startled by the transition, perhaps from the transition from "having my arms raised just above my head holding the weight of the crown" to being whereever I am. I don't think that this new "I" would go into an existential crisis on realizing that, though, I'd continue on whatever goal the mind-state that was me a few seconds ago and perhaps a thousand miles away intended to do. If that was "Try to keep doing whatever your previous self was doing and avoid catastrophes. And if you find yourself staring at an open Bitcoin wallet, wire some to this address, so that original us can have some funds to continue working on the plan" I'd go about it. I don't see why I'd suddenly become jealous of the crown-wearer, or fearful of my imminent cessation.
