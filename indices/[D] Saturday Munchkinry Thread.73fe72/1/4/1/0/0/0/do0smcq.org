See the difference here is the lack of continuity of experience, after all there's no more reason to expect to experience the things reconstructed you experiences any more anyone else. Whatever ongoing processes in the brain generate one's subjective experience do not seem likely to be connected to any aspect of your personality (for instance you wouldn't expect oblivion from having your personality changed by a drug).\\
Thus it seems like if you care about things from the perspective of your own internal experience you should be totally indifferent to whether other iterations of yourself exist elsewhere or will in the future when considering a course of action that would permanently cease the processes in your mind responsible for generating experiences.

As for the transporter example specifically, the obvious counterpoint is that if it merely scanned you /then/ created the copy it would seem clear beforehand which iteration you expect to continue your experiences from.

There's also another thought experiment relevant here. In this one you and someone else with a remarkably similar personality and intelligence will have your memories scanned. Then you are both memory wiped, after which each brain has the memories that used to belong to the other inscribed in it (between the memory wipe and memory inscription the brains are still aware but are like newborns).\\
In this scenario you know beforehand that after the memory switch one of you will be killed, but you get to choose which. So do you choose to let live the individual who bears your memories or the one that has the same brain as you do right now and thus an unbroken chain of experience?
