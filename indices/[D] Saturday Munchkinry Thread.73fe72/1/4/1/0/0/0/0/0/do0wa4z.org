  I lost you here. What do you mean by this? You keep talking about memories, personality, intelligence, experience etc. as if they are distinct from one's brain. To answer selfishly, I would always pick the individual who bears my memories, that's me.

Sure all those things are features of one's brain, but given these scenario involve digitizing them in order to recreate your brain or inscribe them on another brain it's not so clear cut. So in a sense they are only happen to /currently/ be features of your brain but are fundamentally information/processes which can have pretty much any substrate.

As for the individual who bears your memories always being you, well disputing that has been the whole point here. Because the processes in your brain (or equivalent substrate for AI) that do experiencing are not reliant on you maintaining some consistent personality or memories in order to continue functioning. So if you care about being able to predict future experiences then it becomes apparent that in that context you should consider yourself to be the continous processes in your brain which have experience.\\
This is of course somewhat confusing because when dealing with other people the thing you consider to be them is generally going to be their personality and memories, since that is presumably the reason you cared about them in the first place. So from your perspective there's no real reason to not treat copies of people (that are close enough that you can't tell the difference even if they're not /actually/ that similar) as if they were the same. Effectively when it comes to other people you don't really care about their internal experiences, just their behavior.

It's important to keep track of the fact that you're talking about different things in these two cases even if you/others call them both "you". One of those conceptions is useful for predicting behavior which is what you care about in other people, but the other is the one you actually want to use to predict your own future subjective experiences.
