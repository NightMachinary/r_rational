Oh, I fear death, for sure. But I agree that I would be indifferent to death if I was replaced with an exact copy of myself, as in, say, a Star Trek transporter that destructively rips apart all my constituent particles and builds an identical copy of me somewhere else.

Apart from needing a very solid guarantee that the process will work flawlessly, I'm not sure why that's worthy of fear? How is it different from simply continuing to exist, except that I'm in a slightly different location?
