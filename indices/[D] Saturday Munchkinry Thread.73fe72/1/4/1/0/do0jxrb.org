  The crown wearer would have perfect continuity, while other instances of myself might be startled by the transition, perhaps from the transition from "having my arms raised just above my head holding the weight of the crown" to being whereever I am.

Yes and the shitty thing is that you know beforehand that at the instant of putting on the crown your odds of being the one wearing it are one in over seven billion.

As for the copies following through on the plans created by the original. Well for one there's absolutely no selfish motivation to do that, from your perspective you will never get to reap the benefits of whatever actions you take to help the original.

Regarding whether it makes sense for you to fear your imminent cessation. Well for one the fact that another very similar entity to your mind exists seems irrelevant to that, for one their fate doesn't affect your own future experience of continuing to experience things or not. Importantly though is that people don't seem to realize that if you somehow don't care about your own future anticipated experiences but just that of all minds sufficiently similar to ones own, then that has serious implications in the current actual world.\\
Basically if you aren't primarily concerned with your particular instantiation of minds close to you in mind space. Then one has no real reason to care about death or many other things if you think /any/ variety of multiverse is probably true since pretty much every multiverse theory would have enough worlds to have plenty of near/perfect copies of yourself.

Of course some of our disagreement is possibly just that you just have no real fear of death, and it always unnerves me the sheer number of people of people on reddit I encounter who seem to lack that. The number of people of people I encounter who say they would be indifferent to death if they could be replaced with a copy of themselves in the process is rather bizarre and I suspect can't possibly be representative of the general population.
