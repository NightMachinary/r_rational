That's what the disclaimer about committing seven billion counts of suicide was about. It does pretty strongly depend on your definition of identity, though. I can imagine an argument that because one instance of you is guaranteed to survive it is more like getting a whole bunch of new memories and then having them taken away from you again rather than you having a 1:7 billion chance to survive.

This is not necessarily the argument I would make (my own intuitions on this topic are failing to come up with a good answer), but I feel it is a reasonable position to take.
