Ooh, raising someone specifically for the purpose of wearing the crown is an interesting idea. I had considered finding someone else to wear the crown, but figured it would be difficult to find someone who shares my exact ethics, believes me when I explain the rules of the crown and is both willing to use it and more suitable for using it than me.

My thoughts were mostly along the lines of wearing the crown once, doing what needs to be done and then hiding it away never to be used again. Repeat use is just too risky, I think (plus all the collateral damage happens again every time you use it). Sleeping could indeed be a problem, though I imagine you could always just ducttape the crown to your head.
