Well, the moral of the story was "it's ok to be different" not "please don't mind rape every human on the planet", but yeah you'd need to do something pretty big with the crown in order to do enough good to warrant it's use.

I would argue that preventing sufficiently large disasters (the already mentioned thermonuclear armageddon for instance) or assuring something very good happens (FAI is the first thing that comes to mind, but effecting some large and lasting political changes might also suffice I think).
