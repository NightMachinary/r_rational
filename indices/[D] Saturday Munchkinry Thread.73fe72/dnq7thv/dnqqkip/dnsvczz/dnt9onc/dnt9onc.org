Right I always seem to forget how many people actually consider that a reasonable position or even actually /believe/ it. It always strikes me as a position that totally misses the point of actually predicting future experience in favor of being overly caught up in unanswerable question about identity.

Still it strikes me as bizarre how many people assume that the parts of your mind responsible for a poorly defined "self" would be the same as those that are responsible for subjective experiences.
