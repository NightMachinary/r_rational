Honestly the odds of this going well for you seem ~0 since at the moment you put on the crown the odds of you being the person wearing the crown will be one in 7 billion, otherwise you suddenly find yourself somewhere else and realize that you will die pretty soon once the crown is taken off.

So basically using the crown is a terrible idea because in addition to probably getting caught once you take it off, you are also obliterating so many iterations of your own mind that your odds of survival are slim.
