  when placed on a persons head turns every human in existence into an exact copy of that person until the crown is removed.

So... If I have a bunch of embryos in a petri dish, and I put on the crown, they all magically become copies of me, magicking up the extra body mass from nowhere? Mass = Energy so... this is a massive power source.

Of course, there are some dangers here, you don't want to convert all humans into copies of you, because that would make them really mad and quite likely kill several of them (including the pregnant).

Luckily, we may be saved by:

  There is a speed of light delay to the effect of the crown, so you can't use it for FTL signalling.
#+end_quote

This might mean you can control who gets turned into a copy of you and who doesn't, depending on how it works. Let's say I put on the crown for a second and then take it off. Would that only convert humans within a lightsecond of me into copies? Since the rest of humanity would be further away than the FTL speed of the crown's spell.

If so, move far away from the rest of humanity, bringing only your target converts with you (like a bunch of embryos in a test tube). Put the test tube in a power plant of some kind, and put on the crown for just long enough to convert the embryos into copies of you to generate power from their extra mass, while not long enough to convert far away humans.

(People might still be pissed off by your mass murdering of embryos though.)
