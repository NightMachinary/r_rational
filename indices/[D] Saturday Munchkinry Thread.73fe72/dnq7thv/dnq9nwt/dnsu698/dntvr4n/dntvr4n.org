Lots of people have long hair, so I suppose you could just perpetually have long hair, avoid the property damage, and you'd only be as much suspect as the other tens of thousands of people with long hair and similar hair color and body structure as you.

You'd stand a better chance at a net positive if you scouted out unethical rich people ahead of time and only stole from them, having the other clones sit around idly, but, unless you can complete your theft incredibly quickly, I think you'd still come out negative given the sheer amount of man-hours that would be lost around the world during the time you're wasting multiplied by 7 billion, possible causing disasters as important infrastructure goes untended and airplanes aren't properly piloted, and workers in poor countries lose daylight hours and leave tasks unfinished that your clones wouldn't know how to do or that they need to be done in the first place.

I don't think you could make up for that by Robin-Hooding a few rich jerks, so I guess the most ethical thing to do would be to destroy the crown if possible.
