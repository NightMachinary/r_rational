  Exploit the market of lonely people by starting a lucrative friend-for-rent business, with your comparative advantage being that during your time with a client you genuinely care deeply about them. If you're not good-looking, maybe use some of the money you made being a semi-famous labrat and/or stuntperson to invest in cosmetic surgery. If you're up for it, you could even make loads of cash being the world's most sought-after prostitute (there would definitely be people into it even if you're only average looking).

  You're basically the perfect romantic partner for the same reason - no matter who you're with, you can genuinely think of them as the sexiest person on earth. Use this and your previous fame to marry a rich person, if you can.

This seems extremely dangerous. Modifying your own utility function has a tendency to be permanent. In this example, once you modify your utility function to include genuine care for someone, there is a very real chance that you would no longer want to modify your utility function back to uncaring, since you do care about them and modifying your function to not care could hurt them.
