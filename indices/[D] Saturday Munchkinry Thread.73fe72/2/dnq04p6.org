You have a one in a hundred million genetic brain anomaly. It is dormant until a bad car accident puts you in a coma. You wake up faster than the doctors expected, and it turns out that not only did your brain heal itself, but it also grew new connections between your prefrontal cortex and parts of your brain that are normally beneath consciousness. You discover that you now have significant conscious control over your autonomic nervous system. Specifically, you can

1. Exercise a lot of control over your heart rate.

2. Exert your muscles past their normal brain-imposed limitations.

3. Turn any of your senses on or off at will, including pain.

4. Cause yourself to fall asleep instantly, or alternatively keep yourself awake and focused much longer than normal (though the effects of sleep deprivation would still slowly set in and reduce your performance; you just wouldn't consciously notice for a long time).

5. Focus your full attention on anything you choose, and be able to instantly change focus to something else of your choice, without any significant mental break.

6. Control your emotions very precisely. For example, your could suppress stage fright and make yourself feel extremely happy about being in front of people. You could change how you feel about particular people and things, even change your basic disgust response.

7. Alter your sexuality at will. You could make yourself asexual for a period of time, and then later make yourself attracted to very specific people or things.

Is this ability a blessing or a curse? How would you use it to make yourself wealthy and powerful? I came up with this when trying to think of the absolute minimal changes needed to make someone a superhero, changes that are very close to plausible. If you're wondering how it could be a curse, note that more conscious control is not always a good thing. There would be the constant temptation to just turn off all pain signals, but this is a terrible idea, since you could seriously hurt yourself without knowing it. Similarly, there would be the temptation to turn off all negative emotions, but that may not be good for your mental health in the long run.
