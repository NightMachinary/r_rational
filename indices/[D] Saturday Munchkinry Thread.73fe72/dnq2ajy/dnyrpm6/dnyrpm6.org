Well, "Literature Review" sounds almost like a superset of "Olden Omnicompetence". Sure, it doesn't give you physical skills, but the omnicompetence doesn't give you extra strength or flexibility, either, so you'd want to practice in either case. Plus, it's not just instinctive, so you could actually teach it.

However, it seems to me that the most important power is the one that breaks normal physics, namely Material Transposition. Removing nuclear waste is fairly mundane, but being able to create nuclear fuel by drawing from a plane of infinite energy is something else.

Note that you might initially find it hard to locate a complete cubic foot of U-235, but you only need to start with a small sample, because you can double it every 3 hours.
