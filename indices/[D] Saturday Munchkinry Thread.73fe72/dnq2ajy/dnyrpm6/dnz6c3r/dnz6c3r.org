  Well, "Literature Review" sounds almost like a superset of "Olden Omnicompetence". Sure, it doesn't give you physical skills, but the omnicompetence doesn't give you extra strength or flexibility, either, so you'd want to practice in either case. Plus, it's not just instinctive, so you could actually teach it.

I'd meant for the two to roughly represent the difference between [[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/knowledge-how/][Epistêmê and Technê]]. My impression is that e.g. historians of art aren't themselves necessarily good artists, unless they've practiced it independently? Plus, the omnicompetence one gives you non-public knowledge (if that's of any use) and makes you an omniglot, too. IDK how much something like finger dexterity can be partitioned into "physical ability" and "skill", either, e.g. in the case of playing a piano, so left it ambiguous. Plus IDK that expert piano players automatically get a leg up in something like video games, where a deciding factor can be how many operations per second you can perform.

  Note that you might initially find it hard to locate a complete cubic foot of U-235, but you only need to start with a small sample, because you can double it every 3 hours.

You could definitely find some refined nuclear fuel, but I'd intended the power to only work on moments before your acquiring it, so doubling would be out in this case.
