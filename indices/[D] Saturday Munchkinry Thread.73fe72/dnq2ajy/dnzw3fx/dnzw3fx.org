I think the most interesting and useful powerful powers here are the "Council of Greatness" and "Olden Omnicompetence" examples.

The usefulness of the Council of Greatness power is contingent on my ability to transmit information into and out of the council. It's a [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/qk/that_alien_message/][That Alien Message]] situation, except the population is 1400 instead of billions.

The listed categories are interesting. I don't know whether any interesting ancient philosophers would have considered themselves philosophers. I don't know how to define what a 'leader' is, or understand why we have a group allocated to each of artists, musicians, and writers (had I selected the categories, all these would be represented by one group). But they promise not to disappoint, so I'm all for it! I think I'd step into it and say, "OK, guys and gals, what do you all think we should do? Oh, and we can select 200 more folks, let me know who you want."

It's sort of like making your first wish from a 3-wishes-genie to know what the best possible next 2 wishes would be. I now have the combined intellect of some of the top 1200 people who have ever lived, who never need sleep or eat. And they're supernaturally cooperative and motivated, which is also critical.

The next question is whether "Olden Omnicompetence" encompasses mental 'talents' such as reason, memory, philosophy, rhetoric, creativity, charisma, etc. Forget the sculpting of statues and forging of swords, I'm the intellectual amalgamation of the Council of Greatness myself. With all this business acumen and political wisdom (which were undoubtedly talents held by some people prior to 19000 BC, much less 1900 AD), I can easily hire a modern machine shop or factory to do any production I need - no point in trying to pull a Connecticut Yankee operation. This power seems to neglect to some extent that my physique includes my brain. But if I can exceed Bach's musical creativity, well, my current brain has no hope of doing that even less than my body trying to do a triple backflip. This power limits me to one brain that needs sleep, food, etc. unlike the Council's 1200 brains that can all work full time, but completely removes the bottleneck of getting information into and out of the council.

Kinda bummed that Summon Spirits requires "easily searchable limits". It would have been fun to munchkin it by summoning "an employee of the company which will experience the greatest growth in the stock market tomorrow". Also, "ghostly memories do not persist across summons" seems like a severe limit on my ability to use more than two such individuals.

Postcognitive Projection feels somewhat limited. I think the most useful information would be that which was written down exactly one decade ago - there's lots of corporate or international espionage that's still completely relevant after 10 years.

Material transposition has a historical element, but seems orthagonal to the knowledge-is-power ideas behind the other options. Also, the radius of the Earth is only a few thousand miles. I'm probably going to summon vacuum for a long time trying to figure out the coordinate system. And when I do succeed in summoning "rock", that rock is, at first, likely to be explosive magma at thousands of degrees and many, many gigapascals. So I'm not sure I'll survive the learning curve here.

It does break physics, which is unique, but Olden Omnicompetence and the Council of Greatness break not physics but the limits of society and talent, which could be equally useful. The Council, especially, turns me into a walking strong AI robot.

(Side note: The image is pretty cool, but it would be nice to have a plaintext format that could be easily quoted for responses.)
