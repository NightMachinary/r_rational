Over and over and over again. Probably take a week off each time and go on a fun vacation.

But hmmm, does the laptop have limitless storage and search capabilities? Are there any limits to how many loops I can go through?

So the loop is deterministic barring the information I access on the laptop, eh. I could try using the current values as a seed to perturb my actions enough, and try to cooperate across iterations to dowse for buried treasure and stuff (maybe including treasure buried in e.g. scratch-off tickets in gas stations, etc.). I think I might probably be able to establish some sort of schelling point code in the first few iterations of the loop which subsequent loopers would follow (e.g. have each 1 represents a square meter, starting at the south pole and spiraling clockwise up to the north; 000s represent places to investigate upon exiting the loop), and a week should be enough to get myself somewhere and start digging. I reckon stuff like lottery tickets would be too sensitive to initial conditions if they're the draw-balls-out-of-a-container sort (when I choose to exit do I play through one more final loop, or just continue on as I was from my exit time? If the latter, I could precommit to exiting only after I've had a really, really, /really/ good week, using that aforementioned seed as perturbation, though I'd probably be convinced to exit far before then, and trying to make use of seeds corresponding to however many bytes worth of data would eventually get my computer bogged down to the point of worthlessness).

Actually, my first moves would be to pay some smart people to brainstorm with me on how to exploit the loop -- some $$ could grease their palms enough to seriously entertain my crazy thought experiment. Then I'd take their advice into consideration and change my plans accordingly.
