You are stuck in a (deterministic) time loop. The loop lasts 7 days, after which everything resets, /including/ your memories. However, you may send one bit of information per loop back to yourself (a 0 or a 1).

At the end of every loop, or when you die, you have 1 minute to choose what to send back. This information goes to a simple table listing each bit for each loop iteration. At the beginning of the every loop, you are told these rules and are given a laptop with access to the table. This access is magical and until you turn on the laptop, there is no effect on the physical world. The laptop is otherwise just a laptop.

During any iteration, you can decide to exit the time loop and make anything you've done in the current loop permanent.
