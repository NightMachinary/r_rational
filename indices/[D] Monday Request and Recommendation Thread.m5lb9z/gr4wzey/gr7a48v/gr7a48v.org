I didn't like Salvos very much, I thought it leaned way, way too much on the litrpg [brackets], particularly for fights, which made things pretty boring and repetitive. He [kicked] her away, and she threw a [fireball] at him, that kind of thing.

I did like Vigor Mortis, and the two have some similarities. They both have female leads that are earnest, blunt, loyal, selectively violent, and have an atypical personality.

Vigor Mortis isn't an litrpg, just a fantasy. It has detailed, well set up fight set pieces and there's an actual feeling of purpose and danger, rather than just farming [XP] again. Oh, and the world building is pretty impressive, IMO. +Also spoilers+
