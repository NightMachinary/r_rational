I got about halfway through it months ago after I got up to date on Chainsaw Man and got curious about the author's work. To give an innocuous answer, I stopped at the point that Star Wars got mentioned. It was definitely an experience to read it, if nothing else.

Do you think I should go back to it? I have some remaining morbid curiosity if nothing else.
