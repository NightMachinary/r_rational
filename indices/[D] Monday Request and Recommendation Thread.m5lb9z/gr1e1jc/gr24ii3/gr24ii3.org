Maybe non fiction would help, self help is helpful if you're humble enough to consume it. Two things that work very well for me are:

- Being grateful, it sounds cliche and dumb but it just works. It's weird, just add it as a daily task on your checklist and think of a few things you're grateful for. It makes me consistently happier, it works, as silly as it may sound.
- Avoid disdaining things. I'm very judgmental, this helps avoid that. Same thing add it as a daily task on your checklist and do it. To elaborate a bit here's an example. Your internet is slow, most people would call it crap (disdaining it), all you have to do is avoid doing that. It's specially useful if you're like me and other peoples laziness annoys you, there were people that I couldn't stand before I started doing this.
