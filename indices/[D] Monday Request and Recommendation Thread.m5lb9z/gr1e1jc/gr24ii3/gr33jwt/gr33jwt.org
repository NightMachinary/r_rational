I love Ling Qi but she is absolutely not psychologically healthy. She's a walking rolodex of traumas and complexes; she's almost /defined/ by them, even when it comes to the positive actions she takes (befriending people and especially Bai Meizhen). It takes her more than fifty chapters to loosen up enough to even /consider/ having something in her life that isn't directly driving her towards cultivated strength, and she's consistently, utterly, remorselessly devoid of empathy to anyone other than the half-dozen people she's befriended.
