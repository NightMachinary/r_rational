So not really rational nor fiction, but I suspect there's a lot of people here who love Factorio. I just lost my whole week to Dyson Sphere Program, a Factorio like with 98% positive reviews on Steam.

Anyway, the game is great and all but as an indie game developer myself it just completely blew my mind how a team of 4 people made this game in 2 years. It's strong at /everything/, it's ambitious technically challenging, but yet somehow the user experience is amazing too. And these guys made it in 2 years with no prior releases. If ever there was proof of that whole 10x more productive programmers thing, this is it. Like it's probably more like 100x more productive from the baseline.
