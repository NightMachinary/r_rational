Is there another story that slams home the themes of "The Cold Equations" by Tom Godwin without it being a case of disastrously bad engineering and safety protocols? Specifically, that Nature is utterly indifferent to such concerns as morality, justice, fairness, etc., and instead follows strict mathematical laws of cause and effect with no exceptions; that humans create civilization to protect themselves from Nature's indifference, but outside those protections Nature can and will kill indiscriminately; and that even the most sympathetic of people can end up dying tragically for no good reason?

The other good example I can give is from HPMOR chapter 39.

  "All right," Harry said coldly. "I'll answer your original question, then. You asked why Dark Wizards are afraid of death. Pretend, Headmaster, that you really believed in souls. Pretend that anyone could verify the existence of souls at any time, pretend that nobody cried at funerals because they knew their loved ones were still alive. Now can you imagine destroying a soul? Ripping it to shreds so that nothing remains to go on its next great adventure? Can you imagine what a terrible thing that would be, the worst crime that had ever been committed in the history of the universe, which you would do anything to prevent from happening even once? Because that's what Death really is - the annihilation of a soul!"

  The old wizard was staring at him, a sad look in his eyes. "I suppose I do understand now," he said quietly.

  "Oh?" said Harry. "Understand what?"

  "Voldemort," said the old wizard. "I understand him now at last. Because to believe that the world is truly like that, you must believe there is no justice in it, that it is woven of darkness at its core. I asked you why he became a monster, and you could give no reason. And if I could ask him, I suppose, his answer would be: Why not?"

  They stood there gazing into each other's eyes, the old wizard in his robes, and the young boy with the lightning-bolt scar on his forehead.

  "Tell me, Harry," said the old wizard, "will you become a monster?"

  "No," said the boy, an iron certainty in his voice.

  "Why not?" said the old wizard.

  The young boy stood very straight, his chin raised high and proud, and said: "There is no justice in the laws of Nature, Headmaster, no term for fairness in the equations of motion. The universe is neither evil, nor good, it simply does not care. The stars don't care, or the Sun, or the sky. But they don't have to! We care! There is light in the world, and it is us!â€¯"

  "I wonder what will become of you, Harry," said the old wizard. His voice was soft, with a strange wonder and regret in it. "It is enough to make me wish to live just to see it."

  The boy bowed to him with heavy irony, and departed; and the oaken door slammed shut behind him with a thud.
