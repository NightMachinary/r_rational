For books that acknowledge that "Nature is utterly indifferent to such concerns as morality, justice, fairness, etc., and instead follows strict mathematical laws of cause and effect with no exceptions; that humans create civilization to protect themselves from Nature's indifference," I would reccomend the Hogfather; it's not my favorite discworld book, but it is a decent place to start and that's basically it's entire focus. Death in particular ends up commenting on this very topic directly, but it's a running theme for pretty much the entire story despite the fantastical backstop.
