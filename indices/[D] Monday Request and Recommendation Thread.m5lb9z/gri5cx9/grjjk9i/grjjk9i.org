  It's strong at everything, it's ambitious technically challenging, but yet somehow the user experience is amazing too. And these guys made it in 2 years with no prior releases.

It's honestly amazing. There's so much attention to detail, and yet the scale of the game is huge. The trains blew my mind.

Although, fair warning: don't start playing this game if you have, like, anything at all you need to do in your life.
