to clarify a bit there's two classes of stories about outside context problems (OCPs):

- stories where the OCP acts as a McGuffin and other entities are trying to understand / exploit it (e.g Iain M. Banks' /Excession/ (which I believe is where the term originated), Peter Watts' /Blindsight/)
- stories where one of the main characters /is/ an outside context problem, and you get to see them tearing up the world (e.g, Dead Tired).

It sounds like you're mostly looking for the latter, so:

These ones have largely inhuman MCs:

- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/29669/love-crafted][Love Crafted]] - an outside context problem is summoned into a generic fantasy world. It just wants headpats. (by the same author as Dead Tired, btw)
- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/40998/a-friendly-voidling][A friendly voidling]] - an outside context problem is summoned into a very Discworld-esque universe. It just wants friends. It does not have a concept of boundaries - be they physical, emotional, or dimensional. (seems very clearly inspired by the previous story)
- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/40038/eldritch-entity-on-a-journey-of-self-discovery][Eldritch Entity On A Journey Of Self-Discovery]] - a moderately depressed outside context problem essentially just stumbles into a particular reality.

These ones have human MCs who are just very powerful:

- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/23173/the-simulacrum][The Simulacrum]] - an entity crashes into some sort of simulation or something? and the simulation is probably a shounen anime? There's a lot of tropes at least, and the MC doing stuff nobody should be able to do.
- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/35549/prophecy-approved-companion][Prophecy Approved Companion]] - the Hero has arrived! The Hero has glitched out the game! None of the NPCs know how to deal with this!
- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/36065/sylver-seeker][Sylver Seeker]] - one of the better "I was a mage before the system so I know how to do magic for real" stories. The MC ends up being an outside context problem because he can punch way above his apparent level by munchkining real magic.
