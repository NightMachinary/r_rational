Overlord is the "I've been isekai'd as my video game character" trope, except the character is the last remaining member of a former top guild, is himself max level and gratuitously powerful, and he got isekai'd with his guild's base, resources, and npcs intact (who are now all fully sentient). The story is about the main character trying to establish himself in the world and carve out a place for the npcs he sees as his own children (and they happen to have more power than most nearby nations combined at their disposal, even if distributed over a significantly smaller population). That said, the main character is a ball of anxiety and insecurities, who constantly projects a fa√ßade of confidence and genius in order to live up to the expectations his underlings/children have placed in him, so there's quite a bit of comedy from his subordinates being blind to all this, and quite a bit of "the main character is flying by the seat of his pants" when it comes to anything more complex than combat or officeworker-level interpersonal management that pushes the story away from being anything rational.

I've posted about Overlord a few times in previous recommendation threads, I am awful at using Reddit search though. Regardless, here's a brief comment I made last month for further detail:

"Overlord is a good light novel series, but light novels are 100% an acquired taste, and the author of Overlord specifically loves his unusual and detailed perspective changes. For example, book 4 is 80% from the point of view of a kinda locally notable lizardman's journey, as the actual mc of the series sends one of his not-lieutenants to effortlessly conquer all the lizardman tribes. Books 12 and 13 are from the perspective of a paladin's squire, which sounds less engaging than it ends up being (also she is 100% Best Girl from the entire series, fight me)."

Edit: Also the anime adaption really only hits the broad points of the story and anything that isn't directly plot relevant that it cheapens the experience. The first season is reasonable, but the next two go downhill, and the third also has a bunch of terrible cgi animation at critical points.
