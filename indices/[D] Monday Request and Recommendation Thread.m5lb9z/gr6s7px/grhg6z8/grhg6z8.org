You might like [[https://www.sbnation.com/a/17776-football][17776: What Football will look like in the future]]. Discovering what the story is about is part of the mystery and the charm, but here's some spoilers as to why it could be relevant: Tl;DR is that for some reason people don't get hurt or die anymore, but they also can't reproduce. The year is 17776, and people have basically given up on trying to solve that mystery. Or even solving /other/ mysteries. Space exploration is dead, even though people now actually live long enough to get to other star systems within their lifespan, because... what's there to do, out there? The only place where you can have meaningful interactions is on Earth.
