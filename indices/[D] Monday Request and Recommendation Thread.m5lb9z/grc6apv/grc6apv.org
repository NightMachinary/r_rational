Someone asked for recommendations over on the PGTE subreddit earlier today and I lost track of time and accidentally wrote 1000 words on a response, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/PracticalGuideToEvil/comments/m7a3jl/web_novels_of_similar_quality_to_guide_but/grc5gbp/][here's a link to the comment]] since its got brief descriptions of 9 different works I think reasonably worthwhile, even if they've generally cropped up in past recommendation threads over the months (and I think I did a similar response in one of these threads a few months back but couldn't find it when I looked the other week since I hate using Reddit search. I need to start saving these comments so I don't rewrite them from scratch every few months)
