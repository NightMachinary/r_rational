I'm looking for two kinds of recs:

I. *Popcorn-y base-building stories where the main character has almost complete control over their environment*.

The best bet is, obviously, Dungeon Core stories, but I feel like I've read all the good ones. Something like a god creating a world/part of a world would also be great. What I'm /not/ looking for is a normal human building a base. That's /not/ "almost complete control over their environment."

Some things I've read: /A Lonely Dungeon/ (pretty nice), /Post Human/ (was ok, but I dropped it after the introduction of the android characters or something similar), /Blue Core/ (sorry, explicit sexual content bores me, and so far only the Erogamer was an exception), /Dungeon I/O/ (couldn't get past the first few chapters due to bad prose), /Dungeon Heart/ (I remember literally nothing about it, but I found it ok while reading), /The Breath of Creation/ (liked it), /Obsidian Core/ (alright so far, though lacks interesting ideas).

II. *A non-human/human romance with intelligent characters*.

The non-human character must be /distinctly/ non-human, especially physically. Basically, if they are humanoid, it's not what I'm looking for. And the human character should be intelligent (and it would be nice, but optional, if the non-human character was like that too). The more rational the story is, the better---but at this point I'm not picky because I've never found even one example of what I'm looking for here.

Thanks in advance!
