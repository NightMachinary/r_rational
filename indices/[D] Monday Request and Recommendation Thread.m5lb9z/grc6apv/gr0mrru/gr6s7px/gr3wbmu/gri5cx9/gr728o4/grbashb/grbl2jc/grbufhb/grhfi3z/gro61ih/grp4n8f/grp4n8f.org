Nothing similar I'm afraid. Currently I have been reading [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/onizuku-my-hero-academia-au.915180/][Onizuku]], a currently very short (13k words) story where the japanese youkai exist and only few know of their existence, with families of exorcists being traditionally their hunters and protectors of humanity. Izuku is a half oni, a man eating demon, and because of this, a very different person. The rest of the world is pretty much the same than in canon, with some of Izuku's classmates being youkai's themselves. Admittedly very short, but with lots of potential.

Going away from bnha, and hoping that you share my taste in other ways, two of the fics that I have been loving the most are [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15406896/chapters/35757684][Hear the Silence]] and [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26675/a-journey-of-black-and-red][A Journey of Black and Red]].

The first one is a Naruto SI, interested in exploring trauma, society biases and character relationships. Currently in hiatus, 700k words, and very slow paced.

A Journey of Black and Red updates weekly in Royal road and is an original novel about vampires in the 1800s. The MC is converted into a vampire against her will, and the beginning is kinda dark, though it lightens considerably. The story has an incredible sense of humor, hates Twilight vampires and has the MC struggle to become the master of her own fate.

Finally, the author [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/members/shadenight123.1556/][Shadenight123]] is a somewhat guilty pleasure of mine. His first stories are very edgy, and he usually written Self Inserts. Having said that, he writes a lot, and I love pretty much anything he writes. However, is not for everyone, and the MC of his stories is often very similar. I would recommend starting with his [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/a-heart-of-ice-and-coffee-rwby-si.54448/][RWBY]] or [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/the-shadenight123-corner-hugs-need-not-apply.15425/page-359#post-17132720][Avatar]] stories to see what he is about, the first having different "routes", with a very different feel between each route.
