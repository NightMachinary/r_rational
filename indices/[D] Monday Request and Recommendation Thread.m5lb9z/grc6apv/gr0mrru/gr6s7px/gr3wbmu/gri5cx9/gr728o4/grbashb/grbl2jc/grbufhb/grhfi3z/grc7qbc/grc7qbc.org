I asked this and posted a bunch of my own recs 3 weeks ago, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/lpq207/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/gog4ryk/][here.]] Since then I've got back on to Slouching Towards Nirvana, and have nearly finished [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16340741/chapters/38231207][A Study of Firsts]] over the past two days, which is worth a tentative rec. That said, its all minor character interactions and fluff from the class of 1A adapting to sharing a dorm together, and kinda trends more towards semi-crackfic over time (which tbh is kinda fair given how little attention canon gives a bunch of kids spending time with one another is going to get them to change and grow together, when they have such grand aspirations as heroes especially, and how getting up to shenanigans seems inevitable given both the stressors and skills they all have, even if the fic lays it on a bit thick). If nothing else, props to the author having a chapter where everyone deals with dietary requirements and health concerns from quirks, but your mileage may vary and all.

(Also I've technically been hashing out a bunch of stuff for a BNHA fic I'm planning myself these past few weeks since I regularly spend time I should be trying to fall asleep doing worldbuilding stuff on my phone's notes app and figured I should actually stick to a project and make something with from my habit. Also I figure fanfic will be good training wheels with established canon as a framework and an already existing readerbase so I don't feel like I'm shouting into an empty void when I start putting stuff out. Anyway I've had to split my notes into half a dozen different docs because of app word limits even if I'm sticking only to brief dotpoints because I hate typing on mobile. So yeah, watch this space)
