I'm looking for recommendations primarily exploring large scale trans-singularity superintelligent AI interacting with humanity (and not just in a "kill all humans" fashion).

Good examples of relevant titles I've already read:

- "The World As It Appears To Be" by Benedict_SC

- "Branches on the tree of time", "The last christmas" and "A bluer shade of white" by alexanderwales

- "Friendship is Optimal" by Iceman

- "The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect" by Roger Williams

Any suggestions?
