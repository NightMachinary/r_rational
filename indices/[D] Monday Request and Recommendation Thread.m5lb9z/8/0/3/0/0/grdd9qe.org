Thank you very much for the kind words, and also deep thanks to [[/u/plutonicHumanoid]] for posting this recommendation. It is very gratifying that someone out there enjoyed my story-- it's kind of my love letter to [[/r/rational]]. [[/u/jiffyjuff]]'s comment was enough to make me blush.

It's my first (and so far only) novel-length work, but OCTO draws influence from works like /Crystal Society/ and the /Antimemetics/ series and /Cordyceps: Too Clever For Their Own Good/ and too many other fantastic works to name. I wanted there to be an entry in the rational Lovecraftian/Gigerian kaiju xenofiction space, so I gave it my best shot.
