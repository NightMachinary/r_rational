I'm currently reading [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/dead-tired.894343/][Dead Tired]], a fic where the main character is absolutely OP. Nothing is a match for him, not even the gods.

And still it manages to be an interesting story, with how Harold is just curious about the world and how you get to discover it with him on his travels. A very good cast of secondary characters and great writing are a bonus, too.

I'm looking for something similar, since the story is a work in progress and i've reached the end of it, and sinc ethe second book is turning into crack fic, and not scratching that particular itch anymore.

I've seen Dead tired called an OCP story in the comments, so went looking for those. So far none managed to have an interesting protagonist in an interesting setting.

Any suggestions?
