  *McGuffin*. A term devised by Alfred Hitchcock, who describes it at considerable length in François Truffaut's /Le Cinéma Selon Hitchcock/ (1966; trans Helen G Scott as /Hitchcock/ 1967), as an object whose loss -- or rumours of whose existence -- triggers the cast of a thriller or detective film into searching for it, or fighting for it, or running from it, but which has in fact little or no intrinsic meaning once the dust has settled. For Hitchcock, the best McGuffin is the one most empty of content, "the most nonexistent, and the most absurd."
