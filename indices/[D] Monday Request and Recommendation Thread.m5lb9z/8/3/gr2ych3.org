Thanks for the rec! The dry wit reminds me of Douglas Adams at the moment.

"A long distance teleportation done poorly can mean that the mage will appear in mid-air sideways, moving at great speeds, and with his lungs trying valiantly to exit from his mouth.

Oh, and of course one would usually rather not appear buried in stone or halfway into something. You don't often hear from those mages though."
