Does anyone have recommendations for Twilight fanfiction in the vein of Alicorn's [[https://luminous.elcenia.com/][Luminosity]]/Radiance? Or in general, recs for fanfics that take schlocky or underexamined settings seriously? No Naruto/HP recs though; I'm rather burnt out on those fandoms.

And while I'm here, let me drop a few recs.

[[https://mangadex.org/title/57650/bibliomania][BIBLIOMANIA]]: Manga. Short, complete manga with gorgeous art, esoteric themes, and a plot that's utterly impossible for me to explain. Feels like reading a fever dream.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/historical-complete-schwarz-rot-gold-a-german-civil-war-quest.916378/#post-73828720][Schwarz-Rot-Gold]] : Quest. Navigate post-WW1 Wiemar Republic Germany through a 3-way civil war. Well researched historical (alternate-universe) fiction.

[[https://mangadex.org/title/36329/useless-ponko][Useless Ponko]] : Manga. An old man receives a maid robot as a posthumous gift from his departed wife. Cute, funny, and occasionally philosophical.

[[https://mangadex.org/title/48577/my-father-became-a-cute-vtuber-girl][My Father Became a Cute VTuber Girl]] : Manga. The Main Character discovers the VTuber he simps for is actually his father.

[[https://mangadex.org/title/43521/dog-nigga][Dog Nigga]] : Manga (Western) . I don't know /what/ the */fuck/* is going on here. Good shit though.

[[https://mangadex.org/title/40472/tearmoon-empire-story][Tearmoon Empire Story]] : Manga. Clueless princess gets sent back in time after her execution. Spends her time trying to avoid getting Robespierre'd. Think 'Otome Game Villain' but without the isekai.

[[https://ww6.readmha.com/manga/vigilante-boku-no-hero-academia-illegals/][Vigilante: Boku no Hero Academia Illegals]] : Manga. Spinoff (Side story? Semiprequel?) to the main My Hero Academia manga. Features older, more mature characters and a closer view at the 'street level' of heroism.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/trust-once-lost-mlp-tg-tf-si.797022/#post-62113947][Trust Once Lost]]: MLP:FiM fanfiction. HiE fanfic where the MC is stuck as a foal and has to work through some deep-seated trauma. Non-mlp fans probably won't care for it, but I know there are at least a few bronies on here.
