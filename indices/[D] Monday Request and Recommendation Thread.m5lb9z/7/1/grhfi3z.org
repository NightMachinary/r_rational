The bnha fanfic I'm looking forward the most to is [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13488656/1/A-Precise-Note][A Precise Note]], by Sir Lucifer Morningstar. As you may deduce, the author is the edgiest writer you have ever seen, and his other stories are really dark.

Having said that disclaimer, I find the story fantastic. It has 100k words and updates slowly, but in that time it has touched many rational themes, in a world slightly darker (or maybe just more coherent) than in bnha canon. Izuku gets an OP quirk and is transformed by it very quickly. Different type of ethical problems, and what should you do with overwhelming power to better society is also discussed. The more powerful quirks of canon are made stronger, with Nezu being pretty much a precog and AFO being the overwhelmingly powerful he is supposed to be.

Having said that, if you prefer something more vanilla, [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-heroic-chronicles-of-a-young-man-youjo-senki-my-hero-academia.875316/][The heroic chronicles of a young man]] is a kinda crossover with Youjo Senki, with the main character being based on the male salaryman that would become Tanya, with a quirk that lets him fight somewhat similar to her. The MC brings a very different perspective to heroics, and carries the misunderstandings of Youjo Senki. Updates frequently and it's in my top 3.

For more crossovers there's [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/my-hero-school-adventure-is-all-wrong-as-expected-bnha-x-oregairu.697066/][My hero school adventure is all wrong as expected]], a crossover with oregairu that has already been recommended here. As the other two, very recommended. Updates slowly, long chapters.

Finally, there's [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/dragonspawn-my-hero-academia-si.696280/][Dragonspawn]] , a SI where the main character's quirk is being a dragon. Updates semi frequently.

If you like the recommendations written here, feel free to ask for more or share others you have liked. My preferences are in AU with new characters or different perspectives than in canon. Would also love to see another fic with a darker world than in canon, and with more powerful quirks.
