Does it have to be a singleton AI? If not, then

Accelerando by Charles Stross covers transition from roughly present time past singularity where economy (&, well, everything) is overtaken by post human AIs. Through it might not fit the criteria for 'interacting with humanity' all that well.

There's a more fitting book which is kind-of similar, unfortunately not in English; "Perfect Imperfection" by Dukaj. There is a description of some interesting concepts [[http://www.terminally-incoherent.com/blog/2011/07/08/perfect-imperfection-perfekcyjna-niedoskonalosc-by-jacek-dukaj/][here]] and on the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_Imperfection][wiki]]

Particularly relevant to the question

  Dukaj envisions a future in which standard baseline humans can peacefully co-exist with god-like AI constructs. How? Civilization. In Dukaj's universe civilization is actually a concise term that describes a community of sentient beings voluntarily choosing to abide by an arbitrary set of laws, rules and regulations. The HS civilization is built as a stratified society in which those who choose to be un-augmented are protected from those superior to them. The authority lies with an inclusion known as “The Emperor” who controls all the plateau resources and all nano-clouds within the bounds of the civilization. If you want to store your data on HS Plateau or manifest yourself in the physical form somewhere in HS space, you simply lease resources or nano from the Emperor, who can swiftly rescind them if you break the law. Of course if you are a super bright post-human or AI who thinks that baseline Stahs is scum of the earth to be squashed, you can simply leave HS Civilization and apply for residence in another one

Through it's slightly misleading at the end because it talks about post-humans only; "human" can't really 'upgrade' on their own. While they live in a seemingly post-scarcity world where they can just request, IDK, an ice cream and it's created out of thin air, they don't actually own any scarce resources (computing power and so on) & have no way to earn them if they wanted.

Except for the rich ones that often are more wealthy than post-humans but stay human (through usually with backups and such) - which is also pretty interesting.

Sadly it probably won't be translated nor continued (it's a first part of a supposed trilogy, but the book is from 2004). Writing style itself is peculiar; author invents new grammatical constructs on top of the actual language - IDK how it'd be translated.

Maybe when machine translation gets a /little/ better it'll be feasible to translate it 'unprofessionally'.
