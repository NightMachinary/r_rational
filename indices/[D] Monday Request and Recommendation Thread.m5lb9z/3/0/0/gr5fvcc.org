Checked out the first two chapters of "No Epic Loot Here, Only Puns." I don't like the prose so far, but the story itself seems somewhat interesting. I'll check it out in full a bit later, thank you!

As for "I Woke Up As A Dungeon, Now What," well, I haven't read Worm. Would it still be alright? (Both in a sense that I would understand what's going on and in a sense that I wouldn't catch any spoilers.)

Thanks!
