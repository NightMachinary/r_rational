I. I was recommended [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/37231/a-lonely-dungeon][A Lonely Dungeon]] here a week or two back, and that was fun even if it's not a completely typical dungeon core fic. I remember enjoying Evil God Average as well, but it wasn't rational by any means and it's been a while since I read it so take that rec with a bit more of a grain of salt.

II. Inhuman, intelligent, rational. The closest thing i can think of to that is [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/dragon-harem-quest-or-saying-you-were-gay-wasnt-the-conversation-ender-you-hoped-for.47186/][Dragon Harem Quest - Or: Saying You Were Gay Wasn't The Conversation-Ender You Hoped For]], which I found myself enjoying after repeated reccomendations overcame the aversiveness from the title. You might enjoy [[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/blood-thirsty-dungeon-keeper-in-space.12569/][Blood Thirsty]]? That's the only other thing i currently recall enjoying that I think has a decent chance of being what you're looking for.
