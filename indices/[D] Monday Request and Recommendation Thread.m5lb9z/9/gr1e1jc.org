I'd appreciate recommendations of written (web)novels with a protagonist that a therapist would label '*psychologically healthy*', or that centrally features the gradual development of such traits.

In more detail, the protagonist could be someone who is (or develops into) an independent, psychologically-healthy individual with appropriate self-esteem. Able to set boundaries while still coming across as caring. Someone who believes in their own worth, is unfazed by others' judgements, isn't caught up in a judging view of the universe, doesn't worry about seeming intelligent or competent because they're not insecure about those things.

The opposite of me, basically.

An example is [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/31429/cinnamon-bun][Cinnamon Bun]]. Another okay fit is the MC from [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/39408/beware-of-chicken][Beware of Chicken]] who doesn't feel any need to participate in the whole cultivation thing and just goes out to make friends. He's a bit of a Gary Stu, though. An in-between of Blue and Red from [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9794740/89/Pokemon-The-Origin-of-Species][PTOOS]] fits, but neither one alone; Blue's confident but judging, Red's underconfident but accepting. A counter-example is Zorian in most of [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning][Mother of Learning]], though he does grow out of it so maybe it's just a good example in the end. The best counter-example is probably HPJEV from [[http://www.hpmor.com/chapter/1][HPMOR]].

(I know it's not a very [[/r/rational]] request. It's perhaps the opposite of what I think many people here like. I tend to like my protagonists clever more than loving. Trying to widen my horizons a bit. Hey, it's worth a try.)
