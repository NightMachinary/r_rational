I just finished [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11324722-the-righteous-mind][The Righteous Mind,]] and it's pretty good. The author attempts to make people on different parts of the political spectrum understand each other better, by looking at how their views on morality differ.

​

The book is basically a study on what morality is. People here would like it. There are a lot of interesting tidbits, and should help people have a better understanding of reality.

​

edit* Since I'm recommending non fiction here are a couple more:

- [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37880811-make-time][Make Time,]] should help aspiring writers and artists with busy lives.
- [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18290401-show-your-work][Show your Work,]] good for people that might be shy or uncomfortable with sharing their creations.
