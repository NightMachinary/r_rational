It's not just 'person' though. There is no determinism here. You aren't guaranteed the same kind of life, the same location, the same gender or sex even. There is no stable genetics here.

You likely have 12 completely and utterly different lives. It's arguable that it is even 'you' in the 11 in the middle. Yes, they will be enjoyable, but the 'you' that lives that life dies at the end. Then all 12 of them are reborn at once.

12 lifetimes absorbed in a second. 12 /completely different/ lives, with the terrifying realization that in each one /one of the most important people in the universe to you ceases to exist./ The horror of that realization alone as you relive 12 lives in a moment makes me shudder.

I cannot see any situation in which the 13th person lives a sane life, without some incredible therapy. All those 12 lives have done at the end is create a broken person, who in the *best case scenario*, is merely an empty shell remembering past happiness which they can never regain.

Ugh. I'm shivering just thinking about it.

Until the 13th life, you don't even remember making the deal for nakama. That's only in the first one.
