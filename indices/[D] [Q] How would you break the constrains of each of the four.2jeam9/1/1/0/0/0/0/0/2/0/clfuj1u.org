There is a baby. With 12 separate memories/personalities of 12 old men/women who had fulfilled lives. I can't even imagine how growing up like such a person would be. Happy or no, sanity seems completely out of question. And the fact that you will have another lifetime before you missing 78 different people who may or may not have similarities between them, 12 of which were lovers and soulmates of those 12 old men/women, who you remember perfectly while finding nothing really similar in your current life doesn't seem very cheerful to me.
