Yeah, I'm still unconvinced and I think in the end we'll end up needing to agree to disagree. The 'you that lives that life dies at the end' is just rhetoric about what 'does it means to be you and not another'. Not fighting the hypothetical, you lose your memories but go on to live another happy life minus one person you don't remember - when the vast majority of people in the world just die.

Even if the 13th life was as absurdly bad as you say, it'd still be preceded by 12 awesome lives. That for each life "one of the most important people in the universe to you ceases to exist" is hardly worse in /retrospect/ than having all 12 of the most important people in the universe to you cease to exist already in the first life.

  Until the 13th life, you don't even remember making the deal for nakama. That's only in the first one.

Unless I'm missing something, I don't see the text mention any deal to be remembered in either the 1st or the 13th life.
