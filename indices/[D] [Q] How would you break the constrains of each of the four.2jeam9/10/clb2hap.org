For "The Fisher King" and "The Road Eternal" I would defer to Baba Yaga's solution (the Fisher King variant was used in "Howl's Moving Castle").

The Nakama scenario is tougher, as you do not know that you are in it until it is too late to do anything about it. I don't think it can be "beaten" in this way.

For the Dominion scenario the best way to beat the primary constraint is to master psychology and sociology with their attendant sub-disciplines /first/, then use those skills to subvert the enmity of your rivals. Practice the art of "ruling by not ruling".
