I guess I would have to go with fisher king. It is the only one I could use to shelter people from the heat death of the universe if it isn't avoidable. Of course...then I immediately become the target of any AIs left standing at the end of the universe who want my energy to sustain their function... eek. It might lead to a living hell for me but I'd have to go for it. (I have this terrible image of starting a singularity, only to see the AI get smacked down by a paperclipper who had a 2 million year headstart. It would then infiltrate my home with nanobots an eyeblink after winning the war and keep me captive for eternity to fuel its paperclip empire. It wouldn't let me die or do anything that could jeopardize me because why take the risk)

On the other hand if heat death is inevitable, the other potential outcome if I didn't create the fisher king house is utter obliteration of everything on heat death. I would take the risk if it gave a chance to shield whatever future evolution of humanity results from that. Forget AI, the heat death is the ultimate Xrisk from what I see now.
