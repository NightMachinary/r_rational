I think I can break Nakama in such a way that it becomes the most appealing of all the choices.

Let's assume at some point during one of your lives you figure out how your luck works. You know that the luck will always cause the most desirable outcome upon whatever you try to do. Obviously, you go into nano-engineering or bio-engineering. By tasking yourself with small goals such as "discover a cure to aging" and "cure all illnesses using one airborn virus as a vector", you can force your luck to give you the inspirations you need to make you succeed at finding what you seek. At which point you stop aging and can effectively become near immortal.

Using your new found hyper-wealth (a term you'd invent for yourself of course), you could set loftier goals like "How do I make my mars-colonization company successful?". You can use this method to find solutions to effectively any problem that is facing you, if you frame your situation in such a way that your luck is forced to intervene.

At which point you stop dying, because you have the cure to aging and illness and probably some way to back up your consciousness in a digital format. Cycle broken, world saved, humanity facing no major threats that you cannot resolve in a positive way.
