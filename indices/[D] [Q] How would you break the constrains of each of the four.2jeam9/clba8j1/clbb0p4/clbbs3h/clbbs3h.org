Ah, but an "ordinary, everyday life" is entirely subjective. To most people throughout human history, an "ordinary, everyday life" was nomadic hunter-gathering, which I don't think is the sort of life that's implied by the text. To me, it implies that the power works for things that seem ordinary and everyday to the individual in question, even if they're historically very unusual.

So, what you have to do is make yourself subjectively feel that curing aging or building a martian colony is "ordinary" and "everyday". Difficult, but given how thoroughly human beings can be brainwashed and manipulated, not outside the realm of possibility. Have your twelve legendary friends completely insulate you from the real world, and create for you a artificial life where solving impossible problems seems like the most ordinary possible course of events. It would seem unusual at first, but once you became accustomed to that life, and given constant social reinforcement, a life of curing aging or founding Mars colonies could become completely ordinary to you.
