The Road Eternal could be quite useful for deep sea exploration/extreme monetary profit. Take a boat to the middle of the ocean, and the backpack will generate scuba gear.

Take the scuba gear down to their max depth just as the backpack's timer resets and it'll obviously have to make you a larger and better set of scuba gear that you could don over your current scuba gear (because gear that you'd have to get out of the water to put on would not be appropriate). Continue down to the new max depth of your diving gear.

Repeat the above process until you become the scuba-diving equivalent to the [[http://www.naylornetwork.com/naf-nwl/assets/michelin-man.jpg][Michelin Man]]. And eventually you'll reach the ocean floor. Once you're down there, have someone drop you deep sea drilling equipment so you can prospect for oil. Which becomes extremely profitable very quickly as deep sea prospecting is extremely difficult to do remotely due to the pressures involved on sensitive electronics. Which you can ignore because the backpack will create magic scuba gear that can withstand the depth.

I think the Fisher King is the most easily broken. But the Road Eternal would be a good secondary choice. Eternal youth coupled with near-immortality is appealing, though not as appealing as the true immortality of Fisher King.
