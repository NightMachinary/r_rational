The Fisher King scenario looks to be the most gameable with the fewest downsides. I can copy any technology that exists and I can locally /break physics/?

After that, I'd go for the Dominion scenario and just quit. Nothing here says that I /have/ to use my natural leadership powers. If I'm not actually ruling the world, then my nemeses are a nonissue and nothing stops me from having good friends. And anyway, being a fast learner with a magical respect geass does not mean I'm actually qualified to rule the world; Screw destiny, the actual elected officials can deal with the turbulent times ahead! I may do some minor lobbying, but I'd mostly be fine with just enjoying my free immortality and getting things done in areas I actually care about, IE, not politics.

Actually the Nakama scenario might be perfect too... It doesn't offer true magical immortality like the rest, but thirteen long lifetimes is plenty of time to solve the problem of death through mundane means. Especially with an ultra-lucky team working on it with perfect group chemistry.

The Road Eternal would be annoying for a few centuries or millennia. But sooner or later the world I'm in will develop cheap private space travel, or I'll hop into a world that has, and then I can rent a ship on my "ordinary travel expenses" fund. Living out of a car generally isn't "settling down", so living out of a spaceship shouldn't be either. Does a stable orbit count as settling down? Its still "moving onward" pretty fast, albeit on a predictable course. Even if I can't stay in an orbit for a month, I can get really comfortable in a good vehicle. Especially once I can get some proper cyberpunk upgrades or upload my mind or something.
