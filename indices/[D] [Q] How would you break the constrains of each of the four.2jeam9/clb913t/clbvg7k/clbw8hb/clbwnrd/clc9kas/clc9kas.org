I think even the most hardcore introverts would go irretrievably insane in short order. Everyone you interact with is either acting programmatically as you specified, so they're effectively just you, or effectively insane (non-lucid dreamers).

I think that unless you can munchkin it (and I can't think of how), it's Hell.
