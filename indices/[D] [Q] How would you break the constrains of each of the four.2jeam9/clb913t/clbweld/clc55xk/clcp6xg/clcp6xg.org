Except it explicitly cannot let you prevent death. That's in the prompt, you can't stop aging or 'eventual death'.

Now, if that only refers to the magical healing powers, that's fine, but if it applies to the wisdom as well, then you don't actually have perfect sight. There is a testable blind spot there.

Since you have the reincarnation-as-long-as-you-remian-altruistic part, you're probably functionally immortal, but not being able to prevent others from slowly degenerating is a bit crappy. I'm not sure how that would apply to age-based diseases, you're certainly not going to be able to keep everyone in the world healthy through a power that requires touch.

It seems like the healing power is tangential to the real power, which is the Wisdom score. It would really be called "Sage" instead of "Healer".
