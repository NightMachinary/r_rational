The healer's ability is ultimate power. Mistakes harm people -- if in no other way, they waste someone's time, which is a precious commodity. Therefore, you will never make a mistake at anything that is ruled by choice. Presumably you can still drop a ball while juggling, because you may not be physically able to perform the "right" throw / catch, but in matters of research or computer programming you'll be flawless.

So, yes. All problems solved forever and always.
