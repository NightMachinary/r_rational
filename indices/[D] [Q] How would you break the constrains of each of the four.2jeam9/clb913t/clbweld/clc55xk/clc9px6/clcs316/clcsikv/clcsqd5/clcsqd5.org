Maybe if you could properly take the time to frame the action and know about the nature of the choice, it would work. But that seems to require an information threshold to be met, as the power isn't otherwise informational in nature.

So if there were two people, and both of them knew about the situation but they disagree about what it means (or how likely something is), the information is there. If the wrong choice beats the "harm" limit, whatever that is, you would believe the one telling you to do the "right thing", because that information was out there somewhere in the interaction.

But if you try to figure out if a door is trapped before opening it, it doesn't help, because you have no way to get at that information from where you are. If you got to ask even a single useful question of someone who /did/ know, even if they lied, however...
