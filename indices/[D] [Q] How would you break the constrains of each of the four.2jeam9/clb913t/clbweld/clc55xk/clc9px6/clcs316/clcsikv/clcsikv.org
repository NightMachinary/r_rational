I do think that actively-maintained physical immortality and fixing mental illnesses are reasonable extrapolations that you can get from the Healer's healing, and permanent, maintenance-free physical immortality is also pretty reasonable. But claiming that it can fix all possibility of making mistakes by expanding the definition of harm to unreasonably broad levels, not so much.
