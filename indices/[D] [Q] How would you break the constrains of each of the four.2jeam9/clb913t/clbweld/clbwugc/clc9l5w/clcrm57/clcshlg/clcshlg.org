  Including simulations of people real enough to trick my chimp instincts into believing I'm not alone and without a tribe. And I can still interact with people in their own dreams.

You /specifically/ can't get this. And by extension, I'm pretty sure you can't get anything you aren't capable of specifying; you get "anything you can think of", but you have to think of every particular; anything unspecified either goes unnoticed or is incomplete (this is how dreams work, after all).

#+begin_quote
  I think most people I interact with now are effectively asleep and insane. So, nothing has changed. Except, I'm not immortal and possessed of anything I can imagine right now.
#+end_quote

If you think people seem as stupid and crazy now as they would be if you met them in dreams, you either don't remember your dreams ever, haven't unlucidly dreamed in a very long time, or totally lack imagination.

#+begin_quote
  And anything I can imagine is in there. Like, the complete C++ code to a Friendly AI software program that I can give some programmer who's dreaming.
#+end_quote

You're missing the operative words: "everything ever thought or imagined is in there *somewhere*." You still have to find it, and there's no indication that's going to be easy or be doable in any reasonable timeframe.

#+begin_quote
  And injecting people back into the "real world" isn't said to be impossible, just that "I am not capable" of doing it. Not that it cannot be done.
#+end_quote

You're splitting hairs; by any reasonable interpretation of the description, it's strongly implying that it can't be done.

In short, you're almost deliberately misreading the description of Escape in an incredibly optimistic way. It's like the difference between messing with the D&D rules to make the grapple-ball-of-speed (not working as intended, but very clearly within the rules as specified) vs. the Locate City Bomb (which requires lawyering a circle to be a cylinder of infinitesimal height and chaining several poorly-worded feats that neglected to fully specify the conditions for their use). You're trying to make the Locate City Bomb with Escape when everyone else's suggestions for effective use of the various paths are limiting themselves to grapple-ball-style inferences.

For a specific comparison from elsewhere in the comment thread, someone claimed you could suddenly make an antimatter golem appear inside the Fisher King house, and someone else pointed out that the description heavily implied you had to create the golems from material within the house, and so unless you could safely harness a golem's worth of antimatter that wouldn't be possible. You're going way beyond that.
