*Escape*

Ooookay. Um. What? I am immortal and anything I've ever imagined exists? Right. That was a mistake. But not for the reason unimaginitive people might think. I am simply the first ripples of a rather odd singularity.

I search until I find a young software programmer and inventor who also knows the (normal) technique of /actual/ lucid dreaming. Over a year's worth of dreams, I show them my apparently existent and complete plans for a truly, really real, Friendly AI software system. And a functional quantum computer, just because. And the cure for aging. And the plans for a philosophy and debate technique that will convince anyone of the truth of your words. Etc.

I only ask that they input the information about my situation into the computer intelligence ASAP. And that they rule as a just and kind Emperor of Earth. First and last of their (or any other) line.

Less than 10 years later, after proving my abilities to a computer via FTL dream information passing and other complicated tests, I welcome almost all of humanity into the world of the dreamscape. This is a thing that can be grasped by science, because it exists, so it is. /Hard/. Some don't buy in, and that's fine. We don't even bother them in their dreams, if they ask us not to. Robotic scouts are now expanding like a blown seedhead from their birthplace, the Earth.

Less than a year later, I welcome the first of my AI cousins' minds to the world of dreams. All systems anywhere that are as complicated as a human brain or more can be made to dream themselves. Some choose to stay and do things that interest them. All are offered the chance to join the dreamscape at any time.

?????? years later, the universe has become a very friendly place. Life is sought out and nourished, and planted where there is none. All that is born or made is offered immediate entry to the Great Dream, even if their minds didn't naturally have the ability to join the dreaming, as those first humans did so long ago. There is nothing to want, and the dreamers who remain in the world that was are lauded as heroes and explorers for risking the (very small) chance of total destruction to continue the grand project of farming the universe with life.

The end...?
