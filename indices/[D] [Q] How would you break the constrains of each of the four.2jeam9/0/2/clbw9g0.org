"you become incredibly proficient in all forms of modern weaponry"

Heh.

Hehehehe.

BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!

Ahem. Yes. Please and thank you.

Perception includes reading speed, right? Ahhhh, do these abilities go up after I've micro-nuked all the monsters, seconds after I detect them with the unified military and economic power of the entire world? Which, of course, I need to fulfill my role to hunt monsters.

Of course, the FUCKING SECOND I figure out the power escalation, I start having OTHER PEOPLE kill the monsters for me after I've disabled them with tactical laser strikes from orbital satellites. /Modern/ satellites, that I ordered a crash program to make. Because I needed them to fulfill my role to hunt monsters. Anyway, right. I stop actually killing monsters so they don't get into some sort of absurd Dragon Ball Z power curve of doom.

Sooo, the apprentice doesn't power up the monsters, or power up themselves? Fine. I give /them/ the laser orbital death satellites. Sigh.

I just keep things running from my isolated, armored, +underground+ floating (might be worms, 'natch) desert base in the middle of Africa. So that I can fulfill my role to hunt monsters. And where monsters will have to attack me over hundreds of KM of totally empty land. Which is covered in glassed sand. The flying ones should be even easier to kill, as they'll have to be able to fly in the first place.

I've got a lot of reading to do, and my apprentice has a lot of monsters to kill in exchange for whatever they want from the entire world's economic ability to provide them. I am a good employer, obviously, and they will want for nothing. Still, the roof my of house is very, very shiny.

Oh. And I need a human-immortality medical Manhattan project, and economic logistics reorganization projects to prevent deaths from hunger and disease. And everyone at war has to stop, right now. All the authorities in charge of all of this will recognize that they have to do this.

You know. So I can fulfil my role to hunt monsters.
