Awesome. Let's see what I can do with them.

- The Road Eternal - There's no restriction on /revisiting/ places that I can see, so you can still have a home. Or several that you cycle between. That gets you reasonably convenient immortality. The gear's not so easy to exploit, can't think of much I can get out of those. The world-swapping may or may not be good depending on whether you can choose historical details of the worlds you travel to, but even if you can't you might be able to become a super-awesome "author" or "inventor" by bringing along a digital edition of The Complete Works of Everyone to the new world.

- The Fisher King - This one's pretty awesome already, not sure it really needs exploiting. Existing buildings are big enough that the building you create ought to be big enough for almost anything. And there's no limit on the number of golems you create, just their lifespan outside the house, so you've got a magical army at your command. Use that to earn a ton of money and invest in telepresence technology and those golems can be your proxies. If you can risk holding on to the seed long enough without planting it, maybe see if you can get into orbit and plant the seed there - the result could essentially be your own personal starship, depending on how the "core cannot be moved" restriction works. Maybe plant it on a tiny asteroid small enough for your house's thrusters to shove around, if a natural foundation is required. Hope that someday soon a space elevator will be constructed, after which your house can be made bigger than planet sized if you really want.

- Nakama - This one's pretty lame, it's the only one that has a hard limit on total lifespan and doesn't give much in the way of benefits or powers. There's one trick I can see that could be awesome, though, if you can pull it off: ""Friends who fall out of the cycle in this way move on to whatever you believe happens naturally after death." Using the right self-brainwashing, you can /create the afterlife in whatever form you choose/. It doesn't say you yourself get to go there, so you'll have to build a back door in to whatever you set up for your friends (maybe some cutesy thing about how heaven isn't heaven if your friends aren't all there, allowing them to drag you up with them when they die).

- Dominion - this one's pretty good out of the box too. Those twelve enemies don't have your "rulership" power so they're not likely to be much of a threat, and they can't permanently defeat you even if they do manage to get the upper hand on you. Once I've identified who they are I can have my people work on neutralizing them long-term. Delegation will be key to making this fun - it still counts as "effective rulership" if you delegate well, and it gives you free time for hobbies.

- Hunter - Not so awesome. Best approach I can think of is to take the "proficiency with modern weapons" option and then rely on things like drones, sniper weapons, long-range missiles, and so forth to take out the monsters safely. Your apprentice serves as an expendable layer between you and the monsters too, since he's replaceable. Oh, do biological weapons count as "modern weapons"? See if I can come up with a monster-plague that kills them off as they appear, my battleground will be the biology lab thousands of miles from where the monster physically appears.

- Healer - pretty good, since I'd want to be compassionate with powers like this anyway. The "influence emotions" thing suggests a career in politics might be relatively easy, and can be be sold to the reincarnation-bot as being a way to help people by ruling them well.

- Escape - This one is perhaps the best one here, you become pretty godlike right out of the box. The main limitation is that there are few "lucid dreamers" to interact with. But there will be some, so you won't get lonely right off the bat. You'll be able to quickly re-extend your influence back to the real world if you desire through these people. Since you have access to everything that's ever been "thought or imagined", you've got all the knowledge you could possibly need to set someone up or tear someone down in the real world. Locations of lost treasures, deep dark secrets to be used for dispensing blackmail or justice, and so forth. You can make friends with lucid dreamers and have them train others to lucid dream as well. If anyone misuses your gifts of knowledge you'll be able to see that and dispense dream-world punishments as well, if it comes to that. That's all assuming you want to exert influence over the real world, anyway. You could just make friends with lucid dreamers and hang out, giving them secrets just out of altruism. There's no cost to it.
