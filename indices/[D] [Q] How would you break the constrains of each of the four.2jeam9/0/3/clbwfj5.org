*Healer*

I install robotic components in my body, replacing limbs and organs, until I count as a machine to my powers. Any damage from this I can instantly heal, of course.

Then I repair myself forever.

Or maybe I just remember that /my body is a fucking machine/. Err, literally. Either way, this will not stand.

Between healing very rich people, and making them immortal by either making them cyborgs or convincing them that they are already machines, I become the richest person ever. If I know about the "gotcha" (and why wouldn't I? Why mention the spirit at all if I couldn't base decisions on this?!) I funnel all of this into charity projects. Otherwise, I only funnel /most/ of it into charity.

The rich people I directly help don't mind how rich and powerful I am becoming, and all try very, very hard to help keep my abilities secret using their every economic and social lever. Because they trust me when I tell them that secrecy and protecting me while I do my works is necessary -- that's the emotion I focused on for them while helping them, of course.

The woobily spirit stuff doesn't count for shit, as I'm not ever dying. Even if I do, I'll have donated more money to charity than any two human beings ever, saving millions of lives. And even if I /still/ get the shaft because I had a bad attitude about there being an stupid, stupid afterlife or something, so what? I just have to rack up the numbers /their way/ next time to /really/ live forever. Again, this is serial reincarnation, so I am still pushing into the future. A couple more lifetimes and human immortality will be cured even without my abilities. I'm sure they'll inspire people to hunt for a way to replace me when I somehow die to accident or whatever, or maybe I'll fund the effort too.

This one is stupid. I don't see the point, especially if the spirit's benchmarks are hidden.
