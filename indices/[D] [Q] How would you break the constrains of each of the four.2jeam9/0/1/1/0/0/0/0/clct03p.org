Nope, wrong. It only says they will "have no true intelligence of their own". If I need someone to be an engaging debate companion, they will be. I just won't be able to make a clone of Albert Einstein to work on new theoretical physics ideas for me.

You don't psychologically need whatever "true" intelligence is to keep from going crazy. No one does. I'm sure I'd have gone crazy just in this conversation, if that were the case. Hell, cats and TV shows can keep people socialized to normative behavioral levels.

  If you think people seem as stupid and crazy now as they would be if you met them in dreams, you either don't remember your dreams ever, haven't unlucidly dreamed in a very long time, or totally lack imagination.

Nice false choices and backhanded insults. Prove it, this time with logic instead of statements that would make a high-school debate club roll their eyes.

I've got non-engagement, unconscious actions, and the rest of psychology on my side. I also communicate to people on the internet. And that is an inherently shallow affect environment, full of people who think lying is okay there, risk is non-existent for their actions, and sex is something quite twisted from reality. /Definitionally/ crazy personas.

Persona constructs in dreams act exactly how you'd think they would. Which is usually much saner than reality, if a little non-linear sometimes.

If people in your dreams demand you give them back their gold, swear vengeance for the deaths of their children, tear off their faces and scream for hours on end, or anything like that, you might want to get checked up. That's not normal.

  You still have to find it, and there's no indication that's going to be easy or be doable in any reasonable timeframe.
#+end_quote

And nothing says it /isn't/. See, I can disagree without support too. Nothing says I can't search at the speed of light and find it almost instantly. It doesn't define this as a constraint or even a drawback, and you aren't making a logical case for it being one. This is just bland argumentativeness at this point. Boring.

#+begin_quote
  You're splitting hairs;
#+end_quote

Yeah. That's the point. Obviously.

#+begin_quote
  by any reasonable interpretation of the description, it's strongly implying that it can't be done.
#+end_quote

Back that up. It doesn't say it is impossible when it could. So it isn't. That's the way rules as written works. No man can slay my argument. But I'll need pics, or it didn't happen.

#+begin_quote
  For a specific comparison from elsewhere in the comment thread, someone claimed you could suddenly make an antimatter golem appear inside the Fisher King house, and someone else pointed out that the description heavily implied you had to create the golems from material within the house, and so unless you could safely harness a golem's worth of antimatter that wouldn't be possible. You're going way beyond that.
#+end_quote

Clearly not. I'm working within the literal rules and getting results that don't need special treatment. I don't have any "antimatter" that no technology currently exists to safely handle in macro quantities, and I'm not trying to then apply a second rule to use that near-Unobtainium.

And you're /still/ wrong. I think that guy's house /could/ make antimatter. Very, very briefly. Then he's reviving inside a somehow not destroyed house, feeling very stupid and hoping he put out the cat first.

You're just being a spoilsport for some reason, clutching at straws to throw at my post. I don't see why. Seems like a personal issue with dreams.
