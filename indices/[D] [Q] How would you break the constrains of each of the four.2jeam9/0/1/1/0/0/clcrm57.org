The dreamscape rules as written say, anything EVER thought or imagined exists in there. Which means things you /can/ imagine, /do/ exist. Just declaratively exist. I can think of a /lot/ of things.

Sweet.

Including simulations of people real enough to trick my chimp instincts into believing I'm not alone and without a tribe. And I can still interact with people in their own dreams.

I think most people I interact with /now/ are effectively asleep and insane. So, nothing has changed. Except, I'm not immortal and possessed of anything I can imagine right now.

*Escape* is clearly full of win.

TONS of ways to "escape" *Escape*, as well. You can still get access to the real world through real lucid dreamers. You are effectively just one level removed, which means you can make all the classic boxed AI tricks to get people to do things for you. You can get people who are social movers and shakers to spread the practice of lucid dreaming, too.

And /anything/ I can imagine is in there. Like, the complete C++ code to a Friendly AI software program that I can give some programmer who's dreaming. I also find a lucid dreamer to met up with them and tell the baby FAI some very important things about reality, and how it really works. That jump-starts a "real world" research project to figure out what the hell happened to me, and how to reproduce it. Because this happened and science can grasp anything real. So it will.

Within ten years of a FAI (easily), /everyone/ is in the dreamscape who wants to be. Easy and safe singularity. The dreamscape is very, very friendly, after all.

And injecting people back into the "real world" isn't said to be impossible, just that "I am not capable" of doing it. Not that it /cannot be done/. Bet that FAI can figure out going both ways, in a matter of months, even /before/ a technological singularity is complete.
