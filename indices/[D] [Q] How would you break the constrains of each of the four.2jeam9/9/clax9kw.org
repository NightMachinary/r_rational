Well, what can leave the fisher kings house? Information. So the barbarians burned the library of Alexandria? No problem. House can contain any tech, and I say books count. You've already got a copy of every book ever, and scribes are always welcome in your home. Also, you can easily prototype things like fusion reactors and super-small circuit boards.

Another thing that could leave would the golems. So, create a giant "golem" made of rocket fuel for my moon shot. As long as your rocket takes off before the year is up, you can burn up that fuel no problem. Or maybe just a rocket ship golem, for short term trips. Nuke golems don't need to last a long time either. Food golems ("fruit golem"), needle-with-vaccine-golem (as long as the virus's in the vaccine are dead, and thus not animate), and so on. Of course, there is the concern that chunks of the world dissappear when the golems time is up. If you live off fruit golems for a year, do you dissappear when the year is up? Do the fumes from the rocket fuel golem vanish? Because if they do vanish, that's pretty good for the environment, but I'm worried that someone might breath them.

You could compel someone to obey you by installing a "golem" artificial heart inside them.

Other, more exotic golems would allow all sorts of abuse. A golem of air, for example. Invisible, can spy on anyone, travel around the world in no time, kill anyone, anywhere, at any time, by withdrawing all the air in their lungs. FAR more powerful than the dominion option. Dark matter golem? Antimatter golem? Light golem? My knowledge of physics is kinda weak, but all these strike me as worth exploring.

Can we make golems that can design smarter golems? Not sure if "cannot make things you don't understand" blocks that one. Maybe if i spent a couple thousand years trying to figure it out?

I'm pretty sure that golems cannot create more golems; only I can do that. Still, worth a shot.

You can bring things from outside the house into the house, then alter them once they are inside. Medical procedures and such. Your house will always be a world class hospital.

A single antimatter golem interacting with a normal matter golem would create virtually infinite energy, so heat death of the universe = beaten. Plus, if all humanity unites and creates a single house the size of a star, then I could create star golems. Humanity running low on power? Just create two star sized golems, one of matter, another of antimatter, and mash them together or something. Problem solved.

As for which I'd chose... I'd probably go with the Fisher King, because living beyond the heat death of the universe is pretty sweet. And I'd probably spend the rest of my life wondering how it would feel to have chosen Nakama.
