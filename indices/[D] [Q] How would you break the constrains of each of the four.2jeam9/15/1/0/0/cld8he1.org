When a battle is triggered (Such as the one Orangered just lost in [[/r/Aegis_Imperial]], of which I am...was the Governor :( ), and it starts, the people who can participate deploy troops in 'skirmishes' in the battle with commands, such as >oppose #x with x cavalry(counters enemies) or >attack with x cavalry(triggers a skirmish), etc. in a rock-paper-scissors style of fighting.

People are directed by mods in the chat at [[http://www.orangeredtechnologies.com][www.orangeredtechnologies.com]], and it is strongly encouraged to join the chat and wait for orders before doing anything.

Basically, it's rock paper scissors commands that are taken by a bot. But you shouldn't attack without the mods telling you to, because Orangered has less troops and can't risk deploying too many before a skirmish is about to end.
