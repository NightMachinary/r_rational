There was also one done on [[/r/Orangered]] (The opposing/counterpart team to [[/r/Periwinkle]]). Those results were /much/ closer to the ones seen here. I participated in the Orangered one, but my priorities were slightly different in those days, and I wouldn't pick the same thing I did then.

Oh, and while the subject of Orangered-Periwinkle has come up: Join Chroma and help the Orangered Nation fight the Periwinkle menace! We need /you/ to fight today! (seriously, we're desperate. We've been getting our asses kicked ever since the Reddit April fools thing a year ago)
