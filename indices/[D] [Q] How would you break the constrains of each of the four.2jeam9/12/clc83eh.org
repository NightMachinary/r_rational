Alright, I will "break" Nakama, since it is apparently the hardest. Also, you guys, not every hack has to trigger a positive singularity or something... you just have to break the prompt.

--------------

Munchkin #0: If in every life, I /know/ that I am under Nakama, I can deduce which re-incarnation I am in by the number of close friends I have. I can simply create a widely publicized record of all my memories. Next incarnation will find them, see that this past person was /also/ under a "Nakama", and deduce that the memoir was written by a past life. Episodic/Semantic Memory chain acquired!

If no one believes me about Nakama, then there are various secret passwords, given to trusted and respected institutions. The final life knows all the secrets, thereby proving the existence of Nakama. (Or just use the supernatural powers of #4 pet hack to prove it.)

If I'm not the only one under Nakama, then Nakama is likely well known to the world because other Nakama would have thought of the above. The system of determining if a memoir was written by my own past life, or another Nakama on the same life-count, is to see if the pet species match.

In either case, if only the First Life knows about the Nakama, then a unique and unusually long lived pet could act as a Nakama signal - that is, assuming you don't have sufficient control over the pet beyond "which earth species" and can't send messages outright.

If even the /first/ life doesn't know what's going on, then assuming you've got a meta-consciousness that chooses the pet before this all starts, you should use the #4 supernatural-pet-hack below to at least clue your lives in that /something/ odd is going on, and the re-incarnation of this supernatural thing will establish a link in the Nakama chain if the world knows what Nakama is. (If not, the world will at least know that there exists a supernatural animal which appears every few generations and chooses a human, and the 13th chosen human would report memories from the 12 past chosen ones.)

If you have none of that information, then the prompt transforms to "what would you do with 12 close friends and a pet." // "what would you do with accurate memories of 12 lives", which is a rather different prompt. You might still get lucky and just /happen/ to choose a pet that really can't physically live that long or display that behavior - if not, it's really hard to hack systems when you don't even know you're in them.

--------------

Munchkin #1: I choose careers that are only possible in a post-singularity paradise. "The guy who wakes up the cryo-frozen people", etc. It shall come to pass. (Or magical paradises, if that's allowed).

Munchkin #2: If I can successfully destroy the Earth, it means that there are people on other planets for me to reincarnate into. Not worth the information, but still.

Munchkin #3: My pet is a human. BOOM, not alone in the final life! (I mean, we're all alone anyway, aren't we? I assume I can still make friends the old fashioned way...) I suppose this breaks the meaning of "pet".

*Munchkin #4 (the supernatural pet hack)*: My pet is an animal which is not supposed to live as long as a human OR my pet is a human with progeria OR my pet is a species normally incapable of complex emotions such as loyalty. Now I've got an ongoing source of Supernatural Things happening around me, which is used in hack #0. Hopefully this also causes scientists acquire secrets of longevity, neuroscience, and/or insight into the magical world, maybe leading to big downstream effects.
