Assuming that you know the conditions of the Nakama scenario, you could go into bioengeering and nanoengineering. By the end of a long career of this, hopefully you'll be responsible for a couple of innovations in life extension and stuff that will give your next reincarnation a few more years to live.

Then you write down somewhere, "if you have 11 close friends and are very lucky, do the following: ...". I'll have several years to actually write the proper instructions for my next iteration.

Hopefully, by a few reincarnations in I and my friends will be living forever. By attrition, eventually I'll end up at number 13 anyway. But hey, mind uploading and simulations will be a thing by then - I might even be responsible for that.
