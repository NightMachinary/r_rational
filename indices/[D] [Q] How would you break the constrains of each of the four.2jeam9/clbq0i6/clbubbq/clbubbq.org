  By stretching the definition of 'you'
#+end_quote

What allows you to do that? That would be like saying you and your twin are the same person.

#+begin_quote
  This leaves me free to leave the house for any length of time and still respawn even if killed outside the house.
#+end_quote

Disregarding the above, you being killed outside while also being inside (i.e. the clone was inside at the time) does not constitute you being killed inside insofar I understand the English language. You are alive inside by your definition of you. Can't both have the cake and eat it too.

  When both cloning and time travel are invented
#+end_quote

*If* both cloning and time travel are invented. The first is very probable but I wouldn't be so sure about time travel. The fact that there aren't any time travelers walking out and about would be one indication against it.

#+begin_quote
  I can simply create golems that are perfect physical duplicates of myself
#+end_quote

Only if you perfectly understand your own body. Human bodies are pretty damn complicated.

#+begin_quote
  hook them up to be remote-controlled by my brain
#+end_quote

I didn't know that remote human/golem mind-interfaces were existing technology.

#+begin_quote
  Since the house can generate any material
#+end_quote

It can /contain/ any object that exists. It can only create food at will. Also, I don't know if safe anti-matter isolators are existing objects.

The rest seems doable.
