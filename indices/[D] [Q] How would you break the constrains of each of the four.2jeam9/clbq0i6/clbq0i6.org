Fisher King: I create microscopic golems that build microscopic structures extending in every direction, including down and later up, increasing the size of my house to a ridiculous degree. The golems have to be large enough to see, but they don't necessarily have to be large enough to see /with the naked eye/. By stretching the definition of 'you', I can leave the house while remaining inside it with the use of clones. This leaves me free to leave the house for any length of time and still respawn even if killed outside the house. When both cloning and time travel are invented, I share this technology with my past self, allowing me to do this even before such technology would otherwise exist. If this proves nonviable for any reason, I can simply create golems that are perfect physical duplicates of myself, hook them up to be remote-controlled by my brain, and use those when I want to go outside. Since the house can generate any material, I can produce infinite energy by creating and harnessing antimatter. This will also allow me to indefinitely prevent the heat death of the universe. Eventually, the human race can be moved entirely inside my house, and prosper indefinitely within. Once this happens, I will effectively be a god.
