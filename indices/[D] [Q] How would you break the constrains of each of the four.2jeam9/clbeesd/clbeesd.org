Nakama: Is there some way to force your magic to give you technological breakthroughs? There are two reasonable options here - the promise that you will reunite with your friends, and the promise that your pet will live as long as you.

So what if you put your pet in a machine that would kill it unless an attached computer randomly generated a better AIDS vaccine? To be extra safe, do this before reuniting with all your friends. Or what if hired accomplices detained you from meeting your friends pending some key breakthroughs in regenerative medicine?
