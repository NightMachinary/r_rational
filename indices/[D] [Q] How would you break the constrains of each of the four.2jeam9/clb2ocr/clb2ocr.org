Ok im going to focus on each in series.

Road Eternal: My personal favorite, it's objectively inferior to the Fishermans house but i like the idea of having no central point restricting you, I'd worry about becoming paranoid and a shut in. The simple fact of the matter is that after your first world you'd be able to apply everything you learned over the course of one human existence to your interactions with the next one. 100 years is pocket change to an immortal, and depending on how you walk it you could easily fill a hundred years with new experiences to shit around in until the next world if you win the multiversal lottery of crap. also, silnce magical items cannot be lost if I unwittingly grabbed the one ring after a hundred years would it become part of my ensemble along with the pack constantly following me and tempting me with senseless irrational evil.

Fisherman King: I have to agree with everyone else on the objective superiority of the fishermans home. I do have one thing to add to the discourse though. It specifies the golems must be sufficiently large enough to see, but this still allows for a grey goo scenario, you cant see a nano golem, but a trillion in a vat are clearly visible.

Nakama: Honestly this seems more similar to a hell of your own making.. every lifetime you have less and less friends but you are no less fulfilled or happy and then you remember all of it and realize that none of them objectively made any difference to your life and you question "if i didn't remember would my life be any worse than it was when i had friends?"

Dominion: My second favorite, the largest objection i hold is the twelve nemesis, it seems terribly exhausting but the reward is more than fair, a truly free future, once your nemesis are defeated you are free, no forced wandering or home that is tied to your immortality, If you really want to you could just get your people working on emulations of bag of holding and some way to travel dimensions. So ya a better version of the wanderer but you have to work for it.

Also, has anyone noticed the duality of the scenarios? Fisherman king and Nakama, one has you living in an aloof solitude of superiority to the rest of the world, while the other pushes you to be thoroughly connected to the world you live in going so far as to remove your memories. Road eternal and Dominion, always walking a carefree road with little to tie you to one place and the other pitting you against a direct conflict for the dominion of a single where and when.
