The Road Eternal:\\
Why limit yourself to Earth? It sounds like you'd make the perfect pre-FTL travel astronaut assuming you can handle the whole being alone for a couple thousand years thing. You also have the option to return back to Earth every 100 years, apparently.

Fisher King:\\
Easily broken as discussed elsewhere. I'd pick this one.

Nakama:\\
I really don't see the appeal in this one at all. It's Doctor Who turned up to 11 coupled with a final life where everyone thinks you are insane. I suppose you'd get quite a bit of accumulated knowledge. You'd be a boon to any historian who was willing to trust you. This also assumes your memory is perfect.

Dominion:\\
You could easily build up to this scenario with Fisher King except now you also have an invincible fortress.
