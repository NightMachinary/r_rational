The endless road's backpack might be exploitable. I am traveling at a convention of the the world's best physicists and mathematicians. Appropriate supplies for this location would be include fundamental proofs of mathematics, correct physical predictions, and accurate models of physics. (I am at a tech convention, novel technological prototypes are appropriate etc...)

The money could also be exploited with cooperation from a community. It would be quite easy to generate gold (or any other material) out of nothing. A harder way would be to set up a very expensive town run on a cryptocurrency based on protein folding patterns (or anything else), so you can pay people with that knowledge.

I'd say that the Fisher King is amazing. A [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kola_Superdeep_Borehole][borehole]] is a structure, so you get ~12km of height to work with, and a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Wall_of_China][wall]] is also a structure, so you get ~8800 km of length (and width as well). You can have a 8800 * 8800 * 12 km cube as your house, and make it bigger on the inside.

Splitting your house into 100m high levels, you would have 9.3 * 10^{10} km^{2} of surface area to work with (about 20 Earths worth, including oceans). Invite everyone in to a libertarian utopia with free housing, food, entertainment, technology, and utilities.

There's no reason to leave once you have it set up, so you can seal the entrances to remove your weaknesses.

PS: "every form of utility" could be absurdly broken depending on what definition is used. Power, water, internet access and TV are nice, but "anything that is within my utility function" is far better.
