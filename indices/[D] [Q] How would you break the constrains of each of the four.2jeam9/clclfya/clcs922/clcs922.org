Eugh. "Surprising." Sure. Those sure are...thoughts, I guess. I forgot what normal people reasoning "out loud" looked like. I should have braced myself.

I owe every single person in this subreddit that I've ever argued with a huge apology. Sure, half of you might want to kill me with your poorly implemented, for-the-greater-good altruism and non-physically-continuous, informational-only identity theories.

But at least none of you are voting positively for *Nakama*, because you "love the idea of it", "you still have your pet...ultimately a good trade", or you'd "be no where without friends". /Burrr/.

I am really and truly sorry. Just don't make me read normal people again.
