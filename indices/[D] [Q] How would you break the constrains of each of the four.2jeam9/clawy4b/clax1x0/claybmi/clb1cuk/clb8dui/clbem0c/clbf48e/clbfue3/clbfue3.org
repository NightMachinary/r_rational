I didn't want to go into full paranoid insane mode, but I have to if I want to win/make-the-best-point/whatever this internet discussion/argument/comment-thread/thing:

1. Live in an invincible house-box in a corner and interact even with the rest of your house through golems, plugging it into your nervous system and using brain control if possible. Make the golems look exactly like you, disguise the box as part of a wall (it's still part of the house anyways so it is or should be 'nigh invincible'), and act as if the golems inside the house actually are youThis would have the added benefit of getting you outside for longer, actually, now that I think of it.

2. You can 'reshape your house at will', so can you not destroy the exits?

3. Army of golems guarding the inside and you.

4. Use a bunch of disappearing and reappearing staircases (or staircases that fly around and have to be put in place by you) between any place you're in, with a fatal drop between you and the exit at any point.

5. All of the above?

6. ???

7. Profit.
