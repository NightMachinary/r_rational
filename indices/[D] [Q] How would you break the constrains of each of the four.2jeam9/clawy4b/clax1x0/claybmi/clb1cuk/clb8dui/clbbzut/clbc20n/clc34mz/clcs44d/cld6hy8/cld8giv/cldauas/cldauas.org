While sex was definitely within the things I considered, it certainly wasn't the only one.

I didn't mean to insult, sorry if it came out like that, I meant only to say that for me, personal interaction with other, real people would be very important. The way I see it, simply removing all ways in or out while having a visitor, plus some fail-safes in case the person attacks you anyway. The important thing is that if I can't be removed from the house, I can't die. Everything else I can work around with enough time. I certainly wouldn't be inviting anyone in for a little while, until I had a reliable system worked out.

I had already read your answer, and I think I'd be really irked about making companions for myself, no matter how realistic. Sure, you'll say I'm sub-optimal (I already knew that too), but that's what I've got to work with.
