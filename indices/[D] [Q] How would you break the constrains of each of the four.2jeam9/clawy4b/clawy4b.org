Oh I love this CYOA.

For Fisher King, I think a popular idea was to construct golems as small as you can, and have them construct a tiny (<1mm) hollow tube as far as possible (underground for sure, maybe into space too?). That would probably fit the definition of a largest structure and lets you make the inside of the house really huge.

Also really with Fisher King you can live a generally normal day to day life, you just can't take vacations longer than a week. That doesn't really seem to be in the spirit of the premise so I suppose it counts.

edit: looks like I got the idea from [[/u/Geminii27]], who does indeed frequent [[/r/rational]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/1g230a/4_choices_taken_from_intp_who_took_it_from_mbti/cag4ygh][here]]. So thanks Gemini!
