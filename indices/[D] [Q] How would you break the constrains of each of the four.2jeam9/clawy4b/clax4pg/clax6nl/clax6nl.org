Yeah "minor" seems to be really open to interpretation. Personally I would consider 'bigger on the inside' to be a pretty major violation of physics so really it all seems rather up in the air.

Re: volume, I meant make a structure (arbitrarily large) km wide. It would be very narrow to keep construction simple and inexpensive. Each dimension is evaluated individually so it can be three separate structures in all directions.
