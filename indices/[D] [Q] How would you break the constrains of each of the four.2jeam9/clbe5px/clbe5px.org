The Road Eternal: Well, I suppose that I could just brute-force the parallel universes until I meet someone who can take the drawbacks off of my magic items. Plus, the idea of "moving onward" is ill-defined enough that I might get away with moving between as few as two locations. I could have a family, or at least a long-term lover, without engaging the "settling down" rule.

Fisher King: Too easy, if "any drink I desire" includes drinks that don't exist, or if "any technology or object that exists" includes any that alien civilizations could potentially have invented. Alternatively, I could just spend my time making golems and having them build my house downwards, until I've basically hollowed out the upper crust- I do have time, after all. I can then sell extravagantly rare beverages from my house with warnings that they'll fade away in a week's time, and channel the money into cryonics research, bringing better technology into existence and magicking it into my house in ridiculous amounts. Then I could send golems out to invite everyone on the planet to come freeze themselves in my house and give me a few thousand years with all the technology on the planet to solve humanity's problems.

Nakama: I've... got nothing. Looks like a fairly cut and dry destiny. I suppose I could send myself a message, assuming I'm being reincarnated in a linear order, but there wouldn't be much to say unless we assume that there's inherently some way to bring these people back to life. If I were successful I could spend 12 lives studying with my friends on how to do that, or else try to end death HPMOR-style, but even with 84 iterations of sets of eyes, I'm not sure we'd crack that in time. Or we could take the easy route again and say that my pet is a species that doesn't exist but which can bring back the dead or break reincarnation limits or anything else of that sort.

Dominion: I'm aware that I'm basically giving the same response to all of these, but does "having a natural grasp for everything I attempt" include things that haven't been attempted before, or things that aren't actually possible? Could I, say, do really well at reading a book by flipping its pages really fast, or making things explode when I chant vaguely ominous words, or making people trip by staring at them really hard? If I have an entire world worth of people under my command, then I could just radically decentralize everything to keep those twelve nemeses permanently unable to rebel- instating Discordianism as a global religion, burning the DIY ethic into everyone's minds, et cetera- but I'd also like to turn those resources towards the sciences, if at all possible- preferably space travel. If humanity's spread amongst the stars, or even just among the solar system, things are suddenly much more secure for me.
