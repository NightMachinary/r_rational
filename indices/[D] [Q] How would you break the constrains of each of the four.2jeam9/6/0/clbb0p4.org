My two criticisms would be:

1. It specifically states your luck does not extend to "adventure and excitement" and only applies to "ordinary, everyday life". I feel at this point it becomes an argument over semantics however I think breaking Nakama is entirely beyond the point of it.

2. The goals you outlined could be achieved just as well, if not even faster, with Fisher King or Dominion. Those two scenarios also give you straight up immortality instead of a limited amount of deaths.
