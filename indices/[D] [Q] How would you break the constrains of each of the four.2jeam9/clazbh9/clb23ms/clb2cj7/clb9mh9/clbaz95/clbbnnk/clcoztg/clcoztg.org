  If you believe that reincarnation without memories is just death...

I do believe that, yes, I can't see how you can argue anything differently. We are not anything except our memories and our current consciousness, and if 'you' die and none of that passes on, the resulting person isn't you. This is only even arguable perhaps in the case of person 13, since they get the memories of all the people involved.

We imagine 13 different people. You!1- You!13. These people are all technically 'you' as defined by whatever magical effect is storing the memories of people as they die to be restored in You!13. But You!2-You!12 have no direct relation to or knowledge of each other in any way, except that each will have progressively one less Nakama member and those members in each life are similarly 'them' in the same way you are 'you', only they just inarguably flat out die as there is never any memory storage. Yous!2-12 are all different people. They could have different races, skills, likes, dislikes, thought patterns, languages, life experience, genetics, hell even species.

If this is also advancing temporally, the world likely has changed so much in 12 full lifetimes (and they would be long lifetimes, the preternatural luck ensures each to be at least 100 years - this would be over a millennia, easy even assuming the laughable notion that they don't lick mortality in that timeframe) that You!12s thoughts, morality, and senses are pretty much incomprehensible to You!1 or 2. They cannot be the same person, they might not even be able to think the same thoughts!

Then they all come together to be You!13... well, that person is going to have a hell of a time with what might be the worst multiple personality situation on record.

I would make the same argument for someone with complete and perfectly irreversible amnesia. They wouldn't be the same person as pre amnesia themselves, even though you might even be able to argue continuity and have some chance of success. In this there isn't even a smidge of that.

Because the you in the first life (who has memory of making the choice to Nakama) and the last life (who is a conglomerate of all the yous in the cycle, including the first, and knows what is happening because of the knowledge of the first life) will know that you are losing people. The 12 in the middle, I agree, will have good lives and have no idea what they are missing. The 13th will not.

Although you are right, it's not so much the 'there is one less each time' that will be the real horror to number 13 - assuming he thinks the way I do, that each of them are dying - the real breaking point is that regardless of how happy the lives are *You!13 has lost his best friends and lovers /78/ times and remembers each one.* Each one of them a partner for life, gone forever, that You!13 will never regain, or even come close to, because he knows he is the last.

That just makes [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror][it even more damning]], because You!13 both realizes that they will never recover what they have lost, and that it was a choice of part-of-you (You!1) that led to that outcome.

The choice to take the Nakama scenario.

And since You!13 is a conglomerate of all the other Yous, they are all there, in that private hell in the body that isn't their own, in a time flung far out of comfort, without 78 people who were lifelong companions to all of them.

You tell me the odds of that one living to a natural lifespan, or approaching anything like happiness.
