I'm going to put a *trigger warning* on this post, because this is not healthy to think about. Mentions of suicide. So there. Just don't even read this. I don't usually do this, but damn. It came out ugly when I wrote it down.

I'm not sure the rules as written should be read as you knowing You!13 is the last time. Simply, that you /remember/ the last 12 Yous, and it /is/ the last time.

So it might be worse. You might /think/ you'll keep looping forever without your soulmates. Or worse-worse, that you'll loop around and find them again oh god oh god if you exist please bring them back just bring them back I'll do anything.

And so you immediately try to kill yourself. Just to see if you are right. And worst-worse, you remember this all as a baby. Or possibly even in the womb. It says you are lucky and reincarnate as a baby, so that is fuzzy. But you are, as noted, at least temporarily very, very insane.

So you try to kill yourself as soon as you can. Apparently, according to the rules, happily. And /luckily/, suicide is a common things to do -- unlike, say, wanting to live really and truly forever -- and is therefore not at all exciting or an adventure. So, /luckily/, you get it right the first time, die cleanly and painlessly in the attempt, and end your suffering forever.

Fucking dark. Fuck everything about Nakama. It is all kinds of a sick joke.
