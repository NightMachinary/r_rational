I do not have a working definition of "you", for the time being I just accept the statement of the scenario that says "you will reincarnate", and anticipate that it means that /something/ meaningful survives -- perhaps personality, perhaps patterns of thoughts, but something.

I do not know how consciousness works for me to able to say that there won't be "continuity", whatever that means.

If you believe that reincarnation without memories is just death why did you say "in each one one of the most important people in the universe to you ceases to exist", rather than treat all your friends across lives as 78 different happy people who each lived their own individually happy lives, no more horrific than if no reincarnation had taken place at all?

It seems to me that one needs to be thinking about the scenario is two different and contradictory ways for one to be 'feeling the horror' as you feel it.
