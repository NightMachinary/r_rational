Man, you keep shouting "the horror, the horror" at me, and I'm still not feeling it.

Yes, feel free to keep shouting "You!13 has lost his best friends and lovers 78 times and remembers each one, and feels complete horror", and I'll keep responding that "You!13 remembers 78 awesome people whom he deeply loved and deeply enjoyed life with, and feels great contentment and joy at the memories." is at least as likely.

You can choose to see it all as horrific, but I'm just not going to agree with you.
