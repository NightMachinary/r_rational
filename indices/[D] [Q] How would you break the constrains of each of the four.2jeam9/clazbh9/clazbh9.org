I think some people are forgetting that the Nakama scenario involves a memory wipe every single death, until on the lonely 13th life, when all 12 previous yous re-substantiate, and you likely go insane.

It actually sound really, really terrifying. You've lost everyone who mattered to you /12 times/ and have lived 12 different lives as slightly different people.

Of course, if your dream job is something like "ruler of the world", you could probably get most of it done in one life and get immortality.
