Of course, you can still be killed if anyone figures out how it works. Die within the house, and it doesn't stick, but if they capture you and remove you first then you can be permakilled. So there's no guarantee you'll outlive human civilisation.

Equivalently, the house can probably be knocked down or blown up. I would be interested to see what happens when a bulldozer hits a wall that's bigger on the inside.

Compare and contrast with Nakama's no-strings-attached twelve extra lives.
