On top of which you'd be able to live a fairly normal life with Fisher King. You'd just have to invite friends over most of the time and most of them would jump at the chance to spend time at your awesome house.

edit: After looking over it some more I see essentially no downside to the Fisher King scenario aside from the "can't leave the house for too long" restriction. That means very little when you have the potential to make teleportation devices. You don't even have to get very clever to break it.
