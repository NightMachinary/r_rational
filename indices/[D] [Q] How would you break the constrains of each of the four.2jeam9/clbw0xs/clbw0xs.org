Ah. Well, "break"? Because I want them to fail? Or to achieve my goals?

My goals, that's more interesting. A good writing warmup for NaNoWriMo.

--------------

*TRE*:

A "wandering jew" scenario, treat appropriately. This is a curse instead of a wonderful opportunity, if not handled correctly. The most interesting of the four, because of the relatively clear rules.

Shelter is missing from the list, but if you could be harmed falling off a cliff is taken into account, your need for a tent should be covered as well. Or a bank card with $100 to pay for that hotel. Guns are expensive, after all, so this isn't out of scope. So that's all the basics solved, in the "wild" or cities.

"Travel" is such a strange thing to define. What does "moving onward" mean? As I don't normally travel, or even camp, I say travel means no permanent home or shelter that I own. So /for me/, travel is not a large distance. I move from one hotel to another in a major city with relative low crime. Every day, a new room to sleep in. Up and down the city streets, with everything I own every morning. Just to make sure, I spend my days exploring the city and surrounding area at random.

+Japan+ (Shit! Fuck! Almost died through weeaboo. Forgot about killer doomquakes. Damn, that was close.) France is my choice. Safe, high-tech, trains to move around fast, just in case I start to feel "weak" from not "moving onward". English-friendly enough to get a start. Give myself a few months to bone up on the language in +Tokyo's+ Paris tourist areas, and I'm set for life. The point is, I can't die of old age. So I just have to wait for a future that will grant me even MORE powers, like "normal" physical immortality. Or maybe a new body, without this trapped backpack attached to it.

It's going to be a long wait, even for optimistic views of the future. Oh. And "language affinity?" Time to get a laptop while I hang out in major cities with free wi-fi. C++ is a "language", after all. Maybe I'll take a shot at that Friendly AI problem...

Oh. And if in the middle of a perfectly safe city, you find body armor, a gun, or (dog help you) an NBC suit in your pack one day, that would be a signal to ditch and run until you start getting nice things in your pack again.

A note: the 100 year swap thing is a shitty idea. Don't fucking do it, what is wrong with you? Unless on that day you are somehow the FBI Most Wanted, head of an international terrorist group, or basically about to be imprisoned and/or killed, why would you give up known sure things for totally unknown and poorly worded other worlds? No. Just, no.

*Fisher King*

GG, well played rest of the world. I've already got everything I really want. I'm am 100% safe (unless I fuck up) and I'm going to live forever. So calm down world, no evil ruler or nanobot golems ("that I can see"? Reeealy...) for you. Because I win. Everything else is just gravy.

Sorry, right. Details on how I'd live after getting almost everything I ever wanted handed to me.

I initially thought, bottom of the ocean. Then I thought, why? *Invincible house.* So, right in the middle of the most tectonically stable area I can find, over the longest period possible given shifting plates, but also with wi-fi. So, not California or Japan...(shit, revise TRE! Idiot!) and not Siberia. Without looking anything up, I'm thinking the middle of France. I'll look that up later to see if I'm right.

So. I live forever and no one can ever, ever, ever stop me. Because, why would I ever invite someone into my house so they can push me out of it and potentially kill me for good?

Why?

For sex or other companionship, you say? Well, given the golem rules, I'm about to get really, /really/ good at biology, chemistry, all aspects of physiology, and psychology. Then I'll make a room out of the basic elemental building blocks of the human body and start making golems my lizard brain will think are good members of my "in group", so I can be a little saner as a chimp. They'll have better bodies (won't even need a digestive system at all or a brain, for example) but they'll need to look mostly like humans to be long-term psychological stabilizers.

But until then, well, I've still got the internet, radio, live video conferences, and every sex toy ever invented at my disposal to trick those primitive urges for socialization and sex.

After I become an expert at human bodies (robotics is still a disappointing waste of time) then the only question is, fully sentient companions or mobile sextoys? Depends on if that line means they /always/ have a lifespan of a year or not. I'm not comfortable (yet) killing sentient beings in that way. Though that might change if I was removed sufficiently from the rest of the universe. Which I would. Because I'd never leave the building.

I'm thinking I don't want to ever make anything capable of pushing me outside, but I could simply make door-blocking golems that never, ever, ever let me outside. They look a lot like bank vault doors, except fewer handles. To open them, I'd have to intentionally make door-blocking-golem removing golems. Which I would never, ever do. Certainly not without make-me-not-fit-through-doors golems strapped to me first.

But they would be dumb robots made out of building materials. Only moral to make people (and if sentient, they would be people) who wouldn't mind never having friends over or ever being able to leave. Because I won't let them back in again, and they'll die in a year. And they'd need to be able to learn to like living forever. Because I'm not making things that want to die. That's stilly.

Oh right. And start funding archologies in the outer world, so I can make things larger than the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Everett_Factory][Boeing Everett Factory]] is wide, and the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burj_Khalifa][Burj Khalifa]] is tall. Yes, I'm /that/ greedy.

*Nakama*

If you make it to 13, I think it is fair to say you are trapped in a Banksian digital hell, a very subtle and insidious one. Because at that point, you now know how fucked up the world really is. As an infant. The moment you become "you", which might be as a cluster of neurons, because you are obviuosly not running your brain on matter. Or maybe three years later. Who knows. doesn't matter. You know everyone you ever cared for is gone, based on the pattern, and gone likely forever. Fuck your lives. And it doesn't even say you understand the rules. So this is all just dumped on you. Bogus.

That's even if you /don't/ remember your former lives until #13. That isn't clear from the poorly worded rules. As others have pointed out, #13 is you being insane. Sooner if you remember every past life, every time. Maybe it is a happy kind of crazy, but you are not going to be well.

But seriously now? Why would you ever reach #13? Or even #4? If physical immortality isn't perfected in 12 human lifespans from now (remember /reincarnation/, not some peggy-sue resets) even assuming they don't keep getting longer, humanity is likely royally fucked anyway. #13 would just be me assuming the universe is actively malevolent, and me trying to fuck it over as hard as I could, however I could.

Because I'd be insane, but likely happy to take the entire universe down with me. Remember, I don't /know/ that I'm not just Groundhog Daying from that point on, as I have no view of the rules of this process, just #13's memories of boringly happy lives, and of what was lost. Yeah. I'd be /pissed/.

*Dominion*

So, is this nothing has changed, except for getting easier for me every time I tell someone what to do? A sort of "super-Lelouch?"

Or I am doomed to rule over Earth instead of doing what I want; and if I drop the ball, people will be pissed as they naturally would? Which means, /INSTANTLY/ and likely fatally. Who needs 12 immortal rebels out for my blood? The second the Middle East can get an assassin at me, I'm dead. Because their problems are suddenly /my fault/, right? I'm not invincible, just unaging.

This one's definition and ruleset sucks. Does everyone know who I am overnight? Can I rule from secret, meeting with world leaders who all secretly acknowledge my authority? Do the 12 +evil exes+ rebel scum /also/ acknowledge my right to rule, per item #1? Do they simply always assume the worst and pick at the edges? Are they immune to my commands? If I say, 'no one is allowed to try and kill me', will they accept that? If I order the world to never undermine my rule, do they have to obey, thus making themselves useless? What, exactly, IS my power over others?

Disappointing. At /best/, it is simply RL++, which means I likely simply ignore the authority powers as soon as I discover the "people expect me to rule well" part. After that, I go about my business in obscurity while living forever.

Sooner or later, that McDonalds I accidentally took Dominion over will go out of business, and my rule will fall into the shadows of history, as will I.

Worst case, it is an inevitable death sentence, as those 12 people are not constrained as to how to take me out. Nor is /anyone else/.

Final note: Why does the skills thing matter, if everyone follows my rule? So stupid.
