One slight quibble - I don't think Brahman would be described as though it were a deity, would likely just be Brahmā? I can verify with a friend later today.

[Edit] Verified with a friend of mine who spent most of their life in India - they said the phrase "Brahman or any other god or supernatural being" didn't really make sense, and would be more likely to have been "Brahmā or any other deity or divine being"; "supernatural being" has implications of ghosts and demons, not positive entities, and the term "deity" is more common than "god".
