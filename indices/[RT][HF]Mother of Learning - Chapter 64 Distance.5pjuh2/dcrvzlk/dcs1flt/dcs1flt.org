This theory has been brought up extensively in the past chapter discussion threads. The biggest argument against it, in my opinion, is Zach's lack of Soul Sight. No matter how much Red Robe mind raped him into forgetting stuff, he couldn't erase this ability since it's acquired by drinking a potion. Besides, I'd like to think even Zach would notice someone else using his mana reserves, no matter how huge they are.
