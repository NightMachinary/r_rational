Hmm, maybe, though the guardian only mentioned that in context of entering or exiting the gate. So you have to balance that implication against the previous research into the extreme difficulty of soulkill. In the case that it is recreating souls completely every iteration, and reattaching the controllers soul, it may still be programmed to reattach the shared soul to the second body, though I agree it is less likely.

I'm pretty sure they checked to make sure Zach wasn't doing anything weird (like being controlled by his own returning soul, and casting simulacrum immediately before being mindwiped) in the morning right? Or was that only checked after red robe left?
