I don't think that that will get it through the Gate without sharing Zach's body. Let's think about how the restart works.

- The Guardian pulls all marked souls into the Gate for safekeeping
- The Gate destroys the (pocket) universe
- The Gate builds a new universe from the template, including Zach's body and brain.
- The Guardian anchors marked souls back to their respective bodies.

None of those steps will create an extra ectoplasm body or magical brain that wasn't in the template.

The only way for a simulacrum to simply exploit its connection to Zach's marker, as far as I can tell, would be to overwrite his mind with its own and replace him. Which didn't happen; he's still around.
