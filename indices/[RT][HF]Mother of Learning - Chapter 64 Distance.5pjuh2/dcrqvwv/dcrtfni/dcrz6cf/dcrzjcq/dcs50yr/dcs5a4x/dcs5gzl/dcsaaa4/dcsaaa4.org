I agree; I usually roll my eyes at the 1000-year-old dating a normally-aged person. However, I just realized it may not be so far-fetched.

It is certainly possible that as time passes, some individuals may be more accepting of more types of people.

For example, to some 12-year-olds, a 7-year-old may seem insufferably naive and annoying. However, to a 18-year-old, the 7-year-old's naivety may simply be endearing, and the child's lack of emotional control may be sympathized with due to the adult's increased patience.

And certainly, some young people /do/ successfully date older individuals. I know many who have had (and continue to have) long-term relationships with people with decades-wide age gaps. The largest I know of is a friend who was 21 when she met her 60-something-year-old boyfriend, and they only "broke up" when she changed locations for education at age 25. And despite the break-up, I believe he's still helping her pay for school.

And I know several women in their early twenties who have said they specifically prefer men in their late thirties or early forties because men their age often seem immature, which they find tiring.

So in the real world, there's definitely precedent for both increased and decreased compatibility as the age gap increases, and I wouldn't say these examples are uncommon.

Despite this, adults dating high schoolers /does/ feel really uncomfortable. However, given what we know about Kirielle's arranged marriage at 15, in this setting, 15 may well be "of age".
