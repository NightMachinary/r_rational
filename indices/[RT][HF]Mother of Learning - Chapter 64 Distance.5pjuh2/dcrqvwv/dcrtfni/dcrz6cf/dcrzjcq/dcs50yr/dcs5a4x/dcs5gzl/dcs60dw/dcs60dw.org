In real life people get older physically. In this story there is no physical aging. This is a significant difference which makes it difficult to compare them. I don't think you can just assume that 30 years in the time loop is the same as 30 years of natural aging. Also, I imagination that what people experience effects how they change. For example if Zorian spent ten years womanizing it might effect him differently then if he spent ten years training his magic. Frankly I believe that this story is to far from reality to make any definitive statements about how the loop might effect his compatibility with woman of different age groups.
