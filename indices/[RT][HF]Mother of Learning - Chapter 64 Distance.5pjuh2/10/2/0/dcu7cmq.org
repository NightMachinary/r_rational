I actually think Zorian would have difficulty being in a relationship with anyone not Open. Either he uses his abilities to sense emotions and thoughts, which would be a rather significant power imbalance in the relationship, or he doesn't, which would mean consciously putting distance between them. He would do best, I think, with someone who can reciprocate.

So.../maybe/ Tinami, but I didn't get the impression that he actually enjoyed her company particularly. They worked together, sure, he respected her intelligence, but that's all.
