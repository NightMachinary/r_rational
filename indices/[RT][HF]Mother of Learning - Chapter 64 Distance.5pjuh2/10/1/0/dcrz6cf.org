um...considering the time loop, how old are Zach and Zorian now? And how old are Akoja and Raynie? I mean, are Akoja and Raynie even of age yet? Like, I was under the impression that the academy students are all high school age, and that at the start of the first time loop Zorian was coming to the Academy for the first time. That would make Akoja what? Fourteen or Fifteen years old, maybe? I'm pretty sure Zorian was 15 at the start of the story.

I mean, to give an example of what I'm trying to say here, a 100-year-old man dating a 300-year-old man seems a little less squicky than a 100-year old man dating a 15 year old girl. Maybe I'm wrong, but the former seems more likely to make for a healthy relationship than the latter.

Zach/Zorian might not just be the One True Pairing. It might be the Only Possible Sane Pairing unless they can drastically extend the lifespans of everybody else after they leave the time loop.
