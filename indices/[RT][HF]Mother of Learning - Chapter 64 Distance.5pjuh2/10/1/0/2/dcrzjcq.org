As for Zach/Zorian please no. I don't know exactly how long Zorian has been in the loop, but it's been a lot less then 100 years. I think it's been even less then ten years, but I'm not sure. Personally I don't really care about a mental age differences so long as physically they are around the same age. I would care if one of the characters was really young like 12 or younger, but 15 is pretty mature. Frankly stories about things like 1,000 year old vampires dating humans beings are really common. It seems fine to me. At any rate even if 15 is to young he could just wait a couple years and then they would be 18. Then it would be hard to find something to complain about.
