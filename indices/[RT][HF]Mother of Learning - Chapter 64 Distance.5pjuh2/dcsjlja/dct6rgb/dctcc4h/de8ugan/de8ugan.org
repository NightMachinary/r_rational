On the subject of teleport points, though, previously the idea of travelling to Koth via teleport chain was dismissed as "too much time waiting for mana reserves to recharge." However, since he now has a simulacrum making the trip anyway, let's actually do some math on it.

Zorian's max teleport range is unknown, but let's assume he can cross half of Eldemar in one jump. Earlier chapters seemed to imply he could [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/49/Mother-of-Learning][teleport all over the country as he pleased]]. Since [[https://www.reddit.com/r/noveltranslations/comments/5pjv30/en_mother_of_learning_chapter_64/dcsglot/][mana costs aren't linear]], he could probably stretch his reserves further by breaking it into smaller jumps, but that's a starting point.

A brief look at the [[http://dodo-ptica.deviantart.com/art/MoL-verse-World-Map-Huge-657220714][world]] and [[http://dodo-ptica.deviantart.com/art/Altazia-Political-Outline-575261642][continent]] maps makes me think that's a few hundred km. Koth is [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/64/Mother-of-Learning][estimated around 7000km]]; the distance from Zorian's home to the southern tip of Altazia is at least 1/7 of that, likely more, so at least 1000km. And "half of Eldemar" looks like about 1/5 of that distance, so about 200km. Let's call it 150 to account for not travelling in a straight line.

So, at that rate, Zorian (actually his simulacrum) needs to make about 50 jumps to reach Koth. How fast can he do that?

Well, [[https://motheroflearninguniverse.wordpress.com/2016/12/13/basics-of-magic-mana/][from the blog]], we know that a very skilled mage, which Zorian is, can regenerate reserves completely in 30 minutes. And the author [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5gipl8/rthfmother_of_learning_chapter_62_improperly_used/daw7fjc/][has confirmed]] that the simulacrum can do mana meditation to increase assimilation rate, so that works. Let's assume he always has to leave 1/3 of the reserves available for the original, though, and sometimes the ambient mana might not support that (I think it's tied to the location of the original, but even he might be out of town sometimes), so let's allow an hour. So, 50 hours of jumping.

The simulacrum [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/64/Mother-of-Learning][needs to sleep, but not eat or drink]]. So let's say he can jump & recharge for 16 hours a day. That will take about 3 days and change.

All he needs is the knowledge of locations so he can teleport there. Which, having made the trip once, he should now have.
