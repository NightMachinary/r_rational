Hi there :)

Hmm, I'm guessing that ZSimulacrum can make a stable gate with Zorian from where ever he reaches by the end of the month, which bypasses the need for teleport anchors. Also, maybe teleport chain locations can be included in the memory packets?

I like how ZZ are following all three viable leads- gating with the simulacrum, the Silent Doorway Adepts, and the invader's Bakora Gate, instead of picking one and following the plot from there. Very rational.
