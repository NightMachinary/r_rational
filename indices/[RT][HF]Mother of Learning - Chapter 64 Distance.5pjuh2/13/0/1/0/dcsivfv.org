From the author's comments on the previous chapter, I think that the simulacrum would be entirely unable to cast spells while cut off from the soul, and would gradually destabilise and disintegrate over the course of a few hours.

And the Black Room operates for more than an hour of outside time. To achieve even a single day of inside time while only an hour passes outside would be a factor of 24, which only the Cyoria Room is capable of. And we know that the Cyoria Room operates for a day of outside time.

So I'm pretty sure that it's not feasible to put one of the Zorians in the box.
