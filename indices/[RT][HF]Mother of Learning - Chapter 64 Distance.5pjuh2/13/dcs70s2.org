I'm a bit confused by the fact that simulacrum doesn't have a range limit. What type does the process of transferring mana from original to simulacrum have? Does Zorian's mana get teleported, gated, or something else entirely? Even dimensional links get strained with range, like we saw with teleport beacons.

Also, how come he can use Black Rooms with simulacrum out, if a Black Room severs all connections to the outside world, wouldn't that destroy Zorian's connection to simulacrum? What would happen if a simulacrum uses a Black Room and tries casting spells inside - where would his mana come from?
