There doesn't seem to be too many options for Zorian, or anyone, to leave the Sovereign Gate physically. I also think that Physics would be against it- the SGate creates a huge amount of matter for a very short, accelerated burst of time that's so small, in order to keep the energy cost low. It would break Irl conservation of mass/energy principle if someone could walk out of the gate. But hey, this is fiction, so who knows.

Zorian speculated that if he escaped from the loop, his soul would snap back to his original body. Zorian also thought that RR would be able to displace the original RR due to his skills as a necromancer.

I was thinking that only Loop Zorian's soul can escape from the Sovereign gate- as explained in the control room. This might set up a situation where Loop Zorian has to possess Zorian Prime- something he'd be well able to accomplish with his mind magic.

He could then manifest himself in a ectoplasmic body, or by remote controlling an automaton. I have a pet theory that Zorian Prime's body would function as a phylactery- without a body of his own, it would be Loop Zorian's only access to essential life force. Either that, or Loop Zorian could have to make himself into a Lich. The simulacrum spell was stated as being part way towards making a Lich spell.

From my perspective as a reader, I wouldn't really care if Zorian Prime got obliterated in favour of Loop Zorian's survival. I'm interested to see if the author goes there for comedic shenanigans. Zorian Prime had a huge inferiority complex over Daimen's excellence, and I think he'd feel very threatened by Loop Zorian being a better version of himself.
