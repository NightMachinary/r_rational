Loop Zorian "I'm you. I can give you 4 years of magic training, every spell you've ever wanted, a bunch of spells that you never knew about, mind magic that will alleviate your social anxiety, a tonne of loot, and loads of spell formulas to make money easy. Plus save all your friends- friendship which you can now have because I'm no longer a social cripple, your own life, and the rest of the country. Just say yes."

Prime Zorian "Sure."

Yeah, there isn't much of a down side, and it's totally reasonable that Zorian Prime isn't going to turn down an offer like that.
