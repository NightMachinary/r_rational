Zorian's simulacrums are incredible well behaved,all things considered! They know what the stakes are- if they can't help Zorian get out of the loop, death is certain.

I can't see Zorian Prime being so easy to manage. I hope we get to see him again from Loop Zorian's perspective. Even though Loop Zorian said that he'd kill the Prime if he had to, I'm hoping that his use of simulacrums has change his mind.

Not really the same thing, as this Zorian has his own (copied, mutilated) soul, where as the simulacrums don't.

That's probably a long way away. It seem like it's going to take a lot of chapters just to get out of the Sovereign Gate. Or just to get to Koth.
