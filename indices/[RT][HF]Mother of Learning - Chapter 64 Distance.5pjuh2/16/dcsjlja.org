What a sweet little chapter. Hurray for ships!

It was nice to have lost of details of the teleport mechanics. I thought that Zorian would put a teleport recall anchor on a charm and give it to Kirielle, then teleport to her when she got to Koth at the end of the month. Range seems to be the limit.

Those secretive spiders. The Bakora Gates have been described as a "network". Spiders should be good a networks, right? Maybe they have to protect themselves from QI and others that use the Gates.

This story has a lot of gates and nets.

Simulacrum Zorian is my new fave character. It's interesting how he's a nested character, just as our Zorian is just a copy of real-world-outside-of-the-Sovereign-Gate Zorian.
