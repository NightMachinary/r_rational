There's room to improve this. He can still pay mages to teleport him, especially on Altazia, and by now he should have an idea of which ones are worth approaching. He could carry mana crystals, either for low-mana areas, or as lightweight universal currency, whichever is more efficient. He could adjust his sleeping hours, so he gets 8 hours where the original is asleep and his reserves don't have to be shared. And I still think he should try resupplying with intermediate gates.
