  make a stable gate

Good point, that's much better than teleporting at this range.

#+begin_quote
  all three viable leads
#+end_quote

Note that they're viable at different times. The simulacrum has to head off ASAP to be useful, the spiders need an early start to allow for the negotiations but not leaving so early that they'd miss out on the Black Rooms, and the invaders' gate is vulnerable at the end of the month.
