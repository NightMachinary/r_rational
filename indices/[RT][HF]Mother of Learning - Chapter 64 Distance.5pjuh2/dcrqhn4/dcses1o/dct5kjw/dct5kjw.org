it might not be the case that Zorian was teleporting to places he hasn't been before w/ Kael. Zorian has personally explored a great deal of that region when he was running away from Cyoria and on Silverlake's requests. so it's possible he simply teleported to the general area and then him and Kael walked the rest of the way (or he really has already been there)

in Ch 32 where Alanic asks Zorian to be a courier, there's no implication that Alanic went with Zorian (he's delivering letters and packages so why go with anyways?). so it's likely that Alanic was only sending him to go to common places or at least close to them
