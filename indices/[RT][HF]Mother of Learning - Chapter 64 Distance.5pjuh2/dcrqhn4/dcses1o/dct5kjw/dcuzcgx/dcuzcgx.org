I agree with both those counts. The time with Kael especially, if he could just rely on Kael's knowledge of the location, they wouldn't have had to walk for hours to get to the graves.

Also, when Alanic was curious about the soul well, he still relied on Zorian for the teleportation, since it was a place Alanic hadn't been to before himself.

My main questions are "how much familiarity is actually needed to teleport to a place?" and "Can Zorian use his perfect-recall memory packets to shorten the amount of time needed to pick up a new location?"

It's not especially clear how much of Zorian's reserves the teleport spell requires. The bit that cretan_bull quoted from chapter 26 only gives us some idea, along with this follow up that was left out:

  He had to wait half an hour or so until his mana reserves regenerated enough that he would feel safe descending into the Dungeon,
#+end_quote

Later in the story, Zorian is able to chain 2-4 teleports to avoid being tracked, presumably without depleting his reserves and leaving himself vulnerable. He also uses short distance teleports in combat, which wouldn't be especially practical if they use up a quarter of his reserves either. Teleporting from his home to Cyoria was probably more mana intensive because of lack of of practice with the spell and distance than the other examples I gave.

My guess is, when it comes to extremely short teleports (within nearby visual range) Zorian can probably manage a pretty high number, say, 20 or so.

When it comes to several kilometers, probably only 6-12 in a row.

When it comes to the range limitation of the spell (150-300 kilometers? Hasn't been made clear in the story.) Zorian can probably only do 2-3.

I still feel like Zorian could learn new locations on his own/with simulacra+memory packets after paying a person to teleport him there initially, then teach the locations to Zach, and between the two of them they could chain teleports and get to Koth in 1-3 days. I think Zorian's current skills in divination and dimensionalism make his spell more efficient, but Zach's greater reserves should still allow for maybe 10 max distance teleports before needing to recharge (30 minutes - 3 hours). But I'd say it's pretty clear at this point that either there's an underlying rule I'm failing to pick up on, or the author simply doesn't want to go this route.
