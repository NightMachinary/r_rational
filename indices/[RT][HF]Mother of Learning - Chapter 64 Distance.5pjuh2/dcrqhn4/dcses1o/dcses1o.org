  I thought the only limitation on teleportation was on distance and that you had to have been there before
#+end_quote

Mana costs scale with distance and the (number/size/mass?) of the things being teleported. Divining the location of the teleport destination is an integral component of the spell, and mana cost scales with the difficulty of the divination. The divination is made more difficult by distance and interference.

Breaking a long-distance teleport into multiple steps makes it more practical, implying distance scaling is super-linear.

The degree to which Zorian finds teleporting to Cyoria's beacon to be less mana-intensive (spending "most of his mana" versus... not) implies the divination is a very significant part of the spell's cost. The divination component may even be solely responsible for the distance scaling.

In Chapter 26 Zorian implies you can't teleport "somewhere you've never set foot in". However, Zorian teleported with Kael to collect alchemy ingredients in places Zorian had not been and Alanic used Zorian as a courier without being concerned about whether Zorian had been to the destinations. At the very least you can also teleport somewhere if you have someone who has been there before.

This requirement seems to be simply a matter of being able to divine the location sufficiently accurately. If you or some other person willing to assist you has been to the destination, that can be used.

Targeting anywhere in the vicinity of a teleport beacon results in a very strong signal from the beacon, returning the location of the receiving area as the result of the divination. This strong signal is easier to use and takes a great deal of skill to ignore if you are trying to target somewhere else. It also interferes with teleportation departing from the vicinity of the beacon.

A recall anchor can be targeted without having been at the destination and allows the caster to teleport through interference. A more complex anchor incorporating spell formulae has a greater tolerance for interference.

The whole "having to have been somewhere before" looks like one of those things beginners are taught that's completely wrong but good enough for most use cases.

Having a really good method of divining the target location may make long-distance teleportation much more practical. Some possibilities are:

- A recall anchor
- The link between his soul and a simulacrum
- The soul marker on a simulacrum
- Some sort of "beacon" spell cast by a simulacrum providing a target for his teleportation, with coordination via mind-magic

  Teleportation had a reputation of being dangerous among most mages. This was because, at its core, the classical teleportation spell wasn't a pure dimensionalism spell -- it had *a substantial divination component that divined the exact coordinates of the location the caster was trying to reach*, and if the caster set up the divination wrong... well, all sorts of weird and unpleasant things could happen. Then there was a fact that some people really didn't like people teleporting into their home and territory and set up wards that didn't just cause teleportation to fail, but to fail catastrophically. Such wards were illegal, but used by a certain type of people anyway.

  Other than that, though, teleportation was a fairly safe and convenient method of transportation. So long as your destination wasn't behind wards. Or underground. *Or somewhere you've never set foot in*. Yeah.

  Ah, whatever, the point was that it could get him to Cyoria in mere moments. Cyoria thankfully had a teleport beacon in the city that funneled travelers into a central location and simultaneously *made teleportation easier (and less mana intensive) for the mage doing the teleporting*. That meant that *Zorian wasn't going to spend most of his mana* on the teleport, which was a very good thing.

  "Excellent. The intruder alarms shouldn't be much of a problem, then," Gurey said with a grin. "Aldwin had this neat trick where he could *turn an item into a teleport beacon of sorts*, and then simply teleport himself to its location *without having to have been there in the past*. I'm sure I can get some innocuous-seeming thing through the door, you just have to cast the spell on it. I don't know how to cast the spell myself, but Aldwin did write it down in one of his journals..."

  "Spell you say? No spell formula involved?" asked Zorian curiously.

  "No. '*Spell of recall*', I think it's called. It's a two-part spell -- you first cast a personal teleport beacon on an item, and it immediately *forges a connection between you and it*. You can then cast the second spell at any time, causing youself to be 'recalled' at the location of the item. According to Aldwin, it was meant to be used for rapid escape -- you cast the first spell on a retreat point and then use the second spell to teleport there if you end up in a bind."

  "Why not use a regular teleport for that?" frowned Zorian. "Sounds like a lot of trouble when a normal teleport will suffice. After all, you've already been to the location you're teleporting to if you're setting it up as a retreat point."

  "I really don't know. You will have to find that out yourself if you're interested," Gurey said.

  Fortunately, during the month-long recuperation, Zorian had come up with an idea of how he could side-step his current limitation as far as teleportation was concerned. Which was why, before descending into the dungeon, he turned one of the large stones he found on the outskirts of Knyazov Dveri into a recall anchor.

  The *recall spell* was outright made specifically for quick retreats, and the link forged between the caster and the anchor ensured *they could teleport out even from areas warded against teleportation*. Well, so long as the wards were basic ones, since those protections simply *disrupted the targeting part of the teleport* rather than inhibiting dimensional warping as such. Consequently, Zorian had a feeling the spell would work to yank him back to the anchor, even though the Dungeon interference.

  He was right... sort of. He had found that past a certain depth, the strain on the link became too much and it snapped. Before that happened, however, the spell worked flawlessly, allowing Zorian to quickly teleport away to the surface. The depth past which it ceased to work was too shallow for his liking, but he was confident he could strengthen the link. Over the next couple of days, he worked to combine several marking spells and his knowledge of spell formula in order to *create a stronger anchor for the recall spell -- one that would allow it to power through any amount of rock and Dungeon interference*. He was largely successful in this, though the anchor object had to be pretty large to contain the final spell formula he designed. No matter, there was no need to make the anchor particularly portable for what he had in mind.

  [Some of this doesn't make any sense,] Zorian complained. [According to you, the Ibasans are transporting their forces straight from Ulquaan Ibasa to Fort Oroklo, then from Fort Oroklo to some unknown point in the Sarokian Highlands, and then from there to beneath Cyoria.]

  [Yes, what of it?]

  [That's not enough stops for an effective teleportation chain,] Zorian said. [Only two stop points *for a journey of such distance*, with the final destination point *being deep underground to boot*? There is no way that's really what's happening. If they were sending letters or small packages maybe, but no way could you transport an army like that. Even if Quatach-Ichl is the best mass teleporter in the whole damn world, *the mana costs for such long jumps would be completely impractical on that scale*.]

  Admittedly, such a small number of stops would do much to explain how they could transport such an army through Eldemar territory without being discovered by Eldemar, but...

  [They're not teleporting in the manner we've seen you do it,] Memory of Sublime Glories noted. [They are using some kind of stone construct to open a dimensional passage between two points. Like a door to another land.]

  "Good. Let's *hurry to the edge of the city so we can teleport* to Lukav's place," Alanic said.

  "There is no need," Zorian said with a self-satisfied smile. "Let's just find a deserted alley and I'll teleport us out straight out of the city. *The teleport beacon hasn't been able to stop me for quite some time now*."

  If Alanic was surprised by his claim, he did not show it. Zorian supposed it was a minor thing after the revelations in the past few days. They found a sufficiently isolated place and soon arrived not far from Lukav's house, just outside the village he lived in.
