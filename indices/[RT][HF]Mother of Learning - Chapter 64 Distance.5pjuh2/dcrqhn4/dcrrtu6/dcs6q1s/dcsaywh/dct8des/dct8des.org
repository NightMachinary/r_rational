Yeah, even after so much loop time, he's not really a team player. Even when the team members are all him.

Maybe his simulacra will eventually knock some sense into him and make him realise that he should treat them as largely equals instead of servants. Better at some things (no need to eat or drink, can't break bones), not so good at others (probably can't survive the loop), but just as intelligent, and he should make less assumptions about being the master. Would love to read about that.
