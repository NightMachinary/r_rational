I agree. Zorian seemed pretty rude to his simulacrum in this chapter, however Zorian /was/ pretty pissed that not just one, but an entire series of simulacra plotted to troll him. And they did so without direct communication between them.

Zorian may not realize it, but he /loves/ schadenfreude, especially toward people who annoy him, so I'm not surprised his simulacra are acting this way.
