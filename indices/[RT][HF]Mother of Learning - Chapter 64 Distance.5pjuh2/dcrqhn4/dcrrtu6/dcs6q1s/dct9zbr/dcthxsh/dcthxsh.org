That's a fair point, I suppose! I hadn't thought of that. I'm not Zorian, but I have to admit I would rationalize with the idea that Extern!Zorian having pretty nearly been (from a within the time loop perspective) stopped in time. With his simulacrums, they're both "people" who've developed at the same rate and have a respect for each other, sort of.

So basically, Extern!Zorian and Loop!Zorian have exactly the same experiences up to a certain point, then Loop!Zorian's continue and Extern!Zorian's stop. That would arguably qualify more as an "addition" then a "kill-and-replace" (to me personally).

But that is definitely an interesting thought. I don't think Zorian himself has thought through the implications of that yet past "I want to get out". It probably helps that he hasn't seen or interacted with Extern!Zorian at all, so he can sort of think of him as a "shell" for him.
