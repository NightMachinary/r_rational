I'm sure that Zorian would love to get out of the loop non-destructively if he can. His original self isn't likely to be much help in fighting the invasion, but he's still a person.

If the only way out, though, involves booting out the original soul and taking over the body - well, without loop!Zorian's intervention, the original would die in the first artillery barrage anyway. Better for one of them to survive than none. Plus the many, many thousands of other people in Cyoria who loop!Zorian may be able to save. And as you say, loop!Zorian is simply a continuation of the original, so in one sense, original!Zorian wouldn't even be lost.

If, somehow, they both survive, that's gonna be a whole new level of interesting. Dealing with simulacra is one thing, but they had all his knowledge and knew that they were ephemeral. How would he deal with a copy of himself that is still grouchy, anti-social, at odds with all his family, and knows nothing about the time loop? Which one is more entitled to be with his family?
