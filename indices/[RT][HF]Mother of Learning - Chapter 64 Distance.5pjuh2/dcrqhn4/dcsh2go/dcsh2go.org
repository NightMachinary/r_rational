  I thought the only limitation on teleportation was on distance and that you had to have been there before.

  Teleportation has range limitations. The cost increases with distance and the amount of people being teleported, and the increase is not linear. Zorian would have to chain teleports to reach his simulacrum, and he'd run out of mana fairly quickly and have to wait for it to recharge. He'd lose a lot of time waiting for his mana reserves to come back, so his progress would be fairly slow, and he'd would be unable to do anything magic-related while he journeyed in this fashion.
