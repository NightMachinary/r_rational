The reminder of Zach's reaction to the Ghost Serpent makes me wonder if he actually did behave like a monster for a time in previous restarts. It would explain why he refuses to let Zorian read his mind, and why he always seems a little uncomfortable when they discuss the ethics of the time loop (at least to me). If it's true, Zach's change of mind is probably somehow connected to the appearance of Red Robe.
