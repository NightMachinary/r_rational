my point was leaning more towards the fact that they don't have an issue at all with winking out. and has never been even hinted in the slightest. death and pain are completely different stories but just dissolving doesn't seem to trigger any self preservation in them. otherwise, why ever dissolve yourself of your own accord if you can stay a little bit longer?
