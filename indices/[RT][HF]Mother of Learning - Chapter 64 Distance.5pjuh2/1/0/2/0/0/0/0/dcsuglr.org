I think the simulacrum fighting the grey hunter didn't like the idea of disappearing/being a sacrificial pawn, and reminded original Zorian of that in a memory packet? That said, they definitely aren't treating it as serously as they could and seem to accept Zorians reasoning / orders if he would accept them himself. So far the only major way they have diverged from Zorian is by getting bored with mundane tasks, which is probably what Zorian would do in their place.
