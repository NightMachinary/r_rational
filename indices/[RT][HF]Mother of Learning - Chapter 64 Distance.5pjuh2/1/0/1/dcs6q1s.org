I think his relaxing of the rules is fair, taking into account his own nature. Even though he's been stuck in the time loop for this long, he still is hesitant to mind search innocent/good people, despite the fact that they're

1. copies of their "real" selves and
2. going to forget it once the time loop resets

While he didn't actually go into this, I think it'd be a fair assumption on his part that his simulacrum isn't going to kill him and replace him, just based on his own rules of morality that he's still been following despite all this time interacting with arguably fake people and experiencing the nonpermanance of his actions.

I also find it fairly safe to assume that the warning given about the simulacrums was based on your average user of them, who tend to be less morally sound.

I do find it concerning that he's having his simulacrums perform tasks that he wouldn't want to do himself at times, though. He does seem to unconsciously have the mentality that they're expendable, which can be dangerous.
