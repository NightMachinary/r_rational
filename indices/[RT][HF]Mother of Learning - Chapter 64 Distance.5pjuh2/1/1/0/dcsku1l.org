Teleport beacon is a good idea. Nice quote research.

That one is out, simulacrum has no soul.

  The teleport beacon hasn't been able to stop me for quite some time now.

The effect which can't stop Zorian is the part which forces incoming teleports to land there (see the first time Zorian teleported with Ilsa). Apparently, this also attempts to require outgoing teleports to leave from the expected spot (I hadn't noticed this before). This makes sense with the teleport transport network described in this chapter.

I wonder if this redirecting/security/navigation aspect is essential to the finding-your-destination aspect, or completely orthogonal. I expect orthogonal, no reason to need that for outgoing teleports - or maybe that is an unwanted side effect?
