if we take the two maps on subsection of Altazia and the northern hemisphere at large, we can get a sense of scale. we can see that Knyazov Dveri and Cyoria/Korsa aren't terribly far apart in comparison to the Altazia subregion as a whole. then when we look at the northern hemisphere, the smaller map of Altazia is tiny compared to the distance to Koth. so, the total number of jumps might be larger than you expect. also reminder that 30min-3 hours for recharge is assuming sufficient ambient mana levels. it might not be that fast in many of the destinations they get to.

tho yea, once a simulacrum is able to reach Koth, chain teleportation is an option. but as mentioned in already, it's not their only option and it'll take some time (maybe a couple of restarts) for a simulacrum to be able to reach Koth so let's explore options while that's happening!
