there'd be absolutely no reason for her to leave the ball into the city and promptly attacked by winter wolves.

maybe a red herring from Zorian (but quite doubtful), but Zorian has already interrogated everyone. Zorian has also shown off too much and Akoja also knows what he's like and capable off (to a minor extent). she has been attending class all the time and also Zorian has already admitted to it being very difficult to keep his magical prowess a secret so what's the chances of Akoja doing the same? for much longer?

Red Robe is also constantly shielded. Zorian can read Akoja's emotions, so she isn't. even Red Robe wouldn't be oh so clever enough to leak emotions of her crushing on Zorian to him while selectively hiding her anger/insanity of him rejecting her constantly before she even had any reason to suspect other time loopers. and what kind of person would constantly ask a person out knowing they're in a time loop and will be rejected?
