Yeah, that would be an interesting character development. He had 30 years.

It was implied that the he refuses to let Zorian read his mind out of a compulsion imbedded by RR. Zach only started using anti mind magic after the Aranea made contact with him. I have a theory that they might have undone some of the damage RR did. I also suspect that Zach has the knowledge of how to control the Sovereign Gate as a Controller, and more about the timeloop, buried in his mind. This would explain how the Matriarch had solid information about this that was in her last mind package.

Maybe it's a bit of both.
