The biggest problem with RR being simulacrum is plot meta. If RR is simulacrum after leaving Time Loop he is merging with original Zach. And after Time Looped Zach successfully exit loop he also merging with the same Zach erasing RR simulacrum memories. That mean no final grand battle, which would be waste plot-wise. Of cause there is possibility of final mental battle of two Zachs (and possibly Zorian) in the Zach's soulspace, but that is too convoluted and would be out of character for ML.
