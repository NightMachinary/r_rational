Yes, all indications are that RR was long gone when Zorian learned that ritual.

I don't buy the Red Simulacrum theory, though. A simulacrum wanting to join the loop would have all of the same obstacles as a regular human being, /plus/ the additional difficulty of lacking its own soul and being tied to Zach's. Since the Gate only cares about the Controller's soul, there is no reason for the Simulacrum's mind and body to be recreated. They aren't part of the template.

A sufficiently skilled simulacrum, maybe with mind magic that Zach has forgotten, might be able to overwrite someone's mind with its own and thus gain access to a body that is in the template. But then, as I said, it still has all the same challenges if it wants to somehow duplicate the Controller marker.
