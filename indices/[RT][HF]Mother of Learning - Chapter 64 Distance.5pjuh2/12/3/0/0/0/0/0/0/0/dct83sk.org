The loop may not work in a way that would allow a simulacrum to be restored, but its worth remembering that the loop doesn't reset or restore souls, it resets minds. That's why soul kill was such a concern. So the Gate could simply restore the current mind state if the soul marker is present. Thus a simulacrum may be able to get its mind restored because it effectively has a marker. It does still need a body, but it's possible that it could overwrite another's mind or possess someone in some fashion that would 'count' to the Gate.
