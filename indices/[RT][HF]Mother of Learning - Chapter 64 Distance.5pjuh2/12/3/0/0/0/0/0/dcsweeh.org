I have to disagree. It has the controller marker because it shares zachs soul. The simulacrum theory provides a good theory to explain two of the major puzzles in this whole thing: how did red robe loop (answer: he shares zachs soul) and how did he trick the gatekeeper into thinking he was the controller (answer: he had zachs soul). He does need to provide a body, but mind magic should do that nicely.

The main downside to the whole theory is that it doesn't explain who sent zach on this to begin with, or what happens when a simulacrum steps out of the simulator. Can he still share a soul and mana through the supposedly incredible separation of the blackroom simulator? The latter is unanswerable by us, but plausibly handwaveable. I also have to wonder why red robe didn't seem all that badass, if he was a clone of zach. Possibly because if he used too much mana then even zach, a veritable fountain of the stuff, would notice.

Other main theory I have is simply that the royals/whoever had a key hacked the artifact, and managed to inject their own agent, red robe. Maybe Damien found another key in his mission abroad. They didn't realize that Zach's genetic marker would always trigger, even with their hack.
