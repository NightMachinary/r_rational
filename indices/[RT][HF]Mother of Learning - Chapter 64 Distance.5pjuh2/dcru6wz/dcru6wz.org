I absolutely loved this chapter. This is approximately the level of detail I enjoy to read.

In a once per three weeks novel, it's nice to have every chapter be very plot-driven, so I can understand people's impatience, however these slower, deeper chapters make me feel the world and its characters feel more alive to me. I really like slowing down to this level of pacing---at least every once in a while, a bit like the interludes in Worm.

I'm very curious what the Adepts decide as well.
