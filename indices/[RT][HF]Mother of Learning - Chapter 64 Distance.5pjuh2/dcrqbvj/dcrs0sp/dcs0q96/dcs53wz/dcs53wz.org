except the church doesn't argue that a soul is necessary for sentience. nor that simulacrums aren't sentient. their whole stance is that simulacrums aren't people in the everyday sense. or, in other words, they're not alive (and in real life definitions, they wouldn't be considered alive either), if we're to change the wording to fit what they mean

as mentioned, it's pushing the boundaries, but if simulacrums were considered people and afforded the same rights as normal people, I'd imagine the spell itself to be a lot more taboo/illegal than it currently is. for one, the caster is basically required to keep it active until death, never allowed to dispel them without it being considered murder. which is basically what Batak mentioned as a minority view before the quote above
