I never said that the simulacrum didn't need the soul? and I was referring to magic that has already been cast but needs upkeep? I don't think anything that I say goes against the things you mention? pretty sure what I said is just a rewording of what you just said. the soul can't think without a body (or at least a mind construct), thus it wouldn't have soul awareness let alone mentally perform any other mana manipulation. my pt there was the if the soul is disembodied, any currently active simulacrums should dissolve at that pt, too (but this is before I remembered that it has been mentioned before that simulacrums can stay active for a short while after the original enters a Black Room)
