[[/u/DCarrier]], too

I meant "need" a little more loosely than [that]. just like a child needs their parent to survive doesn't mean their utterly doomed if their parents die or abandon them (maybe not entirely applicable but puts my point across). at the very least, what I meant was that the soul wont care if the simulacrums are gone but the original body will have an effect on the soul. I'd imagine if the original body is destroyed while any magic is being active (simulacrums, persistent magic, etc. the ones that require active upkeep), that magic will fizzle out since the soul at that point is unable to keep the magic active since it can't think on its own, so it'll basically become inactive, cutting off support for magic

if we go that route of the soul not needing the the body, the body doesn't necessarily need the original soul (though flesh golems aren't really alive so not entirely mirrored).

or to twist it another way, to function properly, the soul and body need each other. a body without a soul can't act (but substitute souls or animation cores work) while a soul can't think/act without a body (mind constructs and w/e else is necessary for liches or a new body can work as substitutes).
