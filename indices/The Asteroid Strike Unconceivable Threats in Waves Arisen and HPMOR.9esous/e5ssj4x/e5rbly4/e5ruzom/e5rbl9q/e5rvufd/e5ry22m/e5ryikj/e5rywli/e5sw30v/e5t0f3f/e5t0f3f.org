I just don't think it's especially interesting though because what would make the Asteroid unusual is it happening to the protagonists, in a way that upsets the story. Asteroids happening off screen aren't that rare. Every time you have a story where "X suddenly dies" and the protagonist has to deal with it, that's an Asteroid for X - but it doesn't break the main story.
