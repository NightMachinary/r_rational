I'd say Riddle saw it coming but he didn't (and couldn't) stop it. the prophecy of world destruction, tied in to the prophecy of his own destruction, was unavoidable. he struggled, and by all merits should have won given his position, but Time conspired to destroy him anyway. Despite all his power and preparation and intelligence he got smashed, twice, by a clueless kid who was Time's Tool. the fact that the bigger asteroid hasn't landed yet - the actual fated destruction - doesn't mean it hasn't impacted the plot.

The revelation that everything dumbledore has done was in response to this prophecy, that Harry's very existance was shaped by it, is a pretty major and startling revelation.

But, I get what you mean; as readers we are brought along for the ride in a smooth manner. it lacks the shock value of something like the Red Wedding; and a "real" asteroid strike should be even worse than that. It should be the white walkers sweeping down unannounced to devour westeros in the midst of its political bickering.

But having no foreshadowing whatsoever is dissatisfying to the reader, and the POINT of the asteroid strike can be made even while it is worked into the narrative in an acceptable way. That is, the reader can be made to understand the pettiness or short sightedness of the human characters' squabbles in the face of an uncaring, overwhelming natural force -- but this doesn't mean you have to forgo foreshadowing necessarily to address those themes. The shock value is a stylistic choice, not about content.
