i get it. I think we are talking about different things using the same label.

You are talking about the stylistic impression or feeling the reader should get when you imagine the impact of an asteroid, or the anticipation of it.

That feeling could happen regardless of the subject matter or content.

HPMOR has a little bit of that feeling but since Voldie=Defense professor is so telegraphed from the original series and the prophecy is somewhat distant and vague, it doesn't have the /emotional impact/ that you imagine being associated with an asteroid.

The OP is saying this sense of surprise WOULD be felt by other characters in the story - such as the students at hogwarts experiencing Harry's "foom", or voldemort being surprised by his defeat twice at the peak of his power. But the reader doesn't experience this.

My interpretation of an Asteroid strike is more of "inevitable and catastrophic events beyond the scope of human control". This can be done in a variety of styles, and is more about thematic content.

all of these can be present in any combination, or not, in a given story.
