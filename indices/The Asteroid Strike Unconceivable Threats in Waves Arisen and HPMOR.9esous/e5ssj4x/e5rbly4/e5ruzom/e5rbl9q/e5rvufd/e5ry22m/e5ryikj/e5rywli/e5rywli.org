For him that was a story about him fighting the prophecy of "each will kill the other", with the plot twists and near deaths related to that. Then on page 240 he's informed that he, his prophecy and his storyline are irrelevant because the real trouble is the kid ending the world.

It might work as a "quest upgrade" if you frame it right, but coupled with that Voldemort lost... Well, I guess you can frame it as a "Won once, got quest-upgraded, sacrificed himself but saved the world" kind of story. But for Voldemort it would have strong undertones of "where the hell /that/ came from?!"
