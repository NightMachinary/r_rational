the asteroid strike to me is the prophecy of world destruction. everyone is carrying on in literary tropes learning magic or being evil or whatever, and behind the scenes a massive unavoidable disaster is hurtling toward them all. Harry's life and ultimate victory are more driven by the unseen actions of dumbledore and fate that got him to that point than his own competence.
