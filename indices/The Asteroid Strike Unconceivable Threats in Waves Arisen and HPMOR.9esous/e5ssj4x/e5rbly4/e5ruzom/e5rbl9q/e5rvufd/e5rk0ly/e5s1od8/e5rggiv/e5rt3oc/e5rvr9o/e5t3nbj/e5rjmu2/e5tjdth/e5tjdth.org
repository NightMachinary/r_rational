I dunno, I think it's worth noting that the prophecy ("the asteroid event") was actually /directly triggered by an action that Quirrell took./ In fact, it was an action which was intended to have some psychological affect on Harry. And Quirrell knew that Harry had great capacity for magic power.

So yeah, learning that Harry has the potential to destroy the world wasn't something Quirrell had thought of. But it's not nearly anywhere an asteroid level of an event, out of nowhere. And it definitely wasn't an event that had nothing to do with the plot. It followed directly from Quirrell's own actions and Quirrell could see that.
