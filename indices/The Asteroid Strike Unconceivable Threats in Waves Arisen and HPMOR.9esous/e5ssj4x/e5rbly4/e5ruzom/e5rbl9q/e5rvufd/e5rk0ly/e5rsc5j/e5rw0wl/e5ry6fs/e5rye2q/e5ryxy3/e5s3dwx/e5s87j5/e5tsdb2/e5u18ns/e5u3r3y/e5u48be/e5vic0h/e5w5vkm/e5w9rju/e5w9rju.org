  we're talking about social problems anyway, that need cooperation to fix. So in a very pragmatic sense, it will help you do that if you don't do the thing where you consider yourself automatically bestowed with better powers of reasoning (even if you may be) because that usually nets you the result that however good your ideas, no one will hear you because they dislike you personally and are suspicious of your motives.

Are you one of those strange folk who are somehow capable of brainwashing themselves into deliberately changing their mind to believe something false? By all means /hide/ the fact you think you're smarter than people to better coordinate with them, certainly, but actively trying to unlearn it? I always find this sort of "you should give up on believing true thing X, it's politically inconvenient" argument puzzling both because I have no idea how you'd go about doing it effectively in practice and because it seems like there are much better interventions that solve the problem without mangling your ability to reason.
