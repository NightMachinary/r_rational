I've mentioned this to people before. FOOMS don't ever look all that impressive from the inside. They are normal progressions of events. Humans were a FOOM event. Out of nowhere the planet exploded with us.

The only people that reliably seem to be properly awed by singularities are those being left behind.

I personally do strive to write stories with asteroids.

But its tricky to do right.

The best i've seen to do it is either much like you've noticed write about the asteroid ands don't tell anybody. Which is what your two examples do. (Along with surprises)

Or you write about the mice who cower. while suddenly the whole world vanishes and is remade around them. Which lets you do more standard drama.

Which is generally what i've seen Charles stross do.

I lile to blend the two personally. Although I think I've succeeded more with fan fiction because you can sort of use standards of the canon as a surrogate for the "dinosaur" perspective in the audience.
