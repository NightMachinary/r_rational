  does not actually demonstrate that "people more clever and better informed than EY" are working on all the major problems, which was the original argument.

Ok, agreed. So let's put it this way - of course I can't /demonstrate/ something this vague (after all, it's not like we can even measure something like cleverness in an objective way). My general idea is, for any given field, there exists a compendium of accumulated knowledge through centuries or millennia of studies by reasonably brilliant people. It seems reasonable to assume such a compendium will be in general superior to the output of a single human, however brilliant they can be, because it constitutes the synthesis (through filtering and selection of ideas, in an evolution-like process) of the work of dozens and dozens of people probably similarly brilliant. Any specialist in a field spends a significant part of their life studying such compendia - significant enough that you simply wouldn't have enough time in your life to get the same level of expertise in /two/ separate fields. So basically, any specialist will probably be only really good at /one/ thing, no matter how clever they are. For any other things, they still can contribute valuable opinions and viewpoints - even occasionally with the benefit of outsider perspective - but they'll also probably have a lots of blind spots, unknown unknowns, and suffer a bit from Dunning-Kruger syndrome. Applying one's own expertise to tackle a completely different field is [[https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/here_to_help.png][very tempting]], but more often than not only seems like a good idea because you're just /that/ ignorant.

  Is actually why anti-science political views exist. I'm pretty sure it's because when there are vested and powerful interests that are inconvenienced by truth, those interests are incentivized to spend massive amounts of resources to trick or mislead people, which includes politicians and their constituents.

  Like, yeah, politics is super important and scientists are not always great communicators, but I have no idea why you'd think that the reason GW is not commonly accepted as true is that there just aren't enough people willing to clearly articulate the problem, and feel like you need to understand Conflict Theory better.

Of course there's actual powerful interests. That's the point, that's why you need to be a good politician to push this stuff. There's /always/ powerful interests. Expecting that all you need to do is spell out the truth and it'll magically stick is naive. To anyone listening who doesn't have the first hand evidence that you do, it's no more truth than what someone else says - it's just a matter of /who do they trust more/. Of course GW is already a difficult narrative to sell to begin with (time scales beyond human scope, requires to go against social inertia, etc.) so it wasn't an easy task either way, but more political savviness could have probably helped. How exactly? I don't know, I'm a scientist myself so probably would have screwed it up as badly.
