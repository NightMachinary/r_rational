  The idea of "high level rationalists" in general also just irks me. It feels like simply sliding back in basic primate mode: find a pack leader, someone to respect and admire, and defer to them. That's the surefire way to creating new problems instead of fixing old ones. Everyone has skills that can be useful, but no one is fundamentally smarter than the problems that we are all victims of, nor the problems themselves exist for want of intelligence. Simple random occurrences can push crowds of rational, intelligent actors into toxic equilibria that will then become unbreakable. It's no one's fault and it's got nothing to do with how stupid or smart the people involved in it are. It could be broken thanks to someone incredibly smart or someone incredibly stupid, on purpose or not, as well. It's a natural feature of complex systems. It's a phenomenon we need to study, prepare for and mitigate, collectively, just as we do with earthquakes.

I can't help but feel that studying and mitigating it would go better if we didn't have to pretend outcomes are completely and utterly independent of intelligence and rationality.
