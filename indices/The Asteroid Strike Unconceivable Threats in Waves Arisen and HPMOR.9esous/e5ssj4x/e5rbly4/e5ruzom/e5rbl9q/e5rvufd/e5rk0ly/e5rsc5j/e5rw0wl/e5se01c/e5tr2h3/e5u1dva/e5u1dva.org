"Under any circumstances, remember, four-fifths of everybody's work must be bad. But the remnant is worth the trouble for its own sake."

My evidence is that society isn't a cesspool of hopeless misery. As a general trend, on an individual basis, lives improve. When something seems gone wrong, people /try/. Not necessarily with the degree of logic and testing that Yudkowsky did, nor necessarily with the available resources but with whatever they have at hand and by whatever knowledge base they possess.

Investigate most homes or workplaces and discover half a dozen gems of jury-rigged brilliance. The same sort of life hacks that pre-dated easy methods to distribute them. The majority of them don't do much more than keep things muddling through, but a few really knock it out of the park.

If we all had to depend on the trickling output of a rare sort of genius, we'd have been doomed a long time ago.
