  My general idea is, for any given field, there exists a compendium of accumulated knowledge through centuries or millennia of studies by reasonably brilliant people. It seems reasonable to assume such a compendium will be in general superior to the output of a single human, however brilliant they can be, because it constitutes the synthesis (through filtering and selection of ideas, in an evolution-like process) of the work of dozens and dozens of people probably similarly brilliant.

  Applying one's own expertise to tackle a completely different field is very tempting, but more often than not only seems like a good idea because you're just that ignorant.

Didn't EY just recently write a whole book on why this argument is wrong? With an example how he single-handedly outperformed the sum of medical knowledge when treating seasonal affective disorder, no less. That's not to say any random shmuck can expect to pull this off reliably, but we /are/ talking about EY in particular.
