I think it's less that it never hit the wheel, and more that the wheel isn't a practical solution /given the other constraints/: namely, that everything has to be able to assemble itself, be made of cells, etc. In order to "hit the wheel" you need to have something resembling disjointed parts, and that's just hard to do while also working within the restrictions of self-assembling biomechanics.
