EY makes a point of showing how bad evolution is as an optimization process in his rationality book. A recurrent example he uses is how the human eye is designed, and how nature developed the wheel only a few times.

He even criticizes the scientific method for not focusing on testing out the most probable theories first, and basically accepting any theory no matter how unlikely to be worth tested before more statistically likely theories, while at the same time seeing this type of failure as good and productive.

EY says this makes it slower than it should be, and wastes resources. He says it's not an optimized system, it's just an inherited crude system we inherited from people from centuries ago, but we are too stuck in our ways to bother taking the time and effort necessary to fix it.

I believe he's mostly right on both cases. Evolution could, create the most effective methods for something like cell architecture given infinite time, I just find it unlikely to have happened already given it's low ability to go back and optimize designs that already work because this would risk a period of lower performance and to an extent make this sort of thing risky to the individuals and make said trait less common.

i.e if to optimize your eye evolution has to risk a high rate of blindness for a period, this trait will rarely be passed on, therefore your eye will not be optimized. If to improve or optimize anything in evolution involves any potential limited time downgrade evolution will actually make it more unlikely to happen.

Just as an FYI purple is a better color to absorb uv light, in fact most organisms that filled this niche were purple before the green ones showed up. The green ones won because their by product, oxygen, was toxic to it's competitors. In this case, for random reasons the less efficient method won evolutionary wise.
