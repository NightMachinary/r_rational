Where Eliezer makes the point that you can't expect the accumulation of expertise into a field of knowledge that's smarter than any one participant if there isn't a mechanism that /specifically/ rewards this, and how to spot fields in which this mechanism is absent.

Also notable for the rejoinder that everybody misunderstands efficient markets - just because you can't profit doesn't mean that other people can profit; it might just be the case that /nobody/ can profit in which case the market is doomed to mediocrity. Markets hit the ceiling, but the ceiling might be low.

(My personal pet peeve: /philosophy./ I have unlearnt how to think of free will in a noncompatibilist fashion, and so the fact that philosophy as an institution has not yet converged on strong compatibilism as the authoritively correct explanation for free will makes me embarassed for the field. It's obviously correct, guys, get a clue!)
