  Maybe those attempts have existed at the very beginning - and have been completely outperformed by the current paradigm.

True, but note that building a cell lets you, in theory, chain together dozens of decisions that only pay off in combination. Evolution can't really do that, it can only retroengineer it by coincidence.

IMO for cells as we know it to be optimal, the efficiency ceiling has to be either low or reachable by many different paths, so that almost every beginning state can be moved into a near-optimal endstate by near-monotonous incremental improvement. Evolution never even hit the wheel; it certainly would never have hit the nuclear reactor. Such structural and systemic improvements that are so plentiful in the macro would have to be near-absent in the micro. This just seems intuitively implausible to me, though I acknowledge that's not much of an empirical argument.
