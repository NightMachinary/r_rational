If one is really motivated, they'll have no trouble coming up with a plausible-sounding argument against intelligence being relevant to anything. And there's certainly a ready motivator of "it's unfair some people are just innately better able to reason in general and there's no way to change that". However when it comes down to it and you need to pick one of two people to do something that is crucially important gets done well and all you know about the candidates is that one has IQ two standard deviations above mean and the other two deviations below? Vague philosophical arguments don't give much of a way out there, you just pick the person more likely to succeed, i.e. the one with the higher one.

Certainly if the task is narrow and concrete and you have data about performance of people on that exact task, you pick the one better able to perform it, regardless of what their IQs are. In a lot of situations, however, you need to answer something along the lines of "which one is better able to learn new skills" and ignoring rationality and IQ there would be shooting yourself in the foot. No matter how public-relation-unfriendly the reason of "that person is just better able to reason, I expect they'll have an easier time achieving success in a new field" sounds.
