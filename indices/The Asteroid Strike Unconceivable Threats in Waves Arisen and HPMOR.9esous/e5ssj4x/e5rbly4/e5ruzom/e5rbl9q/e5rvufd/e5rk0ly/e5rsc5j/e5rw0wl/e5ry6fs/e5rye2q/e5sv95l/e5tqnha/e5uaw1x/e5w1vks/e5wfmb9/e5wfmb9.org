Reducing poverty and eliminating diseases and increasing access to healthcare are all areas where, as far as I can tell, intelligence or rationality isn't the only limiting factor on success. It's like global warming. Everybody is smart enough to understand it is a problem, and yet progress is still slow, because there's only so much rational evidence can do. Many of these problems are problems because of how hard it is to convince people to work together, or to coordinate, or to trust each other, or to put aside there differences and actually try and solve the issue. And yes, rationality would definitely help in achieving all of this, but I don't think that just because somebody is the most rational, they could do it better than anybody else.

If EY could jut sit in a room collecting evidence and thinking, and then post a solution and have everybody try it without question, then I would agree with you. But getting anything done on a societal level (especially when it comes to actually solving big problems on a large scale), requires so many other skills, abilities, and traits that I can't automatically agree that he would be better at it than everybody else who has tried. The only one I can think of off the top of my head right now isn't the best example, but perhaps one such trait is emotional resilience. Getting people to work together and trying to actually solve these kinds of problems in the real world is often stressful, and it's no use being the most rational if you burn out halfway through the process.

Essentially, I think there's a reason that the actions of climate scientists, despite probably being, on average, more rational than politicians, aren't really the important factor in stopping global warming, while the actions of politicians are. Rationality is an amazing methodology, and probably one of the most important traits to have when it comes to solving problems, and it's probably a trait that enhances the effectiveness of all your other traits as well. But if we're talking about solving societal problems on a large scale, than I don't think it's importance is so dramatically more than that of other traits, that we can judge someone the best possible societal repair man based on rationality alone.

Essentially, I think that if solving the problems you mentioned was a matter of pure rationality (to the point where we would appoint the problem-solvers based on their rationality alone), then they wouldn't still be problems. The professions that work on these kind of things could definitely benefit from rationality training, but I think there's probably a reason that these kind of jobs aren't already full of the most rational people, and it probably has to do with the kind of people capable/willing to do the work (and not just the thinking).

To get even more down to it (because writing 'essentially' again would just feel bad): teaching rationality is a great thing to do, and I definitely think it benefits the world. But I think there are reasons EY choose to do that (as well as the other stuff he does), instead of becoming a politician/charity worker/healthcare policy maker/etc..., and those reasons would probably effect his ability to the job dramatically better than the people already doing it.

So while I am willing to concede that EY may be smarter and more rational than most of the people who have been trying to solve these problems since history began, I don't think I agree that that would automatically make him better at solving them.

Also I feel like making this kind of equivalence is fundamentally wrong. Like saying some expert in a different field would be better at EY at rationality if they just bothered to learn it, because there success in an adjacent area of expertise proves they have the potential to also dominate his. It just feels disrespectful. But of course that's just a feeling and the weakest part of my argument, so if you choose to reply to anything, don't reply to that. I just felt like I had to put it out there in case anybody could help me put it into better words.
