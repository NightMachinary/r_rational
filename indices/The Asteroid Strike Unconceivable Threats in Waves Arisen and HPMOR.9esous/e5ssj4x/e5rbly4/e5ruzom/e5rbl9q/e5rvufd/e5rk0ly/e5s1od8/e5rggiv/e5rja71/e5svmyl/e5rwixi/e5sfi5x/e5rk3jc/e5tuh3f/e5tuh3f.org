I got curious and did a little digging into some old threads from PM_ME_RATIONAL_FICS. I'm now 100% certain that's EY's alternate account, and probably the writing experiment thing he mentioned in his comment. There's a lot of clues, but what convinced me is that he writes about HPMOR like he's the author, not like a reader (he tries to hide it but it's there). And they have the same sense of humor too. :)

What cracks me up is he commented on his pseudo thread in his normal account saying how awesome it was:
