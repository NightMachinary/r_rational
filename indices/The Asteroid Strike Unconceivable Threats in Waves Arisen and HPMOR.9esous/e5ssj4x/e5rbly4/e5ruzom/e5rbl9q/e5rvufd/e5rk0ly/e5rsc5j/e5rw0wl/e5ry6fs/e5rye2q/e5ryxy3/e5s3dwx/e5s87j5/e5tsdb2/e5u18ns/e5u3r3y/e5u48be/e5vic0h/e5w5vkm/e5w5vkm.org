Sure, but:

1) some of these problems are just too complex to solve from first principles with just human level intelligence anyway, so anyone is almost equally powerless in front of them if alone;

2) we're talking about social problems anyway, that need cooperation to fix. So in a very pragmatic sense, it /will/ help you do that if you don't do the thing where you consider yourself automatically bestowed with better powers of reasoning (even if you /may/ be) because that usually nets you the result that however good your ideas, no one will hear you because they dislike you personally and are suspicious of your motives.

In general, I think it's important to stay grounded, and more important, to keep ourselves from being prey of our natural instinct to seek idols and heroes to defer to unconditionally. We do our best if we can both neither overestimate our own ability nor other people's.
