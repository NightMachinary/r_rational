  I'm just saying, I don't feel like the reason why more people don't try the SAD cure with lamps is because they can't logically come up with it.

And if that's all rationality was, we wouldn't be having this discussion. But as I've repeatedly been trying to point out in this and other threads, just thinking of something is /not/ what it means to be rational or "clever" and that's why I don't actually think that there are people on EY's level working on all the Major Problems in the world.

This:

#+begin_quote
  A less rational or knowledgeable person might just enter full Dunning-Kruger mode and string their house with lamps without ever wondering about that - and just happen to stumble upon the solution.
#+end_quote

Is exactly why I've been pointing out that it's not enough to say "anyone, even a child, could have thought of that." The process that EY went through is what's important and what makes it a valuable indication of what marks "actual applied rationality" as a powerful domain expertise, and different from just any other arbitrary form of "intelligence" or knowledge base or skillset.

#+begin_quote
  It's not like any type of intelligence is a single D&D like stat anyway - there's a complex landscape of possible skills and axes which will give you bonuses in certain situations and maluses in others. That's what I meant, more or less.
#+end_quote

I mean, the Wisdom stat also exists for a reason :P

#+begin_quote
  You could say I prefer having in mind a gaussian curve of rationality where EY may place somewhere around plus three or four sigmas above the average, maybe, but not reduce the gaussian to a binned histogram and give big bold names to the classes.
#+end_quote

Sure, and of course it's not that binary, but in my mind after a certain (arbitrary and fuzzy) cutoff it makes sense to apply labels that indicate distinction, even on such fluid and multidimensional measuring systems. I don't notice any negative knock-on effects in my own mind from doing so, but maybe an outside perspective could point them out.
