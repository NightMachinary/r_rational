  all you know about the candidates is that one has IQ two standard deviations above mean and the other two deviations below?

Well, that's one /big/ difference - big enough that it'd probably be apparent just by chatting with the people in question for five minutes. We all have a fuzzy notion of intelligence. The problem of putting a number to it is that it removes part of the fuzziness. If you told me that an IQ of 120 proves that someone is more intelligent than one with an IQ of 112 I'd say that's probably bullshit.

  you need to answer something along the lines of "which one is better able to learn new skills" and ignoring rationality and IQ there would be shooting yourself in the foot.

Sure, but again, we do that sort of judgement all the time. We don't need IQ for that. Also, here we're talking also about evaluating /oneself/, where the interest isn't in getting the job done as well as possible, but in evaluating one as high as possible (because we just enjoy thinking highly of ourselves). So they're different situations.
