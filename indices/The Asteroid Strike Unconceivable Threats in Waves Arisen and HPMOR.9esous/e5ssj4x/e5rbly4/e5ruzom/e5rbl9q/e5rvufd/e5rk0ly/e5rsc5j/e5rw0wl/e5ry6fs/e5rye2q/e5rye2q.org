And EY isn't?

We've all got flaws and blind spots. Sure, not everyone in science is a novel Einstein or even necessarily able to think out of the box, but that's also a function of how /big/ science is these days - it's an industry in itself. And even people with blind spots can be very good at cracking /some/ topics and problems. For example, a genius solution to global warming would be worthless without the political ability to get it accepted and espoused by the general populace (in fact, I would say this is a big problem science has had with GW and other topics: relying too much on scientists who want to do everything and are unwilling to engage fully with politics has led to piss-poor communication choices that have chipped away at its credibility, making anti-science instead a viable political position to simply harvest certain forms of discontent).

Ultimately, whenever the solution to a problem is a sort of "spherical chicken" approach, that's not a solution at all. As EY himself aptly put it, if the people who wrote stories about conquering the world with smarts were really /that/ smart... they'd be conquering the world. Which isn't possible with sheer rationality and careful planning exactly because the world doesn't work like a story and throws, not necessarily asteroids, but at least micrometeorites at you /all the time/.
