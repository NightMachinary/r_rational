Personally, I think The Waves Arisen was written by someone in the rational community who is one of Eliezer's friends (most likely Alicorn IMHO) and had him act as a beta-reader. The unknown friend wasn't too comfortable or didn't want the publicity and decided to be anonymous and let Eliezer have the credit for writing it.
