Well Eliezer did start working on the problem when almost nobody else was doing it .So if it is posible to do basic research , and Eliezer was doing it before most others.Then he was doing research that had to be done before everyone else.

Its difficult to judge what is going to be useful in the end.Even if his most important contribution ends just being getting a lot of people interested on the topic that still would mean that there was low hanging fruit to be had there .There were some actions that nobody was taking , no people more clever and better informed than" Big Yud" on any and every particular subject had been beating their head against this Greatest Problem before he did .And hes currently doing research that nobody else is doing and is not obiously wrong.I wouldn't be surprised if in future ai safety textbooks contain things Eliezer wrote.

You can have expertise in game theory statistics machine learning and all other related fields anyway.And on ehat people are doing in the field , what problems are open and what has been tried etc.

And the research is not mostly resoning by analogy right now .There is reasoning by analogy yes , but like there is concrete research to be done about formalizing things and Eliezer seems to be working on that so dunno.\\
If you mean about the forecasting stuff and that kind of thing maybe , but that seem to be mostly on the question of if ai safety is important in the first place ,and seeing how deep mind is hiring ai safety researchers i would say the consensus is slowly moving towards that.Of course if you rely on big consensus as an heuristic to believe things or not you are not going to be convinced yet.And its not that its a bad heuristic , but then you are not going to be able to judge new things whith few researchers on them, only the obviously true stuff, and sometimes yo will still be wrong.If you want we can discuss in more detail what things you think are likely to be true , what things you think we cant know now and how likely it is that other day(now I'm a bit sleepy and I'm not sure how coherent this will look tomorrow so I'll just turn off my phone and go sleep)
