I can personally attest that the answer is yes, because I have never watched or read /any/ of the source material. Not a single comic frame, not a single cartoon second. And I still quite enjoyed The Waves Arisen.

Though, to be fair, I had already read a number of other Naruto fanfictions. Pro tip, [[/u/velorien][u/velorien]]'s Lighting Up the Dark is a rather confusing starting point if you've never read any Naruto at all before.
