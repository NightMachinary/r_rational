Epistemic status: layman theorizing.

Note that life exists. How close do you suppose plant cells are in their performance to the limits imposed by the laws of physics?

I suspect that "grey goo" invokes the wrong association by its association with the somewhat discredited notion of autonomous mechanical nanobots. It may make more sense to instead think in terms of making a plant or bacterium "grey gooey." Given how fixedly our biosphere's chemistry seems to have been determined by a few initial random decisions, it does not seem safe to assume that there aren't much more efficient and competitive ways to build cells out there.
