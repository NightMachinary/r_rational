I like to think that genius is not primarily a property of a person, but an event in a group. Our narrative tropes make us see genius as primarily manifesting as a property of some individuals, but I argue that those narrative tropes are misguiding our perceptions. The narrative framework of individualism restricts our vision. The framework of individualism is widely spread and especially dominant in the english speaking western culture (this might be a meme I believe blindly without evidence; i'm not very familiar with other cultures, but lets just roll with this for now), and it guides our planning and structuring of the real world. Individualism might not have been the smartest framework to choose, but it was chosen anyway, and as a result we as Humanity have constructed a simulacrum reality that reaffirms the assumptions of Individualism, most visibly by electing singular Presidents to lead our companies and state governments. So in that sense, Individualism offers the proper mental tools for understanding reality, but I argue *IT'S NOT ENOUGH!*. It works locally, but another framework would bring forth more favorable results globally.

BIG CHANGE follows the flims of the leaders of big organizations, such as state machines? That's the simulacra reality of individualism.

Even BIGGER CHANGE follows when *an idea gains critical mass in the psychic medium that is the collective of human brains*. When people work in unison, guided by an idea, it can create change much larger than any single leader could (realistically) achieve. United masses of people don't just lead countries, they form them, destory them, create new modes of operation that are unlike any other state apparatus seen before.
