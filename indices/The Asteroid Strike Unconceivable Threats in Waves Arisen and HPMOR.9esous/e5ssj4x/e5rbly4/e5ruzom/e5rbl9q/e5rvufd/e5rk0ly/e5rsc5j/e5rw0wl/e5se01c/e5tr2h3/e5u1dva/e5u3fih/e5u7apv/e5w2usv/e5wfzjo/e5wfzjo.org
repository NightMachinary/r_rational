Would it have helped if I'd capitalized Everyone? A whole rather than a universal singular?

I agree with more or less everything you say here, and continue to think that our difficulties are of perspective rather than fundamental. Worse, they're probably rooted in my own unclear or poetic phrasings.

I agree, for example, that perspiration for its own sake is often a waste. My point, and I conjecture Edison's, is that ideas are cheap. My addition to his quip is that genius is born more from its context than its singular inspiration. There's no Einstein without the crucible of physics thinkers and experimenters in late 19th century Germany. And if that set of schools and labs hadn't developed there, it might very well have developed somewhere and somewhen else and some other brilliant kid who in our world grew up thinking about boiler pressure maintenance or mechanical calculation or market forces or animal husbandry would have been imagining travel at the speed of light...

...and been willing to do the work of proving it, instead of the work of becoming an inventor, or a farmer, or an entrepreneur.

  That doesn't mean FOOM doesn't happen on less exponential scales. It just means you need more of them, lacking such world-breaking force multipliers. Not one Protagonist that no one else can be, many protagonists that anyone might be... but not everyone.

I endorse that completely, and am quite content to end the conversation there.
