  Note that life exists. How close do you suppose plant cells are in their performance to the limits imposed by the laws of physics?

For stuff like photosynthesis, for example, probably skirting it, given their other constraints. Even in the lab we can't do much better with photochemical devices than the top performer in the plant kingdom (sugarcane, ~8% conversion).

  Given how determined our biosphere's chemistry seems to be by a few initial random decisions, it does not seem safe to assume that there aren't much more efficient and competitive ways to build cells out there.

Maybe those attempts /have/ existed at the very beginning - and have been completely outperformed by the current paradigm.
