I'm glad we're closer to agreement then we were, but this:

  I guess what I don't appreciate in your way of framing this is that I think you're giving too much credit to EY's skill and less to his position as someone who simply had different incentives. For example, the SAD thing didn't require being especially clever. It just required $600 dollars. A child could have come up with the same idea. The reason why medical science did not test for it has nothing to do with the lack of clever people.

Still feels like a massive missing of the point. Most people with SAD have $600 dollars or more. Furthermore, "a child could have come up with X" is honestly one of the most insulting ways to dismiss something someone cleverer than you managed to do, just because it seems simple in retrospect. It's not /always/ about cleverness, as you point out, position and incentives are important too, but unless you've done something similarly impressive along the same axis, there are a million people sitting in armchairs happy to gab about how /they/ could have come up with that or how they had the /same idea/ as that writer or director or inventor or entrepreneur or whatever, but somehow it's still just one person who was the first to make the thing and a million of them who were nowhere near actually doing so.

So to me, the reason why medical science didn't test for it has /exactly/ to do with a lack of clever people, if "clever" is being used in the same way I use it to describe high level rationalists. I mean I wasn't the first one to use the word "clever" for that, I'd rather just say "rational" when in a community that I hope would know what I mean when I use that word. I guess this may not be as much the case as I thought.
