Adjusting zoom or projection on the map makes the goalposts seem to move, but they really are right where they used to be. I'm not entirely sure we disagree about anything.

In much the same way that it's all small stuff that we oughtn't sweat, the greatest problems engineers come into contact with are ultimately the Greatest Problems they solve. That's the slow chipping. Significantly compiled and iterated life hacks is indistinguishable from progress. All that cheating and yearning and working /as a whole/.

I didn't mean that somebody in particular is more clever and informed about everything than Yudkowsky - though, to be fair, somebody probably is or has been - I meant that /everybody/ is. It's a lousy narrative and, yes, an almost certainly unfalsifiable one. There's no protagonist, no antagonist, no beginning or ending. By the time positive change finally happens, it's not a big surprise... it's all but inevitable.

We lionize the individuals who take the last step, but they're only slightly more responsible for giant leaps than Neil Armstrong was for stepping on the moon. They stand on the shoulders of some giants, sure, but also the shoulders of millions of hardworking, hardthinking human beings.

Genius is .01% inspiration and .99% perspiration and 99% everybody else inspiring and perspiring. Yudkowsky inspires me, as do others in the community, and "Big Yud" really was meant to be affectionate rather than mocking... but so far as I can see, FOOM doesn't work the way it does in his stories.
