Sure. Here's actually an interesting summary about it tho':

[[https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2015/09/16/is-iq-a-predictor-of-success/#2286d0063604]]

Specifically, sure, IQ correlates with certain outcomes. However IQ is a metric that attempts to measure intelligence, but specifically, it gauges /certain skills/ (I've never taken one of the professional tests it mentions there but I suppose it's usually spatial, verbal manipulation, etc.). So it's more like a metric of a subset of specific skills that can have real-life applications. In addition, correlation =/= causation, so of course there's a whole other host of possible failure points there. For example you could argue that IQ-related skills are "signallers", things that our specific society takes as representative of good intelligence and therefore will lead you to be hired more, get more promotions etc. regardless of whether those things /actually/ contribute to what you're doing.

What I mean is, there's lots of trappings in trying to capture something as general as intelligence. Even if you define intelligence as that one thing that helps you achieve success regardless of the circumstances (and that's already damn vague), then you have the problem of defining success itself. If people with higher IQ get jobs that pay more, for example, does that mean success? Someone could argue "but people with high IQ are also on average more depressed and suffer more from various forms of mental illness, so /surely/ that's a sign their lives are actually worse!" and that success is to /not/ suffer from depression, something that IQ does not help with.

In other words, I find philosophically much less troublesome to simply talk about differences in skill on specific field. Sure, there is a quality people possess that makes sense to call "intelligence" and that usually manifests itself as a high level of skill in a number of different but usually contiguous fields (note: not necessarily /the same/ fields, since different types of intelligence exist; a very intelligent politician or lawyer couldn't do a scientist's job, nor the scientist could do the politician's). But I still think the best way to think about it is through the ways in which it manifests itself, rather than the unknown quantity itself. And I don't particularly think we'd benefit much in practice from a good way to measure it. Almost all of our problems come less from a lack of understanding of "who's better than who" and more from a lack of agreement on what "better" even /means/.
