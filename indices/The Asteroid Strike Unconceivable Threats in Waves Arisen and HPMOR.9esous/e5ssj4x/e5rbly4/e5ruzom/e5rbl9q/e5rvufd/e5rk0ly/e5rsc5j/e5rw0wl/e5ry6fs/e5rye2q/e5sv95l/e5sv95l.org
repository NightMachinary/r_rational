I think trying to equate intelligence with rationality is a mistake. If rationality is your measuring stick for intelligence, then of course EY comes out on top. The man is so dedicated to rationality that he's written books on the topic; it is one of his areas of expertise.

This, in my opinion, does not make him instantly smarter than expert scientists. Rationality does not equal intelligence; if it did than EY would have been stupid to write the Sequences, because there would have been absolutely no point. In the same way it's possible to be a fool and still be rational, I think it's perfectly possible to be a genius, and irrational.

I don't find it at all implausible that a genius physicist can be smarter than EY, and a better physicist than EY ever could have been, and yet still be less rational, because to me 'smarter' doesn't have much to do with 'more rational'.

Judging intelligence by rationality is unfairly biased towards EY, because while other smart people have chosen to specialise in biology or chemistry or physics, he choose to specialise in rationality. It would be like judging intelligence based on skill in Primatology, and then claiming Jane Goodall is smarter than Einstein. Technically correct, if that's the scale you're using; but it's the scale that's the problem.
