Now and then I'm accused of having written something that doesn't appear under my name, and sometimes in one of those cases somebody talks about "Eliezer's style". There is much in this world that I cannot confirm or deny, but I'll at least say this much: I did at least once go and write a piece of online fiction to test my writing skills, not under my own name. This work isn't what you could call prominent, but it is sometimes casually mentioned in somebody's "Best Of" list. To the best of my knowledge nobody has ever accused Eliezer Yudkowsky of having written it. Because I tried to write in a different style, and so far as I know, it totally worked.

Nobody responding to this message will mention the work in question either, unless somebody throws out an enormous shotgun list - say, a list so long as to contain at least 9 other works. The writing didn't especially sound like Eliezer, or rather didn't sound like you imagine Eliezer to be; so you didn't notice.

(Of course I could be wrong about that, in which case I will privately be very impressed that you called it; but needless to say I shall not confirm nor deny.)

It is also the case that I've at least once been falsely accused by more than one accuser of having written an online fiction piece to which I in fact made no contribution at all, not even beta reading or advice about plot or dialogue adjustments. Authors sometimes try to do the same things I tried to do in HPMOR, and then somebody thinks that's *Eliezer's style* instead of a particular set of writing goals... so it goes.
