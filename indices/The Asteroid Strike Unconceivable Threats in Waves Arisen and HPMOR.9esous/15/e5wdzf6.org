I think there is a great external shock at one point: when he gains the rinnegan, and so all elements, super-vaporizer thing, perfect control of his chakra, the power to extrude an indestructible black material at will, and whatever secrets the previous user had. granted, he's already more-or-less foomed by then, having gotten the chakra-factory thing up and running, but it's still a sharp change. also, I don't get where the 'the ninjas worship television' and "and has come to reform the ninja world with...a deluge of cheap Japanese electronics," things- none of what he does is electronic that I can see, and what are the ninjas supposedly worshiping that's like television?
