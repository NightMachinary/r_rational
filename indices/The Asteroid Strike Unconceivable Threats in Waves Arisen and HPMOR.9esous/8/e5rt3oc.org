Honestly, I don't think there was anything deeply meaningful about Harry achieving immortality for everyone. He just happened to stumble, mostly through luck, on an immortality machines that its previous owners had locked away without ever using its potential.

Real life generally doesn't have that kind of immediately-exploitable world-changing potential lying around. I think Twig is a better take on world-changing transhumanism.
