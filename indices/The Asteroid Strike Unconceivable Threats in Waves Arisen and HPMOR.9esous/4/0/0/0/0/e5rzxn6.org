It certainly was an event that changed the direction of the story, but those aren't unheard of in stories. No one died and no previous buildup had to be radically discarded; they only had to revise their objectives. By comparison, even the [[#s][GoT spoilers]] is a much bigger upset.

The "asteroid-like" event would be something that completely runs counter any narrative wisdom. Something where for example a long time spent to build up a character and the reader's affection towards them is willingly thrown out of the window because of a completely random occurrence unrelated to anything else happening in the plot. Like, dunno, the Hogwarts Express crashes from one of those very tall bridges due to a structural failure. Everyone dies at the beginning of Year 2. The rest of the story is the professors dealing with guilt and grief. Also, Voldemort is now unopposed and triumphs. End of HP.

Stuff like this isn't usually /done/ in stories because it would just sort of ruin their point. It would make them empty, purposeless, meaningless. Like, y'know, real life. But exactly for that reason it would also be interesting to see it happen, sometimes. It's definitely nothing like the Voldie thing though. First and foremost, a true "asteroid-like" event would be /enraging as fuck/. Like, you could see the cleverness afterwards, but the first reaction of any invested reader should probably be to just slam the book against the wall.
