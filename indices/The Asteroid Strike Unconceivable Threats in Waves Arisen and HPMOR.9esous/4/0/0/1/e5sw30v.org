I thought it was about how the prophecy was an Asteroid to Voldemort. Not a perfect one, mind you, because he would have known prophecies existed, but still an Asteroid, since they still seem really rare in-universe.

Voldemort was going about his life, on his own personal mission, just kind of mucking about here and there, killing a few idiots, maybe planning to take over a government or two. Nothing special. Nothing that hadn't happened a thousand times before him, and would continue to happen long after he had died. He was like a T-Rex, hunting and killing and, while limited, still essentially the master of their own destiny.

And then the Prophecy happened, and nothing else mattered. Nothing else was important, because this was Happening now. There was nothing he could have done to avoid it. There was nothing he could have done to predict it. And once it happened, there was nothing he could do to escape it. From Voldemort's point of view, the Prophecy being made was like an Asteroid; a sudden, incredibly impactful event that cannot be combated, avoided, or even predicted.

All the events of HPMOR are just Voldemort trying to fight the Asteroid, and failing; proving once and for all just how futile it all was. He was like a T-Rex, roaring at the Big Rock. Powerful and terrible in his own way, but ultimately irrelevant in the face of such overwhelming force.
