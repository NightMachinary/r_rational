I don't know, I feel like the point would be exactly to be unexpected, even at the cost of it being frustrating.

I'll make an example that's basically the exact opposite trope. I read a novel once, "The Desert of the Tartars" (also translated as "The Tartar steppe") by Dino Buzzati. The novel is about one officer who moves to a border outpost in a god-forsaken place, serving as a guarding post against possible invasions by these roaming barbarians, the Tartars. The guy goes on with his life in this place, small accident happens, and there's always an atmosphere of /tension/ - like the Tartars are going to attack at any moment, and things will get dramatic.

And then they never do. Or rather, they do at the very end, when the protagonist is old and ailing and dies in his bed without even getting to see them.

Reading that novel felt... incredibly frustrating. It wasn't a /pleasant/ read. But at the same time, through the unpleasantness, it delivered its message (about basically the pointlessness of wasting your life in wait of grand events that may never come to pass, or in service of bogus causes) extremely well. So a similar thing I could see for a "true" asteroid story. It wouldn't be a fun read, but it still could be powerful.
