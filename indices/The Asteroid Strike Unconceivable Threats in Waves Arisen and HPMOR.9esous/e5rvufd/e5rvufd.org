I frankly disagree with anything in HPMOR being an "asteroid strike". HPMOR followed very much narrative convention in its core structure: it had a hero, a villain, a challenge, foreshadowing galore, a final reckoning. While the way we get there is very different, the fundamental structure isn't all that different from the original HP books: Harry and Voldemort are fated enemies, linked one to each other, and in the end one /has/ to defeat the other - and he does. That's not an asteroid. Neither are the concerns about Harry destroying the universe, which are mostly a plot device, and potentially sequel fuel.

It would have been an asteroid strike if Harry had /actually/ inadvertently brought forth the collapse of a metastable void state with his partial transmutation experiments, thus obliterating the Earth and producing a lightspeed expanding bubble of annihilation, and leaving all plot threads midway through.

I agree that this would be an interesting way to end a story. Hard to make it not feel a blatant troll, and perhaps it would be more fit for a short story than a novel-sized one, where the investment of the reader would grow a lot before being frustrated so blatantly, which would make the whole experience just really unpleasant.

BTW, it's not exactly rational, but this reminds me of /Inuyashiki/. A superhero manga where [[#s][Inuyashiki ending spoilers]].
