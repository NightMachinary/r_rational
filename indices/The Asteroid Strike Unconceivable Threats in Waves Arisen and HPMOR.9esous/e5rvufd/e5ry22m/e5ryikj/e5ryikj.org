It still wasn't. An asteroid to Voldemort would have been /a literal asteroid hitting Voldemort/. This was Voldemort pointing his telescope at the sky and spotting an asteroid hurling towards his position, giving him time enough to plan for its arrival (in a way that conveniently set up his own eventual defeat). It wasn't sudden, it wasn't disruptive of the plot, it was a perfectly normal occurrence, a plot twist, but not one that killed the complexity of the story or completely upended its narrative structure.
