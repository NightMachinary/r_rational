I disagree with your examples.

You took the concept of an outside-the-context event causing a world-breaking catastrophe. You even used a proper hypothetical example ('epic' fanfiction ending half-way).

Those two aren't such examples.\\
Those are the stories that have their amazingly intelligent and brave protagonists go on their quest to change the world, and ultimately succeed, totally at that.\\
Both of them use the rules available in the world. Used cleverly and lucky enough, but that's it. Jinchuriki's, versatile and powerful jutsu, ton of magic spells and unexplored magical properties of the world... yeah, all of them are part of the world. Local world. No need to explore the deep space or other realms for those.

If we went with dinosaur theme, we'd see this kind of example by a new, super-proficient and incredibly aggressive organism taking over earth.\\
Improbable? Yes. Impossible, given what dinosaurs experience (in their collective lifespans if not singular lives)? No. New species and mutations emerge all the time (given large enough timescale).

What examples could work?\\
[[https://fictionhub.io/story/the-metropolitan-man/][The Metroplitan Man]] would work, if only partly. Superman breaks known physics in many ways, after all. It's not as catastrophic (especially given his minimal interference), but outside-context none the less.\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20][HP&N20]] also works, if still on a smaller scale. He's not of this realm, and his abiltiies baffle anyone around him. Give a lvl 20 mage such a journey, and you'll see a /real/ meteor impact.

My point is that meteor strike should come from /outside/ what we know. Outside all the known rules and plots.\\
Like Naruto continues his uplift work but suddenly an army of nano-chakra-bots come and raze all his work because alternate universe Orochimaru decides it's a good idea to conquer the multiverse.\\
Or you have a rom-com-drama and somewhere after protag's first kiss Rick just teleports into his room then liquifies and sucks out his girlfriend's spine because her genes make for the perfect ingredient of a delicious coctail.
