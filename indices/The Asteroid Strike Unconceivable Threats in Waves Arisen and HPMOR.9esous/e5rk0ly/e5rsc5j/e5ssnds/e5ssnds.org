This, and also, can we please collectively agree cut it out with the taunting "Big Yud"? He's a real person.

I understand there are often different social norms for politicians and public figures (although i question whether there should be, i accept that there are). But while he has a lot of clout on this corner of the internet, he /isn't/ a politician, or powerful public figure, nor has he hasn't hurt anyone or advocated for any very bad things. It's really not nice.

Personally I consider using playground taunts like that as a sign that the person speaking shouldn't be taken seriously.
