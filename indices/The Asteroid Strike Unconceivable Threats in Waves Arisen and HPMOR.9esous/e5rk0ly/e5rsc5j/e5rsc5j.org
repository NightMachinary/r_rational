This is also really well said. Probably the only part of your post I have serious disagreement with (on a "claim about reality" level, I actually totally get your taste preference too, a /large/ part of me also would have much preferred an HPMOR where The Prophecy never happened) is this one:

#+begin_quote
  People more clever and better informed than Big Yud on any and every particular subject have been beating their collective heads against the Greatest Problems since before anybody knew what time it was. They continue to.
#+end_quote

I have very low expectations that EY is not actually smarter than the vast majority of people, even those trying to solve the Greatest Problems. This is not a statement about the limits or lack thereof of EY's current domain expertise, or current capabilities or skills or knowledge about any particular fields. I don't agree with everything EY says, and obviously think he would be even smarter and more clever if he could clone himself and learn all the things he doesn't know he doesn't know and then merge to integrate it all, same as anyone.

But if you've met many of the Serious People of the world and think they're remotely as actually-clever-and-sane-and-intelligent as EY, I'd love to meet the ones you're thinking of, because the ones I've met are marginally-smarter-than-average at best, and most have either lucked into wherever they're at or leveraged a particular set of expertise at a particularly opportune moment.

Like, there are a lot of super clever and intelligent people throughout history and the current world, and some are on EY's level and some are even higher, but this line just rubbed me the wrong way. It assumes a level of intelligence and cleverness that I have failed to see in most people who are in charge of institutions. I don't mean to imply there aren't /good reasons/ for that, or that many of the world's hard problems /really aren't as simple as depositing one EY into the equation would help solve,/ but I wouldn't rule that hypothesis out until it actually had a chance to be tested.

(This isn't as specific to EY as it sounds, btw, there are others in the rationality community and outside of it that I think are far cleverer than the majority of people in positions of power and prestige, and that's an important failure mode to pay attention to in considering why the world is in the state that it's in)
