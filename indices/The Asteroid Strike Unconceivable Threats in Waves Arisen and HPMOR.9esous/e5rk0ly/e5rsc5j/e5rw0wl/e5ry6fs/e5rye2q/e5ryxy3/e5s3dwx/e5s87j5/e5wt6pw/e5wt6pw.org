I just read the first chapter of the book. One of the main points is that you CAN expect civilization to perform well in situations where the incentives are correct, and that relying on experts in those cases is a good idea. Even in his first example with the Japanese monetary situation, he was just assessing economics bloggers, not coming up with a new idea himself.

​

I think the original statement stands, that there are other competent people that are working on the big problems in any given field, and collectively the top experts in a field are going to be better than him in their area of expertise.

​

That doesn't mean there aren't opportunities to make improvements all the time! Obviously the world isn't anywhere near optimal. But thinking EY is somehow unique in being able to come up with novel solutions is hero worship I doubt he would approve of.
