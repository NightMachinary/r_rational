FWIW Dunning-Kruger's original claim is normally misinterpreted.

#+begin_quote
  The critical point to note is that there's a clear /positive/ correlation between actual performance (gray line) and perceived performance (black line): the people in the top quartile for actual performance think they perform better than the people in the second quartile, who in turn think they perform better than the people in the third quartile, and so on. So the bias is definitively /not/ that incompetent people think they're better than competent people. Rather, it's that /incompetent people think they're much better than they actually are/. But they typically still don't think they're quite as good as people who, you know, actually /are good/. (It's important to note that Dunning and Kruger never claimed to show that the unskilled think they're better than the skilled; that's just the way the finding is often interpreted by others.)
