Feh. If you're Richard Feynman sitting in a strip club, "I'm the smartest man in this room" is very much a safe bet. Granted, not many of us are on that level, but telling those who /are/ that they must genuflect and constantly try to find reasons to believe otherwise seems childish.

  Plus, as a general rule: facts speak louder than words. If you think you're smarter, and you want people to acknowledge it and follow you on that account, start by doing something that proves your skill and earn their respect. After all, if all you have is just a high propensity for abstract thinking without any real skill to apply it to, you don't really have much except for potential. What really moves the world is getting things done.

Obviously "I'm smarter than you" isn't much of an argument, unless you actually have evidence to back it up. Once you /do/ have the evidence that demonstrates that you /are/ in fact better than someone at something (where said something can perfectly well be domain-general ability to learn and reason about novel things to achieve useful results), attempts to conjure up false modesty just look like inept politicking.
