I'm not saying that useful research can't be done. I'm more saying that at this point no one's opinion is necessarily /especially/ more valuable than others, because there's still no AI safety experts with actual practical experience around. We don't have Dr. Susan Calvin. Everyone is just speculating, thinking by analogy, and drawing their own conclusions. It's a fresher, more open field, one where people are still roaming the virgin plains and colonising them, is what I mean.
