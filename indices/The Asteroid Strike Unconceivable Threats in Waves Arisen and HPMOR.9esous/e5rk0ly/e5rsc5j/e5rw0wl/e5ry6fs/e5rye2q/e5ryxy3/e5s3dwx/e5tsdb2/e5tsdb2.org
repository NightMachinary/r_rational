I feel like most of what I'd respond to this with has been said by others now, but I do want to repeat from my first post:

#+begin_quote
  This is not a statement about the limits or lack thereof of EY's current domain expertise, or current capabilities or skills or knowledge about any particular fields.
#+end_quote

I feel like you've missed my cruxes, if you think the things you're saying in this post are things I disagree with or are arguing against. The main point I'm making is that assuming that "there are experts in other fields who are more knowledgeable about those fields than EY" is not the same thing as them being more clever, and while ultimately EY will never be able to accumulate as much knowledge in multiple fields as he will on his major focuses, one of them being rationality is actually far more useful to such cross-domain analysis and problem solving than practically any other domain expertise.

It doesn't automatically make him /right/ or /knowledgeable/ or anything like that when talking about other fields. But he still very often more insightful when talking about other fields in a way most other "smart people" don't when stepping outside their domain, and his rationality/cleverness is why.
