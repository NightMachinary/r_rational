Heh, quantum collapse is an old pet peeve of mine... I'm reading right now a long book about the Solvay conference of 1927, which basically was the tipping point that made that idea prevail. An interesting (if technical) read on how much personal politics and circumstances can shift the course of science: [[https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0609184][Quantum Theory at the Crossroads]]. I'm doing this in preparation for a talk I will give on some modern developments of pilot wave theory, so... you may imagine this is a topic close to my heart.

However, I think some freedom of pursuing even seemingly unlikely ideas is useful. Sometimes the unlikely idea can be a weird road to a great one. If you read the book, you'll find a lot of weird roads that were taken to get to modern QM - it's not like one day Schroedinger woke up and dreamed his equation into existence. The obsession with trying to maximise efficiency along the lines of only supporting the most sane-sounding research which seems to promise the safest returns is /exactly/ what has generated the modern publish or perish setup, and for all we know, could be a major contributor to the current dearth of breakthroughs physics is experiencing.
