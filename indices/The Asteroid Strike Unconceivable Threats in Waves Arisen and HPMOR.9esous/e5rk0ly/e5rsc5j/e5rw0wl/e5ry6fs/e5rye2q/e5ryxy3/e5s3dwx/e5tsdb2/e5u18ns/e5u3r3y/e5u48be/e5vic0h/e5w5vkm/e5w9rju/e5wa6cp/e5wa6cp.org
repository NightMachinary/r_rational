It's not really about convincing yourself, more about keeping a healthy level of doubt and inner dialectic, IMHO. The moment when you're too self-assured about being smarter than everyone in the room is the moment in which you're sure to stop being so. So, you try to falsify the "being smarter" thesis all the time. "But what if I'm wrong?" can't be the dominating thought in your head - that'd be paralysing - but it /has/ to be in there somewhere at all times.

Also, and this may sound very cynical, but yes, if you /really/ tried to deceive people about something, the first thing to do would be convince yourself of that something too. However I don't think I try to do anything like that. I'm neither that cunning nor that modest. All I'm doing is conceding that no matter how smart I may think I am, by definition, wherever I have a blind spot, I won't see it. So anyone might be able to help me fix that blind spot, because their sight there might be better than mine. Intelligence isn't some kind of number where greater beats lower all the time on any battlefield. There's plenty of things I tend to be really good at with a tiny amount of effort, and plenty of things I tend to be absolutely awful at even if I put my heart and soul into them.

Plus, as a general rule: facts speak louder than words. If you think you're smarter, and you want people to acknowledge it and follow you on that account, start by doing something that /proves/ your skill and earn their respect. After all, if all you have is just a high propensity for abstract thinking without any real skill to apply it to, you don't really have much except for potential. What really moves the world is getting things done.
