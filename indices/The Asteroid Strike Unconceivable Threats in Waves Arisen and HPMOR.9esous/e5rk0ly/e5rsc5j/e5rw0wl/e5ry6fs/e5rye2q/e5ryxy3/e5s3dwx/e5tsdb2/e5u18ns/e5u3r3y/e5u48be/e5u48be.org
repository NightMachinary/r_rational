  Still feels like a massive missing of the point. Most people with SAD have $600 dollars or more. Furthermore, "a child could have come up with X" is honestly one of the most insulting ways to dismiss something someone cleverer than you managed to do, just because it seems simple in retrospect.

I'm just saying "clever" is the wrong axis. It's insulting to suggest that all those people lack the intelligence to deduce that if "some light" is helpful, then "more light" is even more helpful. In fact, a more clever person could know more about non-linear functions and start making up excellent rationalizations for why that might not be the case. I am confident that EY would back me up on this. Rather, it makes far more sense to think that everyone is falling prey to the $20 note fallacy: if it's been on the ground for so long, /it must be fake/. EY wasn't the only one clever enough to try it. He was the only one who actually shrugged and went "why the hell not" (the only one /that we know of/, I might add; maybe other people did similar things and didn't document it. And we'd still need to replicate his findings in a more controlled study to confirm it isn't just placebo or some unrelated effect that did the trick). Which is in itself a quality, but it's not "cleverness". More, like... willingness to break the mold? Unconventional-ness? Resistance to peer pressure? It's a social intelligence thing, not a smarts thing, though it often happens that science-smart people /also/ possess this trait. In fact it's a trait that might be /disadvantageous/ in some contexts. So EY may be able to use it positively to help his girlfriend with her SAD, but he also might be affected negatively by it when he comes off as too smug or self-assured to others, because going along with the majority is a powerful bonding mechanism important to social trust. It's why utilitarianism isn't quite as popular as virtue ethics.

I'm not saying that EY is not clever either, of course. Just that this specifically wasn't one situation where that aspect was the prominent one.

The idea of "high level rationalists" in general also just irks me. It feels like simply sliding back in basic primate mode: find a pack leader, someone to respect and admire, and defer to them. That's the surefire way to creating new problems instead of fixing old ones. Everyone has skills that can be useful, but no one is fundamentally smarter than the problems that we are all victims of, nor the problems themselves exist for want of intelligence. Simple random occurrences can push crowds of rational, intelligent actors into toxic equilibria that will then become unbreakable. It's no one's fault and it's got nothing to do with how stupid or smart the people involved in it are. It could be broken thanks to someone incredibly smart or someone incredibly stupid, on purpose or not, as well. It's a natural feature of complex systems. It's a phenomenon we need to study, prepare for and mitigate, collectively, just as we do with earthquakes.
