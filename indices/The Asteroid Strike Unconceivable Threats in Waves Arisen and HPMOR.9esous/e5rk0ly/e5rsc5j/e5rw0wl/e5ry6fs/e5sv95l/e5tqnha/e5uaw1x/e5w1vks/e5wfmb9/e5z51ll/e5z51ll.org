  So while I am willing to concede that EY may be smarter and more rational than most of the people who have been trying to solve these problems since history began, I don't think I agree that that would automatically make him better at solving them.

This is pretty much /endthread. I feel like my original comment has been taken entirely too far in multiple directions, when what I /actually objected to/ was simply the assertion that people who are cleverer than EY are working on all the Major Problems :P

I explicitly said that this /doesn't mean/ he, currently as he is, would automatically be better at solving them all, only that I'm not willing to reject that hypothesis out of hand.
