  The actual comment I replied to was, if I remember correctly, talking about how even distinguished scientists can be limited in their rationality; and I think that saying that just because a talented scientist seems limited in their rationality means EY would be a better scientist than them, unfair.

Sure, but that's not what I said :P What I actually said was "This does not by any means make them stupid or incompetent, only limited in things like their ability to apply epistemological rigor to their beliefs and carefully assess complex systems and social dynamics with minimal prejudice or bias."

The real crux here seems to come down to what we define as Major Problems in the world. Since the original point I was arguing against, that there /aren't/ many people smarter than EY working on them, and you think that within particular domain expertise there are, then defining what they actually are is important.

If your perspective is that pure scientific research in fields like chemistry and physics and so on is the actual bottleneck for solving all the important and major problems in the world, then you're right. Award-winning scientists are probably pretty good at the epistemological rigor thing, within their own field.

If my perspective is that there are far more major problems in the world than pure scientific research is currently trying to address (so, complex problems like reducing poverty and eliminated diseases and increasing access to healthcare and so on) then I think I'm right.

Unless you /also/ think that not just award-winning scientists but also politicians, NGO leaders, entrepreneurs, etc are smart enough in their limited-field rationality to be more capable than EY in identifying the problems in their fields and coming up with solutions, in which case, again, I see no evidence of this from what I know of the major players trying to tackle major problems in the world.

Again, it doesn't make them dumb or incompetent. But it doesn't make them capable of actually outperforming a version of EY that was a domain-expert in their field. By my definitions, that makes them not /actually/ more clever/rational/competent. The "better informed" part often goes with the domain expertise, but honestly, it really doesn't always. And again (again) that doesn't mean there aren't /good reasons/ for that, like "they're too busy dealing with the politics of their position to actually inform themselves about what's actually true and useful to solving the problem they're working on," but that still doesn't justify the original claim.
