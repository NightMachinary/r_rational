Aaand you lost me again :P

Sorry, but I think we really are disagreeing about something, and it's something rather important, so I'm going to go on a bit of a rant.

I don't think your narrative is "lousy" in the sense you seem to mean it, as in unattractive, I think just the opposite: that it's far /too/ attractive, just in a different way. It's doing the opposite of the "Genius Hero Saves The World" narrative, and I have even less reason to believe it is remotely true.

A snarky and sad part of me honestly wants to grab your head and turn it toward the world to stare at what's actually happening and be like... come on, friend. Have you MET the average person? Because as the saying goes, half of all people are dumber than that.

Yes, there's beauty and love and genius in unexpected small moments and individual hardships and the grand interwoven tapestry of society and so on. But no, that doesn't mean what you're saying is true. And I feel mildly annoyed that I have to point this out, because it feels vaguely like being gaslighted if someone tries to insist that everyone is "X positive thing" and I have to be the one willing to say the obviously-true-thing that makes me sound like an asshole, which is that no, they aren't.

Not everyone is actually smart, or clever, or whatever. Even taking into account individual specialties and skills, objectively no, they aren't.

Not everyone is actually physically beautiful "in their own way." Say what you will about subjectivity of beauty, we can actually measure this and in every meaningful way, no, they aren't.

Not everyone is actually interesting or meaningfully unique. Any combination of arbitrary and near-infinite features may be technically unique, but when it comes to determining how much attention people are willing to actually give each other, no, they aren't.

And not everyone is actually contributing in some way to the solving of Great Problems. That just doesn't match my observations and experiences. Great Problems are Great because they are /hard/ and life very rarely works like movie scripts where plucky salt-of-the-earth heroes solve problems that the smartest people struggle with. Small localized optimizations, yes. Worldwide problems, no. You need smart people for those, and smart people are /rare/. Even intelligent people are not as rare as actual, usefully smart ones. And "rational" ones are even rarer. I wish the world was different, but it's not.

If you're using the "shoulders of millions of hardworking individuals" thing to mean that those smart people need a whole society to make their coffee and beds and pencils and computers and shampoo and food and car and everything else that they use day to day, yes, of course, but that is absolutely shifting the goal posts from "People more clever and better informed than Big Yud etc etc," and this conversation would be resolved if you would just admit that instead of trying to find ways to make it still apply by changing the argument completely.

Yes, /of course/ we shouldn't mistake the popular and visible face of an accomplishment as the only person who contributed to it. But that's a strawman, and if you think the original goal post hasn't shifted because every tiny bit of inspiration and perspiration adds up to the big wins, that's just... wrong. A millions of people have spent literally billions of dollars on charities that accomplish nothing but help thousands of people have jobs that they can be proud of but which nudge the world toward an optimal place absolutely zilch. And that's being generous and not assuming they do more harm than good.

Genius is NOT 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration. It's important, yes, massively important, but you know what? A lot of people are working their asses off every day and they're not doing anything new or interesting or important to anyone outside their own life, in any way that affects the state of the world or helps on-net. "Genius" loses all meaning if we reduce it to 1 part per 99ths hard work. That's not the world we live in.

99% of everybody else is NOT inspiring. This is a false narrative that makes everyone sound like the heroes working together to save the world, and I get why it's an important weapon to fight against the also-false narrative that there's some Protagonist upon whose herculean singular efforts the world turns, but it's taking things way too far and avoiding the rather obvious truth:

There are MANY protagonists. Each fighting in their own way, attributing their own genius, to their own causes.

But they are NOT common, they are NOT the majority, and if people think they are, if people think little optimizations that make their own life easier or maybe help out their family or friends or coworkers is "enough," then they cede and abdicate and excuse themselves from the actual heroic responsibility to take up the /really/ hard work, of pushing themselves /beyond/ tiny local optimizations into the actual, commonly-used-and-much-more-sensible-definition of the originally used phrase, "Big Problems," which are not solved by a billion people working hard in their own separate directions, but a relatively small handful of people working cleverly at the right time, in the right place, on the right problem, and not giving up until it's actually done, and the world is meaningfully different as the result of /their/ genius and effort in a way that's intrinsically different than anyone else on the planet's own genius and effort toward their own local optimizations.

If your main objection is actually this:

#+begin_quote
  but so far as I can see, FOOM doesn't work the way it does in his stories.
#+end_quote

Then sure, of course not, because /magic isn't real./

That doesn't mean FOOM doesn't happen on less exponential scales. It just means you need more of them, lacking such world-breaking force multipliers. Not one Protagonist that no one else can be, many protagonists that anyone might be... but not everyone.
