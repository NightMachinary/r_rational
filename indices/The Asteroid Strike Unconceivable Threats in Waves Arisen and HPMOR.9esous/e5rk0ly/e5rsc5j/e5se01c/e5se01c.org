You don't see them because most of them aren't out making public noise. It used to be that spreading information was difficult because the technology to do so was awkward and expensive. Now spreading information is difficult because it's so cheap and easy that it's hard to distinguish signal from noise.

Like evolution, general societal advancement isn't a perfecting process. Improvements are invented and reinvented over and over until one mutation happens to reach widespread use, and those tend to favor the novel and the sexy.

I'm not talking about politicians, yes, but not scientists or philosophers either. I'm talking about everyday schlubs like [[https://equilibriabook.com/][this guy]], curing his girlfriend's SAD without actually managing revolutionize anything. Things like this happen /all the time/, mostly by people who don't write books about it.

Engineers, [[http://www.kiplingsociety.co.uk/poems_martha.htm][in the broadest sense]], are out there keeping everything running smoothly, innovating as necessary, and generally sustaining the status quo /by anonymously undermining it/. A few make the right sort of noise at the right time and their practices are adopted. The rest remain anonymous forever and once they're gone some other engineer has to reinvent the wheel.

The accomplished and celebrated are so because they were good at self-promotion as well as being good at whatever else they managed. Compare Bill Gates to Linus Torvalds, and then to Dennis Ritchie. Compare Thomas Edison to Nicola Tesla, and then to William Stanley Jr. And every one of those people is more celebrated than most.

The folks in charge of institutions are good at getting promoted, regardless of whatever else they do.

We will never know the names of most of the "more clever and better informed" people beating their heads against the Greatest Problems because most of them won't succeed in anything other than local improvements, and most of them aren't trying to get noticed, and vanishingly few would achieve revolutionary change even if their ideas were adopted.

They chip away at the stone, and we move a few micrometers further through the tunnel towards the light.
