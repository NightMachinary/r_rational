  Why is it that people are so certain The Waves Arisen was written by Eliezer?

I mean, the short version is that I disagree with you on this:

#+begin_quote
  the writing style isn't particularly like HPMOR.
#+end_quote

The pacing, the style of humor, the themes... it all reads like EY to me. Like, this bit, right at the beginning:

#+begin_quote
  This work was created in part to explore a more haphazard approach to writing, the results of which can only be evaluated in the light of strangers' feedback, so leave your thoughts in the comment section to cooperate in the acausal trade that is this story. That goes double for anyone who can discern why in their case it should go double. Defectors will receive an empty box as due reward.
#+end_quote

It's not didactic in the same way HPMOR is, but I feel that's also true for Three Worlds Collide.
