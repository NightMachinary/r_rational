This seems very unlikely. PMRF was fairly credentialist, and in the end fled from controversy over a post along those lines. EY would neither write that, and if he was he would just post in on FB or LW or whatever. (I could go into their other differences, certainly I have my own suspicions about who PMRF is, but this is the biggest.)
