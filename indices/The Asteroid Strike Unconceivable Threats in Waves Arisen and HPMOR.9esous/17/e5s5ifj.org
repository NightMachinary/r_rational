  (I got an A in literary analysis in school. Well, I got an F, but I interpreted it as an A.)

  (I also got an F in topology and tried interpreting that as an A. It didn't work.).

This is by far the funniest thing I've read all day, and had I not written this message I'd be reasonably confident that it would be the funniest thing I read all day. Now that I've written this, some people would be interested in proving me wrong so if I (say that I) predict that I'll see something funnier, it would make it less likely for me to see something funnier and if I (say that I) predict that I would see something funnier, it would make it less likely to be so. Of course after saying the above people may try to outsmart me and do the opposite of what I claim to expect them to do in response to my action, but I'll want to outsmart them so this goes on ad infinitum. As such, I would not make any explicit predictions, but please send me funny stuff.
