FOOM isn't an acronym, it's shorthand for [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity][the Vingean Singularity]]: a hypothetical historical moment when superintelligence reconfigures technological evolution to the point that it's no longer comprehensible within the preexisting framework.

I'm using it slightly more loosely than that, as the process of breaking the fictional world that rational fanfiction often aspires to.
