/shrugs/ Personally I've found that even accomplished and celebrated scientists and philosophers are /incredibly limited/ in their rationality. This does not by any means make them stupid or incompetent, only limited in things like their ability to apply epistemological rigor to their beliefs and carefully assess complex systems and social dynamics with minimal prejudice or bias.
