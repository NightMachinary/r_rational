  "there are experts in other fields who are more knowledgeable about those fields than EY" is not the same thing as them being more clever, and while ultimately EY will never be able to accumulate as much knowledge in multiple fields as he will on his major focuses, one of them being rationality is actually far more useful to such cross-domain analysis and problem solving than practically any other domain expertise.

Honestly, I've been reading "Inadequate Equilibria" now (approximately 60% in, thanks for the link!) and I feel like what he's saying comes across a bit better to me because it sounds like a more measured claim. He never puts things in terms of "X is more clever than Y". In fact, in almost all his dialogues, "people are stupid" is Simplicio's argument. He talks about systemic failures that happen /regardless of how clever the people involved are/. In fact, if you have a broken enough system of incentives, the rational people who are however looking out mostly for themselves might just run with it better than the others. A very good rational scientist might be /amazing/ at putting out high impact factor publishable papers and still not produce great science - because they'd just have optimised the ability the system they're in is /really/ selecting for.

I don't have a problem with believing this sort of thing. My mom isn't a rationalist of any sort, and she actually sometimes pulled off better diagnoses than our family doctor for me when I was a child using information available to amateurs, in a time in which we didn't even have the internet.

I agree with EY's arguments on "modest epistemology" and how it can fail. It is a topic in fact dear to me and that I see discussed a lot in my bubble in some of its specific realisations (for example, there's a certain doctor in Italy who has built a fame out of heavily criticising the anti-vaxxer movement but has soon transformed from an educator into an arrogant prick who positively touts and promotes a universal Argument from Authority - basically arguing that if you don't have a degree in medicine all you should ever do is shut up and listen to your betters. This obviously is largely seen as a very stupid and harmful approach by sane people, as it effectively harms the overall credibility of medicine even more when it does happen to actually fuck up). I guess what I don't appreciate in your way of framing this is that I think you're giving too much credit to EY's /skill/ and less to his /position/ as someone who simply had different incentives. For example, the SAD thing didn't require being especially clever. It just required $600 dollars. A child could have come up with the same idea. The reason why medical science did not test for it has nothing to do with the lack of clever people.
