Isn't what? Incredibly limited in his rationality? Quite frankly, if he is, I'd love to see your example of someone who is less so.

I feel like you're throwing the goalposts across the field. We've gone from

#+begin_quote
  people more clever and better informed than EY are beating their heads against every Big Problem
#+end_quote

which is the claim I objected to, to

#+begin_quote
  even people with blind spots can be good at cracking /some/ topics and problems
#+end_quote

which I agree with, but doesn't address the original point, and

#+begin_quote
  As EY himself aptly put it, if the people who wrote stories about conquering the world with smarts were really that smart... they'd be conquering the world.
#+end_quote

Which is rather a massive step to leap to, cleanly dodging the point that /no one/ is currently conquering the world on their own thinking, which means penalizing EY for not doing so (or whatever the metaphor "conquering the world" is acting as substitute for) does not actually demonstrate that "people more clever and better informed than EY" are working on all the major problems, which was the original argument.

You have to actually demonstrate that EY is stuck with spherical chicken approaches before you assert things like "EY isn't fixing X therefor EY can't fix X," and even then you would not have proven that people more clever and better informed are working on fixing X.

Also, kind of off topic but I'm not sure this:

#+begin_quote
  relying too much on scientists who want to do everything and are unwilling to engage fully with politics
#+end_quote

Is actually why anti-science political views exist. I'm pretty sure it's because when there are vested and powerful interests that are inconvenienced by truth, those interests are incentivized to spend massive amounts of resources to trick or mislead people, which includes politicians and their constituents.

Like, yeah, politics is super important and scientists are not always great communicators, but I have no idea why you'd think that the reason GW is not commonly accepted as true is that there just aren't enough people willing to clearly articulate the problem, and feel like you need to understand Conflict Theory better.
