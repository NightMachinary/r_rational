  I'm just not sure a unique way to determine which theories are more probable exists. Of course, in some cases it's obvious. If I meet a new phenomenon, I first try to explain it with existing models than with some novel never-heard-before energy-conservation-violating new quantum theory of matter.

You are correct. But a lot of scientists get fixated on these more unlikely theories and waste time and resources, and when proven wrong they are told what they did was good and productive. He says he himself could have wasted a decade with this if he hadn't been lucky.

EY argues that you can find the most likely theories to work using Occam's razor / it's updated version Solomonoff induction..

He even has a series of articles criticizing how silly it was for our physicists to accept quantum collapse for as long as they did, while some physicists today still accept it. Even though it goes completely against Occam's razor.
