There are things we can know about what an AGI will be like and there is a lot of obvious basic research to do.

You are just making some assumptions about what can and cant be known about what true ai would be like ,but thats not something trivial that you can easily determine without actually trying to do basic research .

Maybe it turns out its not posible to do usefull research before we know how to make human level AGI .But we have reseach first to figure that out , you cant just decide that it looks like we can't.

Have you actually tried to figure out what kind of useful research could be done now before concluding that its imposible?

All fields have to start at some point.Ai safety its just a new one , that happened to start a bit more than ten years ago whith a few people that included Eliezer and the organization he founded.

At some point someone has to start doing basic research that no one has ever thought of doing for a field to start.But If what you want its authority and amount of scientists that agree, the field has been growing for years.

It never was literally only Eliezer anyway .But now other groups of people like Open ai are doing ai safety research .

And there is also this paper for example [[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.06565.pdf]]
