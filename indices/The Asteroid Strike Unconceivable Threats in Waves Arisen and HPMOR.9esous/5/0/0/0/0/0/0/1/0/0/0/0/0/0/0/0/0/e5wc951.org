Being better than someone at something is a much more specific and verifiable claim though. I guess that's also my problem with talking about smarts or intelligence: it's too vague. It feels like talking about a panacea, a meta-skill that will just apply to pretty much anything. I'm not saying it doesn't exist, but it's not as clearly measurable. If I play chess with you ten times, and beat you 8 out of 10, "I'm better than you at chess" doesn't sound like an outrageous claim or a boast because it's far more rooted in evidence. As long as I don't act like an ass about it, you'll probably easily accept it too without much argument.
