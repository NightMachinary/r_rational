Oh, I'm definitely not equating rationality with intelligence. I value rationality far more. The ratio of people skilled in rational thought to people who are "just" intelligent is massively lopsided, and it's my belief that this is /why/ so many problems in the world remain problems. Because it's /not/ enough to just be intelligent. It's super useful and valuable, but for the really hard shit in life, intelligent people struggle almost as much as anyone else, in my experiences.

So I strongly disagree with the idea that rationality as an "area of expertise" is a poor measuring stick or a domain expertise that's as unrelated to general evaluations of people's value toward solving problems as other domain expertise, like primatology. Frankly I'm not really sure what you even mean when you think of rationality, if that's how you see it. Some list of memorized biases? Some convoluted and esoteric philosophical position? That's not the rationality that EY has learned and developed and taught, and it's not what I've been trying to teach at ESPR or SPARC or in my own story. It's a set of methodology for /determining what's true/ and /figuring out what works/, above all else. It's /hella/ more useful than any single other domain expertise, even if those domains are /still obviously necessary/ to become educated on to solve problems in their fields.
