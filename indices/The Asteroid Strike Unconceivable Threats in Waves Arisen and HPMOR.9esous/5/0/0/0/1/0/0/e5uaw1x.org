I think we're having a misunderstanding. What I was disagreeing with, was the assertion that somehow there weren't that many people smarter than EY, working on important problems. The actual comment I replied to was, if I remember correctly, talking about how even distinguished scientists can be limited in their rationality; and I think that saying that just because a talented scientist seems limited in their rationality means EY would be a better scientist than them, unfair. I find that, in my experience, even if scientists don't seem rational in daily life, they are extremely good at applying what we define as rationality to their craft. Science is all about determining what is true and figuring out what works. An award winning scientist definitely used rationality to get that award, even if they aren't explicitly rational, and this is why I find that assertion that we can just assume EY would do a better job so strange. I see rationality as a poor measuring stick, because in many cases people who don't know about it or haven't heard about it aren't trying to be rational all the time. I think it's a poor measuring stick for someone's ability to solve problems, because if we think that award scientists don't have it in spades, then we are clearly measuring it wrong. Maybe I need a new word. Rereading my arguments, I think I agree with you that many distinguished academics are 'limited' in their rationality, as they only seem to apply it to their own field. However, I think that while they are 'limited', they are still very, very good at rationality, within their area of expertise. Probably more rational in that area, then we can assume EY would be. Anyways, my main point is that rationality is not intelligence, which you agree with. One of your main points (if I'm understanding correctly) is that may celebrated intellectuals are limited in their rationality, which I agree with, and that rationality is more important that intellect, which I also agree with. I believe, however, that even someone limited in their rationality can still be extremely rational within their field. I find it hard to believe that a talented scientist isn't being rational when they make their discoveries, considering how similar rationality is to the scientific method, and how much of what I've read about eliminating bias on Lesswrong and in stories, I've heard again in lectures given by professors of science. Rationality, as a methodology, is mimicked by a lot of other schools of thought also dedicated to solving problems.

Essentially I disagree with the idea that EY, because of his impressive rationality, is automatically better than overall less rational experts in different fields, because lots of the fields I assume we're talking about (like science and engineering), require the development of in-field rationality to excel in. Essentially, I'm saying that even if someone's rationality is limited to their field, they can still be more rational within their area of expertise than we can assume EY would be, if that makes sense. Like how a super specialised AI can still be better at maths than an actual general intelligence, even if the general intelligence is still, by most measures, objectively a better thinker (if that metaphor makes sense).
