Hmm. How to put this.

Part of me thinks you might be right? But more of me thinks your claim is actually unfalsifiable. Which makes it... not really convincing.

Like you can't ironically drop EY's example of what he did in as an "everyday schlub" as if it proves /your/ point rather than mine. Not everyone who does things like that are going to write about it, but just assuming that it's no more special than what millions of people do constantly seems way too big a claim to make given common observation that most people /don't/ actually independently discover cures to illnesses by logic and testing, or whatever other impressive feats keep "chipping away at the stone." You're presenting this as a /narrative/ for how society functions and advances. Where is your evidence?
