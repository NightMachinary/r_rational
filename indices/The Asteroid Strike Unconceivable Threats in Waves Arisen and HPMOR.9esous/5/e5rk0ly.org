Whatever camp you're in, I'm in the other cabin. We've got the same counselors, we obey the same rules, we've got more or less the same schedule of events... but we're on /different teams/.

By the time a protagonist breaks the world, I have already lost interest. Sometimes the story is good enough on its own merits that I'll keep reading anyway, but sometimes it isn't. HPMOR was at its best, for me, when it pointed out aspects of the world of Harry Potter that weren't particularly well thought out. The last arc you loved so much was the one that well and truly lost me. I'd been wanting to see how the story ended for a long time by that point, and I was /profoundly/ disappointed.

I can't even remember the point at which I got tired of The Waves Arisen. I had wiped whatever I had read from memory so thoroughly that I went to check up on it and recognized the map. Reading the first chapter brought back enough that I don't have to read any more.

To explore my frustration without resorting to fiction: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/FinalExams/][Final Exams]]

A particular selection of HPMOR fans were so proud of their ability to save Harry at the end that they thought they were so /unlike/ the ninjas that they would apply the same brainstorming process to such oncoming asteroids as whether P=NP and the outcome of Israeli elections. It didn't last long.

One can know all the rules of The Wizarding World easier than one can know all the rules of emergency room efficiency. Because the rules of the former were made by one person - in the case of fanfiction, two - and the rules of the latter are deliberately confounded by a bazillion of them, hungrily exploiting loopholes to their advantages and then closing those loopholes and opening others.

The world we live in is the result of thousands of years of such scheming. People more clever and better informed than Big Yud on any and every particular subject have been beating their collective heads against the Greatest Problems since before anybody knew what time it was. They continue to.

They are inspired to "shut up and do the impossible" and, as you say, the fact that they believe they /might/ do the impossible is what keeps the world turning. That and the conservation of angular momentum.

I want more deconstruction rational fiction, where it turns out that everybody else already did the thinking that our conventional protagonist might and witness the way that world looks /afterwards/... or, if authors want a real challenge, a deep reconstruction where we explore the hitherto unseen scaffolding that supports the way things are. The protagonist's successes are smaller, more focused, and less likely to destroy the potential for sequels that match what we loved about the original.

Imagining that by strict application of first principles you might implement the FOOM isn't /rational/. Inspiring, sure, and more likely to bring about positive results than my cynicism, but it wouldn't be a smart bet. An asteroid strike isn't a black swan if you can see it coming.
