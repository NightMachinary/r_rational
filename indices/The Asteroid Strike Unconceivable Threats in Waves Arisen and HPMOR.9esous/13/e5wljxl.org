I went and read waves arisen based on this recommendation, prior to finishing the article. From the first part of your article I had expected a more catastrophic event to end Waves Arisen.

To me, the Asteroid Strike in HPMOR wasn't Harry fooming, it was the End of the World prophecy. Everyone was tooting along playing their roles, learning magic and playing politics, Voldemort Voldemorting, Dumbledore Dumbledoring, until Dumdum checked the prophecies and discovered he had BIGGER PROBLEMS. There was an asteroid coming. There was nothing they could do about it. The world was going to end, full stop.

This is the kind of threat I imagined and mentally categorized as "Asteroid Strike", though I know get what you mean by the outside experience for the rest of society for Harry and Naruto's fooms.

To me, the climate change metaphor was the real kicker in Waves Arisen. We can speculate that the techniques Naruto came up with may have in fact been utilized by the "Ancients" -- that they had seen the potential for munchkined superweapons and chakra factories using water ninjitsu, and that the resulting arms race flooded the planet. Or, maybe even more realistically, that it was merely the combined actions of a few hundred million ninja leveraging relatively ordinary powers on a global scale.

This kind of scenario is the much scarier and more likely scenario in our world. Not a single person coming up with a neat trick and taking power, but a lot of people driven by game theory and politics to defect and escalate until the world is destroyed.

We've faced this dilemma with Nuclear weapons, which was survivable because the actions required are overt and the consequences obvious and direct. We're facing it with Climate Change, which may not be because all it takes is for people to /keep living normally/ - keep using energy and technology and climbing the consumption ladder and growing technology and civilization, like we've done for millenia. The million small acts are perfectly sufficient to destroy the world and kill everyone.

And we will face it very soon with AI, which will be a combination of the two - a natural progression of incremental improvements, motivated by economics and politics, that result in a sudden and likely catastrophic FOOM.

All it takes is for things to continue the way they are - for people to keep improving AI gradually, and then for one idiot CEO some day to hire some eggheads to build a big smart program and give it the instruction to [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9402014/chapters/21285149]["maximize shareholder value".]]

This is the real meaning of an asteroid strike IMO - either natural events or unintended consequences crashing down on everyone's head in a way that is completely unavoidable once it starts. It's not a satisfying literary technique to have Naruto breaking the water clones to refill his chakra en mass for the final battle only to discover he's flooded the rest of the plateau by accident and everyone dies - but this is the real danger.
