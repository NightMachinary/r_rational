I'm a huge fan of HPMOR, it was my first real intro to not just rationalist fiction, but scientific thinking and it changed the course of my life from being in a cultish religion and pursuing what my upbringing had taught me to pursue to becoming a scientist, which I am now working on my PhD in Molecular Biology so I can help fight the dragon that is old age.

I love that book.

But I HAVENT READ WAVES ARISEN so I had to stop reading your really interesting looking analysis when you gave the warning, and I can't yet contribute on your really interesting commentary. I vow to read Waves Arisen and return to comment on your fascinating thread as soon as I can.
