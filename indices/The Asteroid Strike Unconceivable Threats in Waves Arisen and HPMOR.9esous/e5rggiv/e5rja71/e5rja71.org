The Waves Arisen is a Naruto fanfic written by an author named Wertifloke, of whom no trace existed before or since.

Consensus seems to be that it was written pseudonymously by someone known to the rational community under a different name. I'm >80% on it being Eliezer Yudkowsky himself.

(Speaking of pseudonyms, this post reminds me of an old poster in this subreddit who went by PM_ME_RATIONAL_FICS. Similar discursive style.)
