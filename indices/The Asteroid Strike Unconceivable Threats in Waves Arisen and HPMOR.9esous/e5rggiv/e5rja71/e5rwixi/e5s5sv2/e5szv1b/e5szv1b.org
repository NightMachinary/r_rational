  extremely memorable writing style and TWA isn't it.
#+end_quote

To be fair, TWA's writing style in of itself was extremely memorable (remember the jokes about 'plot toxicity'?) with no other story known to the rational community having a very similar writing style. If the author is already known by other works, then it is pretty likely that the author went to extreme lengths to write in a very different fashion to disguise their style. It's even stated as such in the very first [[https://wertifloke.wordpress.com/2015/01/25/chapter-1/][chapter]].

  This work was created in part to explore a more haphazard approach to writing, the results of which can only be evaluated in the light of strangers' feedback.

Anyway long story short, Naruto in TWA has a strong ability for introspection and self-reflection that I feel is mirrored very similarly to Bella in Luminosity. There is no really good reason. Alicorn just someone who I know to be Eliezer's friend with a strong talent for writing and is at the top of a list with very few candidates on it.

I just find it difficult to believe Eliezer wrote TWA while also writing the last few chapters to HPMOR. His hints about TWA makes a lot more sense to me if he was a beta-reader instead of being the author.
