Why is it that people are so certain The Waves Arisen was written by Eliezer?

It certainly seems possible, but the writing style isn't particularly like HPMOR. It also doesn't have the same hyper-pedagogical feel that HPMOR, Three Worlds Collide, and The Dark Lord's Answer have.

None of those things are super strong evidence in the opposite direction, of course, since I would never have predicted that A Girl Corrupted was EY based on those criteria.

But what /is/ similar enough between the two stories that so many people are very confident they're the same person? Is it just that "rationalist fanfiction that isn't poorly-written" is such a small class, and that the timing works out?
