When I was around ~12 and browsing in a Barnes & Noble my mom handed me 'First Test.' About a decade later she was surprised to hear the book had been about a gal.\\
Later that year, at summer camp, I was discussing the Lioness Quartet with another young camper, and I vividly relish the memory of her saying that she "really liked the lioness quartet, except that Alanna was such a slut."

I definitely believe there is room for rational fiction in Tortall, and I am excited to read it.
