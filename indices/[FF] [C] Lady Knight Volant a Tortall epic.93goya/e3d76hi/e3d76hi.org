Wow, I read those books like 15 years ago and enjoyed them quite a bit. Haven't thought about them in a long time. I may check this out if I burn through my backlog. (Though Protector of the Small was my least favorite of Pierce's series... [Edit: first three Tortall* series, since I see she's written more which I haven't read])

Thanks for the rec.
