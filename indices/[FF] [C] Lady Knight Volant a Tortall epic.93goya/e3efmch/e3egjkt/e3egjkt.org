I really liked the portrayal of Alanna in that book, I went to Catholic school and it was the first portrayal of healthy relationships that I really found in media. She had sex for fun as well as for romance, she made sure people treated her right, and she valued being respected. It was really, really good especially when so many YA books pretend sex doesn't exist. Whereas the Lioness Quartet has that wonderful scene where Alanna gets her first period and has NFI what is going on.
