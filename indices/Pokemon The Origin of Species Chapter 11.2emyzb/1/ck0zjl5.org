So this chapter was meant to be done super quick to make up for leaving it on a cliffhanger. Like, record time quick. That was the intention. Promise.

But it just kept growing. An extension to the flashback here, an extra argument there, and before I knew it I'd written the longest chapter to date instead of a quick resolution to the cliffhanger.

Ah well. Some prolonged suspense now and then adds spice to life, right? Right.

To anyone who speaks Japanese, please excuse my wholesale butchering of your language. I spent an embarrassing amount of time trying to figure out translations for "I summon you" and "plant roots" (as a verb-noun rather than the noun-noun I kept seeing online), and if you'd like to offer better translations, I would very much appreciate the corrections: I figured it was better to ask for forgiveness than prolong publication another few days looking for someone that would translate for me.

Hope you guys enjoy the read, and all feedback welcome, as usual!

(Side note: I mentioned awhile back that I hadn't read any pokemon fiction, and invited recommendations. The majority of suggestions were for Game of Champions by L. Lamora, and I recently had the free time to check it out. I swallowed it in two big gulps, and am still hungry for more. I can see now why it came so highly recommended, and anyone who enjoys my fic should definitely give it a read. It explores and expands the world of Pokemon with a creativity and passion I found admirable and immensely enjoyable.)
