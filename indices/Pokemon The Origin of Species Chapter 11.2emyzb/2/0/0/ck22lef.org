  Glad to hear it :) Are you referring to his last line?

Actually, I'm referring to his lesson that letting others keep you safe is a risk in itself. I don't think that lesson is wrong, exactly... but it might be dangerous to stop at that point. That's the sort of thinking that drives eight year olds to take it upon themselves to raise tyrogues.

Tom's overall risk management thing is all good.

  I was under the impression that "san" was for equals and "sama" was for those you look up to or for an honored elder.

Sort of true, but the difference is more extreme than you're thinking. You use "san" for your parents and police officers (/omawari-san/, Mr. Police officer), and Mr. Company President is more often /Shachō-san/ than /Shachō-sama/. It's not just about respect, it's about class hierarchies, and situational formality, and other things that are simply incomprehensible to us westerners. "Sama" denotes /royalty/.

Actually, I'm not sure if the average man on the street /ever/ uses "sama" seriously, outside of certain prescribed cases like customer service. It's definitely nowhere near as common as anime would lead you to believe.

  Do you mind if I run any future phrases by you?

Sure! I'd be happy to offer whatever help I can.
