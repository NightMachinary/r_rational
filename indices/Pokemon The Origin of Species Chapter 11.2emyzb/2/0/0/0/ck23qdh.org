  Actually, I'm referring to his lesson that letting others keep you safe is a risk in itself. I don't think that lesson is wrong, exactly... but it might be dangerous to stop at that point. That's the sort of thinking that drives eight year olds to take it upon themselves to raise tyrogues.

Ahh yeah. Keep in mind, it comes from a man living in a world where enormously powerful monsters somewhat regularly attack cities, so the applicability in our world is a bit reduced: most people in developed countries can go their entire life without getting into a life-or-death struggle, so learning to defend yourself isn't exactly a priority.

But Tom knows that his son's life may one day depend on him being in a situation where he can't rely on anyone else to defend him but his wits and his pokemon.
