  Firefly had the advantage of subtitles, though, which there really isn't a graceful way to do in pure text.

If memory serves, Firefly didn't use subtitles to translate the Chinese. It was just there: the context usually gave you some indication of what they were saying.

  In the context of the Pokemon world, I feel like this raises more worldbuilding questions than it addresses: if the different regions were truly once as culturally distinct as Japan, the USA, and France, how do they come to speak the same dominant language?

Unown :)

  Suggestion: Change "Japanese" to the dominant language. Add exposition to the effect that the more far-flung regions speak different languages, and Leaf specifically is not a native speaker of the local tongue.

The main language isn't necessarily "english" as we know it, but it is distinct from the native Japanese.
