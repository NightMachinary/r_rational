Now that I think about it, the fact that the Unown are ancient Pokemon in the shape of English letters has interesting implications. Did English or whatever its equivalent is in the Pokemon world simply get its alphabet from the shape of the Unown? Do all languages in their world use the same alphabet based on the Unown? But in the game it seemed that the Unown were only recently rediscovered by investigating the ruins of ancient civilizations after a very long period. So maybe the Unowns, being Psychic types, actually read the minds of the viewers and take the shape of letters. Interesting either way.
