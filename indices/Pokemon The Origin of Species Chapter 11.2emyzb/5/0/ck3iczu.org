It started that way because present tense is what I'm writing my novel in, and switching back and forth was just causing too many errors in both documents.

I'm sorry you're finding it awkward, and others who haven't read present-tense stories before have said the same thing, but they've also said they stop noticing eventually, so I hope it doesn't impact your enjoyment too much :) Thanks for reading either way!
