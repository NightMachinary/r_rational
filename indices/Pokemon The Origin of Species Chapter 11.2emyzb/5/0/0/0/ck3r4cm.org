Woops, thanks for catching that. Fixed!

And I'm glad you're enjoying it :) Pokemon has always been one of my favorite fictional universes, but as I got older it became harder to ignore just how nonsensical it was. I'm glad to have the opportunity to try and make it more rational, for myself and others.
