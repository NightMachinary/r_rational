  I'm not sure if I quite agree with Tomio's reasoning, but I've not heard that line of thinking phrased so clearly before. So thank you for giving me something to think about.

Glad to hear it :) Are you referring to his last line?

  And lastly, you're being way too free with your -samas. In a world that usually drops honorifics, using any honorific at all is already more formal than it is in our world, and -sama is just super over-the-top. It would sound sarcastic. It should probably be Akio-san, Akio-renjā (Ranger Akio), Akio-junsa-buchō (Sergeant Akio, or whatever rank), or maybe Akio-sensei.

Hmm. I was under the impression that "san" was for equals and "sama" was for those you look up to or for an honored elder. My intention in using the honorific rather than his title was to acknowledge thanks for something he's doing outside his official role as a Ranger, but if you think "san" works better, I'll use that instead. This would apply to Donovan in the earlier chapter too, I imagine.

  I don't promise this is completely correct, I'm not a native speaker. But I do promise that it is less painful than what you currently have.

Don't worry, any help at all is greatly appreciated. Do you mind if I run any future phrases by you?
