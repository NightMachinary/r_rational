Fascinating look into the dangers of wild Pokemon and how Rangers deal with them. And how Red deals with being confronted with it! I wonder how his thoughts of Pokemon in general are going to develop, after a few more events like this.

I'm not sure if I quite agree with Tomio's reasoning, but I've not heard that line of thinking phrased so clearly before. So thank you for giving me something to think about.

It seems strange that the Rangers would enlist the aid of some eleven year olds, especially putting Blue directly in the line of fire. But then, the fact that they're running around unattended at all already shows that the Pokemon world puts more trust in children than our world, for better or worse, so it's perfectly consistent.

On Japanese: For "Kūfuku, I summon you!" I'd use "Kūfuku, /kimi ni maneita!/" But you've got "Come to me!", which isn't really bad. Though if you're using preset command phrases, it would have to be "/Kimi ni kimeta!/", "I choose you!" For "Kūfuku, plant roots," I'd use "Kūfuku, /ne o uetsukere./" In our world, </uetsukere/> is a really unusual word, being the command form of the verb </uetsukeru/> "to plant"... which isn't a command very often. Go figure. If you're using macrons for long vowels, it's </arigatō/>. And lastly, you're being /way/ too free with your /-sama/s. In a world that usually drops honorifics, using any honorific at all is already more formal than it is in our world, and /-sama/ is just super over-the-top. It would sound sarcastic. It should probably be Akio-/san/, Akio-/renjā/ (Ranger Akio), Akio-/junsa-buchō/ (Sergeant Akio, or [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_rank#Japan][whatever rank]]), or maybe Akio-/sensei/.

I don't promise this is completely correct, I'm not a native speaker. But I do promise that it is less painful than what you currently have.
