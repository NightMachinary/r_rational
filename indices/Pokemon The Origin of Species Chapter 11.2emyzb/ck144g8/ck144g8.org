Good chapter. The theme of "when is it right to help" is an interesting one that too often gets treated simplistically. Looking forward to what comes next.

I found the Japanese gratuitous and distracting. I know your intention is to give the regions different feels and customs underneath the homogeneity, but I don't think our-universe foreign languages is the way to do it (especially when, as you mentioned, you're no expert in the language).
