Firefly had the advantage of subtitles, though, which there really isn't a graceful way to do in pure text.

In the context of the Pokemon world, I feel like this raises more worldbuilding questions than it addresses: if the different regions were truly once as culturally distinct as Japan, the USA, and France, how do they come to speak the same dominant language? You generally don't get dominant language shifts without large population movements (euphemism for "conquest" and "ethnic suppression"), and there's no hint of that in your story to date.

Suggestion: Change "Japanese" to the dominant language. Add exposition to the effect that the more far-flung regions speak different languages, and Leaf specifically is not a native speaker of the local tongue.
