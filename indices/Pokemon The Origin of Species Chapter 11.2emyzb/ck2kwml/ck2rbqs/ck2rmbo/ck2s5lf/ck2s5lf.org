I have a vague ending planned, which is to say I know where the story is headed and many of the events leading to its culmination, but there's also a lot of room for variation along the way, and the real question is how much of the story is gong to be yadda-yadda'd. Since it's a rationalfic I don't like the idea of glossing over anything important, and if I want to be writing this until I'm 40 I could easily write it as I have been so far, with multiple chapters for each "day" in the story.

Thankfully that doesn't seem likely, since as the story goes and the characters become more developed/farther along in their journey, it'll be less critical to describe their every waking moment. Which is a roundabout way of saying "I have no idea" :P
