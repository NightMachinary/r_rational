Thanks, glad you're enjoying it!

My rule for myself is at least one per month. Weekends are when I do the vast bulk of my writing, so I usually publish on a weekend or shortly afterward.

This chapter was supposed to be done two weeks ago, but it ended up taking so long that I barely managed to meet my monthly deadline. If I get more free time or finish editing my novel sometime soon I'll hopefully get to write faster, but for now 1 per month has been the standard :)
