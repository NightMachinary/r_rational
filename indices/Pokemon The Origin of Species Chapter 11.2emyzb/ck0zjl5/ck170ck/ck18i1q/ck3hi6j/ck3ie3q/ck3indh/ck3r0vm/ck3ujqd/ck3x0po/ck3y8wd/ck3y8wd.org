Totally understand your comment as I definitely get turned off when I'm browsing FF.net (M tag sorted by favourites/follows/reviews) when it's just brutal for no reason, as I remember, though again it has been a good years since I read it, the whole thing was super dark to show how shit a world with pokemon would be, because it's been forever since I've read it and maybe I'm looking through rose-tinted glasses *I'll withdraw my recommendation*. I could honestly be mixing it up with another story just a name that I definitely remember with feelings of enjoyment.
