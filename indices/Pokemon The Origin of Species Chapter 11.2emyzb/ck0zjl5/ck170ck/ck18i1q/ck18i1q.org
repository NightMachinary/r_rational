Thanks, but I'd say stick with it :) The first few chapters took a bit of settling in to the unique narrative voice, but by his battle with Brock it really kicked into high gear, and the worldbuilding began in earnest.

As for the rational factor, while his Red isn't a rationalist and he does pull a few unpredictable twists out of his hat, by and large the writer does a great job translating the pokemon world and physiology into rational terms.
