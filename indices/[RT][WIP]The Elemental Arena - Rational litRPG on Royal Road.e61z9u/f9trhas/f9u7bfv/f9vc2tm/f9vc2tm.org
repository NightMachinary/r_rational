Always glad when I can contribute to an awesome work of art like this one.

Sorry for your lost hour.

Wooden armor is not often great, but they're not exactly gonna have time to tan any leather or melt any ore in their current situation, so they seem pretty much stuck with pre-bronze age technology barring any magical skills. Metal being an element suggests that it might actually get you some metal tools at some point. Maybe black powder explosives if the arena has been seeded with the necessary chemicals.

Since they're often fighting animals with horns and gremlins with spears rather than humans with metal weapons even a bundle of branches tied tightly around the torso would probably help a lot.

Other efficient opportunities more directly related to his starting specialization into survival would probably be things like animal snares (hopefully there are non-monster animals that stay around after death protein is an important source of calories for humans), or even deadly traps for larger animals.

Even a giant moose would go down fast if it fell halfway into a covered big hole with wooden stakes, and even a human doesn't do well against caltrops of any kind.

And they clearly need force multipliers, really, really badly.

I'm hoping that Nathan digs a bit deeper into what answers others got from the AI when there's a chance, there seems to be a lot of information that is yet unshared that would function as a force multiplier for the entire group (analyze enemy especially, only one person needs to have it in order to improve efficiency for the entire group vs that enemy, leaving more resources for hard-to-counter enemies).

Whether the end-goal is exclusive or inclusive and wether they might encounter alien players seems like mission critical information, since it would presumably shape their entire strategy for getting home alive.

If there are alien players with stupid levels of baseline stats compared to humans but the boss is cooperative, they can win by cooperating with that alien for mutual gain.

If there are no alien players and thus only humans can kill the boss it's time to see how quickly you can build a somewhat reliable fighting organization.

If there are superhuman aliens and the goal is exclusive a lot of the strategy will probably be "how not to get hunted to death by 1-8000 giant alien jedi with plasma shields capable of tanking an anti-tank shell from an artillery gun, and also get to and kill the boss before they do".

Either way, the story is exciting and I greatly look forward to more chapters!
