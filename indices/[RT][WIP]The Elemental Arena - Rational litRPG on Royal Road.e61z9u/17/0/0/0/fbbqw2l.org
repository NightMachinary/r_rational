I am a discovery writer, which honestly surprised me. I am very organized and detail oriented in my professional life, so when I started writing, I assumed I would write that way too.

For a rational story, I needed characters who were real people. I wanted the plot to be based on these character's actions and reactions. So I started with the characters. Brainstorming characters wasn't too bad for me, I made up a character sheet for each with their background, stats, personality traits, etc. and tried to imagine how they would react to a life and death situation. Most of the rational traits of my story stem from this process I think.

After forming my characters, I tried to make an outline. I wasted a lot of time with not much result. Predicting what characters would do scene to scene was difficult for me since a lot of the subsequent scenes are based on how the characters act. Finally, I figured I should just try writing something instead. I had an idea for a challenge in my head (the moving rock wall challenge), so I put the characters in the challenge and wrote to see what happened based on how the characters might act. I ended up writing 100k words after that.

The story had a lot of issues, but at least I got my ideas on paper. My game system needed a little work as well so I made sure my spreadsheet was fleshed out. Having written a lot already, I had a better idea of what worked and didn't. So I went back and completely re-wrote the story from scratch using the improved game system. I basically *used my first draft as an extremely detailed outline* for the re-written story.
