They're not externally measurably different.

The functional difference would become abundantly clear if you got copied and immediately ceased to exist.

Someone else comes out the other side with identical makeup and memories, sure, but that's more like a legacy than you being teleported. Someone else carrying on your torch, but you are still stone dead.

Delay the murder-part of the murder-copy and you could even meet the new copy and make it abundantly clear that there is no mechanism for transfer of consciousness.

And without a mechanism to transfer consciousness (like gradually offloading neurons to the new location while those neurons can still talk to each other via a wireless link that mimics normal transfer) there's no reason to believe that a consciousness would be transfered.
