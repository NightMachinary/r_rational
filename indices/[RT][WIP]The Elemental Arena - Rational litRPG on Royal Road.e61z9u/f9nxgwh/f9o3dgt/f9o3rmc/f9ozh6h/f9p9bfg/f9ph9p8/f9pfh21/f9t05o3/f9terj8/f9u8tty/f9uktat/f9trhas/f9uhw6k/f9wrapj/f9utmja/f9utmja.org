So while this novel isnt explicitly irrational i cant really say that it is also explicitly rational.

The gameshow type of premise/setup is overdone. It is boring and uninteresting.

It has some incredibly stilted dialogue which i dont usually mind as its a common thing in webnovels it just adds to my annoyance.

as with almost every litrpg ever the characters need to be wisecracks and constantly reference pop culture stuff which also is always annoying in every litrpg novel that it happens in, and it happens in a lot of them. I havent read a lot of it as i got bored around when they met the 3rd or second group of players/participants and david or whoever died . This novel hasnt shown me anything which i could get exited about yet and i probably wont continue it.

Dont get me wrong, i am glad more people are trying to write rational fiction etc and i encourage you to go on but this is just boring for now. Atleast to the chapter i read it, it hasnt shown me anything to qualify it as especially rational so ....
