No worries, thanks for your interest. :)

Elemental affinities are handled a little differently in my series than common tropes of them. Even though there are only Five Energies, they are quite a bit broader and more fluid than their names imply since literally everything in the universe is encompassed by the five. I'll include a few snippets of text from chapter 3 where some of it is discussed, although it is elaborated in much more depth elsewhere. This is a very mild spoiler:

“What about Air, isn't that an element?” 

“Air is part of all the elements, but not one of the main five energies of Water, Wood, Fire, Earth, and Metal."

"The elements can act as forces of energy just as easily as they might correlate to material components.  For example, Wood is the energy that feeds Fire, which could simply manifest as a physical object like firewood.  The Wood element could also take the form of oxygen in the air that the fire needs to continue its chemical reaction to grow.  Air is but a generic term for matter in a gaseous state and all matter can become a gas if you make it hot enough. So the air is a part of the elements, but by itself not one of the Five.”

Johanna was scowling at the Guide's explanation.  “So you're saying the Wood element is air? That makes no sense.”

Asahi turned and answered instead.  “If I'm understanding correctly, it can be at times when it takes that form. The elements are energies in a constant state of interaction and flux with one another.”
