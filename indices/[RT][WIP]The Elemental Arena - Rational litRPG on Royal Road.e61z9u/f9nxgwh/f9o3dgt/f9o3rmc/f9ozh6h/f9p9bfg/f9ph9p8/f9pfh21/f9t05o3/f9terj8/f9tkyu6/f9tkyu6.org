Thank you for the feedback.

You are correct, there is no way for them to know given their information. Maya was mainly saying it for Nathan's benefit. I originally had Nathan expressing his own skepticism, but it was edited out since that scene was about 3x too long in my first draft and the chapter was already a monster in length. I have added a paragraph back to the scene since it does seem unclear, even though the subject matter they are discussing will remain ambiguous to them for now.
