Speaking of Skills, you left out Blunt Weapons I.

"While they ate, the blond Aussie told them he'd learned the /Blunt Weapons I/ skill from the battle for using his club. The skill was passive similar to Maya's new /Pole Weapons/ skill, and he'd gotten it even though he hadn't directly fought the tier 1 monster. But since he participated in the battle, it gave him credit for the kill. /Blunt Weapons/ was Earth aligned whereas /Pole Weapons/ was Wood" (Ch. 9).

There are almost certainly other weapon Skills. Using Mr. Rock unfortunately didn't activate Blunt Weapons, meaning that the term weapon doesn't simply refer to any object used to do harm.

Assuming there is a separate skill for swords/knives (Edged Weapons), the players probably couldn't activate it via using a sharpened piece of stone or wood. I expect this kind of skill to exist to fulfill the general Bludgeoning/Piercing/Slashing Trifecta of Physical Damage common in RPGs. Furthermore, I would expect this hypothetical Edged Weapons skill to be Metal-aligned as the other two skills have been Wood & Metal aligned (solid substances). This is all conjecture, so take my theory-crafting with a grain of salt.

If the damages resistances & weaknesses to elements functions like I think so, than each players should really watch out for their weaknesses out in the field

- Fire is weak to water. Fire-aligned players might be more prone to drowning, cold temperatures, waterborne diseases and damage from water-aligned weapons and creatures.
- Earth is weak to wood. Earth-aligned players might be more prone to plant-based toxins, (*something else?*) and damage from wood-aligned weapons and creatures.
- Metal is weak to fire. Metal-aligned players might be more prone to overheating, severe burns, electricity and damage from fire-aligned weapons and creatures.
- Wood is weak to metal. Wood-aligned players might be more prone to (*I can't think of anything*) and damage from metal-aligned weapons and creatures
- Water is weak to earth. Earth-aligned players might be more prone to damage from falling, Mr. Rock, sand and damage from earth-aligned weapons and creatures.

This all all my head-cannon for now. I hope to read more of the story!
