That does suggest that there is some value to your life, even though there is another you, no? And that if we made murder-teleporters, we should either not use them to transport people, or only use them to copy people without destroying the original.

Even if the person in question gave their consent, it would presumably be covered under the same laws that cover euthanasia.

  You seem to be as confused about what I am saying as I am about what you are saying. No, both would be you from the beginning and would continue to be you.

They would, of course be /a/ you, but not you-you.

We may be misunderstanding each other.

I do not mean that the copy isn't you in nearly every meaningful sense.

I mean that at no point will the original that walks into a teleporter find themselves behind the eyes of the copy that is made.

Being "behind the eyes" is what consciousness is. Experiencing from that particular point of view, as opposed to the point of view of someone else.

That your awareness/experience of existing would not be moved to the copy is what makes the murder-teleporter into a murder machine if the original were to be destroyed.

Extinguishing an awareness in the original is the murder, because that person is a unique individual. The copy is near-identical, but they do not share the same awareness, and the awareness that they have is not transferred between them if you kill one of them.

The ship-of-theseus neuron-replacer maintains a single awareness/consciousnes the entire time it happens, whereas a murder-teleporter creates a new awareness/consciousness, and murders the scanned original through disintegration as thoroughly as being hit by the Mandalorian's disintegration rifle. No bloodsplatter, but also no survivor.
