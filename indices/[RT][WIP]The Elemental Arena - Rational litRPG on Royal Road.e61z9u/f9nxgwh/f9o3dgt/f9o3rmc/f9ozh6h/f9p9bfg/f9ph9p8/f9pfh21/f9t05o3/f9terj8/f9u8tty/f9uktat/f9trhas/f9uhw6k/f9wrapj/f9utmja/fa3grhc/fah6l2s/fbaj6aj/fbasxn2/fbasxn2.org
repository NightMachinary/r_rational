Hey, thanks for reading and providing some feedback on what you liked. I just posted a new 9k word chapter this morning so you might want to check it out. Currently, I am updating once a week on Wednesdays. I am mostly confident that I can finish book 1 while staying on schedule since I started posting with a huge head-start.

Although, my lead on the current chapter is shrinking each week. So after I finish the first book, I may need to stop posting for a bit so I can get far enough ahead in book 2 to release each chapter on a steady schedule again. I do a lot of backtracking when I write and edit, continuously changing previous chapters as I write the next. So for a web serial format, I have to keep a big lead on the current posting so I have room to make adjustments.
