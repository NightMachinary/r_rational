rational + magic does not have to equal "broken system Our Hero (and perhaps his primary antagonist, but certainly not the common masses of cannon fodder) can munchkin to victory with their Superior Brain." In fact, I'd argue that it /shouldn't/ mean that most of the time. Forgive the presumption but reading between the lines and based on common trends in rational fics, that seems to be the sort of thing you're arguing for.

Side note, didn't downvote because I see literally no reason besides "I disagree with this opinion!" which is /not how downvoting is supposed to work./ You downvote nonsense posts that contribute nothing or that you believe are made in bad faith, you challenge opinions you just disagree with or consider not properly thought-out or justified.
