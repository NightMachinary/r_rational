I honestly cannot think of any real reason to hold that position other than instinctual aversion of a situation that we have not evolved to cope with.

There's nothing special about what matter I'm instantiated in at the moment, and consciousness lapses all of the time and is not continuous anyway. It doesn't matter whether you have any continuous transition or not, else we also die every time we fall asleep, or when our mind wanders, etc.

In your delay argument, it certainly would be very unsettling to exist for even five minutes as the first instance of me knowing that those five minutes would be erased, and I don't advocate for implementing anything like that because I oppose torture even if the torture is immediately forgotten.

Still, setting aside the torture aspect, we again lose more than that to the retrograde and anterograde amnesia we get when we fall asleep. There is nothing inherently worse about the loss of a copy of myself that's only a few minutes diverged than there is about losses that I already accept on a daily basis, besides the advantages to being in two places at once (If I ever manage to have two of me I would consider the loss of my clone after such a short time to be a huge loss, but not because anyone died).

My consciousness isn't some mystical thing that needs to be transferred independently of my mind-state. Do you think if it's moved too suddenly the shock destroys your soul or something?

I recognize that none of this is very intuitive, but our intuitions haven't been honed on these situations and relying on them outside of their scope does us a disservice.
