  Speaking of Skills, you left out Blunt Weapons I.

Good catch! Added it in. Fire is adjacent to Wood and Earth, so Maya and Asahi can benefit from both known weapon skills.

I suspect Mr. Rock didn't grant a skill due to Nathan's Earth 0 rating. Johanna used Mr. Rock to kill a rat, but hasn't been forthcoming at all to others about her skills. If her skill list becomes known, we should find out one way or the other.

The goblin pulling out a knife on Nathan supports your suggestion that something like /Edged Weapon I/ skill exists and is Metal-aspected. This would be the weak point for Wood-aspected abductees.
