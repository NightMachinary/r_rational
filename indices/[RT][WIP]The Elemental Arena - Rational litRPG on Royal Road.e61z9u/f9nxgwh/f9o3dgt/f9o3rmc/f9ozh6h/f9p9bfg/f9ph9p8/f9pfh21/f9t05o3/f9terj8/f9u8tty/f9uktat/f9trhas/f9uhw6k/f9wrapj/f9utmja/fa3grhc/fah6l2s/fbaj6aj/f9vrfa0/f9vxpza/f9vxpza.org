Sorry if it bothered you. Based on some other feedback, I have been working on an edit of chapter one and will probably remove one of the vomits which should make it a bit less overwhelming.

Couple slight spoilers (on mobile so can't spoiler tag):

I wanted to show what would happen if a random person was forced into a crazy situation hence the vomit in the beginning.

It gets better, although there are two other places in book one where he vomits, in both cases in regards to a weak stomach while performing a medical procedure.

The main character starts the story with a couple anxieties, one concerning the sight of blood and he is later forced to confront this fear. One way I show the changes to him is how the mental improvements he receives make it more manageable. For instance, the second time he teleports, he is proud that he doesn't get sick.
