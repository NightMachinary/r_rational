Delete chapter one seems like good general advice to me.

I have an allergy to inorganic and unnecessary exposition. To remedy this I've taken to just skipping the first few chapters/arcs of most new stories I pick up.

I find it often turns somewhat generic and straightforward stories into intriguing little mysteries where I need to piece together clues to figure out what's going on, because the characters know this stuff already and aren't repeating it for the sake of the audience.
