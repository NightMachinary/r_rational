The first chapter was a bit rough in terms of grammar and phrasing, the rest is much better. In case that turned anyone off before giving it a chance.

Personalities are diverse and distinctive, nice. Johanna appears really abrasive and I struggle to understand why Nathan isn't more put off by her, but it only breaks immersion a little. The severe time limits (5 days for trial 1) seems like it may be difficult to explore the game system very much, especially the hinted at vendors. It just doesn't seem like enough time to accumulate NP for skills and items. Of course that assumes similar times for the remaining trials, but that's not a given.

Anyhow, good writing and pacing so far, I'll be following along.
