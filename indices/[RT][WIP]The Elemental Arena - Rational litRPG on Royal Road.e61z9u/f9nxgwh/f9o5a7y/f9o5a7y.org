Thanks. Yeah, it took me weeks to get up the courage to post to [[/r/rational][r/rational]], even though I am actively trying to write a rational story. The readers here are a bit more discerning than most. But that can be a good thing since constructive criticism is something I need, especially since I'm a first time writer. The comments I receive elsewhere may or may not be quite as insightful as I expect I will be given here. :)
