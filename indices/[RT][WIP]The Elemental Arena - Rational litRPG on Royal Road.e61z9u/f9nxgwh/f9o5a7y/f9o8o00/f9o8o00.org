I might post mine here at some point, but it will likely be when there is enough of it to constitute a complete arc, I don't think I can prove rationality to anyone without actually showing it in the text. Rationality also isn't something I'm directly intending to include, just something that is nice when I can. I'm not up to the snuff of the authors this sub sees as it's bread and butter, by far.
