For me, my outline started with creating the characters first, even the ones who appear later, at least as far as book one is concerned. I then created obstacles and I discovery wrote to see what happens. My discovery writing is very basic, and I completely rewrite it after I'm okay with the scene.

I will give an example. Major Chapter 2 spoiler:

I did not plan on events happening exactly the way they did. ex: Kean dying right at the beginning. I originally envisioned him as a quirky sidekick that Nathan could use to bounce game related ideas off, since many of the other characters are not genre savvy with RPGs. But as they were running through the first challenge, his lack of Physical stats were a serious flaw.

Asahi, being a pragmatist, saw Kean as a lost cause and decided it was better to leave him behind. Having three players survive was better than zero, at least to him. Nathan, on the otherhand, is a bit more empathetic. He risked dying to save Kean. If Asahi had been more like Nathan, then all four might have survived, but it would have been risky. Kean ended up dying because it was a hard situation and the characters acted uncoordinated, following their own individual wills instead of the plot's.
