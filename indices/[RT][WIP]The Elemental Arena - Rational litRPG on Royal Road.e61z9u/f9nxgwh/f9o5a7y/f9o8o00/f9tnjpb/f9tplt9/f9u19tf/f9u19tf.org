I think it can work fine with a "Discovery" style of writing (I greatly recommend Brandon Sanderson's lectures on youtube for writing in general).

I suspect a lot of it comes from getting some Beta readers who are good at asking "Why don't they just Y?" or wondering "If that is unprecedented, why is noone more shocked at all the implications that carries?"

I think the answer to such questions might even be fuel for fun depth to the story or world. For example: Why doesn't the Imperium of Man just innovate? Because of the power struggles and complex political interaction with the Priesthood of Mars who have an overwhelming interest in maintaining their monopoly on technology.

Most of the time a minor tweak to the story can fix virtually all the issues that makes someone seem like a plot driven character rather than a person.

If a major tweak is necessary, it can take the story or world in interesting new directions as you find new ground that is as interesting as the main story that you first envisioned.
