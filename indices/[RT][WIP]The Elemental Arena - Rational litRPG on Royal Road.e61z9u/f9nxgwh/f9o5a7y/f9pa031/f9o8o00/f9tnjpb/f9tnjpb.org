I think the core of rationality is generally that the characters act like people (who are aware of and react to the situation around them to the best of their ability) rather than semi-automatons following a script and doing things just so that the plot can happen. I think this is enough to make for a solid rational ground.

To properly shore it up as a rational work you essentially have to give the readers all the info that the point-of-view character uses to make a decision, to the point where they could themselves independently come to the same conclusion as the point-of-view character. Kind of like an old timey detective novel where the reader was told everything the detective knew, but applied to different works than merely "whodunnit?".
