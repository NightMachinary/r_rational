For the most part, the people here are pretty cool. You will get critique ("This chapter feels rushed and <thing> broke my suspension of disbelief") but only a handful of r/r people will offer criticism ("This sucks and you're a shit author. Go take some classes before you publish anything else u luzer and im totes entitle to sya this becuz I m teh smrt." NOTE: This is an example of criticism and does not apply to you. Also, even the few jerkasses we have on r/r can use better grammar than that, but it was funnier this way.)
