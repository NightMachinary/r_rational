You really hit the nail on the head! So many LitRPGs are blatantly obvious wish-fulfillment pieces or have author inserts to the point that it's become a real problem IMO.

When I read a LitRPG (or really, anything) the thing that'll make me drop the book faster than anything else is a dumb MC who makes no sense. If they're irrational for a reason, fine. But so many are obviously on the "plot rail" that they do things that make no sense because the author made the plot before the character and didn't bother to incorporate the character's own identity or actions into it.

What I've read so far is good and I hope you continue. I noticed you recently got onto the Trending Fiction as well, congrats! I'd love to see more LitRPGs that have a greater focus on believable characters that aren't cardboard cutouts whose only purpose seems to be to hype the MC. Keep up the good work!
