Yeah, I don't think I'm quite up to those standards just yet. Most of the characters in my story are conjured up from the aether to fulfill a need in the plot. Not that I don't try to make them believable after the fact, but I feel like I'm in a constant race to create the world and its inhabitants as the story I want to tell runs out ahead of me.

Maybe it is just the demanding pace of writing a Webnovel as an amateur, though I honestly don't think I could have done it another way.
