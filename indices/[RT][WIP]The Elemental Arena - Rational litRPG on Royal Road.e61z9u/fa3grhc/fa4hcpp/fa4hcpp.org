Great feedback. Yeah, I like doing the option list. I actually worried that my narrative would become bloated if he's given a choice every time since it takes several paragraphs of him thinking it through. There will be several more option lists I already have in the works.

Thanks for the feedback on Maya and Nathan. No one else has mentioned it to me yet but I think I might agree with you to some extent at least at face value. I once met a girl at a store and our first conversation seemed to click in a similar way and we went out later, but that is only one example I can remember in my whole life. Funnily enough, that memory is where I specifically drew inspiration for the scene. I just re-read the entire chapter and might make some slight edits, making it a bit less flirty in tone and more joking in general.
