Just caught up and I like what I am seeing. I wish there was more "gacha" moments though where the MC was given multiple options to pick a skill that had the rarities. Feels like im theorycrafting like I am the MC and gets me more engaged.

Also, my only gripe is that the MC and Maya, the obvious heroine, got way too friendly and flirty for the 3 hours they known each other. Hell, she even acting like a cliche "tsundere". But I am ignoring this fact because she has the highest mental stat we have seen and I think she is manipulating the MC to lead him on for her advantage. I mean do complete strangers really act like love birds in the matter of hours? I actually cringed when the MC gave a flower to her even as a joke.
