I would argue that the day we invent teleporters the difference will be very practical, especially if they have the potential to scan someone and create a copy without destroying the original.

The difference between our consciousness and someone else's consciousness is that we are behind one set of eyes, not someone else's.

We only have awareness of ourselves. If a teleporter or some other technology copies us, we will never be aware of the things that they are aware of, no matter how similar our composition.

If someone shoots your copy while you are still alive you will not experience being shot. In fact, you may never ever find out what happened to your copy.

If it happens to /you/ however, you will experience being shot, and you will know everything your senses tell you.

You cannot feel what happens to your copy.

If you want to teleport to a vacation place on a different planet and use a teleporter that does not destroy the original, will you experience going on vacation or will you experience sitting in the scanning booth for awhile, going home and then seeing all the pictures your new copy posts on spacebook?

Why the gradual replacement is important is that it provides a mechanism for the transfer of your experience. We lose individual neurons all the time, so hypothetically replacing them with artificial neurons one by one should not disrupt our awareness any more than day-to-day life does.

To deny that the teleporter kills you just because a copy is made makes me wonder what you would consider to be killing? Is it okay to murder anyone with a blender, or torture them so long as you make a copy of them first? Does the original have no right to lice just because someone copied them?

What if someone told you that they copied you in the last five minutes, and you had some absolute way of knowing this was true, would you be okay with being executed in a painless way? Do you think you would suddenly experience life from behind your copy's eyes after the bullet destroys your brain, even though you didn't experience life from your copy's eyes the loment the copy was made?
