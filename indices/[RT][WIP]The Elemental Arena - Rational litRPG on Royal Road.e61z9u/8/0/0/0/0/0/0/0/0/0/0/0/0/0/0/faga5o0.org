Why would you experience arriving? Your copy experiences arriving safely of course, but what is the method by which the point of view of the you who walks into the teleporter transferred?

You were copied, a copy walks out of the other teleporter, and you were disintegrated.

You could even put in a delay, so that the copy leaves the other teleporter, you sit in the scanning teleporter for five minutes and are only then disintegrated.

Would you experience arriving at your destination, or would you experience sitting for five minutes and then being vaporized?

Or do you argue that there is no awareness behind your eyes, that you are a philosophical zombie who is no more aware than a calculator is?
