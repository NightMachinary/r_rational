Really enjoying this so far! I like the fact that all the characters are explicitly in the top 10% of humans, it makes the rational-protagonist trope more believable (and the characters more interesting, especially since that's the top 10% by composite average). The system seems interesting, I'm really looking forward to seeing more of the abilities--especially Wood Prime, since Nathan doesn't have any yet.

How often are you planning to update?
