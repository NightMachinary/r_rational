Hey, really enjoying your work. As someone who's started and stopped more stories and different accounts than i'm comfortable admitting, It's great to see the confidence you're approaching this with.

If I may ask, what is your writing style? Are you more of a discovery writer (Gardner) or do you plan things out as much as possible (Architect)? Of course, one is likely more conducive to rational fiction, but I think it would be interesting to hear from someone who is actually putting out content.

Also, after reading the latest chapter, I really appreciate that the LitRPG elements aren't force-fed all at once compared to some others in the genre. The gradual pace of learning skills now seems much more sustainable and a lot more manageable for the audience to take in.

Good luck in the future.
