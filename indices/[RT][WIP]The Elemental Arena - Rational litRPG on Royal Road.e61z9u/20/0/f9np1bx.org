  Why rational genre...
#+end_quote

I enjoy reading Rational Fiction, and I like that it is a genre defined by the structure of a story as opposed to the setting (i.e. Fantasy). When I decided to write my own book, adhering to rational aspects wasn't so much a decision as it was a given.

  Why... only five affinities?
#+end_quote

For the game system, I decided to go for depth instead of width when I chose the number of affinities. As of current chapter 11, the players are only scratching the surface of what is possible. The lack of a proper tutorial means that the vast majority of it is yet to be discovered.

  I think its seriously severing possibilities even in fights, i'm not even talking about personalities?
#+end_quote

Fights currently are awkward, quick, and brutal. But they will evolve dramatically as the series progresses. I intend to introduce many skills that require teamwork to be effective, so I think you will find battles to be quite intricate by the time I near the end.
