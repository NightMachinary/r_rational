So, one thing I'm struck by is how easy /Language I/ and /General Fitness I/ skills are to acquire, especially when compared to /First Aid I/ or /Advanced Healing I/. Most skills so far have been awards for task completion or first kills.

The reason for this is, I'm guessing, that the more easily acquired skills will be needed to have any sort of chance to complete the dungeon. Humans speaking different languages cannot coordinate well. Strong, large humans with poor cardiovascular health would likely score well on Physical, yet rapidly wear out and fall prey to the constant attacks we've seen.

This suggests other low-hanging fruit may be out there. Swimming is a critically important skill that many humans have little or no experience with. (Humans from arid or impoverished urban environments exemplify this.)

Simply attempting to float in the creek may trigger a new skill such as /Swimming I/. Climbing would be worth a shot, too. Survival in a forest is enormously enhanced by being able to climb out of the reach of large predators, at least those that can't climb or fly.

Another notion that struck me is how brutal things have been on the Earth and Metal aspects. Two of them horribly impaled by rat-elopes, Johanna (Earth) critically injured, David (Metal) flat-out slain. The "goblins" likewise show signs of shrugging off attacks by their own spears (Pole Weapons I is a Wood skill).

These are both Wood-aspected creatures, I'm guessing. That -30% resistance against your destructive element /hurts/! Since they have five days in the first tier, I expect they will cycle through to another element each day. Days 3 and 4 are going to *suck* for our protagonist.

Building even modest fortification from stone, or perhaps a deadfall or two, will probably help a great deal against the current variety of attackers.

Edit: Reverse-engineered Maya's stat gains. She started with Physical: 112, Mental: 135. Two of her skills, /General Fitness II/ and /Pole Weapons I/, are known quantities. After obtaining these, she'd have Physical: 117, Mental: 135. This leaves /Quick Study I/, /Improved Heart I/, /Debuff Immunity I/, and /Quick Reflexes I/ to account for +4 Physical, +2 Mental. Skill list order appears to conform to the order they were acquired, making /Quick Study I/ Maya's first selection - the same one that offered Nathan /Earth Shield I/ and /Wilderness Survival I/, which both came with two stat bumps. I'm guessing:

- /Quick Study I/ grants +1 Physical and +1 Mental, since bonus NPs apply to both stats.

- /Improved Heart I/ should grant +1 Mental. EPs are not derived from Physical.

- /Debuff Immunity I/ seems in line with /Attack Up I/, granting +1 Physical.

- /Quick Reflexes I/ grants +1 Physical, since this is all that's left.
