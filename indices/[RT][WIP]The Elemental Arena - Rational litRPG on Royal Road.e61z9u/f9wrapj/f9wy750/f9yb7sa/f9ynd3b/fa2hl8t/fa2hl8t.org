Maya almost certainly picks up /Language I/ when she has the chance, boosting her Mental stat to 138. She gained 2 NPs in the chapter 11 encounter.

This poor guy has been out of commission since chapter 8. He has not been earning NPs, and his EPs are being consumed as he recovers them to stabilize himself. With night closing in, things now get desperate. With his injury stitched shut, he has a chance to rest properly. It's possible he does not yet have General Fitness II yet. If so, he might be able to heal himself by gaining Physical - assuming he somehow earns the NPs.

I believe Emma has no activating skills other than Advanced Healing I, because she did not know how to use them. Her healing skill is very powerful, but currently unusable due to insufficient EPs. It's likely she got the same Epic option as Nathan, since her Water score is 4 (required for Advanced Healing I).
