First of all, thank you so much for the detailed feedback and pointing out discrepancies. Great ideas too!

I checked my spreadsheet and you're right. I made a major change in one of my drafts and both of the ladies' EP totals were changed but I missed it in the text. Same thing with Wilderness Survival, I rebalanced some skills since my first draft and only fixed it in one spot. Maya is eligible to learn it now, but will find that she still can't get the skill unlocked to her consternation, at least at this point.

Writing LitRPG is a lot more difficult than I ever thought until I actually tried. Every single edit requires redoing math formulas throughout the rest of the series. I have to keep track of time too for EP regeneration so when I feel I need to move a scene to a new place, it requires rewriting everything after since the characters take different actions based on their available EPs.

I'm doing the editing work anyway, but I certainly am a lot more understanding why other LitRPG authors don't do much editing after posting.
