What a great read so far!

As others here have pointed out, skill gain seems to be entirely vital to any eventual chance of success. NP gain is only slightly secondary to this.

The random encounters will be /brutal/ overnight. With luck, Nathan's /Wilderness Survival II/ skill will have some functionality to find a temporarily safe campsite. Alternately, since these are part of the Day One Challenge, the day might simply end and give them all a respite, and perhaps even a small bonus.

Over time, these encounters have been scaling up in difficulty, however this looks to be due mainly to consolidation of groups.

Boosting Emma's /Mental/ statistic from 132 to 140 appears to be the top priority. Elemental and skill increases may also do the trick, but we've yet to see anything like that in the main arena trials.

/Emma's stats/

#+begin_quote
  Physical: 114

  Mental: 132

  Elements: Water 4, Metal 2?, Wood 2?, Fire: 0?, Earth -1?

  Skills: Language I, Advanced Healing I
#+end_quote

Emma's Water rating would likely have started at 3, same as Nathan's Wood stat. We know it's a 4 due to the prerequisite list for Advanced Healing I. This implies she had similar choices to Nathan. Lack of a possession such as leather bracers leads me to think that she chose to enhance her Mental trait, but this is by no means certain.

Emma has not had a weapon; we've not seen her participating in fights prior to the last one. First kills grant skills (hey, this even rhymes). Odds are good that her next encounter will get her an attack skill, hopefully with Mental +1 or +2.

Her use of the sewing needle could also mend clothing such as Asahi's fatigues. This is certainly worth attempting, both for the tactical impact, and for the potential skill gain.

The EP formula indicates that her total should currently be 4*2 + 2 + 2 - 1 + 132/5 = 37, but her actual total is 36. I've pegged one of Emma's elements too highly, but there's no way of telling which at this point.

/Nathan's stats/

#+begin_quote
  Physical: 130

  Mental: 119

  Elements: Wood 4, Fire 2, Water 2, Earth 0, Metal -1

  Skills: Language I, General Fitness II, Wilderness Survival II, First Aid I, Attack Up I, Analyze Enemy I

Teaching Emma /First Aid/ and /Wilderness Survival/ look like very good ideas. (Side note: The latter skill has a discrepancy. In ch.10, Maya cannot learn it due to Wood: 3 requirement, however the description in ch.6 lists Wood: 2.)
