Thank you for reading and providing feedback.

The players will certainly gain even more unique skills that will prove invaluable to the group, impacting strategy. We will see more caution for certain players happening as the group's basic tier of Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs are met. Currently, they are struggling to survive and figuring out how to work with each other. It's not easy. :)

As for the low hanging fruits, they will be exploring those in a few chapters. :)
