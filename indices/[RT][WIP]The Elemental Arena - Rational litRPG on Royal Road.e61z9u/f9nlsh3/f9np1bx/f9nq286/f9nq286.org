i'm always thought, if you have a rational world but you need for the sake of your book use some fantastic element, isn't it weird to have limitations? I mean, you want a book about real peoples with unusual circumstanses. And they have some affinities to fire or to water. Okay, i can get it. But for the sake of realism isn't it weird to have weaknesses imbedded into system? People can be smart or not-so, or people can be weak to some type of gender for example. But weaknesses imbedded into system? Weird choice.\\
Sorry, if that was harsh, i'm not trying to critisize, just want to understand.
