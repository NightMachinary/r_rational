I'm caught up now and it's looking good. The protagonist is realistically horrified by the violence given his back ground and I am enjoying his growth. I liked that you killed the guy in the beginning, it helped underlining that you are willing to kill of characters and I think that adds to the excitement.

I find it interesting that you've given the MC the ability to heal and to find food, and that he choses to invest in finding food. It makes him one of the most important people in the group in a way that is very different than the usual route to make the MC important. I feel that the incentive system that makes him want to focus non-fighting abilities while needing to fight to earn NP to be an interesting mix. I look forward to when someone will start arguing that he shouldn't be in combat because they'll starve if he does and about how the politics will work in terms of who gets the healing/food.

I do wonder why they don't work more closely together on learning learnable skills from each other. It seems that there is a number of low hanging fruits and I haven't seen anyone considering the diminished competetive edge.
