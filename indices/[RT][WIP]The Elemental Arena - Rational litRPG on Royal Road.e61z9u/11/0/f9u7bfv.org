You have some great ideas here, thank you. A few of them I already have planned but I won't say more to which ones or how I will.

I did spend an hour reading about wooden armor this morning instead of working so thanks for that. :P It's possible I might include it later, although currently they have neither the time or tools to do so yet. Wooden shields might be the easiest to make for their effectiveness.

  On the bright side, if I understand the rules correctly our species will get the reward and the individuals will be saved so long as they contribute to the final fight, they don't need to deal the killing blow?

As far as Nathan understands it, if a human gets the killing blow on the final boss and a player is a human who survives to the end, they will be sent home.
