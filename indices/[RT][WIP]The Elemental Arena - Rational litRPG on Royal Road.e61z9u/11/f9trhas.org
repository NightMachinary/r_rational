It's been tried to the end and I confirm that it is very gewd stuff!

But dammit, now I need more.

It sets my mind running with all the possibilities.

As far as I can tell, some of the low hanging fruits of the system that they haven't reached for yet is that the primary barrier to virtually all the low-affinity-requiring skills is finding out what action is needed to gain the skill.

They don't have writing implements to write them all down, but they could regularly sit in a circle and tell all their skills, starting with those with low requirements, and anytime someone spots something they have the affinity for they speak up and the telling person shares how to unlock that skill.

Kill all but 1-2 gremlins and have whoever doesn't have the polarm skill finish it off and so on.

Depending on if the goblin's drawn knife disappears, another useful thing to do might be to keep a manageable number of gremlins or hornbeavers alive until you can take their equipment or cut off their horns.

It's grisly, but it might be possible to extract some food (dismemberment) from the hornbeavers and use survival to determine if it's safe to eat.

Wood armor might be very useful against the beavers if they can't retrieve the leather armor of the goblins.

Adding a crossbar near the tip of the wooden spears would make them much more practical against both beavers and angry gremlins, along with making their own longer spears from branches or trees.

If they can fashion some kind of wooden shield it would probably improve their odds against Gremlins a lot.

As has already been commented on in the story, keeping a +physical to spare intentionally is probably vital in these circumstances, extra points are good in the long term, but spending 1-2 extra points doesn't seem to give nearly as much value as emergency healing.

I wonder how they will do with sleep. If I understand correctly humans sleep in 1.5 hour cycles, so waking everyone up once an hour to fight would probably be devastating in the long run. Waking up all but 2 and cycling which 2, maybe?

I also wonder how they compare to other species.

If there is something like Orkz, Zerg or Protoss in the arena whose "100" in physical would be 400-4000 for a human their only hope is probably to ally with that species. And let's not even get started on the species that start with 400-4000 in mental.

On the bright side, if I understand the rules correctly our species will get the reward and the individuals will be saved so long as they contribute to the final fight, they don't need to deal the killing blow?

So hypothetically the best solution is to ally with as many species as possible and launch a joint assault on the final boss where you ensure that a member of each species at least throws a rock or something, thus maximizing the number of winners at no cost.

If there can only be one winner, it seems unlikely in the extreme that humanity, a species with only rudimentary genetic engineering and basically no optimization, will have a chance in hell of even getting near the final boss on the same day as whatever superhuman ubermental, uberphysical or uberboth alien species are out there.

Would a hivemind count as a single individual, or would they just select a hivemind with 8000 individual bodies?

Or maybe the hiveminds are part of the ruling class or untouchable political rivals and as such they can refuse to participate.

Or maybe humans are the only ones in this instance, with other species having their own trials? Must be embarrassing to be the AI super-archailect who loses to some humans because they couldn't reach the goal of taking over a planet just by talking before 4000 humans who only just put a guy in orbit managed to bully a giant dragon to death.

So many fun possibilities!
