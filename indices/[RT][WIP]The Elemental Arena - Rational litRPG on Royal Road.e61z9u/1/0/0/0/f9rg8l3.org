Certainly understandable. Since my reading time is limited, I tend to judge a book by its page one grammar. This is especially true for web series. I'll try to remember and post here when I have made improvements.

As for deleting chapter one, I already did that. :P I read a few books on writing as I was starting out and that was one bit of advice I took to heart. Now that I am more experienced writing, it's easier for me to spot the bloat. In fact, I just hacked 400 words from the first scene on my lunch break today. :)
