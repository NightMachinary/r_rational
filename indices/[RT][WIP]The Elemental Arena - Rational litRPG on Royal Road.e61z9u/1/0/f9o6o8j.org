Thank you so much for the feedback!

I'll take a look at editing chapter one again soon, thanks for drawing my attention to it. I've kind of been thinking I should trim a bit of the fat off that chapter anyway to speed up my hook. I know some writers aren't as interested in editing chapters already posted, but I'm not shy at the prospect.

I will also take a look at some of my dialogue between Nathan and Johanna. I'm glad I achieved my goal of giving her a distinct personality but Nathan's reactions to his allies are important for his character too. I might adjust how he perceives her where needed. I can always give a call to my cable provider if I need inspiration for how it feels to be frustrated talking with someone. :P
