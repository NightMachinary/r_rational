Thank you for taking the time to read as much as you did, which sounds like you made it to the 200 page mark. I doubly appreciate you taking the time to provide feedback as well. I admire that you stuck with it so long even though it wasn't working for you.

While I feel my writing is improving dramatically the more I practice, my particular sense of goofy humor will likely continue going forward. Maya's joking dialogue kind of exemplifies my own humor I think. So what you didn't care for will probably continue, aside from improvements to the dialogue and prose as I make more future edits and improve my writing skill.

One character, Asahi, I intentionally gave stilted language as part of his characterization. It's possible I have overdone it, but he was a person who strictly spoke the formal version of Japanese his entire life which the /Language/ skill takes into account when he speaks in English. Most other character's language should sound more casual, so I will look over my dialogue whenever I do edits to improve.

As for the Rational aspects, I am sorry they weren't enough, though I feel there are many there. I will continue to work hard towards adhering to rationality in my writing and hopefully execute it better as I go forward.
