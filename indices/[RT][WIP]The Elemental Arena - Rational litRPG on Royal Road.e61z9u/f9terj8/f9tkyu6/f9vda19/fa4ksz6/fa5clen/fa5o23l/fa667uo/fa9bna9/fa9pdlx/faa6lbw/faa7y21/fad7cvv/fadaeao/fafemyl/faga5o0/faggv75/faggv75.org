We are real and our experiences are real, but we are a pattern, the substrate doesn't matter, changes in the substrate don't matter, pauses in our experience don't matter. Our awareness is due to us being able to build and reflect upon models of the world that include ourselves and our values. All that matters for our awareness to continue is for that process to continue.

There is nothing mystical about that awareness that requires any continuity, we don't require any monolithic continuity of experience to not be p-zombies. Continuity is pretty much a little lie we tell ourselves anyway, whether to make maths simpler or to reason more simply about time or our experiences.

If the destruction had a delay, we would lose those five minutes, obviously. We would experience arriving at our destination but we would never know about those five minutes unless told later, and most people would absolutely find the loss of those five minutes disturbing. I argued before that this would be torture. Waterboarding isn't the same as drowning someone to death, but it is torture all the same.
