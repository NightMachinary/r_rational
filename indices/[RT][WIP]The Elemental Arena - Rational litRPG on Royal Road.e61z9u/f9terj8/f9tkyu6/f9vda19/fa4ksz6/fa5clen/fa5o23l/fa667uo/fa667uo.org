There is indeed nothing special about the matter that you're instantiated in at the moment. While consciousness lapses often, the lower brain activity that still goes on during ordinary consciousness holds some promise that we are not simply erased - there is a potential though unreliable mechanism to transfer your consciousness from sleep to waking.

It could of course also be the case that we die every time we go to sleep, a frightening thought but until we have serious transhuman technology to make sleep obsolete there's not much we can do about it.

There is of course no soul, but without a mechanism to transfer /our/ consciousness there's no reason to see a teleporter-copy of us as anything but a descendant who will carry on our hopes and dreams after we are dead.

That it isn't possible to externally confirm whether a "consciousness" has been transferred (though it is possible to prove that it has /not/ been transfered, as in the case with the original remaining alive) there is no reason we should assume that it would transfer without an explicit mechanism for the transfer to take place, such as gradual replacement of neurons.

I don't think it's necessarily unintuitive, it simply seems a practical problem to be solved with engineering.

If we ever invent murder-teleporters, the obvious solution is of course to, if possible, never destroy the original after the scan that allows the teleport. Because honestly, why would that be necessary? We don't execute anyone because they get on an airplane or an airship, even they were to somehow generate an adequate replacement for the murdered person.

But again, if we die whenever we sleep, the point is somewhat moot until we can become able to sustainably never sleep.

The consciousness is not mystical, it's just the information network that makes you look out of your eyes rather than looking out of your sibling's eyes. We can confirm that it exists within ourselves as an observable fact, even if we cannot verify that it exists within anyone else, it's not a hocus post thing without any observable qualities.
