But we are in agreement that what the murder-teleporter does to the person walking into the teleporter is at least as bad as assault and dismemberment?

I don't mean to be mystical, I mean in the very practical sense of after walking into the teleporter, do you experience arriving safely at your destination, or do you experience a bright light and then nothing for the rest of eternity?

If you experience nothing for the rest of eternity, you are dead, no?
