I find the idea that either sleep or destructive teleportation is "death" in any meaningful way to be equally absurd. I feel you're placing too much meaning on some ill-defined continuity that is neither practical nor demonstrable.

Maybe you could clarify, what exactly makes a consciousness ours vs not ours? What does it mean to "transfer" it, if instantiating your exact self elsewhere does not count? Why do you feel there is any difference between gradually transferring neurons vs transferring them all at once, if the end result is the same? Finally, why does it matter whether there is any interruption in the continuity of our consciousness (it's not like we can tell the difference anyway, especially down at Planck time) ?
