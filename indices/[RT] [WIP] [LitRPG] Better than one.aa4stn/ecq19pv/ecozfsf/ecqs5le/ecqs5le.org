I thought the core concept was inventive and interesting -- congrats on coming up with something new and fresh. I read all the chapters with pleasure.

A big turn-off for me is the personality of the princess and her interactions with the main character. The whole "she's a spoiled brat" thing doesn't work so much for me personally. I'd have preferred it if she was proud, sometimes unreasonable, but on the whole intelligent and persuadable and having more to say to the MC than a string of petty insults.

Think of why Pride and Prejudice works, for example. The main characters have a mix of positive and negative traits, and, even though they initially get into each other's cross-hairs, you are still rooting for them to work out their misunderstandings as the story evolves.
