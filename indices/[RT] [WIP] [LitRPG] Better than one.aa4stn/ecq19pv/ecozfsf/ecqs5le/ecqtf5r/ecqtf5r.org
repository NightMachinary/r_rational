I get what you're saying. I am struggling with characters and dialogues at this time. I intend for her to have a character arc, where she matures and becomes reasonable and disciplined through their struggles. But this would take time, and not 1/3 of the book, but more like post climax. She does have some positive traits right from the start, such as being a great fire mage, and disciplined when it comes to taking care of her/their body. The rest will take some work, and through hardships I'll get her to a stage where'd she'd be proud of her accomplishments.
