You've certainly got an interesting premise here. There are many cool things you can do with this.

I've read the first few chapters, and it feels you might be rushing it too much. For example, I felt like you missed a great opportunity to establish the main characters' personalities with some character interaction as they regain their bearings after the initial crisis in the sewer. As it is, the spoiled princess personality of Estra doesn't quite feel genuine.

So far I don't think there's anything particularly irrational, but I felt that you're progressing things so quickly that things feel like they "just happen" without the reader having had a chance to see them coming. I feel like the events would be more impactful if you spent some more time establishing the world, characters and their situation first.

There are also some grammar mistakes, but nothing that would immediately put me off from reading the story. I think it would help you greatly with both pacing and grammar if you can find a good editor and beta reader.
