I'd love to find a good editor and beta readers, but right now it's just the first draft. And this comment of yours is the best I got as far as feedback so far. You're probably right that I was rushing the first part there, I tend to underwrite. I probably need to squeeze in a chapter between 1 and 2, and do as you suggested. Thanks.
