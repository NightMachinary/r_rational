That's not good. I don't like confusing. I'll probably need to clear that up. In the sewers, she was in shock (generally, the 1st stage of grief.) Shock provides emotional protection from being overwhelmed all at once. Then she was in denial (2nd stage) about what happened once they escaped.

I'll see about clearing that up. Thank you.
