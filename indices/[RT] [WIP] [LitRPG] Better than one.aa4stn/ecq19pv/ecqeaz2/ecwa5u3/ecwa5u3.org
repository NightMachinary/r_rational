Chapter 1 really confused me because there seems to be a jump. At first the personality the MC is sharing a body with seems to know what is going on, and seems to be comfortable with being an ogre.

Then after they escape from the sewer that completely changes, the person is revealed to be Estra and she's horrified at being an ogre.

At first I thought that Estra was only put inside the ogre at that point, and that before was the original personality of the ogre. But that doesn't seem to be the case. It's confusing though.
