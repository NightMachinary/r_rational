She can't really know that if she goes back more than ~250 years. The various calendar reforms have been pretty big, and they spread slowly and confusingly.

Even if she knows the exact date of a historic event to count from she's probably wrong. I started to make an example of the Battle of Agincourt and looked it up on Wikipedia to double-check and was delighted to find a nice article on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Style_and_New_Style_dates][old and new style dates]] using that exact example that explains very well the problem, so I won't belabor it. :)

It doesn't help her to know the dates of famous future events because they'll be thrown off by any changes she's wrought to history and by her mentioning the event. If she publicizes "Oh, in 300 years on December 7, 1941 Japan pulls America into World War II by bombing Pearl Harbor" I can guarantee that's one thing that's not going to happen on that date. :p

What she really wants is to know the date of a major astrological phoenomena. Maybe her mom died on the day that Shoemaker-Levy hit Jupiter or something. Then she has a consistent calendar, history isn't thrown off by foreknowledge of a famous event, the butterfly effect won't change it, and as a bonus the new society won't know her date of departure until a few weeks or years before it happens. You could start your whole story on the date of the astrological event when the whole world has to admit this weird historical kook was in fact not a kook.

(And you are obliged to namedrop [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democritus][Democritus]] somewhere, because if anyone was a time traveller lost in the ancient world...)
