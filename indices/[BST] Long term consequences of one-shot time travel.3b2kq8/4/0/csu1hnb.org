I'm assuming a multiple-timeline model of time travel rather than a self-consistency model. I also have thoughts on the self-consistency model which I would like to expand on at some time, though to summarize, I have never seen /any/ author that gets it right, and a story that gets it right would be completely unlike almost every time travel story.
