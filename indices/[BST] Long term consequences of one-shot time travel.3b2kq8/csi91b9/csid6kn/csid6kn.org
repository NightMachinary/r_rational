Yeah, I guess armies is pushing it. Still, this is an event of global significance, so I expect some political squabbling over the best way to handle it. There might be riots and police, and they'll definitely be hundreds of cameras.

It might send one person, but one scenario that I was imagining is that it is a moderately-sized portal that's open for minutes or hours. The first time only one person was in the right place and the right time, but the second time thousands can go through.

But really, I think the most likely scenario is that no extraordinary physical event will occur there, but that too could make a good story with all the preparation and conflict.
