This is a large part of Orson Scott Card's /Pastwatch: The Redemption of Christopher Columbus/. Spoilers warning/summary of relevant details follows:

At some point in the future we have the ability to open viewing windows looking back in time. During the course of investigating history it is discovered that Columbus's journey to the new world was engineered by an erased future history (to prevent the Aztecs from overrunning Europe and implementing blood sacrifice on a massive scale.) The current timeline eventually sends agents back in time who strand Columbus in the New World (preventing the slave trade and massive depopulation of the Americas) while also introducing metal working to the Aztecs and reforming the whole ritual sacrifice thing, so that when the old and new worlds meet they're on roughly equal footing.
