"If alternate universes are like pages in a book, all running in parallel, from top to bottom, then this book was bound with all of the pages folded in half and then a hole was punched through it. The words at the end of page one bleed over and affect the beginning of page two altering its initial trajectory, so on and so forth, ad infinitum.
