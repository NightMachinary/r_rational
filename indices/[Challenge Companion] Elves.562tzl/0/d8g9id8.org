From /Lords and Ladies/, this is the best quote to summarise his take on Elves:

#+begin_quote
  Elves are wonderful. They provoke wonder.\\
  Elves are marvellous. They cause marvels.\\
  Elves are fantastic. They create fantasies.\\
  Elves are glamorous. They project glamour.\\
  Elves are enchanting. They weave enchantment.\\
  Elves are terrific. They beget terror.\\
  The thing about words is that meanings can twist just like a snake, and if you want to find snakes look for them behind words that have changed their meaning.\\
  No one ever said elves are nice.\\
  Elves are bad.

Basically, Discworld Elves are humanoid dragons. They captivate humans utterly. They are the personification of contemptuous arrogance. They are beautiful and graceful---if you fall prey to their glamour---and utterly unconcerned with the fate of non-elf life.

Of course, there's also a kind of Discworld-logic learning weakness:

#+begin_quote
  *Granny Weatherwax:* You call yourself some kind of goddess and you know nothing, madam, nothing. What don't die can't live. What don't live can't change. What don't change can't learn. The smallest creature that dies in the grass knows more than you. You're right. I'm older. You've lived longer than me but I'm older than you. And better'n you. And, madam, that ain't hard.

So they're closer to animals than humans in terms of intelligent thought, largely incapable of innovation.
