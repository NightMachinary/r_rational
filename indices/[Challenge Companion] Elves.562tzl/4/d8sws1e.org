One thing that is interesting is that elves almost always exist in worlds with multiple humanoid races. Its very rare for it to be just htem and humans, and almost unheard of for them to be the only race. To some degre in rational fiction you need to justifiy why there are all these different races existing simultaneously before you talk about any one race in particular.
