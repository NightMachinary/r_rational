This discussion in the comments on [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/558at0/can_an_elf_and_a_human_grow_up_together/][this post]] from [[/r/worldbuilding][r/worldbuilding]] provides multiple interpretations and a lot of interesting material to work with just by examining if and how human-elf friendships would work. My personal favorites are one that says humans all have ADHD in comparison to elves, and another that says since elves live so long they tend to learn a wide breadth of skills while humans have to specialize.
