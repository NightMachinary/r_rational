In addition to the elves mentioned in the OP, I quite like the Dragaerans (called elves by many humans) in Steven Brust's Vlad Taltos novels. They have a lot of significant cultural differences that add up to something genuinely different from most other elves; it feels like Brust puts a lot of effort into making them different and interesting. The books themselves are fairly gritty fantasy novels about a human in an empire of Dragaerans, where magic is extremely common and powerful, and things like teleportation and resurrection are both fairly commonplace.
