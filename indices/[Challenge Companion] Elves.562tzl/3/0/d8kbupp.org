That's some really interesting stuff you have there.

I'm curious about the Orcs. Why do those that stay behind tear everything down in their old homeland? Why not keep the larders and storehouses and whatnot?

More generally, have you done anything with all that world building? DMed some game or other for instance? How did it work out?
