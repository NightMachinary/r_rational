The reason why orcs deconstruct a lot of their infrastructure after the Summer is because most of it is empty. They consume it at vastly increased rate so as to increase the likelihood of the orcs who leave successfully founding new settlements elsewhere.

With a reduced population density in the old home, much of the infrastructure becomes unnecessary, and beyond that, they may no longer have the manpower to maintain all of it. So in stead of leaving it to rot, becoming potentially dangerous for future generations to scavenge from, they deconstruct it into something more manageable.
