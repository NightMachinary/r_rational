Not done much with these projects, I just like world building things 'properly' I guess?

I did turn one world building project in this vein into a interactive webcomic.

The main reason the orcs tear down what's left behind is in order to nourish and revitalize the soil as well. It's not just destroying, its a selective combination of burn, livestock slaughter and flooding. Everything that can be kept for decades, stored or fermented is, everything else is torn down in order to fuel the regrowth for the later generations.

The orcs practice a kind of controlled apocalypse on their civilizations in order to foster STRONGER resurgences when their population boom is ready.
