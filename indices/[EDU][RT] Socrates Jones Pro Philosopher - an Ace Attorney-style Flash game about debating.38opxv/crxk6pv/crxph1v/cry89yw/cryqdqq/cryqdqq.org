I will have to look into naturalism then, if you find it interesting.

Most of my interest in philosophy is in the ethical sphere. Epistemology is nice too, but my metaphysics is pretty cleanly settled (although I still like to look at odd metaphysics for the same reason that I like to read mythology: it's often damn interesting, and I might even get a good story idea out of it).
