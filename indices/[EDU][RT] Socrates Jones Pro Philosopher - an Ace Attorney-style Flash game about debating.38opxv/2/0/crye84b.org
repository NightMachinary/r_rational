Yeah, the game is pretty linear so there's only one argument you can make against each presentation, which is a shame. As far as social contracts go, I'm pretty sure we're forced into them just by being born or living in a particular country. I think Thoreau argued that someone can separate themselves from society willingly but in practice that's very difficult.
