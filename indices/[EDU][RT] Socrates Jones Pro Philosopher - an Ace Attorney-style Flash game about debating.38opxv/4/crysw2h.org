This game is a surprisingly decent Ace Attorney-style game. It really has a lot of the same pros and cons that the series had, and the humor is pretty similar. So I'd say if you actually like the Ace Attorney gameplay, then check it out.

I'm playing it now. If the game ends with "And therefore, moral utilitarianism is the correct answer" I'm gonna be miffed. Come to think of it, if it says, "Gee, I guess there's no clear answer" I'll also be miffed, so I don't really know what I want. :/
