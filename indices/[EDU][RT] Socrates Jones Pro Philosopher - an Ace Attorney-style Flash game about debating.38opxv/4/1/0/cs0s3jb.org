Er... I haven't finished it. I got through Rousseau's part. It's not a direct condemnation of the game: I enjoyed the first Phoenix Wright, but I didn't find the gameplay to be compelling enough to play the sequels.

I adore the idea, Socrates Jones had a good amount of innovations gameplay-wise, and I found the business of picking apart arguments apart to be intellectually stimulating. Very glad I tried it out, but I don't think I'm quite the target audience.
