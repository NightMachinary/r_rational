And that's fine. My problem with moral intuitionism is when its proponents want to say that we can derive an actual moral truth from our moral intuitions. As a TA in Ethics, I've had a number of students tell me that one of the flaws of consequentialism is that it can justify actions that we "intuitively know are wrong".

Which is just... boggling.

(And having just said that, it's possible that I'm being too hard on Socrates Jones and misunderstanding some of his statements. It sounds like he's using moral intuitionism, but maybe I'm just too traumatized by silly students).
