I think that the biggest flaw in the game is that it has a conversation about which moral system is best without first addressing what morality is.

As a moral anti-realist, I obviously have to say that /Socrates Jones: Pro Philosopher/ is making some unstated assumptions.

(But really, even if I thought that natural law, say, were a thing, I'd still think that the game was jumping the gun. For example, there appear to be shades of moral intuitionism in the game; it also feels like there's a non-materialist metaphysics going on, which makes sense in the context of the game's universe, where there are many afterlives, but does not make sense in the context of the game's purpose, which is to teach philosophy, and would be best-served by first establishing up front what kind of metaphysical assumptions we're working with).
