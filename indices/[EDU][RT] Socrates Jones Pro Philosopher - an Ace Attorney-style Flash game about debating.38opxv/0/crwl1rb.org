The game is linear and it takes a lot of time and resources to make branching paths so there's generally only one or two ways to defeat an argument, unlike in real life - that's a flaw of Ace Attorney too. But aside from that, the game does a decent job of teaching some intelligent debating techniques and how to point out flaws in someone else's and your own arguments. Though I'm not sure the argument used against Hobbes' philosophy worked perfectly.
