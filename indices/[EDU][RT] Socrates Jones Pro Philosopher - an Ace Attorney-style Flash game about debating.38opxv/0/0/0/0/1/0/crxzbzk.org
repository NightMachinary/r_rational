I don't accept that humans are inherently selfish. I have seen people give their lives to protect strangers. This makes no sense if Hobbes's assertion about the nature of humanity is correct. His basic premise is false. We can agree to work together because it benefits all of us without qualification, rather than forcing ourselves to make agreements that hurt all of us to survive each other.

Suppose an expert clothier can make every day enough cloth repairs and new clothes to sustain five people. Suppose the expert farmer can do the same for food, the carpenter for housing, etc. In this population of five, they each gain nothing with their extra produce, and if they were selfish would simply burn the excess to deny their fellow man and thus improve their own standing. But trading it benefits all, and costs them nothing. They even benefit because the others trade back. And this is without anyone giving up any rights at all.
