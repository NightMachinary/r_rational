  I don't accept that humans are inherently selfish.

As you can see in my original comment, I don't think humans are entirely selfish and do have a natural sense of empathy. I do think humans are naturally selfish to some extent, just not as much as Hobbes thought. However, I think social contracts do play some role in morals for many people. Not everyone agrees on morals like paying society back through taxes, not beating up people who annoy them, not discriminating in the workplace, etc. even though a society where everyone acted that way would be bad for them, but social contracts discourage them from acting that way.

Also, in your example even a selfish person probably wouldn't burn the excess materials either because they took pride in producing it and want it to be of use or because trading it benefits them more than burning it. But if they could figure out some way to get the excess materials from the others without trading them something in return or suffering any other repercussions then can you say for sure that not even one person in those five would do it? In a world where some people will try to cheat their own family members out of their share of the inheritance, I wouldn't be 100% confident in that bet.
