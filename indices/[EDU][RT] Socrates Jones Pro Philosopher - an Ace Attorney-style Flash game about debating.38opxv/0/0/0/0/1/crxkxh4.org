True, overthrowing the sovereign is a lot harder now and will be harder in the future, but it's not impossible. The high difficulty and risk of revolution is what keeps people from doing it for no reason and causing that perpetual slaughter. I don't think social contracts are a moral system either, just one way of interpreting the social structures that exist in real life. Whether you think social contracts are good or not they seem to be one of the main things keeping some people from killing and exploiting others.
