And to be clear, my issue isn't that the game took a position other than anti-realism. My annoyance is solely that it made certain assumptions without even coming out and /saying/ them.

(Also that those assumptions seemed to include moral intuitionism, which is a position that I think contradicts the whole exercise of ethical debate in the first place)
