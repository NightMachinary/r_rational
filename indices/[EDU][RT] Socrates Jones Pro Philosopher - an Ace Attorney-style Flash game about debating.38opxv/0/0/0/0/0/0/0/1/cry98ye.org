Regarding moral intuitionism -

We do seem to have some innate *black box* inside our head that delivers moral pronouncements. We can't unpack it directly, because it doesn't answer to that part of our mind. But we can feed it hypotheticals, and it gives us answers. These answers seem to only have the force of our own opinion, and they are based in our own knowledge and biases. But we can be presented with a situational hypothetical, and immediately there comes a sense of having weighed morality on one side or the other. This one feels right, that one feels wrong, both of these feel horrible - before we even consciously consider the implications or consequences. But this black box cannot be simply trusted, because its result changes based on learning. To an uninformed person who has no knowledge of healthcare, an open heart surgery performed by a doctor doesn't look like a great good. It looks like a horrible nightmarish assault of wickedness and depravity.

The black box wants things. We don't know exactly what it wants. It doesn't know exactly how to get them. It uses our knowledge. It informs our decisions. And if we ask the right questions, consider the right hypotheticals, feed it the best knowledge, we can get closer to figuring out what it wants by how it answers.

My best guess, is that this part of our brain understands that it is in the best interest of each of us, for all of us to be happy, healthy, productive, educated, and cooperative. I think all five are needed, and I don't know if there might be a sixth or seventh thing or more. I think the goodness of an action, if we could find a way to measure that, would depend on the consequences of that action, judged by its impact, if we could find a way to measure that, on those five criteria multiplied together. I think our efforts are best spent attempting to improve whichever of those five criteria we currently feel to be the worst, to the extent that it does not cause a decrease in the total product.

I strongly suspect the best way to achieve this is by learning more about the universe, its physics, how the particles in our bodies and heads perform biology and cognition, more about our psychology, and using that information to better inform our actions to make them less harmful and more helpful to those five criteria.
