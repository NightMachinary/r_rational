The sovereign does not fear being overthrown, because it can enforce "Do not overthrow the sovereign." It having that force is the entire point of it being sovereign, to enforce those laws. Start looking enough like you might want to do some overthrowing of a corporate oligarchy on Wall Street, and you'll be met with militarized police in riot gear with tear gas. You're not overthrowing anything, and the sovereign is not afraid.

And if the sovereign could be overthrown, you'd just be right back to your starting point. People would do it out of selfish self-interest, and set right back to breaking their own contracts until a new sovereign arose to begin the cycle anew. This "moral" system creates perpetual slaughter until a strong enough sovereign is formed, ending only in Orwell or Huxley.
