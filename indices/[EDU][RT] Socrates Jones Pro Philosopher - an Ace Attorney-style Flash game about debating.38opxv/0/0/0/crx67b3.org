Socrates's argument against it was that the contract can't be the source of morality because the sovereign is the one who enforces the contracts and there is no repercussion forcing the sovereign to not break the contract. However, a sovereign would (ideally) fear being overthrown and so would still have to keep up their responsibility of enforcing contracts fairly. Personally I disagree with Hobbes not because I don't think social contracts exist and are a major basis of society but because I think people also have morals from humans nature and upbringing and are not always selfish. Also, I'm curious what being a libertarian has to do with the social contract argument.
