  There are 100 billion stars in the Milky Way, and humanity is determined to explore every one. We send probes, probes with the blueprints to reproduce human explorers upon arrival. Uninhabited worlds the galaxy over can be colonized and populated, until after many years they too can join the vast throng of interstellar civilization. But if a probe is very, very lucky, it will land on a populated world instead. Equestria is one such world.

  Even so, it's far from perfect for colonization, not with an environment lethal to human life. But each probe is resourceful and armed with the greatest machine intelligence mankind has devised. If placing a human mind into a newly manufactured human body won't work, it will just have to get a little more creative.

Contains AI, rational actors, good writing, exploring an alien species, linguistics, ponies, some civilization building, and a whole lot of words. It's a great sci-fi story that I could imagine seeing in a book store if the ponies were replaced with some other type of alien.

This story is *complete*.
