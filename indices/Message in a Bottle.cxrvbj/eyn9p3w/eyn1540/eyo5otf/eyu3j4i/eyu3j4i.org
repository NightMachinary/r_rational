There, finished reading. Three days - might have done it in two, but I had work.

I liked it a lot. It's hard to have a story where much of the plot it driven by AIs much smarter than humans, but I think it was done pretty well. What was first called an "epilogue" turned out to instead be a whole second story. Not quite as good, but still interesting.
