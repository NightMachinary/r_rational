There's some nice eternally-driven AI moments. If your constructed-from-tanks crew all dies, build another crew. And another one. And another one, until they can actually live and function properly in the local environment. And be smart enough to conceal the evidence of the existence of previous crews, especially when they're the same people as the current crew.

Also: make offsite backups and sites. If your primary site or center of cognition gets killed, start again from elsewhere. As many times as it takes.
