(minor spoilers regarding the true nature of Equestria)

This story is the first time i've read about what a Dharmic singularity could look like. Most scenarios i've seen end either in the Judeo-Christianity of a Big Good Yudkowskian Singleton, or a Greco-Roman patheon of warring trickster Culture Minds.
