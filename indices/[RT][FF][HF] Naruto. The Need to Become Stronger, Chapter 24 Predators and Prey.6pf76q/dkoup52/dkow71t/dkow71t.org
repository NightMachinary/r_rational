Cheers, I'm glad you like my Gaara. Regarding Ino's telepathy - it's not just some random power boost! There's a secret behind it which makes it look more powerful than it really is, as is the case with almost all seemingly overpowered abilities in NTBS. I think it should be possible to guess the answer at this point, if you look at what she's actually been shown to do, but there won't be a confirmation until about 10-20 chapters later I think. Always difficult to time these things with the rest of the plot...

Regardless, Ino reading Sakura's mind is definitely not supposed to be undetectable - after all her chakra is interfering with Sakura's, no matter how you slice it. She only managed that because A) she knows Sakura and B) Sakura was distracted by listening to Anko's speech while worrying about Naruto.
