As usual a very interesting chapter. I really like this take on Gaara. This seems like a much better depiction of an isolated young ninja with tremendous power who likes murdering people with his sand than the simplistic berserker depicted in Canon. I am really looking forward to seeing his interaction with Naruto and your take on his personal philosophy.

One thing that I dislike is the depiction of Ino's "telepathy". It seems that in your setting the Yamanaka bloodline provides an ability to read minds in a manner that is both undetactable and requires minimal preparation. I am a bit uncertain about this as it seems like a major upgrade to their canon capabilities that may unbalance the setting. If the Yamanaka clan can read the minds without being detected why wouldn't they use it on the foreign ninja that have visited the village for the Chuunin exams and why would these ninja risk attending the exam if they knew that their secrets would be vulnerable?

I may be misinterpreting the nature of the Yamanaka bloodline in your setting and would appreciate it if you could let us know what it is.
