I agree, the author tried to mitigate it by making the special weapons scarce, but I don't know. It means that they're going to have to come up with clever ways of guaranteeing they hit the demons in the mask, but then they could've just not brought up the special weapons and come up with clever ways of getting around the masks.

As is, I assume the limited ammo will be used for drama. They'll run out at the last moment to build suspense, and then they'll think up a plot to win without the weapons anyway.
