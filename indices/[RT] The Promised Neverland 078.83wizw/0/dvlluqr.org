A weapon to surpass metal gear!?!

No but seriously, I'm not a fan of this solution. Basically the author just sidestepped them having sub-par weapons for defeating the demons by saying "We created better weapons." There's not even any explanation for how they were able to figure out how to make better weapons or where they got the tools to do so.

It's probably the least clever solution to a problem we've seen in this story. The way they took out the first demon was good, but this lead in doesn't exactly inspire me.

Though to the author's credit I think it only stands out so much because most of the other ways problems were handled in the story were more inventive and thought out.
