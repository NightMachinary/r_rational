My first thought is that your goal is to prevent WWII and maybe make a better future in general. The naive time traveler goes back, kills Hitler, and...returns to the present to find that Hitler was not the only thing going on with that time, and there was still a war (maybe even one that went more poorly for freedom and democracy).

I'm not sure where the game would go from there, but the scenario that seems most interesting to me is trying to shape Hitler's life so that he turns out to be a better person without redirecting him from politics and opening a void for other demagogues to fill. Not that this would be the only possible solution, but I rather like the idea of a supposed murder simulator that turns into an argument against the idea that history would have gone better if only the right people had been killed.

(Though, maybe a "stop WWI" simulator would be a more interesting way to explore the idea of stopping a powder keg whose explosion seems inevitable. Save the archduke? Something else sets the war off a year later. Go back further and save Frederick III in 1888 so that his son doesn't get into a naval arms race with Britain? Congratulations, ten years later the Fashoda Incident sparks a war between Britain and France.)
