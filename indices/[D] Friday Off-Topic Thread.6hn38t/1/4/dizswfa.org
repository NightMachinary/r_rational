Speaking of making games, I really really want to make a Minecraft / Don't Starve inspired adaptation of Glimwarden at some point.

The whole "You need to kill mobs on a regular basis to fuel the devices keeping them from spawning on top of civilians, and build a whole architecture around killing those mobs" is a great theme for a Minecraf-like game; it provides a sense of necessity behind every single thing you build, whereas in Minecraft you're pretty quickly building complex systems for the sake of playing with redstone.
