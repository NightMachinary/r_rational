Huh. I am an avid player of Minecraft mod packs, and that got me wondering how that could be done. As far as I can tell, it would be definably possible.

1) Take a mob-focused pack. For this example, Blood&Bones.

2) Add to every mob a very high chance of the Heart drop, in quantities varying in quantity.

3) Use hearts in every recipe, make the heart container have a mob repulsing feature, consuming gives you a buff.
