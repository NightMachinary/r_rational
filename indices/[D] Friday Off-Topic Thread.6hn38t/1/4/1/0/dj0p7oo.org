Welllllll... I'm not making weekly updates just yet.

My current student project is to make a Minecraft-inspired game engine. It would basically be something between Minecraft, Mario Maker and Little Big Planet. We're at the "writing the documentation" stage right now (design documents and timelines), and the project is set to last until at least 2019, so it'll be a few years before I'd start this game Glimwarden, if I haven't moved on to something else by then :p

Anyway, thanks for the kind words :)
