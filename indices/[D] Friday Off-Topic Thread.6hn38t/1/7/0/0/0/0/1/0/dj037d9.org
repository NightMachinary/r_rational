I can see that, I guess my experience of it was just different. I never really felt like the saving stopped the action so much as added an extra element of strategy between free flow leap-boost-wallclimb-glide-dash moments.

So it actually was more like run-jump-kill-dash, oh-shit-this-looks-rough, save, jump-boost-climb-*dead*, jump-boost-*dead*, jump-boost-climb-glide-dash-*dead* /shit/ jump-boost-climb-glide-da-*dead* /goddammit/ jump-boost-climb, etc.

But all of that would be in like, 40 seconds of gameplay.
