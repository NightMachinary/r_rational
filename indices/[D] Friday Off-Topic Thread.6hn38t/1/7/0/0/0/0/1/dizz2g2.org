I think Ori is at its best when it's flow-state free running, and strategic, cautious use of save points runs contrary to that because it takes me out of the flowing platformer element in a way that interrupts my enjoyment (this is the same reason that the frequent and unskippable cutscenes bug me more in this game than in others).
