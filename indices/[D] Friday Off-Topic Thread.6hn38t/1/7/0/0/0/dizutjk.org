Dying is fine, it's about /how/ you die. When you die in a single-player game, you should always feel like it's your own fault, like there's something that you could have done better. Deaths should be opportunities for growth. My experience with Ori so far has been that quite a few times I'll just get killed because a laser shoots out of the wall with no visual indication that it was going to happen, or a rock lands on my head with no way for me to know that's what was about to occur. These don't feel fair to me, because there's no way for me to avoid them - it's like if you were playing a game with invisible tripwires that were only revealed when you got exploded by one.

This is worse in Ori than it might otherwise be because of how their save system works; it encourages caution, which slows down the flow of the game, and if you don't save you have to repeat not just the challenging bits that you didn't do correctly, but the tedious-the-second-time stuff as well.
