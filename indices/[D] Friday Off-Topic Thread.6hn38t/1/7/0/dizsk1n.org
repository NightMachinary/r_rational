I enjoy the moment-to-moment gameplay, for the most part, but there's all this other stuff that rankles. I was doing one of the "escape the collapsing thing" sequences and kept getting hit by falling things which instakilled me and forced me to start the whole sequence over. Once I knew what was going to happen, it was easy to avoid, but it was frustrating because it felt like I was being punished for not being able to see into the future (and this was a section where being able to sight-read the level didn't help any).
