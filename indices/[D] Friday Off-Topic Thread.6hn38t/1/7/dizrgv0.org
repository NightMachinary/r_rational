... I really like /Ori/. Sure, the cutscenes take time, but the platforming and puzzles are delightfully frustrating (eh-hem, nontrivial). Action platforming is a different genre from Metroidvania with RPG touches. I expected the latter going in, so it's been a bunch of fun -- and I /love/ action platformers.
