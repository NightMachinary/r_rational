Anyone interested in US monetary policy would find this article interesting: [[https://medium.com/@neelkashkari/why-i-dissented-again-b8579ab664b7]]

This guy, Neel Kashkari, went from not-particularly-exciting California Republican Gubernatorial candidate to, uh, dovish Minneapolis Fed President? I mean he's not dovish /per se/ but he recognizes that undershooting the inflation target is as much a problem as overshooting it by the same amount, which these days makes you a dove I suppose. In any case, a well-written article, possibly even if you don't have a background in economics, though it might be inaccessible in that case.
