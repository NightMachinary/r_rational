Yeah, Ori didn't resonate with me, either (although the reason I dropped it was due to a broken controller, but it certainly didn't inspire me to go back and try it again). I think a lot of gamers who want to be game devs actually want to be movie directors, and have somehow conflated all of the classic director tropes with game development. Either that or they don't realize that story-heavy JRPG is its own genre, and they don't need to inject story unnecessarily where it's unneeded.

Your proposal is actually perfect for a story heavy game, and is actually a pretty neat idea. So long as you don't try and make it an FPS with dialog tacked on, you're golden. Could even make it text based for a prototype, since visuals aren't really crucial until the other kinks have been worked out.
