Funnily enough, my experience with these two games was pretty much the exact opposite of yours.

I greatly enjoyed /Ori/ --- the controls, the flexible powers, the soundtrack, and even the difficulty and the deaths which force you to enter a certain (meditative?) frame of mind or quit playing because otherwise you'll just be getting frustrated.

And I found the /Hollow Knight/ to be bland, containing too many grinding elements (you even need to farm monsters to buy and upgrade your map) and having too many pointless game mechanics (e.g. Hunter's Journal, which is given to you with vague remarks about what exactly it will be unlocking when completed --- the answer to which ends up being [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HollowKnight/comments/61su3h/whats_the_reward_for_completing_the_hunters/][“nothing”).]] At some point the monotony of the convoluted passages just killed my interest enough for me to uninstall the game, even though cosmetically these passages /are/ drawn rather prettily.
