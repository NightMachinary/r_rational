  Would you have the opportunity to try tactics other than killing Hitler, with the titular strategy simply being the fastest one?

Well, I don't really have that worked out yet. I mean, what /is/ your goal? The naive version of the game would have the player trying to change history, but the frame probably deserves more consideration than that. The point is to present an interactive historical biography of Hitler under the guise of being a murder simulator, while covering philosophy and social issues ... but I'm not sure what end that's a means toward.
