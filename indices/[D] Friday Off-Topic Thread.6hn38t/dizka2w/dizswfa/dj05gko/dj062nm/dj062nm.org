That would be a start; but ideally, I'd want to create an entire gameplay structure around it. (the same way Minecraft has a hunger mechanism, but none of the dynamics of Don't Starve)

Orbs wouldn't just make you more powerful, they would be necessary for survival. If you don't get enough orbs regularly, then the monsters attack and your town dies.

As your town develops and grows, the need for orbs augment, and with it the need for infrastructure. A town with twice the diameter needs eight time more orbs; which means you need to recruit other Glimwardens (or "hunters" in the context of a new IP, you know what I mean), build infrastructure to store orbs, more efficient orbs, means of transportation, housings and service buildings; you need weapons to better hunt darklings, which have their own supply chain; and so on.
