At this point, you might as well go full Civ. Don't get me wrong, I would play it, but Minecraft's AI couldn't handle actual strategizing like that. Imagine Civ (I know V best but VI also probably works) with what amounts to retextured barbarians, instead of or including the gold drops, they give a heart, which is retextured Faith. None of the other stuff like founding religions can be done with faith and none of the buildings that usually make it exist anymore, but now the building requirements include Faith as well for Glimwarden soldiers which are super effective against the barbarians and can be upgraded with hearts, and every turn based on city size or something you lose faith. Negative faith nets a whole lot of bad effects, and darklings spawn everywhere.
