Huh. It's interesting that you list the death-resets-to-save-point feature as a bug, since I thought it was probably the most brilliant part of the game. Specifically I mean how it treats save points as a resource that you can use whenever you feel it's most necessary, but if you overuse obviously you may find yourself having to adventure farther and farther from one before finding a recharge, which ups the tension very organically. Ori's definitely not a perfect game (I found the aesthetics and world great but the story itself lacking) but the gameplay was practically flawless, to me (a minor gripe I have with it is that the combat upgrades are pretty pointless after the fourth or fifth one, which isn't that big a deal since there isn't enough XP in a normal completion of the game to get them all anyway, but would suck for anyone that didn't realize that ahead of time and missed out on the other, more important upgrades).

Kill Hitler sounds like it would be a great game that might work as a CYOA interactive comic over a fully graphiced out Tell Tale Games kind of thing. I agree that the title and concept are neat though :)
