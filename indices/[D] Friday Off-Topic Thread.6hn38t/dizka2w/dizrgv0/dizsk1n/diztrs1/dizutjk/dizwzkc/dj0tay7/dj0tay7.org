The flooding tree was the worst for me. It doesn't help that the sequence is short if it takes me literally hours of trying to finally get through it. The rest of the game had very manageable levels of frustration by comparison, including the other two escape sequences, although they are still my third and second least favorite parts of the game respectively, but pretty distant third and second.
