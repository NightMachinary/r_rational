Hmm. I'm actually curious now about how often you saved... I absolutely agree with your philosophy of "dying should always be your fault," but because of the save system I never got frustrated by that in Ori because it was part of the gameplay to use save points strategically and cautiously, while accepting death as an eventuality. As such I don't think I ever lost more than maybe 40-60 seconds of gameplay from a death, and when I knew there was a tricky part obviously I would make sure the death would reset me right back to that point's start.

The exception to this obviously is the "boss" areas like the collapsing tree, but again I'm pretty sure that entire thing lasts only like a minute or two max, and because there's absolutely no pause between death and restarting, and the epic music doesn't even reset from where it was, I was absolutely hooked from start to finish. That tree sequence is actually one of my favorite parts of any video game I've played in recent memory.

I just went and checked, and by the end of my first playthrough (Hard mode) I died almost 900 times. It felt like far less than that, somehow.
