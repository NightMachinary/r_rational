I've been playing Ori and the Blind Forest, which is the sort of critically acclaimed game that is probably not for me. Anytime I start a game with 5 minutes of cutscenes, or I have to repeatedly sit through unskippable cutscenes, I think that this was probably a team that gave priority to story over gameplay. Normally I don't have much of a problem with that (I like the Uncharted series, for example) but it feels really out of place in what's essentially just a pretty metroidvania. The game also resets you to your last save point after you die (in a game that has lots of instadeath), which I see as being fundamentally unfriendly, since it erases progress /and/ often makes you sit through unskippable cutscenes again. But I get why it's critically acclaimed; it's pretty and somber with a good aesthetic. I just wish that they had focused on gameplay considerations a little more. (I was probably spoiled a little bit by Hollow Knight, a metroidvania that has little touches everywhere that showed more consideration for the player.)

I kind of want to write a story or dialogue heavy game at some point, in part because I think branching dialogue and player-driven choices are neat. I have this idea for a game called "Kill Hitler" where you go back in time and kill Hitler at various points in his life. The speedrun of the game would be under a minute - you just repeatedly select the option to kill Hitler. If you want though, you can talk to Hitler when he's sitting in the trenches of WWI, when he's an art student, when he's sitting in jail, etc. to get a more complex biographical portrait. But I'd have to do a bunch of research to get it right, and that seems like a ton of work, so that's another idea that probably doesn't go anywhere. (I really like the title "Kill Hitler" for a game that's philosophically about the appropriateness of violence as a solution to various problems.)
