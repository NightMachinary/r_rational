Hard to say without more information about background and day-to-day experience. If it's severe enough that things like even a brief hug with a loved one or a hand on the arm or shoulder causes significant distress, my general suspicion would be some form of trauma, which is a very delicate thing to address outside of a professional relationship.

If we discount trauma and just focus on the symptoms to address it through a behaviorist lens, I'd probably try to isolate exceptions (if any) and see what makes those situations different so they can try to inhabit that perspective in slowly-safer situations. Gradual exposure to build up a better comfort level in general would probably be my main suggestion, but again it depends on the severity and context. Does seeing other people touch bother them too? Does being close-but-not-touching distract them? It's the work of a session or two just to get a calibration for where a good starting point would be, so finding the least probematic form and working the way up from there is the first step. Desensitization is sometimes hard to do outside of a therapeutic context too, but it depends on the person.

Hope that's helpful :)
