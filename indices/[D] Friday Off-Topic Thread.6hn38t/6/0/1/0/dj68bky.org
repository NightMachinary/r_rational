Phobias are so interesting in part because they're so variable. The original description was of a "clear set of personal boundaries," which implies that more than just touching might bother them. In which case, maybe that would help them get used to a slight boundary invasion that can still be pleasant.

On the other hand, maintaining their weaponry might be their "me time" or the best place for them to destress, in which case you wouldn't want to use that as the first place to try testing their boundaries.

Generally speaking, if it's being done in a day-to-day situation, I would suggest that a setting with more pleasant distractions is better than one with less, an activity that's more engaging is better than one that's less, and a person that they're closer with is better than one they're not as close with.

The easiest way to get a sense of what might nudge the boundary without pushing it too far is to basically test it: practice standing at different distances and see where their discomfort is just high enough that they notice it, but not high enough that it totally distracts them, or find the point where it starts to distract them, then start introducing other stimuli to see if there are any that are engaging enough to make them forget the distraction. This requires their active participation, obviously.

And for that matter, kind of important, so I should probably have mentioned it sooner: relaxation techniques are a big part of desensitization. If the person in question has never meditated or found any helpful way of reducing their anxiety or distraction, desensitization is much, much harder.

Edit:

Aaand I just realized this is probably in regards to a character from Marked for Death XD Is it Kagome or Keiko? Or someone new? I'm on Chapter 70 so still a bit behind.
