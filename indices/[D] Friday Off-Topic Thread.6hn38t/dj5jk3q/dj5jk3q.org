[[/u/DaystarEld]], how would you go about helping someone with haphephobia in the absence of professional help? (Though I suppose YOU don't have that problem :P)

I don't presently have the ability to get more information from them, but they've always had a "clear sense of personal boundaries" and do not understand how other people can lower them to tolerate or even enjoy touch, and I'm not sure how to explain that or help them.
