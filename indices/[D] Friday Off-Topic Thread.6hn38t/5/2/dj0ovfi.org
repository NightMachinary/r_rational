Using this online [[http://www.visca.com/regexdict/][Regex dictionary]] I looked up the number of words which match the patterns =/^[^mn]*m[^mn]*n[^mn]*$/= and =/^[^mn]*n[^mn]*m[^mn]*$/= (i.e. m before n vs n before m, where the word has exactly one of each).

There were 2,934 matches for m before n and only 1,327 for n before m. Things seemed to match roughly that proportion for the different parts of speech.

Removing the "exactly one m and one n" restriction, the results are similar (4,461 m before n, 2,298 n before m).

Probably the most telling example, and the one I think you were hinting at, is that if the m and n are separated by 0 or 1 letters, "m before n" had 1,465 matches and "n before m" had only 384, a ratio of about 3.8:1.

This implies that English does prefer "m before n" to "n before m" when constructing words. This may be due to some property of the words, or some other

The next step would be to compare their frequency in a representative corpus of text (of which there are many freely available, but I can't be bothered to test it right now). That could tell us if English usage reflects the raw proportion of words, or whether there's an additional bias (e.g. if people dislike "n...m", it might be even rarer than its dictionary frequency).
