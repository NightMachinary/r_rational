  Using this online Regex dictionary I looked up the number of words which match the patterns ^{[^{mn]/m[^{mn]}/n[^{mn]*$/}}} and /^{[^{mn]/n[^{mn]}/m[^{mn]*$/}}} (i.e. m before n vs n before m, where the word has exactly one of each).

That's pretty handy - I was going to try using NLTK, but this is much easier.

I notice that the same phenomenon seems to occur with p and t, the unvoiced stops with the same places of articulation, with 3468 results for

#+begin_example
  /^[^pt]*p[^pt]*t[^pt]*$/
#+end_example

versus 1081 for

#+begin_example
  /^[^pt]*t[^pt]*p[^pt]*$/
#+end_example

b and d show the same trend. So it's not just nasal consonants.
