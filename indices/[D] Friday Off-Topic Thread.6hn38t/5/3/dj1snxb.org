Punishment is different than Absence-of-Benefits. Punishment is an active choice and typically removes value for the purposes of deterring specific actions. It only serves a purpose if people are able to avoid it by behaving in a certain, publicly known, socially-optimal way.

Meanwhile, allowing poor children to remain poor is more acceptable because A) it is a passive action. Nobody caused them to become poor, nobody came and stole their money, they were just born that way. It is less wrong to do nothing and allow nature to be cruel than it is to actively be cruel yourself. And B) helping poor children comes at a cost. Every penny they are given has to be taken from someone else, possibly unwillingly in the case of taxes. Not-punishing children is free, in fact it's cheaper than it would be to punish them for the crimes of their parents. Giving charity is not free.
