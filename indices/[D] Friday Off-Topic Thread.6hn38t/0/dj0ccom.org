So I've been writing a MTG/Worm Fanfiction cross called [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/tearing-the-aeons-alt-power-au-elements.529801/][Tearing the Aeons]].

I had the terrible impulse last Wednesday to [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/tearing-the-aeons-alt-power-au-elements.529801/page-7#post-36059662][troll my readers]] by introducing a complete jarring chapter, with Zero (heh) indication that it was non-canon, and in fact, added it as a /Threadmark canon/ chapter.

After I got done with my giggling fits, I announced the chapter to be non-canon.

At one point, someone stated the following:

#+begin_quote
  Well....somehow I feel like I should have seen that coming.

  Tearing the Aeons, planeswalking effects. Seems a bit obvious in retrospect.
#+end_quote

Even in standard fan fiction and non-rational fiction, there should never be something which completely and totally blindsides the reader in theme /or/ in plot progress. While not everything in a story needs to be puzzleable or predictable, the themes and progress should be relevant and consistent, and develop step by step.

I redid the same thing following [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/posts/36071041/][literally the same formula]] for an Omake I wrote for [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/ring-maker-worm-lord-of-the-rings-alt-power.517894/][Ring-Maker]] (I beta read for the author of the Worm/LotR cross Ring-Maker).

That fic received a few similar comments, but there's enough overlap between our readerships which made the Ring-Maker omake even funnier.

There's a study of human psychology and rationalization ex-post-facto somewhere in here, but I'll leave that to psychology people like [[/u/ScottAlexander]].
