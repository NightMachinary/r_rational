Does anyone know why M and N occur together in so many words (at least in English)? Robot, money, mnemonic, demon, many, maniac, diamond, name, etc. By the availability heuristic it seems that it's more often m followed by n but that might not be the case.

It is widely accepted in this century that it is unjust to punish children for the crimes of their ancestors. In contrast, children of the rich have more opportunity than children of the poor. I'm not proposing we take everyone's babies away at birth and randomly reassign them, but in a sense isn't it also an injustice that children can benefit from actions of their ancestors?
