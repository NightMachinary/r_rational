Well, you can exclude words with

#+begin_example
  /n[aeiouy]*m/
#+end_example

or

#+begin_example
  /m[aeiouy]*n/ 
#+end_example

That is, where the n and m don't have a consonant between them. (If I got the regex right, anyway). I get 1381 results for M before N, 910 results for n first. So there's still a pretty clear trend.

On another part of the question, 23.7% of words in the dictionary contain an M, and 43.7 percent contain an N. If the were uncorrelated, we'd expect 10.3 percent to have both.

Looking at the dictionary, I found that 9% have both M and N, so they actually /don't/ occur together more often then chance, though when they do, M does tend to be first.
