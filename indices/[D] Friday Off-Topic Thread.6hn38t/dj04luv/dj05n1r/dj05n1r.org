My linguistics is a bit rusty, but I think it's probably related to the sounds and how mouths make shapes. [m] and [n] are both nasalized consonants, pronounced with a closed velum so air flows through the nose. In all the examples you give, there's a vowel between [m] and [n], which would be nasalized too. So perhaps it's that the human mouth has an easier time of maintaining nasalization through a longer stretch of word, which directs pressure on the language in that direction.
