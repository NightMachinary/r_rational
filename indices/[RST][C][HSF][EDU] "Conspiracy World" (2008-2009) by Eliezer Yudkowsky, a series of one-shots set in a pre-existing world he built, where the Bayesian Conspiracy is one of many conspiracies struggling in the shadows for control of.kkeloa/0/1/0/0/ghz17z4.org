I meant enough experiments to write down the theory of quantum gravity, not enough experiments to be 100% sure the theory of quantum gravity they discovered is the correct theory of everything. (Those are two distinct problems - even after you have a theory of quantum gravity supported by experiments, it's still possible that there will be a bigger particle accelerator that will disprove it.)
