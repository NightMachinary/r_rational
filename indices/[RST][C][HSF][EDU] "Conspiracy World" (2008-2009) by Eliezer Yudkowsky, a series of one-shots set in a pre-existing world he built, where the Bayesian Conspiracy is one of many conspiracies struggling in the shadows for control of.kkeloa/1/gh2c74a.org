Discussion: should we regard Brennan's "lack of pragmatic motivation" argument refuted by the ongoing, uh, performance issues at the FDA + CDC, and if not, how should we reconcile the theory with the observation?

Non-Americans: Feel free to substitute your own versions of our federal agencies.

Note: I'm looking for attempts to relate observations about our performance regarding Covid to Brennan's hypothesis, not just general opinions, narratives, and whatever you want to say about covid.
