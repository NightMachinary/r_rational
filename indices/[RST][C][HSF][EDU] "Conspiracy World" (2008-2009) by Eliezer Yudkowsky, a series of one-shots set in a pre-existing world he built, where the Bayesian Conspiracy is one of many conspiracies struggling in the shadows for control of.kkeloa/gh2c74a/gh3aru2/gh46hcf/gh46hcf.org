I can understand why this seems like an appealing idea but I don't think that there is any real evidence to support it.

Do you really think that the people at the FDA and throughout the government are really just taking it easy? They may not have as much as a direct incentive to avoid the threat of death as many of the more impoverished citizens but they still have all the normal incentives to do a good job. We can also assume that they all have a strong motivation to bring an end to the pandemic simply based on normal human empathy. There are some tremendous organizational and scientific challenges that have to be overcome before any real solution can be implemented. It is certainly possible that there is some level of institutional apathy slowing things down but it makes no sense to treat that as the sole source of delay. It seems like saying that the reason for the lack of an immediate solution to the current crisis is a lack of concern serves more to create a convenient enemy than as an actual explanation.

I think that the key problem is that we (average citizens) have no real way of determining how long it should take to produce a major scientific effort (vaccine or new theory). Can we really say that they are going "slow" when we don't fully understand all the steps in the process? What would a "fast" means of producing scientific results even look like? Is the current length of time (1+ years) for the vaccine really that long? My perspective is that our lack of understanding means that any evaluations we are making regarding the effectiveness of the government and the scientific community will be inherently flawed as they will be based on our frustrations rather than on actual evidence.

I would also say that there is a big flaw in assuming that you can end up with a superior or faster product simply by "working harder". There are unavoidable constraints on how much effort you can get out of people and applying pressure in an attempt to increase work productivity can easily backfire. History seems to indicate that forcing people to meet artificially imposed deadlines that are applied based on public demand or political needs will lead to failures or falsifications intended to avoid punishment rather than true improvement. This seems like it would be especially true when we are dealing with something like vaccine creation where any errors can lead to a massive and irreversible disaster.
