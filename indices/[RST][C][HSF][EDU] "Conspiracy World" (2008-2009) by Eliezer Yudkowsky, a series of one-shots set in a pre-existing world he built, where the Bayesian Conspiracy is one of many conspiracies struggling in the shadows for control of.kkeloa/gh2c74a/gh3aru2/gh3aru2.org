I suggest that the specific decisionmakers at the FDA are indeed lacking in pragmatic motivation. What do they care if ten thousand people die? They'll still go home with their nice paychecks to their comfortable homes in zoned suburbs; and they'll still be first in line for getting the vaccine, whenever they decide it's safe enough for them to risk. As a civilisation we may have pragmatic motivation for speed; but we don't make decisions as a civilisation. Specific people do, and their incentives evidently suck.
