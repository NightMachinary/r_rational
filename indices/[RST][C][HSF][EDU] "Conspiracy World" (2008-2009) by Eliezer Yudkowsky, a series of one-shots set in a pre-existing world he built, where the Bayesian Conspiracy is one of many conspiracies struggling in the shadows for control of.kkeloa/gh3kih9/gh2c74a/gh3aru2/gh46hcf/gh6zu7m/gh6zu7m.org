  Do you really think that the people at the FDA and throughout the government are really just taking it easy?
#+end_quote

Yes? Obviously?

#+begin_quote
  they still have all the normal incentives to do a good job.
#+end_quote

Indeed they do. I think you and I disagree on how much incentive that is for a government bureaucrat.

  I would also say that there is a big flaw in assuming that you can end up with a superior or faster product simply by "working harder". There are unavoidable constraints on how much effort you can get out of people and applying pressure in an attempt to increase work productivity can easily backfire.

That is true. But it does not seem that difficult, for example, to prepare your [[https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2020/12/a-suggestion-for-the-fda.html][fact sheet]] in /advance/ of the meeting wherein you're about 99% sure you'll approve the vaccine, instead of waiting until it's approved and thus delaying the distribution by a week. Are you seriously going to claim that there was nobody at the FDA who could do this clerical work in advance, instead of after the meeting, for fear of burning them out? This speaks to me of an utterly lackadaisical attitude, a complete lack of appreciation for the need for speed.
