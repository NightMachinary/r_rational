Sometimes phisycs advances because a new experiment. Sometimes physics advances because we make a better theory from the evidence we already had and later confirm the results whith experiments, like Einstein did for relativity.

And its not like most people in theoretical physics are sitting arround waiting for experiments to unfold, they are in fact sitting arround publishing papers whith new theories from the data we already have.

I mean particle accelerator experiments in particular are a good example. They are big and expensive and take time so most people doing physics can't just directly test whatever ideas they have. You don't just sit in a room whith a particle accelerator testing things. You theorize a particle and 50 years afterwards someone makes a collider big enough to detect it and you win a nobel.

So maybe they can't actually realistically figure it out whith the info they have or maybe they do.

The teacher is basically saying they can figure it out so presumably it is the second case.
