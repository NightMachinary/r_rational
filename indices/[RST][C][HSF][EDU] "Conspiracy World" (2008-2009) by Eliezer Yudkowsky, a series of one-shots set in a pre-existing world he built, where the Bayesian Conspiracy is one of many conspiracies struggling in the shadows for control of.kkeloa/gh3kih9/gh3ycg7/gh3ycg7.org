They're rationalists - their ability to find the correct answer is vastly superior to ours. We think we haven't done enough experiments on particle accelerators to find the right answer. We're wrong.

Alternatively, since this is (probably) set in the future, they've /already done/ enough experiments.

Or, alternatively, they're all wrong and they can't, in fact, discover the theory of quantum gravity. Maybe the teacher will grade them based on what they tried, not based on whether they succeeded.
