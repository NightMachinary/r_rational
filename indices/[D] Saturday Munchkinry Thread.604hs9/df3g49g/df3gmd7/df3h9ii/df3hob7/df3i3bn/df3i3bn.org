Ah, I was hoping my third bullet point would address that. For something complex like investing, you would need to break it down into its component parts, like quantitative analysis. Similarly, in your IQ test example, you could train yourself in the mental skills necessary to do well on an IQ test (pattern recognition and such) but that is the only guarantee. Instead of you being smart enough to get a better score, it would be you being good enough at the test to get a better score. I know that's splitting hairs, but it seems like an important distinction.
