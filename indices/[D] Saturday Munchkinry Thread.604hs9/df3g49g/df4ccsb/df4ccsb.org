I'd only use money for magical training when I'm /also/ using money for mundane training.

If $100 can buy you a coach/tutor that doubles your training gains, and $100 can buy you magic boosts that double your training gains, then you get a 4x boost for $200, instead of the $300 it would take with pure magic. I'm guessing that real-life trainers scale in efficiency at less than a 1:1 rate (i.e. spending twice as much gets you less than twice the benefit), so I'd likely end up spending more on magic than on people if I was being efficient.

Sports seems like a very easy target if you had it since birth. Pro athletes get millions of dollars (which can fuel your training), and putting in 100 hour-equivalents of training per day is probably enough to get you there.

If I got it right now instead of at birth, I'd look into some sort of consulting job where the demand is for quickly learning a new skill or set of knowledge. Examples are emergency tech support for legacy systems, jack-of-all-trades for rich/powerful people, or anything else time-sensitive, important, and rare.
