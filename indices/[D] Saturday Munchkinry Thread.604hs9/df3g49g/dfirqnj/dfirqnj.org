What defines money? If I make this ability public and somehow demonstrate proof, I might be able to crowdfund money to me, especially given that I'm not spending the money, I'm destroying it - which overall has the effect of the gifters not gifting any amount of their actual societal resources to me, unlike normal dollar gifting. If you destroy a one dollar bill, that one dollar is now gone, and the value of all other dollars increases just slightly.

Alternatively, in the same vein, I can reach out to the government and get them to mint me a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trillion_dollar_coin][trillion dollar coin]].
