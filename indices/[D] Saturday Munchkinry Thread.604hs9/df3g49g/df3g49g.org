Every time you are training yourself in a physical or mental task, you have the option to financially invest in making your training time significantly more efficient- as in, there's a theoretical dollar amount that makes your time training yourself twice as efficient as not spending any money on your training time at all.

Clarifications:

- The amount you spend is however much or little as you like, on a continuous scale. If $X increases your training effectiveness by 100%, spending $2X will increase it by 200% and $.5X will make it increase by 50%.
- the mechanism of spending your money is essentially magical and absolute- no bargaining, no cheating or trickery, no refunds.
- the aspect of your training that is enhanced by your financial investment tends toward being more specific. For example, spending money on training your sprinting will make you faster, whereas training your jogging will make you have better endurance while running. Similarly, spending money on practicing math problems will make you better at the type of math you're practicing, not just generally smarter. Spending it while weightlifting will only make you stronger in the muscle group that you are currently working on
- Training in this fashion can ultimately make you superhumanly good at a human task (e.g. running superhumanly fast, being superhumanly strong), but it cannot give you a fundamentally superhuman skill like telekinesis or ATLA's earthbending.
- I don't want to assign specific dollar values, but in each case money spent is significant enough that you want to be intentional about it, yet affordable enough that it can still be a presence in your life. It's not $100, it's not 50 cents.

1) If this was true of you right now starting today, what would you do differently?

2) If this was true of you from birth, what would you do differently?

I know there are parts of this I left open/vague, so ask as many questions as you need. Also, this prompt is going to be making an appearance in the next Worldbuilding thread! For now, let's just keep this question limited to one theoretical person.
