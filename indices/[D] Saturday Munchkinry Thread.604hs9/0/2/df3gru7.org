In the scenario described after your first /but/, is the diary only telling the terrorist that information based on the terrorist's conditional commitment? It sounds like the diary is responding to mental commitments of the user, so how complex can the commitment go? If conditionals are fair game, it sounds like you can set up a series of If/Then statements, some even nested within each other, that could eventually involve elementary computer programming. Or am I misunderstanding?

And the diary can predict what people can do, but not if what they will do will end up being informed or determined what another diary will do? If so, I would say one of the more obvious things to do would be to introduce people into the equation that don't have diaries, so as to have more reliable and predictable elements that can be exploited. Try hiring/threatening/blackmailing people without diaries into helping you, since it sounds like that's the only real way to have controllable elements in this competition.

ETA: Even though the competition can have only one winner, I think at the beginning some diary users would form a temporary alliance, which could potentially limit the amount of chaos in the narrative at the beginning of the story up until some players are eliminated.
