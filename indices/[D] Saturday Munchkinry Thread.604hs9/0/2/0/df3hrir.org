  If conditionals are fair game, it sounds like you can set up a series of If/Then statements, some even nested within each other, that could eventually involve elementary computer programming. Or am I misunderstanding?

I think you do, unless I misunderstand you.

Think in terms of timelines. At the moment when the prediction is supposed to be made, the timeline splits into DT and PT timelines. In the DT timeline, which is simulated by the Diary, the Diaries have stopped working; that timeline is simulated up to a certain point where the Terrorist either gets caught, or successfully escapes (without her Diary's assistance). The Diary then simulates DT!Terrorist's best suggestions about escaping that she would've given to her past self, and reveals these suggestions to PT!Terrorist. /Then/ it runs the simulation again, checks if DT1!Terrorist's suggestions would lead to DT2!Terrorist's escape; if not, it repeats the process until DT(N)!Terrorist's suggestions lead to DT(N+1)!Terrorist's escape.

Basically, the commitments could be as complicated as the Holder is capable of remembering and following, but they would only be useful in PT timeline if formulated in a way that manipulates the Diaries into sending information about their results into the past.

  And the diary can predict what people can do, but not if what they will do will end up being informed or determined what another diary will do?

Yes. Each message of a Diary introduces /chaos/ into the primary timeline, that wasn't present in the simulated/disposable one. Not only other Diary Holders are unpredictable: anything touched by Diary Holders is unpredictable (well, if the Holder has received messages from the future after your last one, that is).
