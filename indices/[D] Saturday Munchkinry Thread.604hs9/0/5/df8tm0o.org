Reading through the list:

- Use the Murder Diary to brute-force searches for specific individuals and/or locations. Conveniently, your whole goal in this exercise is to find some people and kill them. Otherwise useless.
- The Clairvoyant Diary (the same one you called the Priestess, above) is basically an upgraded version of the generic diaries. "But what if they get fooled!" is not actually a weakness, since literally anyone can be fooled.
- The Escape/Terrorist diary is by far the most powerful diary in combat, given a broad definition of "combat".
- The Watcher and the Blog need to recruit minions. Watcher is a moron for working alone. Blog should just get someone to stand in her presence at all times, preferably multiple people, or just give a Blog to someone who has a crush on her.

All the other diaries are variations on the same basic "it tells the future!" thing. They're all /really useful/ for brute-forcing tasks that don't involve other diaries.

Generic diary tricks:

- Diaries can be used "offensively", since they can't be predicted. I.e. if you want to catch someone, you need to check your diary /immediately after they do/ and then strike.
- Attend a meeting with another diary-holder, then check the results and don't actually do it. Only works if they're an ally. Or I guess you could buy a phone, or, like, literally use your diary (most of which are phones) as a phone. Still, I remain convinced there's a use for this trick.
- The correct way to win the tournament is probably to brute-force your way to nuclear weapons, wait 24 hours, and then destroy whatever city this anime is set in.

EDIT: more generally, I think the thing to do is probably to brute-force mundane tasks that add up to a situation where you can't lose. After a week, diary-holders should rule most of the globe and the manhunt for the others should be ongoing. The mundane utility of these diaries (except the Terrorist) is just /so much greater/ than the diary-vs-diary utility of any of them.
