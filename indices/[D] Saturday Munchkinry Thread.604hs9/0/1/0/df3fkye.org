The Terrorist doesn't get a constant stream of '1' if she is in the primary timeline, she gets an updated plan /only/ if her current one is unworkable. That means she can't distinguish the primary timeline where her current plan works from the disposable one where her Diary doesn't.

*Edit:* Albeit she can precommit to go surrender if her Diary doesn't change, to check if it works, which... I don't think will work. While not-altering of the Diary's text would result in her failure to escape, the Diary's altering of its text for the sole purpose of /convincing/ the Terrorist to escape would imply its attempts to /manipulate/ her into escaping, which I don't think it's supposed to do.
