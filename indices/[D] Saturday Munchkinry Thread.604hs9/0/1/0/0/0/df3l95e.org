  Does the Diary read the Terrorist's mind to find the best escape suggestions he could give back if he wanted to
#+end_quote

Yes.

#+begin_quote
  What's the exact reset trigger?
#+end_quote

Mm, the Diary constantly queries a simulation of the Terrorist's mind as taken at the start of the current iteration of the loop about wheter or not given iteration's Terrorist's situation could be considered either 'a succesful escape' or 'a capture'. If yes, reset.

#+begin_quote
  that will eventually summon great improbabilities if escape is not plausibly possible
#+end_quote

Will that happen, though? Any given plan risks sending the Terrorist into a situation such that she literally can't come up with any escape routes. Her precommitment to finding them isn't indefinitely strong: it will break eventually, long before we get to the true improbabilities.

#+begin_quote
  Therefore Diary users might want to limit the amount of loops they run
#+end_quote

That's a rather interesting idea, though.
