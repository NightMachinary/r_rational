What happens if there is no plausible possibility of escape? Cause that's what would happen if the Diary searched a timeline where the diary doesn't work and the terrorist reliably commited to surrender if the diary doesn't work.

Edit: After reading the other thread, the workings of the diary are more clear: Each time he queries the Diary, he goes into a Groundhog Day loop with mostly amnesia that he can only break out of by escaping, during which none of the other diaries work - an [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/ld/the_hidden_complexity_of_wishes/][outcome pump]], if you will, that will eventually summon great improbabilities if escape is not plausibly possible. Does the Diary read the Terrorist's mind to find the best escape suggestions he could give back if he wanted to, or can the Terrorist choose what information to send back? (What's the exact reset trigger? I suppose that the Priestess cannot try to brainwash him without triggering a reset.)

Since computers exist, and surely somewhere in the world there's some idiot that's generating random numbers and running them as code, after an exponential amount of loops an AGI spawns and tries to break out of whatever Diary it's currently trapped in. Therefore Diary users might want to limit the amount of loops they run. For example, the terrorist might carry dice, and after he activates the Diary throw the dice to see if he rolls 100 1s in a row to see whether the loops have been going on too long, and then desperately try to convince, say, the Priestess, to let him "escape" to break the loop before it eats them.
