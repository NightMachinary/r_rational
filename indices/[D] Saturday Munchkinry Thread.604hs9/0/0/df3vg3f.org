After reading the Tvtropes entry and the list of what all the diaries do, my first question is this: Can the diaries be stolen? Not to use for yourself but based on the idea that destroying a diary will kill it's user. Society has a lot of rules and restrictions on killing people. However, you could (in theory) manage to get a single kill off while avoiding the diary warning the person, but then you now have the police hunting you down adding difficulty to your goal. Society reacts much less harmfully to things like stealing or destroying cell phones. Stealing someone's diary and hiding it for 24 hours will A) prevent them from receiving updates from the future and B) with the 24 hour waiting period, keeps them from getting a DEAD END notification before you steal the diary. The most they might get is an odd lack of entries before the theft (which in turn makes the theft easier) since future!they don't have the diary to write in it (unless the diary entries still appear as though they had the diary to write in it, which is difficult but not insurmountable). Then after the 24 hour (possibly 48 hour for some to be safe) waiting period, you drop the phone in a blender, the diary user dies with no connection to you other than some sleight of hand or snatching the phone out of their hand 12 hours earlier.

The main weakness' of this strategy are both The Criminal Investigation Diary (with it's 90 day reach and focus on crimes in general (such as theft)) and any "paired" diaries where one can monitor the other (such as The Exchange Diaries and Yukiteru & Yuno's diaries).

This also makes me wonder how much information the players have about each other. Knowing exactly how everyone's diary works will up the survivablity dramatically, and being able to model people's behavior (if player 3 gets information X in their diary, they will decide to do Y, and therefore I should tell past me to do Z, which will prompt player 5 to convince player 8 to do Q...) will ramp up the complexity.
