There's also an incentive to /lower/ the sanity waterline of the population of your enemy, make them deluded and dim. Biological and chemical weapons, memetic hazards in the form of propaganda and pseudoscience, assasinations of the enemy's scientists/politicians --- they would be powerful tools in this endeavor.

Which is something most governments would be doing, I think. It is easier, it's something we have more experience with as a civilization, it is more benefitical in the short-term, than raising your population's rationality.

Moloch will win shortly afterwards, the civilization cast into the new Dark Ages.
