  So use 'rogue' superhuman bio-terrorists.

Given nobody has powers that let them produce poisons like that you would need to supply them with the poison. Which would be rather implausible given just how much you need to seriously affect a population. I mean affecting your enemies population on that scale is already rather difficult, and arranging for it to be carried out by a single individual who must plausibly have synthesized it themselves is even less workable.

  The yet-unstoppable offence offered by the superhumans would make the assassinations way more successfull and easy, so I doubt our world's model of warfare is applicable here.

Well keep in mind that all their absolute /best/ scientists would probably be superhumans making them extremely difficult to quickly dispatch, plus the others would be likely guarded (obviously by superhumans, though just being around other scientists will make it likely there will be superhumans around). I mean there's a pretty substantial incentive to protect yourself here.
