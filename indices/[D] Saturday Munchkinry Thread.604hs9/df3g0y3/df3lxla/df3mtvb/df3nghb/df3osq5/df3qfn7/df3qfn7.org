  Given nobody has powers that let them produce poisons like that you would need to supply them with the poison

Supply them with poison by telling them where you, or other countries, keep the poison, then 'witnessing in horror' as they steal it and use it on the enemy's population.

  Well keep in mind that all their absolute /best/ scientists would probably be superhumans making them extremely difficult to quickly dispatch
#+end_quote

I see. Well, if >30% of the not-best scientists is being slaughtered, that would still hit the enemy's research and development ability strongly, with nobody /desiring/ to be a scientist if they're not a superhuman already on top of the direct damage. I doubt superhuman bodyguards are going to be much help here: killing a normal would be way easier than protecting them from being killed.

Still, have superhumans any weaknesses? Poison, drowning, eyeballs? Anything that would be unviable in a straight combat, but could be used in a well-planned assassination?

^{Is my line of inquiry ultimately peripheral to your idea? I.e., did you want to talk about a scenario where the governments race to make their populations sane and healthy, with me reducing it to the typical boring conflicts full of atrocities, or are you interested in viewing it from that angle as well?}
