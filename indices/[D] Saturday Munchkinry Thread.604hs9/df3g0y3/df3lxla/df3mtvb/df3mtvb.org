It's assumed that the soviets have their own superintelligence acting on their behalf so things aren't going to be easy, assume if you could think of a countermeasure so could they.

Chemical, biological and other obvious weapons seem unlikely to be viable since using them on the enemy would be an act of war (whereas using "rogue" superhumans strains credulity somewhat less, since plenty of superhumans do go rogue)

Also how much success do you really think you'll have making the soviet population crazier/dumber just via propaganda? I mean the state controls the media and the citizens view you as evil so good luck. I don't know that there's any examples of this sort of information warfare working in the way you would need here.

As for assassinations that seems sensible for both sides, especially with the existence of superhumans as the perfect assassin. However killing your enemies top scientists also makes sense as a tactic in a normal timeline, and I don't know how much part that played in the actual cold war.
