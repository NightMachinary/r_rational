  Don't force hallucinogens down their throats. Open an Advanced Academy for Top University Students, in which the entrance exam is a thinly (or not-so-thinly) disguised test for loyalty (and is accompanied by a thorough background check) - if a few less-loyal patriots slip in, odds are their views will be changed by being surrounded all day every day by flag-wavers.

Instilling patriotism that way seems rather difficult. You would really only be driving dissent into the shadows, and if you got to Mccarthyist then you raise the incentive for people to emigrate or defect. Plus it's not like a test for patriotism would be at all effective, I mean these are geniuses we're talking about. They can get their heads around the idea of lying about how much they love the government. A background check has similar problems and will only weed out those who were associated openly with groups of dissenters.

As for slipping drugs in the water, that's really unlikely to be something you can easily cover up, and if you get caught it looks worse then forcing people to take drugs "as a matter of national security".
