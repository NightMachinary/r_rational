You don't just want 'educated'. You want /loyal/ first, and only /after/ that educated. The last thing you want is to train up a superhuman who then /actually/ goes rogue. Or worse, defects to the enemy.

At the same time, you want the enemy's superhumans to defect to /you/. So you treat your superhumans really well, and make sure that the enemy superhumans /know/ that you treat your superhumans really well.

Educating people better is a long-term strategy. Elected politicians love short-term, this-will-show-results-before-I-leave-office type strategies.
