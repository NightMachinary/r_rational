You're just a slightly superintelligent entity that can directly manipulate it's mind like a simulated mind, and perceives time vastly faster. You're also pretty much invulnerable, can shapeshift, teleport, blow up entire cities, quite a lot of thing but not direct mind control since that requires detailed knowledge of neurology that nobody has.

Still having a very long subjective time to come up with plans, slight superintelligence (that applies to every area of intelligence including charisma), the ability to spy on people, the ability to manipulate people's brain crudely and get information the same way(on par with what we can do currently with drugs/brain stimulation, and able to tell things we can currently tell by looking at MRI's and the like), etc makes it pretty trivial to control a government if there's no competing god-tier superhumans protecting that government from you. It's assumed that the soviets have their own god-tier superhuman acting in a similar way.

Anyway the real important part of my question is how a government would make it's population vastly more intelligent rational and educated if there was a extremely strong incentive to do so.
