Great ideas.

  Attend a meeting with another diary-holder, then check the results and don't actually do it. Only works if they're an ally. Or I guess you could buy a phone, or, like, literally use your diary (most of which are phones) as a phone. Still, I remain convinced there's a use for this trick.

Yes. Variations on this are:

- Outsource your thinking to your DT (disposable timeline) selves, get plans that should take you a day in a second. Works with multi-people discussions, and iterative plans, and iterative discussions, too.

- Use DTs to convince people of something, then read and use the best arguments your DT selves have found.

- Use DTs to torture people for information, get only the results.

- Use DTs to steal information from well-defended facilities in suicide raids.

- Start mass-scale terrorist bombings in a DT timeline, promise to stop if the 'former' Diary Holders reveal themselves, get their identities. (Should work great at the start, when almost no-one knows how the Diaries work, how it looks 'from the inside'.)

And so on. Basically, as long as no other Diary is involved, almost any Diary Holder is virtually omniscient and has quantitative superintelligence. (Conditional on them finding a way to send themselves arbitrary messages, but it should be doable for most of them, if... unwiedly, for some.)

  The correct way to win the tournament is probably to brute-force your way to nuclear weapons, wait 24 hours, and then destroy whatever city this anime is set in.

... Yes. It /is/. That occurred to me too, when I was thinking of how I would try to win this mess.

If you commit to only launch the missiles after witnessing your Diary predicting the future, none of the others Diary Holders would even see it coming until it's too late to leave the area of destruction. Hilarious.

  After a week, diary-holders should rule most of the globe and the manhunt for the others should be ongoing. The mundane utility of these diaries (except the Terrorist) is just so much greater than the diary-vs-diary utility of any of them.

I was imagining them getting stuck in a stalemate, constantly foiling each other's 'mundane' plans, forcing confrontations, perhaps one of them setting up a perimeter around the city, et cetera, but... You're probably right. They would immediately try to flee the city at all costs and start global-scale decades-spanning Scry vs. Scry World War Three. Which would be fun to witness, but impossible to plan. /Damnation./

The anime had a sort of justification: the god-gamemaster who set it all up was dying, needed to pick a successor soon unless the world ends, so it put everyone in one city. I suppose creating a time limit and closing off the city's borders would indeed be necessary to prevent global-scale messes and nuclear surprises.
