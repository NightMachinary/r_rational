  For the escape diary, what does it tell you if you have nothing to escape from, and nobody is making an attack against you? If nothing, then the diary can act as an alert system- regularly ask the diary for an escape, and once it returns a non-null value, you know that someone is making a move against you.

Your model is correct.

  I can't fathom a rational narrative that includes all diaries being anything other than constant unmitigated chaos. What we're talking about here is basically Game Theory plus time travel, so things would immediately become extremely complex.

Yes! Exactly. Isn't that a fascinating challenge, fitting for a rational fiction writer? To take this premise, run with it, and /make it work/?
