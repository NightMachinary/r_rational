To be honest, this is fiddly enough that I'm dubious it could make a good story.

Anyway:

#+begin_quote
  Timeline 1: Priestess' flock inexplicably do nothing. Terrorist buys this (?) and escapes. RESET

  Timeline 2: Priestess' diary warns her that Terrorist is in the building she orders her flock to capture them. Terrorist is captured. RESET.

  Timeline 3: Priestess' diary describes her flock capturing the Terrorist. However, the Terrorist's diary gives her directions to avoid the flock, which she does. Terrorist escapes successfully. RESET

  Timeline 4: Priestess' diary says her flock don't see anything. Terrorist escapes successfully. REAL TIMELINE
#+end_quote

Thus, the actual sequence of events is:

1. Terrorist consults diary (generating a throwaway timeline), begins path
2. The moment Terrorist consults her diary, Priestess' diary notices the future is different (how?) and generates a new throwaway timeline. Priestess' diary updates to reflect the new path.
3. Priestess reads her diary. Terrorist's diary notices time has shifted and generates a new throwaway timeline.
4. Priestess orders her flock to attack! But they fail.

Or am I misunderstanding the system here?
