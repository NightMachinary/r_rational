(There shouldn't be any problems with the police: the bodies of the Diary Holders rather conveniently get sucked into black hole thingies upon dying, which leaves no evidence at all!)

  Can the diaries be stolen?
#+end_quote

Yes. As a matter of fact, nothing stops you from just taking someone's Diary and... using it for yourself. The messages continue to arrive (they're completely simulated, no actual typing is involved in any timeline), the Holder doesn't need to be able to read them or be in close proximity to the Diary. The First's Diary will continue to tell about the events the First perceives, it won't 'change owners', strictly speaking, but it won't care who reads its messages for what purposes, either.

The Diary-robbery was even done once in the anime, though naturally nobody bothered to do the obvious thing and start stealing others' Diaries for their powers.

(Granted, there are drawbacks to this approach. As destroying a Diary kills the Holder, killing a Holder destroys the Diary. To be safe, you can't just steal someone's Diary and trust them not to get killed at the most inapporiate for you moment, or not to form a temporary alliance with the other Holders and reveal your new Diary's weaknesses to them.)

  This also makes me wonder how much information the players have about each other
#+end_quote

It depends, but in general, barring the Eleventh and his hax not-actually-Future-Diary Diary, nobody knew anything about anyone else or their Diaries besides seeing their silhouettes when the gamemaster introduced them to the game.
