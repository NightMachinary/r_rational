So, I've seen /[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FutureDiary][Future Diary]]/ recently. It was entertaining, the characters sometimes were clever, interesting, and/or awesome, but the most fascinating thing, of course, wasn't used to its full potential. ^{(You may notice} ^{[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4y62uz/d_wednesday_worldbuilding_thread/d6l7r8m/?context=3][a]]} ^{[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4y62uz/d_wednesday_worldbuilding_thread/d6l7r8m/?context=3][pattern]]} ^{here.)}

After thinking about it, I can imagine why, and almost forgive that. Almost.

To be brief, twelve people were given magical devices ('Diaries') that can predict the future, each in an individual specific way. They were then put in a city and told to kill each other; the last one standing gets to be a god.

The time travel system has rules, which can be viewed as example [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FutureDiary][here]], but typically, they weren't defined clearly enough. My take on that is similar to [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4y62uz/d_wednesday_worldbuilding_thread/d6l7r8m/?context=3][my take]] on the Caller's time travel system: any given prediction of a Diary tells the future of a timeline where the Diaries stopped working the instant before that prediction was made. As a consequence, they can't predict the other Diaries, and they can't predict themselves. You can think about it this way: each time a prediction is about to be made, the timeline splits into a 'disposable' one, where the Diaries don't work, and a 'primary' one, which gets messages from the disposable one's future.

So, I'm now trying to figure out how a confrontation between two rational and competent Diary Holders would go, and...

--------------

Let's take something simple. The Priestess has a Clairvoyance Diary, which tells her what her flock --- each member of her flock --- will perceive in the future. The Terrorist has an Escape Diary, which gives her a workable escape path that one of her selves discovered in a 'disposable' timeline. The Terrorist is in the Priestess's shrine, and needs to escape.

 1. The Terrorist gets an escape path.

 2. The Priestess gets information that the Terrorist would escape and where she would escape, and so gives orders to concentrate forces in that location.

 3. The Terrorist gets an updated escape path, which takes into account the Priestess's adjustments.

 N. Repeat ad infinitum.

A competent Priestess may foresee that, and order her people to let the Terrorist escape, /unless/ you see her changing her behaviour after looking at her Diary. A Diary can't predict a Diary; a Diary cannot predict /itself/: so a Diary can't take into account the consequences of its future actions on its plans in the present.

So the Terrorist gets caught.

/But./ A competent Terrorist may compare what her Diary is telling her to what she sees, and precommit to, if she /doesn't/ notice changes in the flock's behaviour, fluke her escape attempt, follow the previous path and get caught, /only/ acting on her new escape path if she sees the Priestess' people acting to circumvent the previous one. The Priestess sees her countermeasures working, assumes that the Terrorist won't get an update before it's too late. The Terrorist, meanwhile, will escape.

/But./ Both a competent Terrorist and a competent Priestess, who know of the weakness described above --- i.e., precommiting to do X if you see the evidence that you're in a 'disposable' timeline, enact the actual plan in the primary timeline only --- may teach themselves (or their people) to act as if they receive messages from the future, even if they /don't/, in order to get a picture of the enemy's true plans in the present. Or vice-versa, pretend to lose the predicative power to bait out the opponent's precommited defeats.

Or be classy and act as consistently or as unpredictable as possible, so that nobody could tell if you have precog or not, from the look of your actions.

Or do something I did not think of.

--------------

The above is an example of a confrontation between two players, in a closed location and within a short timeframe, with fairly comprehensible Diary interactions, using the first trick I came up with. Can you imagine twelve people with completely different predicative abilities waging a war in a city, in the span of a few months? I feel confused just imagining thinking about it.

So, naturally thought I, why not add /more/ complexity?

You can read canon Diaries' abilities [[http://futurediary.wikia.com/wiki/Future_Diary_%28term%29#List_of_Diaries][here]], I can try translating them to my system on demand. Can you think of any interesting exploits? Counters to the tactics described above? More cool munchkinery?

^{Or ideas on how to make sense of the complicated interactions?}
