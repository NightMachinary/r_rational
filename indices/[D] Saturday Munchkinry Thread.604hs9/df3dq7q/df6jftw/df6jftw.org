This actually reminds me of a power I came up with in a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/56heia/saturday_munchkinry_thread/d8jv2rj/][previous munchkinry thread]]

Do you think my power could be refashioned as a future diary? It would probably have to be something extremely simple, like a tiny box with two red LEDs, but I digress.

What do you think? It seems like you've given these kinds of superpowers a lot of thought, so I'd like your input on my future diary's uses and usefulness.

Thanks!
