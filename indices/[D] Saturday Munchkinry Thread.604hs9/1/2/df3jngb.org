I would try to get better at choosing how to use my ability: what skills I should use it on, how much money invest in them.

I think the final combinations of skills would be something that lets me determine, for any given skill, how much money that skill would let me make both long-term and short-term, how easier my ability would make learning it in comparasion to an ordinary human (in absolute terms, i.e. training-hours, not in relative terms, which are constant, by your first bullet point), are there any combinations of this skill with other skills that would make learning it a priority, et cetera --- and then calculate the skill's usefulness using these values.

Breaking that down into individual skills... I'm not sure. Building mathematical models, obviously. Analyzing basic economic interactions, then specialized ones (which I would only figure out after learnig the basics). Learning theory. I think looking-at-a-profession-and-breaking-it-into-individual-skills could be considered a skill, so I'll do that. Possibly also long-term planning.

I think that strategy would work great in the second scenario, where I have it from birth, so I can take my time researching it. In the first scenario, I would probably need to combine it with [[/u/vakusdrake][u/vakusdrake]]'s suggestion of using it to get better at acquiring money.
