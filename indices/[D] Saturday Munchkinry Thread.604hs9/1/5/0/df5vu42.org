    Training in this fashion can ultimately make you superhumanly good at a human task (e.g. running superhumanly fast, being superhumanly strong)
  #+end_quote

  Is it that it can make you, or that it will make you?
#+end_quote

An excellent question! In the magic system that I'm basically using this thread to bug-test, it CAN make you superhuman, but not necessarily. Two limitations that you are specifically wondering about:

1) All else held equal (training time and investment), people with a natural talent for something will end up more successful in that skill

2) Practice does not always make perfect! If you want to be the world's best long-distance runner, but your running form is poor, practicing that form will not be nearly as helpful as making sure you are already running in ideal form before training begins. Theoretically, it would be possible to train yourself into doing something in a very inefficient way, and thus leave yourself at a disadvantage.

And to be very clear, yes, I do intend that one can eventually surpass conventional human limitations with enough time/investment, solely through the magical nature of investment in this system.

There are lots of thoughts in your last paragraph, so I'll try to address what I think are the two most prominent ones:

  Also, are the costs of the training fixed, or some flat percent of your assets, or some progressive percent?
#+end_quote

Fixed. You're right about the billionaires, as the system stands now. It is a lot of fun to imagine how things would play out otherwise though.

  [paraphrase] Does learning how to bake one kind of cake help me learn how to bake another kind of cake too?
#+end_quote

This is by far the most tricky part of working out this system. As it currently stands, it's more or less a matter of focus. When baking the cake, are you focusing on the process of baking? Are you focusing on the optimal combination of ingredients for the specific recipe (however one might personally define optimal)? Is it how quickly one can bake that cake (although one can't rush an oven, one can be quicker with the rest of the process)? This is another confounding factor with the magical investment system- one should ideally be informed and have a clear goal in mind, or risk wasting valuable time and money.
