  Training in this fashion can ultimately make you superhumanly good at a human task (e.g. running superhumanly fast, being superhumanly strong)

Is it that it /can/ make you, or that it /will/ make you? As in, you're still limited by more "intrinsic" differences and diminishing marginal returns, right? If I spend the next five decades devoting myself to maths (or the next 5 years at $10X), I still won't be as good as, say, your average Fields medal or Abel Prize recipient at age 30. Likewise, no amount of hypertraining my running ability would make me faster than Usain Bolt, because I'm just not built for it.

And I would, of course, still need to train, and train effectively at that, it's just that with the efficiency modified I could accomplish in an hour what would otherwise take X hours. So I don't think it's a given that:

  Similarly, spending money on practicing math problems will make you better at the type of math you're practicing, not just generally smarter. Spending it while weightlifting will only make you stronger in the muscle group that you are currently working on.
#+end_quote

Unless the nature of training is itself video-game-ified, because of course it's possible to spend plenty of time training e.g. lifting without making any real progress (so X * 0 is still 0).

Anyway, this would make me shift in my priorities a bit to value earning money more, because the marginal utility of money would no longer diminish quite as quickly (in that I have more things to buy). Depending on the exact costs, I'd prioritize hypertraining tasks that are valuable but unpleasant (to me), like reading math textbooks.

Also, are the costs of the training fixed, or some flat percent of your assets, or some progressive percent? I imagine if they're fixed the world would be a drastically different place, filled with billionaire polymaths. Does the training affect only your "ability" or the work you perform while training too? (and if not, what's the mechanism exactly? Like, I can learn to bake a cake by baking a cake -- in baking a cake I improve my cake baking ability. If it still takes me the same amount of time to bake a cake, where's the extra cake baking ability coming from? Do I know how to bake cakes that are distinct from the one I baked? Is it as if I'd baked that cake X times?)? I imagine there'd be charities devoted to hypertraining individuals on important tasks, and a lot more research into optimal learning/training methods (to get the most bang for your multiplicative buck by modifying the base rate).
