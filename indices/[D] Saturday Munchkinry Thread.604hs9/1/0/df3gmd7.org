Invest in one activity that being extremely good at will make you a lot of money. The best example I can think of is paying to get better at investing since that scales up pretty significantly. Initially you would make very little money, and you'll want to live extremely frugally putting as much money into training that as you can, however once you started making substantial profits from investing you would be able to improve exponentially (since you feed profit back into your profit making potential) as you developed a superhuman ability to predict the market and everyone wanted to give you their money to invest since you are the best around.

Once you have a shit-ton of money you can start investing in other skills. Ideally you want to pick skills that require more than specific training in that skill to excel at. So for instance you would level up your performance at IQ tests or other such "skills" that can't be easily trained and are anchored to an underlying and widely useful ability.\\
Anyway since the cost of improvement is set at a level that would be reasonable for a much lower level of wealth, you should quickly be able to quickly reach superhuman levels of intelligence once you really hit the exponential takeoff in your investing/improvement feedback loop.

Also I should mention that given you can get to superhuman levels, this leads to a singularity pretty quick, given the relatively tiny range of normal human intelligence on an absolute scale.
