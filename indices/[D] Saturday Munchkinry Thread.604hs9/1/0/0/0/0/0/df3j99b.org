  Instead of you being smart enough to get a better score, it would be you being good enough at the test to get a better score

With the IQ example I deliberately chose that because it can't make you better at the test /except/ by making you better at the underlying abilities. As I said in my original answer the idea is to pick tasks that are broad such that there's no way to get better at the test but /not/ the underlying ability. Performance at the test needs to be inseparable from the ability it's supposed to measure.

As for the investing example there's likely multiple ways to go about things, but since things are tied to that task, just figure out which types of investing you can benefit most from initially. Once you get past that initial exponential takeoff you're pretty much set.
