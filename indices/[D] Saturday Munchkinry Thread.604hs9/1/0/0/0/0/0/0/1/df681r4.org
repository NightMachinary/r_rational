Except I don't believe that, I haven't been able to find evidence that anyone can just practice IQ tests until they can score near perfectly.\\
There's a few low hanging fruit that anybody can improve, for instance by using memory techniques to score well on those sections. However those memory techniques would actually be quite useful to have and would apply to more than just IQ tests. However once you make enough improvement on some sections you may want to remove them from the test so the ability is forced to improve other areas.

As for using "algorithmic improvements" that seems hopelessly vague (if you wanted to you could call any mental process algorithmic, so you could just be referring to /actual/ general improvements to intelligence, though you're obviously not), begging the question and indistinguishable from saying you improve a "IQ test ability" separate from intelligence. Given that my whole point is that there's no reason to think such an ability should (or does) exist you seem to be assuming your conclusion.

  There are a lot of algorithmic improvements to the ways you can approach those kinds of problems that don't broadly apply to more interesting questions.

How about you give examples if there's so many, saying "I have good reasons" /then not actually saying what they are/ is a pet peeve of mine.
