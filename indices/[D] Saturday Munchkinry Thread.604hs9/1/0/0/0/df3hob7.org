It doesn't really say it needs to be a specific skill, just that it needs to be a mental or physical task. So as long as you're investing you could improve investing as described. Obviously you would probably need to do some research on what kind of investing seems likely to work best with this plan, but the general plan stays the same, and I don't pretend to know enough to really get into the specific logistics.\\
Anyway I'm pretty confident this is the best plan, since no other skill/task can scale to this extent and provide exponential feedback in the same way.
