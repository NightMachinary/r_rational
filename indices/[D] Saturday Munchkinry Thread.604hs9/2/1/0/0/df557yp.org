Don't force hallucinogens down their throats. Open an Advanced Academy for Top University Students, in which the entrance exam is a thinly (or not-so-thinly) disguised test for loyalty (and is accompanied by a thorough background check) - if a few less-loyal patriots slip in, odds are their views will be changed by being surrounded all day every day by flag-wavers.

/Then/, once they've all been living on campus for six months or so, slip the hallucinogens into the drinking water. Without telling anyone.
