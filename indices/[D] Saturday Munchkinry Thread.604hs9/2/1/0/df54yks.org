  You don't just want 'educated'. You want loyal first, and only after that educated. The last thing you want is to train up a superhuman who then actually goes rogue. Or worse, defects to the enemy.

Sure you want loyalty, but that's somewhat more difficult than it seems. Especially considering how much harder it is to control extremely clever and competent people with propaganda. Of course you'll probably be helped quite a lot by just how unsettling people find the soviet union.\\
As for short term vs long term strategies, well that's why i'm positing a entity controlling the government that's no worried about reelection.\\
Still if you're looking short term the best thing I can think of is to try to force as many intellectuals to take hallucinogens as possible as part of their "civil duty" in order to trigger as many eligible people to get powers as possible.
