  Supply them with poison by telling them where you, or other countries, keep the poison, then 'witnessing in horror' as they steal it and use it on the enemy's population.

Even stealing poisons, I just don't think individuals are going to be able to effectively disperse enough toxins to seriously effect the intelligence of the population.

  I see. Well, if >30% of the not-best scientists is being slaughtered, that would still hit the enemy's research and development ability strongly, with nobody desiring to be a scientist if they're not a superhuman already on top of the direct damage. I doubt superhuman bodyguards are going to be much help here: killing a normal would be way easier than protecting them from being killed.

I think going after researchers is still fundamentally beside the point that the vast majority of the people learning this information and thus receiving the increased likelihood of powers (powers are a pretty big motivator for learning something) aren't researchers. Sure you could try to sabotage their developments that way, that's certainly been done in wars before, but it's not going to make the whole country dumber. Plus there's not really enough assassins to seriously do that sort of thing anyway, and i'm not sure how effective that would be as a deterrent unless somebody you knew was killed.\\
As for protecting researchers remember you only have so many superhuman assassins (remember they have to be willing to plausibly appear to be on the run from you on account of acting against your "official" interests, which would mean giving up their life, plus they need a good power set for it) so if the defences are good enough is it really worth sacrificing them to take out a replaceable researcher?

  Still, have superhumans any weaknesses? Poison, drowning, eyeballs? Anything that would be unviable in a straight combat, but could be used in a well-planned assassination?
#+end_quote

Their powers tend to make them pretty good at dealing with poisons, but massive damage is a pretty good killer. However the kinds of weapons that could reliably take out a superhuman before they could get fixed by a healing superhuman are generally of the sort you would have difficulty smuggling near them. Though I imagine you could still do quite well using teleporters (they would be to valuable to actually to the assassination themselves probably) to smuggle in batches of high power sniper rifles.

  Is my line of inquiry ultimately peripheral to your idea? I.e., did you want to talk about a scenario where the governments race to make their populations sane and healthy, with me reducing it to the typical boring conflicts full of atrocities, or are you interested in viewing it from that angle as well?
#+end_quote

Ultimately there's definitely going to be atrocities, but actually seriously affecting the competence of your enemies population is rather more difficult to manage. Plus the pseudoentity actually connected to people's powers is trying to guide things towards a future in which as many people as possible have powers. So you could say the general fact that more people will have powers in the future is pretty much guaranteed since a superintelligence is working towards that goal (though it acts bizarrely and not in the sort of effective way you might expect of something with a clear utility function that self modifies for efficiency).
