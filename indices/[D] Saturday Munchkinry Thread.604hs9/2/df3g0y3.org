You're a superhuman entity that has recently gained control of american politics during the early 1950's. In the last few years superhumans have begun to arise and it's become apparent that intelligence as well as rationality and education level (and to a lesser extent fitness and general health) are heavily connected with the rare people who get powers and large doses of hallucinogens often trigger their emergence (well that and facing certain death). Superpower strength is frequently high enough to make people one man armies that require large amounts of explosives to take down, so they are of incredible military value, given the scope of the powers and the number of superhumans their effects on other elements of society is not large enough to be of importance here.\\
In the last year it's become apparent that both sides are going to use their superhumans to directly attack each other while claiming they were rogue parties for plausible deniability. As thus having more superhumans is of massive importance, and a military superhumans arms race is inevitable.

So with that how do you try to get ahead in the superhuman arms race?\\
Basically this is supposed to be a scenario where there's a military arms race to raise the sanity waterline, because more rationality as well as knowledge of your mind and reality work will make superpowers more likely. Plus there's a similar incentive to make the population more intelligent and to a lesser extent healthier generally, so something like leaded gasoline would be seen as a threat to national security due to it's effects on national, IQ. Oh yeah and I guess you'll want to try to massively increase the prevalence of hallucinogen use.\\
Still saying you need to do these things is one thing, but it's less clear how you would actually manage it.
