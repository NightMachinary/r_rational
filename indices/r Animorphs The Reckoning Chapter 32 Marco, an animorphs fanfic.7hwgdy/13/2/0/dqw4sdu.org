Correct. From an authorial perspective, a major question when tackling this chapter was: do they bring Chee with them, and I have to have the Chee disabled somehow, or do they leave the Chee out so this isn't an issue? Similarly, I knew as of Garrett's last chapter that he couldn't be a part of this crew.

Fortunately, a) was resolved by the fact that the Chee introduced /themselves/ with the implication that Ax + a second Andalite should be able to disable him, and Ax's observations during the Ventura impact that the Chee's total output wasn't /that/ ridiculously high, and the fact that I hope at this point I can wave my hands and say "Look, if V3 has a clear, concrete intention and sufficient advance warning to plan and tinker, he can just ... /do/ it."
