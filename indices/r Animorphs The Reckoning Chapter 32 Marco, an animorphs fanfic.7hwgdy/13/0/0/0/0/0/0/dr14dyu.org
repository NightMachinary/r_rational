I... don't know if this is meant to be understandable from the information we have so far, in a "The plot flows from the rules of the premise" way? So far it seems a bit arbitrary, and Esplin's logic is based on information we don't have (namely, Alloran's understanding of the morphing tech).

Like, even given that morphing is based on a magic supercomputer that Seerow somehow stumbled upon without anyone else realizing it (... which... look, I'm really not a fan of this whole concept). There would be no reason then to assume that morphed characters are more "accessible" to the gods. The super-emulator could be a part of the gods "fair play" engine, which was stated to be more powerful than either of them; it could forbid them to access its internal memory (which begs the question of why exactly the Escafil device can access it in the first place).

Honestly, I mostly preferred that the rules be vague and unexplained. Like, the gods are allowed to do subtle things, be manipulative, but not, like, decide "Fuck it, an asteroid falls on you and you die", which let most of the agency to the protagonist. I guess there's a pressure in a rational fic to explain it, to go "Here is what the gods can do and why", but then I start wondering "Why are these rules in place? Isn't there something else they could have done to exploit these rules" which obviously takes away from the main characters.
