Your argument is that it's expensive to manipulate biology, so it's energetically cheaper to turn the entire human body into a computerized process, manipulate the process computationally, and then convert the new process back into a biological human body, than it would be to manipulate a small portion of the brain directly.

It's hard for me to imagine that it would be so cheap to analyze, deconstruct, and then reconstruct the brain, that you'd save energy on just making the manipulations directly. If you deconstruct and reconstruct the entire brain, you've got to be spending more energy than if you just deconstruct and reconstruct small pieces of the brain.
