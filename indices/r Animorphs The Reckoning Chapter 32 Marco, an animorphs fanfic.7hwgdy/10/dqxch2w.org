The use of Leeran hypersight as a way to ensure both sides of a negotiation are being honest is an interesting (and I presume intentional) resolution of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kavka%27s_toxin_puzzle][Kavka's toxin puzzle]]: a man presents to you a vial of nonlethal poison and offers you a million dollars if, at noon, you /intend/ to drink it the next day. You don't have to actually do it, just /intend/ to. (Similar to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcomb%27s_paradox][Newcomb's paradox]].) One solution has it that the only way to /intend/ to drink the poison, while knowing that you don't have to and can change your mind later, is to /actually follow through with it/ and drink the poison. That seems to be the solution endorsed here. [[#s][]]

Anyway, great chapter and great adaptation of many Animorphs tropes. It's good to see Visser Three acting like the malevolent, horrifying supergenius he ought to be, rather than the bumbling idiot he was in the original series.
