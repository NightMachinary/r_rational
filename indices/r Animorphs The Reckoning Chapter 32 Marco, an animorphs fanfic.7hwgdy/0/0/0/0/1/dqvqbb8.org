Also called it, when that chapter came out, and I believe you confirmed it at the time in a comment somewhere.

I was able to understand all of these revelations when reading the chapter. Although, how did Marco realize that his mind was altered when morph checking David? Was it an inference he made, or did he directly witness it in the Leeran hypersight? Also, it appears that the Leeran hypersight can show the future. That... no, even without that ... Leeran hypersight is too powerful. There's no way that evolved naturally. I bet it's another thing that's implemented with the help of the gods.
