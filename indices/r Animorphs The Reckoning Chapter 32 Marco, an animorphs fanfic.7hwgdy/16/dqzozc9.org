  The creature named David screamed, and the creature named Marco screamed with it, and the creatures named Tobias and Jake screamed also, and the creature named the Visser laughed as he drew them close, drew them close until they lay within his shadow, a shadow that stretched out, limitless, across the cosmos.

V3 has also more or less solved the cloning problem. His clones probably aren't going to be happy with being destroyed, so he has to reincorporate them into himself somehow. The bit I quoted sounds a lot like he can assimilate other intelligences as well.

Of course, I don't see how this would benefit him, and any use of it to keep our heroes alive would be pretty deus ex machinaey....

Edit: Actually, maybe this would accord with his goals. He wants to conquer death, he's already used to dominating a shared mind and experimenting along those lines, /if/ he could do it without risk he'd probably prefer to assimilate rather than kill. Hard to work out what this would actually entail though.

Otherwise why would he choose David as his assassin? He knows the others are more likely to be trusted...Oh wait, is David the only one without earplugs?
