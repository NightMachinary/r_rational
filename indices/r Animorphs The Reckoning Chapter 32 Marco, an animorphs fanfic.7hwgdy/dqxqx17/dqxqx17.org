"To remember what had happened the last time we had encountered the inscrutable, alien god... and all of Ventura had burned."

Yeah, seems like that was just yesterday.

Really great writing, as always. I know these threads tend to focus on the plot and worldbuilding, but I thought that conversation between Marco and David was one of the most compelling passages in the series. Personally, I didn't find the ending confusing, but I guessed after the last Esplin chapter that you meant to merge him and the One into the same character, so I was sort of expecting something like this. (Although I didn't see it coming the way you did it. Damn.)
