The Visser /asserts/ it to be the case that morphing gives the Ellimist the ability to manipulate memories, but he doesn't present adequate reasons for believing it, just a correlation between edited memory and wearing a morph in like 3 cases. I think he jumped to conclusions. If the Ellimist can reach out into Z-space and mess with brains, doing it in 3D-space should be just as trivial. A restriction to Z-space manipulation would make some sense as the result of a bargain between the Ellimist and Crayak, but it's hard to see why such a bargain would have come about, or how anyone could have deduced its existence just on the knowledge available to the Visser.

The inability of the Chee to understand Rachel remains as-yet unexplained. It seems like the Chee must be alive and participating in the hypersight, because "they would know that it was true, for it already was true", but there was no description of the Chee realizing that they couldn't detect Rachel's violence. This implies that their selective blindness is so absolute that they can't even notice it when experiencing mind-independent hypersight. Weird. Argues that the Ellimist indeed does manipulate minds outside of Z-space, I think.
