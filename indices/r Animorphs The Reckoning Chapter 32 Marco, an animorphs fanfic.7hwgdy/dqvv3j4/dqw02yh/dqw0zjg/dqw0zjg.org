I don't see any reason to think it's less energy or knowledge intensive to edit a simulated brain than to morph a physical one into some desired configuration. They seem like essentially equivalent problems, actually, although adding a computer program representing the brain seems like an extra unnecessary step. I don't know what it means for a Z-space brain to not be "simulated".

My suspension of disbelief is not actually undermined, for what it's worth, I'm probably just poking at this because the Animorphs are losing.
