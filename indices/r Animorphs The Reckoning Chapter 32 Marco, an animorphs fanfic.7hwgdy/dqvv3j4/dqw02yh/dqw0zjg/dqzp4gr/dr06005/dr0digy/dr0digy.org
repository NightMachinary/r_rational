No. The argument is, it's expensive to manipulate biology, so if /they're already manipulating biology for you,/ and as a happy side effect, /they're sending a digitized copy of their brain state to run on an emulator stored on your home computer,/ then it's easier to just fiddle with the digital copy they've so happily provided you.

Remember that "expensive" in this case means "requires me to make sacrifices according to the rules," not "takes a lot of computation." The god or gods have got near-unlimited computation; the thing they don't want to do is "interfere" inefficiently.
