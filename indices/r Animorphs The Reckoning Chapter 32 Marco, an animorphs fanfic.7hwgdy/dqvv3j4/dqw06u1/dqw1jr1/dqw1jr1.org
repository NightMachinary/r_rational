It wasn't clear to me whether being unconscious would stop one from being involved in the hypersight. The Chee weren't very active in the revelatory process, to be sure. I think they're at least alive, given that the Visser wants to punish them, although it's possible he expects some different Chee to surrender themselves for punishment in response to threats at dogs. (Does he know that the Chee are a hivemind? Do the Animorphs know?)
