!!!!!! Well.

I, uh

Wow.

Did V3 just wipe out Jake, Marco, and Tobias? No way. Three main characters annihilated? If true, that's a really, really bold move. But I'm skeptical. There must be a reason that Marco's mother is Visser 1. Unless that reason has already been spent?

I mean, there are also morph backups of everyone - you could resurrect them all with some volunteers or with the Visser's tech...

Anyway, this chapter was jaw-dropping. Me, reading the chapter: uh oh, uh oh, this isn't gonna go well, don't do it Marco, don't bring David, oh crap this is gonna go very poorly, uh oh, uh oh, AHHHHHHHHHHHH MY WORST NIGHTMARES ARE HAPPENING.

Kudos. This story is the best.

*Edit:* Found the analogy I was looking for. This chapter is basically the Red Wedding.
