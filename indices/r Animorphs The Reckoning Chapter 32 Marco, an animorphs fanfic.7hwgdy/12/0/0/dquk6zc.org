I'm not sure how they get out of it either. The only thing I can think of was that they were all /in morph/ before that final scene, but at the same time a deus ex machina would have to be done rather well to feel satisfying. Good thing this fic is so damn good at exceeding all expectations. Looking forward to seeing how it turns out.
