I don't think the rest of the Animorphs can be easily assassinated, but there's a large jump between that and "they still have a chance of winning."

They've lost half the core team + Erek (including Jake and Marco's tactical insights), eliminated whatever advantage Serenity could give them, given Visser Three some Chee bodies to reverse engineer (note that Chee tech was one of the few things keeping the heroes a step ahead), and given up all sorts of valuable intel, such as the details of the Tyagi situation, the chats with Telor, and the existence of Ax-Temrash. They've gained nothing but have added a David/Visser into their ranks to steal their secrets/kill them/other horrifying strategies I won't mention in case TK decides to steal them.

Possible bright points of optimism include:

1: David+Visserclone decide to go after Visser Three mk. 1 because no villain likes competition (unlikely but funny).

2: If the remaining Animorphs (read: Rachel) can get the drop on David and imprison him, they have access to all his memories, including any intel he got from Visser Three's part of the hypersight (side note: I understand WHY we didn't get much of this but it was still frustrating that, for example, what Visser Three was actually doing in 'Nam was not part of that information flow).

3: The Animorphs/Visser Three's part in all this is already done and the galaxy, with a little push, will progress towards symbiotic peace regardless of individual actors.
