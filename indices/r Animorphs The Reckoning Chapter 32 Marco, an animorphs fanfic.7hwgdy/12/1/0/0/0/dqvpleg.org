I read rather slowly, and I understood what was going on. I think the text is fine as it is, no major tweaks needed. I like the shifting viewpoints of the Leeran hypersight: Marco is experiencing everyone's perspective all blended together, and I could tell when it shifted to Visser 3 and to others. I thought the scene was really cool.
