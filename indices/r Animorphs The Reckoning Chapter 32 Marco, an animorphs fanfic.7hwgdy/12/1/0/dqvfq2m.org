It helped a little, but my comprehension was still poor. I suspect this was because:

1. The idea was difficult to follow. I get that you're trying to model what it would feel like to have a conversation in Leeran hypersight, but we need to acknowledge that imagining that is difficult.

2. I had a bias against the protagonists losing this badly: I wanted them to win and plot armor in other fiction has conditioned me to expect them to win, and they did not seem to be winning, so I errantly tried to settle on interpretations where they weren't actually losing.

3. The presentation was difficult to follow. I know it's bad writing to put 'Visser Three thought-spoke', 'Marco thought', 'Marco imagined that David had previously thought' etc, at the start of every paragraph, but it would be useful when readers can so easily get lost.

Your and Ketura's comments here were extremely helpful; is there some way you could work in a review paragraph or three at the end of this chaoter to break from the first-person perspective and explain what just happened in plain English? This was OK for me because I have the subreddit to refer to, but someone who stumbles on this fic in 5 years will not have this thread...
