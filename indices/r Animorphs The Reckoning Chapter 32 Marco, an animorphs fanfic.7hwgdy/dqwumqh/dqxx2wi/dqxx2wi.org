Also, here's what I was trying to do, with David:

1) A reasonably full-blown psychopath, but /still a kid,/ so not entirely coldly calculating or confident so much as willing to go to any length.

2) David must have suspected that Marco ... /knew?/ ... that he was a psychopath. So David's been sitting back, his fate basically in this Marco guy's hands, and ... wondering. Why'd he do it? Why'd he cover for me? What's he want? When's he going to demand it?

3) So when Marco starts commiserating about horrible fathers, David thinks he might see the "why" of Marco's coverup, and further suspects that maybe Marco is a little bit "like him," so he opens up a little and is honest, and Marco supports that, so he opens up more.

4) But he still doesn't "owe" Marco anything, because Marco stunned him and let him suffer through the broadcast and is trying to keep him trapped on a planet where he'll DIE, so ... acknowledgement that this guy did some nice things, it was nice that he was understanding about me being a cold-blooded ice machine, but also that's not going to get in the way of doing what it takes to survive.
