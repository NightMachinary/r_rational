Timeline:

- David freaks out after the Andalite meteor threat is identified and is horrified that everyone decides to stay on Earth. He makes an anonymous internet posting offering the morphing cube for sale.

- Visser Three finds the post and offers to double whatever offer he's already received. David turns traitor and tells the Visser about the Animorph's plan to monitor him during one of his regular trips.

- David goes with Marco to the recon and manages to convince him to let David be the one in morph, where he holds a thoughtspeech convo with the Visser, telling him to act harmless and not shoot anything. The Visser acts like he's feeding (and doesn't do whatever it is he was /actually/ traveling there for).

- On the ambush mission, Visser Three wipes the floor with everyone and brings out a Leeran to interrogate his prisoners. Everyone during this period can read one another's thoughts and memories, and can see the entire five-minute timeline of the interrogation from the beginning.

- Visser Three discovers the location of the cube, the apparent Chee treachery, and the Telor/Ax pairing, which he decides is actually a threat to him.

- Marco discovers David's betrayal, that the Andalite meteor was never a problem, and both he and Visser Three connect the dots and realize that Visser One's host is Marco's abducted mother.

- (also, one of the gods apparently made an important conclusion from its time in the Animorph's heads? Either that or the Visser made a conclusion, that part's not super clear.)

- the Visser infests David with one of his almost-but-not-quite-ready clones, and apparently kills Marco, Tobias, and Jake.
