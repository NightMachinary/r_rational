  The stopped time was an illusion
#+end_quote

I thought that was obvious, given that Cassie was teleported right back where she started before the time-stop, back to her Hork-Bajir morph, which implied that this was her "default state", and everything else was an illusion. (I also think the canon time-stops were illusions too, not sure).

I didn't realize before reading this chapter that no-one else had connected the dots, since Cassie died alone and from the others' perspectives (except Tobias), time stopped and then they were immediately teleported elsewhere.
