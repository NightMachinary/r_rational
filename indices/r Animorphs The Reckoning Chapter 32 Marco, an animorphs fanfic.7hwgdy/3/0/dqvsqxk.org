My take is that Marco's mother likely took the place of Loren from canon, which is to say she's the reason that the Yeerks know about earth at all. It's much more smooth that she's abducted by Skrit Na, which what do you know, they somehow end up crossing paths with Yeerks, alerting them to their presence. One infested ship later, they've got navigational data and a /very/ valuable set of memories from an exotic species.

The Yeerk social structure is much different from canon, so I'm curious as to why the human would be used as a host for what is essentially the commander-in-chief of all Yeerkdom. The political power struggles wouldn't be as present, the individual prestige less of a desired thing, and I doubt Visser One spent a decade on earth preparing it as she did in canon. Perhaps it's merely foresight? Making a gamble on stealing seven billion hosts, the Yeerks are likely to inflate their numbers by a few orders of magnitude, so having their head honcho shard extremely familiar with the limitations of a human is important fundamental knowledge.

That said, with how Aftran turned out it might result in an interesting relationship back home. Wouldn't it just be /poetic/ if /both/ of Marco's parents were eventual voluntary hosts, one for personal reasons and one for the greater good, while he himself died fighting it?
