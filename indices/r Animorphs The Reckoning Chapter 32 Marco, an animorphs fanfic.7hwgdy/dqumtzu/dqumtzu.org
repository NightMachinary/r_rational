Hah. I haven't read the originals in at least a decade, but that fly morph scene read exactly like how KAA wrote them. She always nailed getting them just the right amount of delightfully grotesque. That gave me nostalgia harder than anything yet in the fic, which I've generally enjoyed for almost exactly the opposite reasons as the original.

I... don't know what to do with that final scene? I didn't understand what happened at all. I don't know who the evil morph god is? It felt like it was Visser, but that makes zero sense. It seems completely hopeless, but that's just because it felt like that to Marco. Looking forward to the next chapter!
