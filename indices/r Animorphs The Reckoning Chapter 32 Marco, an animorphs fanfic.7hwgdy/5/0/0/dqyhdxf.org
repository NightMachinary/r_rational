Potential food for thought, is David's mind influence-y enough to change the personality of the Esplin clone? Seems like a really easy way to create /two/ unaligned but hostile antagonists.

In canon, certainly, David is a play by Crayak, both to destroy the animorphs and later to corrupt Rachel. Any potential role reversal in Reckoning shouldn't eliminate the fact that he's a (deliberately designed) dangerous piece on the board, and one that both gods would seek to use against the other.

Also to note, I don't think esplin would have a usable dead-man's switch for use against his clones, both for reasons of personality and the fact that his clones would know about it.

Also, quick question that I hope doesn't get answered in any plot-relevant way in canon, what would Reckoning Howlers look like? Just plus speed and range? They seem reasonably optimized already (if not the most practical way to destroy sentient lifeforms).
