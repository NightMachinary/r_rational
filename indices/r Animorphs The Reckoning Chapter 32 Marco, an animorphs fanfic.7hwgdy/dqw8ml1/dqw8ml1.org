You're not shy about killing characters so I highly anticipate the climax of this story, which surely will be bloody and gory regardless of which side wins.

What happens if the clone-yeerk is cut off from the signal connecting it to Visser 3 prime? Is this reasonably possible? (I could refresh my memory of the chapter where this is introduced but am on break from work and don't have time.) If this is possible and we get value drift like with the blob dumped into space, that could be fun.
