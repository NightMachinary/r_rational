Uh, did not expect a new chapter. Yay!

EDIT: Okay, read the whole chapter. Um, wow, there's a lot to unpack. I totally remember the "Visser feeds in a clearing" arc!

What happens towards the end is pretty unclear. I mean, the gist is pretty obvious, but trying to decrypt whose perspective we're getting, what is physically happening, and... well, what all that stuff /means/ is a bit frustrating.
