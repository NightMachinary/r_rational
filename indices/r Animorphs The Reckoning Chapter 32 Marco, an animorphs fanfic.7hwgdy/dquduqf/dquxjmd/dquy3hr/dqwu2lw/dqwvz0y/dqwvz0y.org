It's come up a couple of times. There's a creature called a Leeran that has a local time-bending, experience-opening effect (/actually/ creating the sort of sensation that people on hallucinogenics /imagine/ they're experiencing, where they can see all the connections and understand all the parts of everything).

V3 used a Leeran for a brief instant to find Rachel and the Chee when they were hidden/cloaked in the high school.

V3 used a Leeran (offscreen, but referenced) to establish trust with the Arn, so that they'd /really truly get/ the fact that he would never interfere with them, if they helped him conquer the universe.

V3 used a Leeran to read the minds of Yeerks from Telor before eating them.
