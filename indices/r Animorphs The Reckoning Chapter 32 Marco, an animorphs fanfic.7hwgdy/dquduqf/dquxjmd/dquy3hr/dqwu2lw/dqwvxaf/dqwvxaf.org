Yes, it has. In canon, Leerans were intrusive psychics, which is to say they could read your thoughts, unlike the more passive Andalites who could universally /send/ but not universally read. This was used as a throwaway threat once or twice, since a Leeran-Controller could detect Animorphs easily, and could also tell that they were not Andalite bandits as they so claimed.

An important caveat was that this was simply the way the Leerans communicated, so when the team morphs Leerans, they found themselves unintentionally reading each other's minds, which was a bit stressful considering the amount of emotional baggage that all of them went through great pains to cover up.

In The Reckoning, this effect was turned up to 11 as sort of a field that surrounds each Leeran. All (presumably sapient) creatures within the field can perceive one another utterly, from just about all possible ways it is possible to perceive someone in. Visser Three keeps one or two nearby on hand, presumably drugged or what have you, to be pulled out whenever he's willing to risk the two-way information transfer.

The Visser mentioned using it occasionally to vet people, and he's definitely used it during negotiations with e.g. the Arn, so that all sides can tell that no one is lying. It's the perfect diplomatic tool, so long as you're not /actually/ planning on betraying anyone (or have any huge secrets you'd rather keep) , and it's the reason the Visser is so set on the dog thing; for him to have actually convinced the Chee he would have to /actually/ believed that's what he was going to do.

It came up in the story before Ventura was destroyed; the Visser pulled one out on Rachel since he didn't have time for anything else (IIRC), which let him confirm the Animorphs' existence and also discover the Chee if I'm not mistaken. In return however Rachel got a brief glimpse into /his/ mind.

It's important to note that the temporal perception is just that, a matter of perception. In this chapter, at least seven people were all in the field at once, but all of them perceived one another utterly, as if they were that person. Thus, since so many of them were mostly rational, analytical actors, they were able to intuit what was going to happen, but even if only one of them figured it out (Alloran), the others would soon get an echo of it and see it themselves.

Actually, how many /were/ there? You can fit a lot of Visser Three clones in a small area, and all (save one) of them being convinced something was true would have a huge impact on the hypersight, not to mention giving him lopsided control over what information was transferred.
