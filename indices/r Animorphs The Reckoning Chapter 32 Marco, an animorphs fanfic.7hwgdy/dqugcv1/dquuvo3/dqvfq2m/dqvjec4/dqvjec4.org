I may tinker, but I'm going to steer clear of sacrificing the integrity of the text. My hope is that the reader-five-years-from-now, who has a complete story to work with, will have momentum from the previous chapters and will get the answers they need from the stuff 4-8 chapters down the road (which for you guys might be a few months away, hence my willingness to clarify out-of-text).

Nothing that happened here will never be referenced again, i.e. it's all going to come up again less ambiguously in later plot references. Also as mentioned last update we're nearing the end, probably fewer than fifteen chapters to go.
