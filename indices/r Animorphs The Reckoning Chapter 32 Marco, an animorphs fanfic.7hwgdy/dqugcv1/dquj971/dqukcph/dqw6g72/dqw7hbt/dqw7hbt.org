  3: The Animorphs/Visser Three's part in all this is already done and the galaxy, with a little push, will progress towards symbiotic peace regardless of individual actors.

I mean, realistically, this would be the case ever since Tobias got the USA president involved and shot down the bug fighter in Washington DC.

Like, the Animorphs make a big deal of going themselves to attack Visser 3, and I kind of get why they do in character (because they see themselves as the protagonists, and there's a prophecy, etc)... but looking at it logically, they weren't that well equipped for the mission compared to either Telor or the combined might of the United States military.

And looking at it another level deeper... well, Telor knows Visser 3's whereabouts, they have a lot of weapons and very good reason to kill him. The fact that they haven't killed him yet means there is some sort of obstacle that the Animorphs weren't aware of. So either the mission was doomed to fail, or it would have succeeded and Esplin's deadman switches would have killed everyone in the mothership and on the planet in horrible horrible plagues.
