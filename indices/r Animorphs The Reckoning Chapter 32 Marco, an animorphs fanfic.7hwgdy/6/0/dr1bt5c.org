One thing I kept noticing in this chapter is that Marco and the others are becoming a bit defeatist. They keep taking decisions that they know are suboptimal and rationalize them as "If X was going to go bad, we'd be screwed anyway anyway".

- Ax says you can't avoid playing into the Ellimist's hands.

- They trust the Chee because the Chee are really powerful and would be extremely hard to stop.

- Elfangor says "You can't guess the Ellimist's thoughts, and you shouldn't try".

- Marco decides that he was right not to bring a gun because he doesn't know how to use a gun / Esplin might have detected it.

It's pretty close to Tobias' "never in control" arc, where he went through the same "Just because I think it's hopeless doesn't mean I shouldn't do anything" questions, while also trying to let go when necessary and just let things play out. I think there's a remark in that chapter where he says they shouldn't just argue themselves into not doing anything.

On the other hand, I feel like they're fundamentally going at this the wrong way. Their reasoning is "There's no point in trying X, X wouldn't work because of Y anyway", but they don't really go the whole way and say "Therefore Y is a huge problem and we should wonder about how to fix it." They don't wonder about how to deal with the Ellimist's manipulations, Marco doesn't consider going to a gun range, they don't explore "Maybe we could hold a lot of dogs hostage?" solutions, etc. (I'm guessing they don't, because it seems pretty unlikely that they'd consider it all offscreen without at least some of it being mentioned)

This isn't a criticism of the story, mind you. This is definitely a real bias (premature tree-pruning? helplessness bias?) that I've seen myself and over people have, and it's pretty insidious.

--------------

I think the biggest mistake the protagonists make is that they act too much like protagonists. Marco's first thought when they learn Esplin's location is "shit, the military will know too"; they send David on missions instead of nameless soldiers; Marco complains about handing Th√†n over to the government; they blow up Serenity; Tyagi decides not to send a recon mission to Vietnam, and the kids go anyway; etc.

Marco especially is doing the thing Jake complained about earlier, where he automatically assumes that if he's not the one to do the thing, someone else will screw it up.

I was especially surprised when they decided to attack Esplin by themselves. This is definitely something that should have been done through an airstrike, not in person. Yeah, ok, Esplin's ship probably has sufficiently advanced detectors, but they know that Elfangor's ship was able to scramble those detectors, and they could have sent a warhead inside an invisible Bug Fighter. Or something else; they should definitely have brainstormed tactics in that category with the military before going on a mission on their own.

(again, I'm not criticizing the story; the characters make mistakes, and part of the enjoyment is seeing them go "We've looked at this the wrong way, we need to do things this way instead")

--------------

All that being said, I did feel that the chapter was pretty unsatisfying overall :(

Obviously, it's pretty hard to have a chapter where the protagonists lose and not be disappointed. I think part of that is that the defeat feels a bit "unearned". All the individual elements (David's betrayal, the Chee, the demorph ray) were foreshadowed, but on the other hand... it feels like the Animorphs acted a little bit dumber than average and they wouldn't have been caught otherwise? Which is kind of a big no-no for killing off several protagonists.

I dunno. Jake's first death and Cassie's death felt earned, in a way. Not just because they were being reckless, but because it made sense that they were being reckless. Jake because he had this "I don't care about danger, I'm a hero" attitude, Cassie because she wanted to do good. On the other hand, in this chapter, it feels like most of their problems would have been avoided if they'd just said "You know what, David is more trouble than he's worth. Let's just turn him over and recruit someone else".

The other thing that doesn't help is... I feel like we don't have enough info to know what the characters "should" have done. It's like, in a RPG, you don't want your party to fail because a scenario was winnable, you want them to fail because you didn't see the secret exit or something. So far we don't really get that; there's no "If only we'd done X instead" (okay, Marco kind of has a moment like that when he almost bails at the last moment).

Part of that is that both we and the characters are missing some crucial information, that they aren't really trying to collect. What are Telor's intentions? What is the US doing / planning to do? What do the Chee want? The protagonists are kind of cutting themselves off from anyone else and going in blind, which means we don't really know what was the "right" thing to do; except that's not really a dramatic error, because we don't see them turn down an occasion to learn more about what's happening, or have a dramatic "If only we'd taken more time to talk things out with our allies" monologue.

So, there you have it. Not a bad chapter, very long and exciting, there's no specific bad scene, but what happens is kind of disappointing.
