What the hell. Super long review time!

- Marco is being a bit of a jerk to Tobias here. It's because he's jealous that Tobias gets to do more protagonist stuff than him.

- The Animorphs are playing this game of "have a secret telepathic conversation while pretending to do nothing" which strikes me as a little silly. I mean, it's not like everyone else doesn't already know that they're colluding and making plans, and they're all mostly allies, so these "pretend you're asleep" games seem a bit pointless.

- "David continued playing cute in front of not-Tyagi" Yeah, I can imagine the dialogue. Tyagi: "..." David: "..." Tyagi: "So... did you have fun murdering your father?"

- I'm really curious what Esplin could be doing going around the planet. Seeding pandemics seemed to be the obvious answer, but Esplin wouldn't need to stay for hours to do that; I didn't consider he could be feeding, but I like the idea (except it turned out to be fake)

- How precise is the positional data on the Marauder's map, and how easy is it to see? Because if it's precise down to a few meters, wouldn't Rachel have been able to see that Esplin stayed in his ship on all trips except the decoy trip? Unless he does usually get out of his ship for some other reason.

- Marco considers the possibility of creating an incident to distract the military from attacking Esplin... would that even work? I mean, these guys have a lot of officers. The president doesn't need to do everything herself, they can delegate and multitask.

- "I believe Mars is approximately two hundred million of your miles" THEY'RE EVERYONE'S KILOME... oh, wait, never mind. Carry on.

- Garett knows that it can be really hard for the reader to guess who's talking if we don't get their names. Thank you, Garett. No, seriously, I loved his outburst. That's so /him/.

- I think Marco is starting to break down a bit. Like, he doesn't have enough information, everything's getting more complicated, so he's trying to find patterns and meaning everywhere. The bit about how things are moving fast "THEREFORE IT'S PROBABLY GOD" sounds a little... over-reaching? On the other hand, he's right that they're acting way too fast and not taking their time nearly enough. Also, I think he's starting to automatically distrust Tobias and Rachel, or to expect the worst from them.

- Didn't Ax report Elfangor as dead? The Andalite high command is going to get crazy over that recording.

- "Oh, by the way, I given the natives the nuke codes and the coordinates of our homeworld. You're welcome!"

- Quick question: do most Andalite soldiers even know their world's coordinates? I mean, if you gave /me/ a chart of the Milky Way, I'd have a hard time pinpointing where we are. Space is huge. If the Andalites were worried about planetary annihilation, the strongest defense is not letting anyone know where their planet is (which I think was a recurrent plot in Stargate). That would probably require setting up one or more outposts, which would be the only offworld structures with the homeworld's coordinates; ships would be unable to get back to the homeworld without getting to the outpost first. That way, nobody can get them by decrypting a ship's navigation log, or interrogating an officer.

- Ax mentions that the "Do we blow the Earth up?" question is being debated by the Andalite government or something. They're treating it as a "don't count on it" thing... but, even this the debate process takes time, there's no way the Andalites will go ahead with their threat now, right? Elfangor claimed that humans had the means to retaliate if the Earth blew up. Even if the Andalites decide it's probably a hoax, they obviously can't take the chance it isn't. There's no way they'd blow up the Earth without at least asking Tyagi for tangible proof they can't shoot back, political rut or not.

- I like the hypocrisy of Elfangor going "We must not be cowards and kill so many people to protect our own hides" after he totally tried to do that.

- Andalite memory-copying is OP. Please nerf.

- Wait, Elfangor believes in trickle-down warfare? I can't take him seriously anymore.

- Okay, wait a sec, they're sending clone!Tyagi in the Yeerk pool? That's... "Ahah, you tried to kidnap me to your giant spaceship, but I'm going into your giant spaceship myself instead! Bet you didn't see that coming!" But seriously, what the hell? Why are they suddenly giving all of Tyagi's intelligence to Telor, free of charge? This one doesn't have earplugs or anything, right?

- I feel like Marco and David are bad influences on each other. Not sure what gave me this feeling; might be something about what they said about how it was /totally okay to murder David's father/.

- We get more details on the relationship between Marco and his dad. It's cool; it's a natural extension on what we're told in canon, but with more attention drawn to it.

- Should they really be taking David on any important missions? Extenuating circumstances or not, he's 10-yo, he has no combat experience, and he's killed his father. I mean, inevitable betrayal aside, I feel like they should be sending him to a therapist, not in a war zone. It's not like they're short on minions, given that they have the Chee, the US military, and all the people they gave powers to to recruit from.

- Wait, Esplin is still hairless? I thought he'd let his fur grow since his first interlude. (he mentioned looking at his blue fur or something?)

- The whole scene with Marco hearing about Esplin running around in the forest, being terrified, waiting for the other shoe to drop was really tense and overall really cool.

- Jake mentions that the Chee won't work with the military. That's interesting, and way under-explored. First off, Tyagi hasn't mentioned the Chee yet, but she knows about them. That's pretty huge. "Ancient super-powerful have been living with us for millenia" is overall weirder and scarier than the alien invasion. There's probably a whole intelligence branch that dedicated specifically to figuring out /anything/ about them. So... did the government contact the Chee? They've definitely tried, at least. Did the Chee refuse to have any contact with them? If they did communicate, how did the negotiations even go?

- The Animorphs mention several time blowing up Serenity, and eventually go through with it. That seems to me like a horribly, horribly bad idea. Serenity was the one big advantage the USA had on the Yeerks. They justify it because they're afraid the yeerks will get their hands on it, but I don't see it happening. They'd had to have infiltrated the military pretty deeply to pull that off, at which point blowing up Serenity is lees important than starting a witchhunt and securing the President. That's leaving aside the fact that the military is probably working pretty hard right now to find and capture any potential spy. Given all that, I don't see any point in destroying Serenity (more on that later)

- I'm not sure what was the plan for subduing Esplin. Letting Jake stand there in the open, so that the Chee attack Esplin when he tries to capture him? That seems way too obvious to work.

- This scene was also super tense and super scary, by the way. You really get the sense that the kids are in over their heads way, way more than they've ever been.

- I like how Marco mentions "getting eaten by a fox" as a possible way the mission could go south. In canon, there were a few scenes where the kids were in the middle on the mission and then a natural predator (a spider when they were flies, a bird of prey, etc) just came and try to eat them out of nowhere. Being an animal's not so fun now, is it?

- "Muahahahahahah! Feel the might of my obscure-but-definitely-canon-(look-the-ghostwriter-period-was-weird-okay?) magic demorphing ray! /Next chapter: Rachel figures out how to make clones of herself by morphing into a starfish./

- I think everyone has already said all there is to say on the hypersight scene. It's trippy.

- I'm a bit confused: Esplin seems to be saying that he had a deal with the Chee, but they betrayed him somehow? It's not super clear.

- I wonder if Marco will survive this situation somehow? One possibility would be "it was only just a simulation" (Esplin kind of plays with the idea at the end, "if only you'd done things differently"), but it would obviously be very cheap. I say that because there's not much point in having Visser 1 be Marco's mom if Marco's not there to angst about it.

- On the other hand, if they're all really dead, it means all their protagonist-ness is now concentrated in Rachel, Garett and Ax! So they're basically invincible!

- And now we're pulling the trigger on Garett's Chekov's not-giving-the-cube-to-the-fundamentally-unreliable-robots.
