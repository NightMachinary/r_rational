Shoot, my default reaction is to start nitpicking, I need to remember that /you/ don't know just how much I'm enjoying this. Literally getting chills and occasionally muttering obscenities at my computer screen, etc. Very much enjoying, but find it hard to engage in any useful high level criticism, so I quibble with details.

Without detracting from how much I'm loving this, I guess editors are actually domain experts and do have value. There are a lot of times that I've been confused, and had to reread and really think about something, if not go to the comments on the Reddit thread, and I have a memory of reading some professional author talk about how you had to have half a dozen reminders that your character had a sprained ankle before you were allowed to make it plot-relevant, cuz if you mentioned it once the reader would forget 100 pages later.

Of course, not everything is meant to be easy to read, and I suspect I'll get a hell of a lot out of rereading this in one go once you finish it.
