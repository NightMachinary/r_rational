  My guess is: nope, we did lose a few protagonists there.

I just noticed that all of the chosen Animorphs are (apparently) dead. Jake, Marco, Cassie, and Tobias were the four in the original time-stopping intervention. Leaving Rachel, Ax, and Garrett, who were not "chosen ones." So the question is, was this moment the purpose of the Animorphs all along? Or was it a maneuver by the other god?

If God1 saved the Animorphs at the Yeerk pool, then I'm assuming that God2 caused David to join the Animorphs in response for the purpose of the betrayal.

Prediction: In the next chapter, God1 will do a time-stopping intervention with Rachel and give her a chance to save the Animorphs or defeat Visser 3 or something. In canon, Crayak gave Rachel superpowers and pitted her against David, so there's precedent.
