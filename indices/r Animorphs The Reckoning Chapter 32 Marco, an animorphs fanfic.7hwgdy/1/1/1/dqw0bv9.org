My guess is: nope, we did lose a few protagonists there.

Otherwise, what ketura said. It's made more confusing by the fact that the characters see events before they happen (or, well, their perception of time and memory gets screwed with enough that they feel like they're seeing the future). So even though David doesn't get infested until the end of the scene, it's narrated several times throughout the scene.
