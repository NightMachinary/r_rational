He wants to learn everything, not spend all his time learning specifically about fighting - he's apparently supernaturally good at learning, for an orc, but only learning. I'd assume Maim or Smash or whatever would give you massively enhanced physical abilities on top of being just naturally good at fighting, while Learn has to, well, learn it, and while he likes fighting he wants to learn other things too, doubly so since however good he gets at fighting he will presumably never compete with a 'real' orcish Command.
