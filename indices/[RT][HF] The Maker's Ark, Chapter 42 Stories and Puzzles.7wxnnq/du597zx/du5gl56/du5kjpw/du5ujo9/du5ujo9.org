The software is still in alpha, there are still a few bugs in the system, and she has no 'secure erase' function 8-). More seriously, anything drastic risks causing the most powerful being in the world to decide that a malevolent biogestalt just murdered her best friend.

A couple of notes for your reread, in no particular order:

Try rereading Golden Valkyrie's first appearance in Fall from the viewpoint that everything she says and does is aimed at or intended to cover for Stella.

Pay attention to the first thing GV says to Stella in chapter 27 of Call, and her reply.

The only scenes of Maker's Ark that include Stella and are /from her viewpoint/ should be in chapters 9 and 10. I didn't have all the biogestalt details and terminology worked out yet then, so I would probably write the first couple of paragraphs of her first scene in chapter 9 a little differently now, but the rest is still spot on and very relevant.
