Think I finally see the problem: You seem to be evaluating Doc's actions from a deontological perspective--but Doc (and all the other major characters) are consequentialists. They aren't arguing about whether he had good intent--he's trying to figure out where he went wrong evaluating the consequences (and the obstacles to to getting those right). In Doc and Stella's view, if you have a lot of power or can do extraordinary things, the only safe way to judge your actions is by consequences--it doesn't matter if you had good intent. That's why she says "You don't know me well enough"--he screwed up in evaluating the personal consequences for her. If it looks like a reasonable mistake--well it better be; he's the smartest man in the world and an experienced superhero. He doesn't make mistakes without a reason.

EDIT: See her reasons (based on consequences) for agreeing in the 2nd scene of chapter 9 of Maker's Ark [[http://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/128307010576/the-makers-ark-chapter-9][here]].
