I'm very glad to see this again, but this particular chapter wasn't to my taste. Pure infodump exposition without any actual plot advancement, and I just want to slap Stella. If I were Doc I would have said something to the effect of, "Seriously? You're bitching at me for bringing you back to life? Look, all the information I had at the time said it was the right thing to do and you hadn't told me not to. As to this 'I did not give positive assent' nonsense: standard medical practice is that patients are resuscitated unless they have taken a positive action to file a DNR. If you wanted to not be brought back, it was your job to tell me, not my job to read your mind. Plus, bringing you back means that you have the choice -- if you wanted to be alive then great, you're alive. If you wanted to be dead, go get dead. We're done here."
