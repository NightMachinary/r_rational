I had forgotten that scene and was working off only what was in this chapter. Still, after going back and re-reading the full thing, here's what I see:

- Yiskah had no firm opinion either way on whether Stella would want to come back in her original body.
- Doc had legitimate reason to think that it would be dangerous to /not/ bring Stella's original body back.
- Despite that, he asked permission before going ahead and doing it.
- Starship Stella at first said she didn't want the old body brought back, but was then convinced by Doc's arguments and okayed the procedure.

I'd say Doc handled that just about perfectly and Stella needs to get over it. Doc didn't do it out of sentimentality, he did it because he saw that not bringing her back posed a legitimate risk to Stella-the-starship-fleet and (implicitly, because unfettered strong AI with no connection to the human race is dangerous) to the human race.

Seriously, Stella...if you're a transhumanist who is completely convinced that you're alive in the starships and your human body is irrelevant and unwanted, why are you wasting time on complaining when you could be killing this body? The fact that you're sitting here getting snippy with Doc says that you-this-human-body actually /do/ want to live and therefore he did the right thing. You can't have it both ways.
