Interesting. Stella's view is that she /was/ alive, and doing just fine after a successful body swap, until Doc decided to insist on reanimating her old brain, giving it a new body, and treating it as the real her. The crux of the problem is that Stella is a transhumanist and Flicker isn't. From Skybreaker's Call, Chapter 34:

" "You!" she said to the screen, interrupting Doc. "Three. You aren't Stella. You're a copy that doesn't want to give up being in charge. Margie, don't listen to Three, Stella would want to come back." "You're certain of that, are you?" ... "I had a certain fondness for that body, but it's done, and I don't need it anymore. No extraordinary measures are required.""
