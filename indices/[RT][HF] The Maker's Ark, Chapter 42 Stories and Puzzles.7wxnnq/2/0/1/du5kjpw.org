If this is Stella's problem I'm curious why she hasn't re-integrated and taken some offload path a-la what you would see in a Serbernost (body is effectively a page file subversion of the prime aspect) or the "Yoink" approach of Bank's Trancended m(M)inds. I'm going to have to re-read a lot (all) of the Stella chapters and go look through some ideas on the topic. Thanks for such a question raising chapter.
