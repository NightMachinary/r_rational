The xenopsychology here seems pretty iff, since humans propensity for attachment outside their species is a trait neither unique to primates nor even to a specific phylogenetic lineage. From looking at earth life it seems much more plausible that humans (and other animals) have imprecise social instincts, because evolution in general only cares about what's good enough. This is evident in examples like jewel beetles trying to mate with beer bottles that satisfy the lazy checklist of features they were given by evolution to identify females. Ultimately it would be weird for an intelligent social species to evolve social instincts complex enough to avoid the human flaws described, without that providing a tangible advantage in the ancestral environment. For instance a social instinct which deliberately excludes other species from empathy doesn't make any sense unless you coevolved with other intelligent species.

This scenario also necessarily inherits the logical problems common in space opera fiction.

In order for humans to fill this sort of role in a galactic community, you need a number of civilizations to arise at around the same time (to have remotely equivalent tech levels) and somehow lack any sufficiently advanced AI or genetic engineering/cybernetics.
