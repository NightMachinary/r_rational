The idea is that these aliens bred and trained humans specifically for whatever purpose they had in mind. That's why "black market genetic material". So they basically get treated like the yellow minions in that cartoon.

  Not too sure about hardyness
#+end_quote

Humans are ridiculously hardy(resilient, robust). Humans eat a huge variety of different foods, can survive (if not thrive)on a monodiet of many of those foods, and can subsist on 0 calories for weeks. Most of the Incas, for example, lived on a diet of around than 1200 calories a day. Also we are present in every single land biome in the world.
