Humans, the dogs of the galaxy

#+begin_quote
  No expert could have predicted that the most notable aspect of human psychology to aliens would have been the convergence of the ability to form parasocial relationships and the propensity for pareidolia and anthropomorphization. Combined, this imparted humans the ability to form genuine bonds of loyalty, affection, and even love with beings outside their species (and even objects!), and was unheard of before the introduction of humanity to the larger galactic community.

  Despite other sapient species being better able to restrict their base impulses and cooperate fruitfully for mutual self-interest, humanity's innate capacity for indiscriminate empathy has given them a reputation for gregariousness that far outmatches reality. Initially, at least.

  Combined with their astounding hardiness and adaptability, relatively fast reproduction and low metabolic footprint it was almost inevitable that after a thriving black market trade in human genetic material that humanity would go on to become the underclass of the galaxy, general purpose servants and foot-soldiers for a myriad of alien races throughout the galaxy.
