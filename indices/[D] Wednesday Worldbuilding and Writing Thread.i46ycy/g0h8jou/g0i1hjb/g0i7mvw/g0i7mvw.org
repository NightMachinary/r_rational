Valid critiques, but ones which can be easily explained in a hypothetical narrative. Maybe in this story that's a feature unique to "lesser" lifeforms. Maybe the central archetype of intelligence(in story) is that it's selected for to model social behaviour of fellows and always results in increasingly complex social behaviour and culture, which makes it nigh impossible for social instincts to be grafted onto other species.

Humans are the exception. Thus enter: minionhood.

As to your other point, yes it requires either suspension of disbelief or a soft sci-fi story. The initial idea was for it to be fantasy races anyway, so maybe that's better.
