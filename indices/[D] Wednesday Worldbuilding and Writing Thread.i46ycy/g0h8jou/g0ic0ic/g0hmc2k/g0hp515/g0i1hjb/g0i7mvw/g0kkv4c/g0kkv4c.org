  Valid critiques, but ones which can be easily explained in a hypothetical narrative. Maybe in this story that's a feature unique to "lesser" lifeforms.

Explanations that aren't incredibly contrived which can apply to a whole galactic community are a lot harder to come up with here. Particularly considering that having say advanced genetic engineering sufficient to add major new social instincts would almost inevitably render "baseline" life redundant.

The only real plausible explanation I can see (without invoking tech which couldn't allow this scenario) for /most/ intelligent species lacking these "human" traits described is it to be the norm for intelligent species to evolve alongside other intelligent species (thus providing an advantage for such selectivity).\\
Even this explanation is still pretty iffy though, since even in the aforementioned scenario it's not clear there would actually be an advantage to more selective social instincts than what humans have. After all humans crude in-group tribalism should work fine with other intelligent life around, since tribes generally consist of related individuals anyway (from genetic evidence we know most humans reproduced with their cousins within the tribe).

  As to your other point, yes it requires either suspension of disbelief or a soft sci-fi story. The initial idea was for it to be fantasy races anyway, so maybe that's better.

Fantasy races works a lot better, especially since intelligent design allows for more creative flexibility. People rarely fully appreciate the staggering scale in terms of time, space, and population that one needs to grapple with in describing any plausible interstellar community.
