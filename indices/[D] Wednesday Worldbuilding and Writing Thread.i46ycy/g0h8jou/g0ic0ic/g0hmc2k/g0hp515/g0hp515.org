I can see humans bonding with aliens (we are freaks) but find it a bit hard to believe that we'd allow ourselves to serve others so much. Could be justified by a long period of servitude. Real cool that we'd spread out that much.

A year to make a kid being fast says something about the species of the Galaxy. Maybe only being able to reproduce N amount of times or it taking N amount of years or N factors having to be fulfilled. Or maybe we've changed to have a shorter gestation period.

Not too sure about hardyness, I'd expect reptile or insect like aliens to be tougher. Because scales and chitin. I can see adaptability yeah.

Kinda weirded out about aliens wanting human dna unless it's for cloning. Though why black market??? Are all the humans clones now? What I mean is why does black market trade of human dna lead to servants and foot soldiers.
