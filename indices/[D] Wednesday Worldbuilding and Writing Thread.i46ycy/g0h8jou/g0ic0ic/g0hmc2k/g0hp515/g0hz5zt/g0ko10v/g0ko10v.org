  Humans are ridiculously hardy(resilient, robust). Humans eat a huge variety of different foods, can survive (if not thrive)on a monodiet of many of those foods, and can subsist on 0 calories for weeks. Most of the Incas, for example, lived on a diet of around than 1200 calories a day. Also we are present in every single land biome in the world.

I should point out that human don't stack up remotely well on the metrics you describe compared to most animals. For instance primates lost the ability to produce vitamin C, and humans evolved smaller digestive tracks and weak jaws due to cooking. Compared even just to our own distant ratlike ancestors humans have a much more restricted diet. Also human caloric requirements are pretty demanding by animal standards: Compared to many non endotherms which regularly go months without food, humans don't stack up well. After all humans are placental mammals, which have the highest body temperatures and metabolic rates aside from flying animals. Hell even among placental mammals humans have a high metabolic rate by virtue of evolving as pursuit hunters who cook our food.

PS: I don't know why more HFY stuff doesn't try to focus on the traits humans have which actually stand out among other animals. Mainly that humans sweating allow us to beat almost any animal in endurance in a hot environment.
