As a sci-fi premise I love it.

As hard sci-fi, it's a bit difficult. Like, we associate the shape :) with a smiley face, hence pareidolia, but alien faces wouldn't look like that. Very few people find spiders cute, for example, and if you google "[[https://miro.medium.com/max/2048/1*ojnyA7GmLlgN_LsW1F4owg.jpeg][cute spiders]]" they have the :) sort of face shape that makes our mirror neurons (or whatever) sing. I mean, look at what I assume is a more typical [[https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/otv-XWGkzFKdXHpVQK1CaVxjW2k=/396x0/http%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2FNetwork%2FImages%2F2018%2F08%2F22%2F15%2F47%2Ftrapdoor-1.jpg][spider face]] - I don't have an easy time having empathy for it. And aliens would be /more/ different.

But if you live in a world of rubber forehead aliens, or anything that is vaguely humanoid (the :) shaped face meeting that definition for me), and that's your "gimme" (reasonable enough in hard sci-fi IMO), then I think it's really cool and neat. I'd love to see humanity in more varied roles than just "soldiers", since that's pretty predictable: diplomats and the like.
