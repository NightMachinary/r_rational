I had an entire review written out for this yesterday and somehow it didn't post :-( But the thrust of it mirrored yours. To summarize:

I enjoyed: The slowburning background horror vibe that is really creepy, the creative world building, the descriptions of non-Euclidean physics, the unreliable narrator making me second-guess what is actually happening.

I had mixed feelings about: The characters seem to be trying to figure out how and why the dungeon works as it does, but this hasn't paid off yet. There are some enjoyably shocking plot twists, but they aren't as satisfying due to lack of foreshadowing or buildup (I keep comparing the situation with Sarah to APGTE's demon of Absence and how the latter was handled so much better than the former). And like you remarked, many times something is pointed out as odd, and then dismissed. Sometimes this is plot-relevant, like James taking phone calls but never mentioning from whom or about what, but most times it just seemingly is dropped for no reason. The characters start as "The Everyman and his Indian roommate," but have slowly become more fleshed out and may eventually be a strong point.

I didn't enjoy: The action scenes don't do much for me either. The pacing is really off throughout the whole story; a hint or oddity is teased and then the scene changes and there's no followup. The delves themselves are different each time, but follow a nigh-identical repetition: prep for the delve, enter deungeon, discuss plan, embark, encounter new monster/trap/oddity, get into a fight, overcome but take some injuries that scuttle the original plan, return to entrance, divide up loot. It gets stale after awhile.

I feel overall like the story has some good ideas and an interesting vibe, but the author's writing is a bit weak. That said, it does seem to be improving as it goes, so I'll be catching up with updates as they come out too.
