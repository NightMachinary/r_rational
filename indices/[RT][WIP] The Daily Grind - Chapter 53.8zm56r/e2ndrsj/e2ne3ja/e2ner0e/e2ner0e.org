Micro review:

I think the author does make some effort to think about things, but people forget about their defined powers one too many times, and much of the prose is taken up with action scenes that don't (per my tastes) demonstrate terribly much in the way of tactics or thought.

There are also a few too many times where people say "well what about this thing, this doesn't make sense" and it's just ... pointed out as not making sense and then dropped? It's a work-in-progress, which means that answers might be coming, but it's still kind of frustrating, and feels like I'm just being told that yes, that thing I noticed doesn't make sense, but the characters also noticed that, so I shouldn't worry about it.

I'm going to keep reading it, partly to see what happens, and partly because there's a consistent creativity to it that I enjoy, even if that creativity sometimes comes at the expense of coherence.
