On a DnD munchkinry kick after reading some glowfic set Pathfinder, so have a DnD releated optimization problems...

You are a God of Magic and Travel that has just had one of your Clerics reach Earth after an accident with an interacting Teleport and Plane Shift. You are now looking to expand into Earth. You can give out spells from the [[https://www.d20srd.org/srd/spellLists/clericSpells.htm][Cleric list]] and from the [[https://www.d20srd.org/srd/spellLists/clericDomains.htm#magicDomain][Magic]] and [[https://www.d20srd.org/srd/spellLists/clericDomains.htm#travelDomain][Travel]] Domains... (3.5e). Your Cleric also knows and has a spell book for [[https://www.d20srd.org/srd/spellLists/sorcererWizardSpells.htm#zeroLevelSorcererWizardSpells][Level 0 Wizard Spells]] and could manage to teach them to someone with around 1-3 months dedicated (several hours a day) teaching, but has no idea how to even start on level 1. Unlike the DnDd rules, you have a bit of flexibility, you can give a spell to Cleric that they didn't request based on what you want them to use and/or what you expect them to need. You can give Cleric spells outside your domains as if the spell was around two levels higher. Unfortunately you also have a bunch of constraints...

- by preexisting God-agreements you can only have one Level 1-4 Cleric (with Level 0and Level 1 Spells) per 30 worshipers, one Level 5-8 Cleric (Level 0-4 Spells) per 90 worshipers, one Level 9-14 Cleric (Level 0-7 Spells) per 300 worshipers, and one Level 15 or greater Cleric (Level 0-9 Spells) per 900 worshipers. You can give occasional level 0 and level 1 spells to lay-worshipers, maybe around 1 spell per week to each worshiper. You can communicate a short sentence once each day to a worshiper when they pray.
- This Earth God YHWH also has some hard rules that you can't risk breaking: No spells to interfere with "Free Will". You have to allow prayer by members of Abrahamic faiths with no outstanding unrepresented sin to counteract your followers spells. And you can't interfere in the exceptionally rare event YHWH actually intervenes to perform a miracle (he is apparently really stingy with them, only 1-2 genuine minor miracles each year in the entire world and always away from cameras or recording devices).\\
- Your Clerics must have an urge to Travel and explore magic. Also if they get too tied down to one place (by buying a permanent home for example) and/or stop visiting new places your ability to give them spells fades away. To put some hard numbers on it, going a week or two without seeing an new interesting location/land mark starts causing issues. Going a month causes spells to almost entirely fade away. Living in one location for 6 months starts causing issues but can be compensated with lots of temporary day trips for up to 3 years.
- Finally, things in the world that disrupt travel cause you pain and make it difficult to give spells to Cleric related to them by location. Notably, the restrictions on every national border cause you some issues and most prison systems providing no alternatives to long-term imprisonment (such as exile, beatings, or death). This can come up several ways... For example a Cleric with a sibling who works for ICE would be too painful to grant spells to if they have any kind of contact with that sibling. A cousin in ICE who the Cleric never speaks to would be just barely manageable.

So with these constraints, how do you go about spreading worship in your faith and your ideals of travel and magic?
