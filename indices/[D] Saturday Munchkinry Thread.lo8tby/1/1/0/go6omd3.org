Online avenues was my first thought. Like does the travel and discovery stuff get eased at all by virtual sightseeing tours, videoblogs of others travels, or whatever VR can cook up these days? Also just having the cleric do their best to spread the word while someone else drives their bus/caravan around the country/s would also help, unless the deity's requirements specifically require a certain type of personal agency in travel decisions.

Oh also, geoguessr is a thing, does that count for something?

Edit: also, how does the form and speed of travel count? How does a charity walk stack up to a cannonball run? And how does stuff along a vertical axis work? Scuba-diving and those zero-g flight things? Hot-air balloons? Does travel while asleep/unconscious/stuffed in a van with a sack on your head count differently?
