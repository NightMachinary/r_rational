I really like the idea of a reverse Isekai with a low level wizard. In their world they may only have a handful of 2nd circle spells, which actually put them at the peak of skill in their little village and they don't even use their 2nd circle spells to particularly valuable effect, instead doing stuff like doing laundry with Prestidigitation, but on Earth they would be a big shot. All of the limits in their small village: the cost of paper and ink, the lack of background scientific knowledge, the lack of money and time to research are gone on Earth. High quality paper and ink are cheap, any non-magical knowledge is one internet search away, and people will pay thousands of dollars to see minor spells.

For internet usage... I thought there was some specific process going on with the spell book and focusing on visual pattens that helped the Wizard prepare the spells. If it is strictly a need for high quality images of geometric diagrams, then internet usage works. If the paper/ink itself becomes magical in the process of writing down the spell internet teaching does not work...
