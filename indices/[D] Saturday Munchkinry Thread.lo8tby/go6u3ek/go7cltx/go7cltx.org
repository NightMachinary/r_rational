Assuming each search area has to about 5 square feet:

100 square miles / 5 square feet = 557.6 million searches

If you can't use sonar or a good metal detector like the other comments suggested and you have to dig holes.

Then I wouldn't dig large holes, but instead of a bunch of small ones. Use an earth auger.

A gas powered one could probably dig the holes in a minute or two: [[https://youtu.be/PrfJpFQcSj0?t=214]]

The hand powered ones I saw online were also pretty efficient. Maybe 15 minutes for a hole.

15 minutes a hole (assuming you want to use child labor, and not give them gas powered tools) and 557.6 million searches means it would take about 139 million man hours to comb the entire desert. But maybe you get lucky and you only need 10 million man hours. With 40 kids working 8 hours a day that is 85 years. With 100 kids its only 35 years. Unless you are cursed with bad luck and unlikely to find the treasure, in which case multiply those years by 13 to search the entire desert.

But if you have that many man hours, do you really have nothing better that they could be doing? If their labor was only worth $1 an hour then the treasure needs to be worth at least $10 million to be worth the search. But a hundred pounds of gold is only worth about $2 million. The bonds would have to be valid to be worth anything, which seems unlikely given their age, you'd need a legal fight to validate them, and if they are bonds for specific companies those companies could be long gone. I'm not sure about the value of the jewels. Its hard to find any good source estimates online. But they would have to be worth more pound for pound than the gold would be to get up in value to that magic $10 million number.

In conclusion, without a good way of doing a cheap and easy search there is no way the treasure chest could justify the labor costs put in to finding it.
