Doing it with augers instead of shovels is a good take. The on-paper purpose of the camp is "building moral character" which might be a bit harder to believe if you make it even more obvious the inmates are looking for something, but that's a minor issue.

Agreed. The Walker family seems obsessed enough with the treasure that at some point the actual money becomes almost secondary. Louise doesn't come across as willing to cut her losses and bail, or at least convert her unpaid labor force into something profitable.
