There's a lot of unexplored territory with BNHA that doesn't involve punching people harder. I'm reminded of an old SMBC comic about people working out Superman would save more lives by being a human* generator for cheap energy instead of fighting crime ([[https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/2011-07-13]]), and a lot of the 1A quirks would be in a similar boat, or at least able to make stuff a whole lot more efficient with civil engineering training rather than hero training (Todoroki, Uraraka, Midoriya, Yaoyorozu, Kaminari etc.). Also Shoji the organ donor should really be a thing.

Also some of the quirks would be so effective as villains. Imagine Momo turning carbs into bombs, or Ashido doing horrific shit with acid. Hell, a smarter Twice and possibly a careful Shinsou could take down countries by themselves if so inclined.
