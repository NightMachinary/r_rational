If Hagakure really is a light manipulator (as the light flashbang thing suggests, I had really forgotten all about that), then it's very arbitrary that she'd be limited to only manipulate light around herself for the sake of being invisible. First, she should be able to turn visible (which I guess would do wonders for her social life). Second, she could develop her Quirk in ways that allow her to distort, curve and focus or unfocus light or even electromagnetic radiation as a whole in a certain radius around her body. If she can do that, it becomes a lot more powerful of an ability.
