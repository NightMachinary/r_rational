Yeah its interesting I don't know of any really powerful invisibility based super heroes. But I think it could definitely be done.

The type of invisibility might matter, and certain ones seem more powerful.

First I'd separate invisibility powers by how they work:

1. *Benders*: light is bending around them. Might have gravity power implications.
2. *Pass-throughs*: Light waves just passing right through them. Could have implications for ignoring certain kinds of energy waves.
3. *Illusionists*: there is an illusion of empty space, they are actively creating light. This has implications for altering appearances are creating different kinds of illusions.
4. *Mind ghosts*: they are there but they just reach out to erase their presence from other people's minds. Cameras might easily identify them afterwards, but they can walk right past the security guards.

Next it matters what spectrum of energy they are impacting. This is probably a bit of a sliding scale. At the low end of invisibility powers would be just impacting the energy spectrum visible to a regular human eye. Any creatures or devices that peek into infrared or ultraviolet would still be able to see them. At the high end of the power ability would be controlling any part of the energy spectrum.

Finally there is what degree of control they have over their powers. If they are just flicking a mental switch to 'be invisible' then there obviously isn't much room for growth. If they have to exert some level of control over their powers then it can get very interesting.

Consider an illusionist that can alter all ranges of the energy spectrum. They could grow to the level of shooting beams of gamma rays out from their body. Or possibly extreme levels of infrared and cook their enemies.

A bender could learn to create extreme bends in light waves and maybe create a magnifying glass. They also might be a counter to an illusionist shooting gamma death rays. Depending on what is giving them their bending they might be able to extend their bending abilities to matter. Bend bullets around them.

A pass through could have some of the weirdest extended powers. What allows the normal laws of physics to just pass through them? What other laws of physics can they ignore? Are they partially phasing out of this dimension? They might actually be incredibly difficult to kill. Imagine someone that /only/ allows light in the visible spectrum to impact them, and only on their retinas. All matter, radiation, etc doesn't touch them unless they want it to. You'd have a pair of eyeballs drifting around and entering any area or facility that they want to.

The mind ghosts could expand their powers into altering people's minds in other ways. But I feel mind altering powers have been pretty well explored.
