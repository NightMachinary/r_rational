I've read that comic too, and while I enjoyed it, it only applies when Superman is fighting normal street criminals. He doesn't just fight common thugs, he fights invading alien fleets, or gargantuan space monsters that devour planets, or literal gods that would enslave earth for all eternity.

I know it's not the point of the comic, but it just bothers me a bit when I know that the result of Superman not fighting crime is eventually that a galaxy-destroying star-conqueror will wander over to Earth and erase it because Superman wasn't there to fight them.
