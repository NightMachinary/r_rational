Every popular super power has a psychological root regarding why we use it in stories so often. Invisibility is about not being perceived, and all the stuff you could get away with then. So in that spirit you can extend invisibility to being a terrifying anti-meme, SCP style. You could make people's eyes slide away from you, anything you do with you, and concepts relating to you.

Another small mod could be to make it ability to control tangibility (pass through walls, etc). That would be an instantly one hit ko on anyone or anything unless it has organs bigger than a whale.

If you want just baseline naked body invisibility and everyone else can explode planets and you don't want to be in a physics lab for the whole story, then I think it basically comes down to assassinations and spying and mind games. I guess you also have immunity to lasers which you could combine with tech. Mostly it cannot be a direct combat role. It would be down to the intelligence of the character to use it. Try putting it on a character who would be scary even without any powers at all, or putting it on a henchman of such a character. (E.g. lex luther)
