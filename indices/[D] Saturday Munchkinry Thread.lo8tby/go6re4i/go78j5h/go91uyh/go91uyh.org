In addition to what everyone else has said, she might have a really good sensory power. After all, for her eyes to work normaly not only would the retinas need to interact with light, but the entire eyeball has to refract it so it forms an image and block it from all other angles to prevent a white-out, and that clearly isn't happening. So if it's just interacting with the retina, there's no reason she couldn't just look the other direction out of the back of her head, and form there you quickly get 360 degree vision, being able to zoom in like a telescope, expanding the frequency and number of colours she can see, etc.

Another thing you could probably get away with is asking WHY it seem she only blocks the human visible spectrum. It seems like it might be BECAUSE that's what people use to see her via some sort of psychological mechanism, and that if she /practiced/ being watched by an IR camera and trying to hide from it she'd eventually learn to be invisible to IR as well, and so on with the entire EM spectrum.

She'd also probably be immune to EM based weaponry like lasers, radiation, etc. and maybe even many sources of dangerous heat in general letting her walk into burning buildings and stuff depending on what exactly counts as a very short range IR interaction.
