Unmarked spoilers for Holes below.

Are there any clever solutions to finding the buried treasure? For the uninitiated, the treasure is buried somewhere in maybe 100 square miles of Texas desert. Louise Walker's family owns the land, and she spends most of her young life being forced by her grandfather to dig random holes trying to find it. Once he dies and she gains control of the land, she decides to build a juvenile detention facility on the land and get teenage inmates to do the digging instead.

That's creative, but with every hole dug giving you maybe Powerball odds at finding the treasure, is there a better way?
