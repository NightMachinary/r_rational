Yeah metal detector is the first thing that comes to mind, but it really does seem obvious enough that I'd always assumed that it was tried and didn't work.

In the slapdash research I did it seems like there are areas of Texas with mineralized soil. I don't think any location more specific than Texas is ever given so placing Green Lake in a place where the soil is too mineralized for metal detectors to be reliable doesn't seem like a stretch. Completely out of my wheelhouse here though so I could be off-base.
