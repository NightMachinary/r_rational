Based on what you say it should spread organically without you needing to do anything, especially among poorer groups. The reason for this is that the level 0 and level 1 priest spells are actually extremely damn helpful and the fact that literally every single worshiper gets one a week is game changing.

It's honestly pretty hard to argue against: "If you worship this god (who objectively exists and responds directly to your prayers) you get as much clean water as /you/ need out of nowhere" or "If just you worship this god your whole family can clean enough dirty water (or food) to survive".

Similarly, the ability to heal wounds that last months or would otherwise be permanent without medical care without even having to leave your house (eg. a broken bone on an older person) would be a categorical change no matter how much money you have. And that's without even getting into the stuff that actual Clerics could get up to which would also be extremely helpful at spreading your faith.
