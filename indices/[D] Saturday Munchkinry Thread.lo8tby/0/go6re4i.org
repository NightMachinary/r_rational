How do you make invisibility scale across a superhero story?

I was hit by a random BNHA fic urge the other day and was wondering how Hagakure gets by when you have a bunch of powerhouses (shoot explosions from your hands, control of both fire and ice, enough physical strength to arm wrestle the Hulk with ease). For those who don't know, Hagakure's quirk (inherent superpower) is that she is completely invisible, but only her body and not any accessories. So she can't be seen by the naked eye whilst she doesn't wear anything. Later on she works out how to fiddle with light to pseudo-flashbang folks on demand, but she's basically a background character in the story so she doesn't get any discussion of her quirk on screen.

It seems like there are a lot of weaknesses to her quirk in any story with significant superpower proliferation. Sensory powers ignore invisibility, area of effect powers can inadvertently harm her, there's enough already existing forms of technological detection to both counter infiltration attempts, or just slap onto another person as is (give a disposable grunt heat vision goggles and a gun and you're reasonably protected).

There are ways to make a superpower that also grants invisibility strong: make it force everyone who detects you to ignore you instead (so it effects sensory powers too), make it easy to expand to cover other people and objects instead (an invisible army or an invisible sniper outside the range of other forms of detection), package it with any number of other powers and have the user only very rarely bring it out as a surprise trump card. But I'm not sure how you make baseline "my body is invisible" powerful unless your entire shtick is listening on low-level disposable guys meeting in alleyways and little else, or you spend your entire time as an unregistered vigilante who moves between locations frequently so no one ever expects you in the first place (and then a sufficiently high budget doorlock can still prevent you going after many a target).
