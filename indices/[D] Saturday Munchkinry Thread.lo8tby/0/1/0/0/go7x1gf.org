Anything like "her body is a perfectly ideal non-dissipative material whose diffraction index she can manipulate at will across position and the EM spectrum" would be in practice insanely broken. Even more if she could produce non-linear optical effects.

BTW goes nicely with a fanfic idea I have called "Einstein's Child" in which instead it's Ochako Urahara to discover the intrinsic brokenness of her power through the study of general relativity (something that btw is alluded to as a throw-away joke in one of the omake 4-komas).
