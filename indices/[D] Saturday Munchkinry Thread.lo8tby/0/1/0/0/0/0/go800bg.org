  Hell, a smarter Twice and possibly a careful Shinsou could take down countries by themselves if so inclined.

TBF that's also why the manga killed off Twice after he unlocked his full powers. It was just too much to justify him being still one of the LoV and /not/ instantly one-shotting every battle. Not that the LoV is short on overpowered characters, Shigaraki and Gigantomachia are both human WMDs.
