I only knew the flashbang thing because I checked the wiki in case I was forgetting something when writing up this post :S

The canon explanation was along the lines of messing with light "inside" her body (occupying the space her body would normally be visible in?) and reflecting it or refracting it or something. I don't know if she could actually become visible beyond appearing as a solid pitch black figure, given her stuff seems to be innate/instinctual and there's never been a scene of Aizawa innadvertantly cancelling her quirk and a naked girl popping up or something (although given the author made Mineta exist in canon I'm surprised the author hasn't done that scene too, blergh), and I guess he can't cancel quirks from people innately born a certain way in canon like Spinner and others. Although since Aizawa's quirk is based on sight, making herself partially visible somehow (with a generous definition of visible, like said pitch black appearance) might let his quirk cancel out the rest of her own from there?

But yeah, totally agree that light manipulation is totally on the cards, or would be if she got screentime (pun not intended). You could probably make that stuff really interesting if you started taking inspiration from the actual physics of light, although there could easily be a lot of weird implications from anything you came up with (I feel like you could step on the toes of something to do with the speed of light and stuff gets funky quickly). And also I guess putting Hagakure on screen with anything more powerful than her baseline introductory quirk opens up discussions about the way physics is understood in universe more than other characters, since it seems like she could boost her quirk with actual study of scientific knowledge rather than just practice, trial and error, or shounen-style believing in yourself harder like everyone else gets to do.
