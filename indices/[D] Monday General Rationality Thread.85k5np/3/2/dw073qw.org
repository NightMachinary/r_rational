Assuming the person they love is a friend who already knows how they feel, they'd probably go through a bit of a grieving process while trying not to let it affect their friendship, make an ass out of themselves a few times anyway, use some cognitive strategies to help them accelerate the process of not falling into common romantic fallacies (pedestalling, worries about losing "soul mate," etc), learn to overcome feelings of jealousy or entitlement, and then ultimately have grown from the experience and secured a lasting friendship that doesn't cause anyone to be hurt.

That's how I'd write it, at least. Gotta write what you know, right? :P
