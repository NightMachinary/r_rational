Getting them to a therapist could be a better choice. But I would be interested in what makes people stop at "just move on". Of course, it's not something that can be changed (unless somebody invents a time machine.. I don't consent to anyone violating my timeline, though.) but "move on" is just the kind of advice that doesn't guarantee it won't happen again.
