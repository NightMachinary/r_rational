Do we like physics? [[https://www.quantamagazine.org/physicists-find-a-way-to-see-the-grin-of-quantum-gravity-20180306/][Researchers have devised a method to determine if gravity is a quantum force.]] Whichever way the experiment turns out, it will be most interesting, since the Standard Model is silent on this issue. I'm on the fence here and can't decide which way I think the experiment will go. On the one hand, I thought gravity was just [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity][geometry]], that is, the stage upon which physics plays out. On the other hand, it's just a set of field equations, no different than the others. But if so, what sort of mathematics allows for superpositions of spacetime manifolds?

Anyone care to speculate?
