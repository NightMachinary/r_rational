The lack of evidence regarding the existence of a graviton, and the fact that the math breaks when we consider gravity as a quantum force lightly suggest that gravity isn't a quantum force. However, I wouldn't be significantly surprised to find out that it was.

Regardless, I would be surprised if it had an appreciable effect on quantum interactions considering the scale both in terms of mass and distance.
