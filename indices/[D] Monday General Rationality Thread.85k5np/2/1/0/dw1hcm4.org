  Regardless, I would be surprised if it had an appreciable effect on quantum interactions considering the scale both in terms of mass and distance.

But that's the whole point of the proposed experiment: it's a scale on which both quantum and gravitational effects are measurable.

  math breaks when we consider gravity as a quantum force

I've seen this idea presented in various pop-science books: that the probabilities start coming out as negative, or infinite. Such results are highly indicative that the mathematical model is fundamentally flawed. That doesn't mean that gravity isn't fundamentally quantizable, but that if it is, differential geometry is the wrong language for describing it.
