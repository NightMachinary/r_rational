Holy cow, if the experiment works then it'll go down in history as one of those devilishly simple ideas that is so obvious in hind-sight. If you want to see if gravity is a quantum force and there is no method to view it at scales small enough for quantization (they are all hidden behind event horizons in black holes), then the answer is to try inducing quantum phenomena such as entanglement solely due to manipulation of gravitational forces like how we already do so with manipulation of electromagnetic forces. Granted in this case it's 'easier said than done'.

I would bet somewhat firmly on the side of gravity of being quantum, because there is just too much evidence that classical formulation of gravity just doesn't make sense in the extreme boundary cases. Also, why would there be one out of the four fundamental forces not be quantum when the other three are? I would bet on 70% of the experiment resolving in favor of quantum, 20% of giving unexpected results that gravity isn't quantum /or/ classical, and 10% of the experiment resolving in favor of classical.
