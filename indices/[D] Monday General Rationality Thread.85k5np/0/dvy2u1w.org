Is there a better term to describe the concept of "information entropy in discussions"? Alternatively, "the rate of decay of actual information exchange in argumentation and communication versus the participants simply saying things without either listening or recieving the information."

I see this all the time, but I have no succinct way to describe it. But when two people get into an argument, either online or in real life, it usually doesn't last longer than 2-3 exchanges before the argument moved far outside of its practical scope and is really just about gaining a social status or tribe advantage over the other person.

If such a term does exist, finding general ways or policies to improve it would go a long way in improving discourse everywhere.
