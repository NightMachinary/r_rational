I think so.

Open-source 3d printing plans are apparently available for printing out lab equipment (designed for to make lab equipment cheaper for third-world countries).

You can buy the reagents you need from sigma or similar websites and the methods are theoretically publicly available through journal articles and patents.

There is still a large barrier of knowledge, money and trial and error to do anything significant but its possible. But things like transmissable viruses aren't that readily avaialble and working with them is far from easy.

It seems to be a somewhat overlooked regulatory blindspot at this stage. Experimenting on yourself is generally legal with gene therapy you have potential containment issues.
