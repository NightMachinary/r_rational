[[https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/7x8x3q/dude_uses_homebrew_genetic_engineering_to_cure/][man creates and uses gene therapy on himself]]

This is a video of a man supposedly curing himself of lactose intolerance by introducing a gene he lacks into cells in his gut via constructing and administering a virus encoding that gene.

As you'd expect, a lot of the comments are about it being a stupid risk, and this type of gene integration does have serious risks associated with it. But lets say for the sake of argument it worked. Are the risks worth it?

Adeno-associated viral vectors (the type of viral vector he apparently used) are pretty good at targeting a set location in a particular chromosome but do have some incidence of off-target integration.

This means there is a low chance for a vector to insert the gene in a place that could be harmful if it disrupted an important gene. This isn't particularly dangerous when its just one cell, which will likely be triggered to die and have no real effect on the person.

As I understand it, the real danger would be if that rare off-target integration event by one particular virus triggers whats called an oncogene. Oncogenes (or proto-oncogenes until they are activated) are essentially genes that when triggered or disrupted in particular ways cause cancers.

If such a gene were to activate in a cell and avoid triggered cell death, you'd have a cancerous cell expanding in your gut.

But this would seem to be pretty low risk. I'm not sure what the viral load the guy ingested was, but say it was many millions of viral vectors, the chance of triggering an oncogene is apparently still very low: doi.org/10.1182/blood-2010-08-302729

Youtube videos showing how to create your own gene-therapies are pretty scary (and cool) but is the response to that guy's self-administered gene therapy an over-reaction? Can we equate the risks associated with these types of therapies to say for example the risk we take crossing the road to work every day?
