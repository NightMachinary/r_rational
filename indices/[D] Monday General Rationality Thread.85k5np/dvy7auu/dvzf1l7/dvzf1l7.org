I think the standard grieving process is appropriate, and rational. I think this is a rather large topic to unpack (which is why there is so much pertinent media), and attempting to do so would come across as both quaint and clich√©, so I'll just skip to the end:

The final stage of getting over the heartbreak associated with rejection of this sort is understanding that there exist very good reasons why it was "unrequited" in the first place. For the rationalist, I think this would mean learning empathy, particularly to empathize with the person who has rejected them.
