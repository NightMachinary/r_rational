That sort of assumes a "good" protagonist. What does one who doesn't care about the consequences do? Kidnap them and attempt to put them in a stockholm syndrome situation? Find out which people are their closest friends and cut them off, then move in for the +kill+ kiss?

Of course, all this misses the larger question -- which is simply "why?". If we're going by the sidebar, couldn't that be an interesting attempt to "demystify mysterious phenomena"?
