Have you told the person you love about your feelings? No? Then do that.

Yeah, you might get rejected. Yeah, that thought is scary. But if you don't know where the other person stands vis-a-vis a relationship with you, you have no information to work with. You need to know what your options are.

If you have told the person you love about your feelings, and they've turned you down? Well, that's sad, but it's their life. If they don't love you back, or only like you and don't want to push the relationship further, that's their decision. Trying to push your desires onto them... well, I wouldn't say it's irrational, but it's sure as fuck unethical.

If you love someone - really, truly love someone - then caring for that person's needs and desires should come first. And if that person doesn't want to be with you? Well, as the old saying goes: if you really love them, you'll let them go.

I'm not saying it will be easy, but nothing worth doing is easy.
