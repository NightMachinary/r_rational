The problem is, once you start asking about what "protagonists" would do, you put the context into "story", and stories have to be interesting and exciting.

So, taking away the "story" aspect and sticking firmly with the "life advice" aspect, IME, cut off all contact for 3-6 months, then trickle it back in: if it doesn't torture you to be around them, then go "back to normal". if it does torture you, then you might have to just cut off contact altogether, or wait another 3-6 months and try again.

Don't think of ways to win their affection or romantic gestures, don't remind them that you are in love with them: they'll remember---/trust me/---and they'll come to you if they suddenly have feelings back.

So, yeah, not "exciting", nobody's going to want to read a story about the person who avoids someone for six months until there's no longer complicated feelings... but it's probably good advice.
