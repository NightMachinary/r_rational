Understand that I'm framing this as if I am giving real-life advice to someone with unrequited love rather than to a character in a story.

Assuming that you've already confessed your feelings or decided not to ever do so (maybe the other person's married?) and you want to move on, then I would advise distracting yourself. A lot of the emotional pain of moving on is within the immediate time period such as a few days to weeks, so intensely focusing on doing something enjoyable such as your hobbies will help 'time heal your wounds'.

I'd suggest picking up a brand new hobby since it's likely you've already shared your current hobbies with the other person. New hobbies help distance you from that period of your life as something that's completely untouched by any memory associations and the beginning of learning a new hobby is more mentally- and time-consuming than with a hobby you are already experienced with. Having something that's not linked to the other person provides distance.

It would be better to go with hobbies that involve other person than a solitary one, but it's fine to go with a solitary one if you prefer it. I suggest learning a new language. It's very absorptive and great at distracting you while learning, and there are often clubs for practicing communicating with other people in cities.
