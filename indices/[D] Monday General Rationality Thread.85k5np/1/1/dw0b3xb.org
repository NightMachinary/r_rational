People's conceptions of acceptable risk vary a lot by topic; this doesn't seem particularly unreasonable by the standards of what people regularly do (eg. smoke cigarettes or weed). It's not something I would do, given how conservative I am around risks of death, but I think looking at the relatively small risk instead of the technical and cultural phenomena this represents is a little like looking at a major announcement and only talking about the fact the narrator said he smokes.
