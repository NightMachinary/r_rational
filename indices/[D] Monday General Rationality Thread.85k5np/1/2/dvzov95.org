It seems that the consensus of the knowledgable people in the thread were that the risk was too high, although I didn't see anybody providing numbers, so you probably couldn't equate the risk to crossing the road.

I could imagine a world in which the probability of getting cancer/other negative consequences were low enough that my expected utility would be higher if I chose to go through with the procedure. I've been trying to find a systematic way of assigning proper utilities to my preferences but the ways I know break down when you throw in probability.
