has anyone read "Mud's Mission" by ushnor on royalroadl? just started it but it seems like a decent General AI story/ paperclip meme in a lit-rpg universe:

for instance it references third law of robotics (but calls it golemancy in chapter 2) and the fourth chapter prelude is

"When considering the negative consequences of the misuse of magic the first thing to come to mind for most people is the power-mad wizard kings of the past. While it is true that as an individual such beings have caused great suffering, such events are incredibly rare. I would argue that the greater suffering has been caused by the sum total of actions from countless well-meaning but foolish or misguided magic users. How many towns have burned down from one poorly thought out fire spell? How many kingdoms have been destroyed when a summoned demon outsmarted their caller? The prosperous city of Shrumdale was destroyed in a flood after a city planner had the bright idea of refilling the aquafer with a portal to the Elemental Plane of Water. Unfortunately, he forgot to schedule an order to close the portal once the aquafer was full. Even more terrifying are some of the hypothetical magical apocalypses which scholars have theorized could occur from seemingly minor mistakes. The first two concepts we'll explore in this chapter share a theme of automation; the self-replicating transmutation spell and the paper-clip making golem. -Excerpt from Magical Ethics"

if you liked superminion or into the iron teeth (both also on royalroadl) then I think you would like this story
