Tough, but fair. Respect for the feedback.

One question, if that's all right. "It's only missing ambiguous text in italics at the beginning of chapters" strikes me as possibly sarcastic, given that later chapters do have italic text at the beginning of chapters. Is that so? Those bits are meant to have a straightforward connection to the chapter they're in, but if they're coming off as so much woo, then that's actionable, and I can work on adjusting them. (If you bailed out before reaching the italic bits, which is the other possibility that occurs to me, that's fair too.)

Your other concerns, I'll admit, are not things I want to be true of my story. But, well, if they are then they are. Things to work on going forward, and also maybe while looking to revise.
