I'm not saying everyone is written the same way, but I have trouble understanding what motivations the protagonist has besides generic heroism, or his likes and dislikes. The whole "you can't stand out" thing is dropped pretty fast.

He's different from the side characters mostly because he's so bland, in contrast to the side characters being exaggerations of single traits - the shy girl in the Pokemon jump in particular is a walking cliche.

Out of curiosity, how would you say Rien stands apart from other jumpchain protagonists?
