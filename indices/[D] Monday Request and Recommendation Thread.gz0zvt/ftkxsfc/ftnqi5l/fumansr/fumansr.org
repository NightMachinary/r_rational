I guess we just receive it much differently. I like the main character a lot; he's not overbearing but I can't really understand what you mean by 'no personality'. He's distinctly a different person from the side characters in the story, both in the Pokemon and the Madoka universes. I guess the secondary characters are a bit one-dimensional, but that's excusable in short fiction; they have time to grow or be explored more deeply later too.
