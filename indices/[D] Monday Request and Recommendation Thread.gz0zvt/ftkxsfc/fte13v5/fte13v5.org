Looking for human-alien rational romance.

Other than the obvious problem of physical intimacy it might address eating together or wanting to share hobbies. Things we take for granted because of a shared morphology that the couple can't take for granted.

Of course, fluff is welcome as well. I would be just as interested in a story about a date going right.
