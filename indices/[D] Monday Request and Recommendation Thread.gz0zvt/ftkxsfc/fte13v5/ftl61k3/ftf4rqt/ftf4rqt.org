I'd highly recommend it to anyone who like horror/psychologial stories. It's more of a slow-burn psychological thriller than the usual fantasy/scifi that I'm into, but it's well written with solid characters. Monthly updates unfortunately, but the chapters are solid.

A group of nun are essentially stuck in a convent. They haven't had contact with the outside world in quite some time. We know that something terrible has happened to the outside world, and it's coming for them now. They're all normal people, no special abilities, and they're just trying to keep their world going one day at a time.

With the 12th chapter that just came out (release rate is 1/month), the story hit its 1 year anniversary, and the plot has progressed substantially, so it's a good time to binge it.

Here's an excerpt (not a spoiler) from the beginning of the story that I really liked and shows off what kind of story it is.

  [A handwritten note that hangs on the refectory door, yellowed with age. The delicate, neat lettering is still legible.]

  Beware the walking beasts, my children, for all shall be lost if you are to antagonise them.

  Do not ignore this letter, and make sure all are aware of these rules for I cannot guarantee the safety of anyone who does not follow them. Harriet - I am trusting you to make sure that this news reaches the Nocturnes.

  These are rules that all acolytes must follow, for the safety of everyone in our community, and of our very souls.

  1. Cover all light sources at night, nary a single candle for your work.
  2. Keep away from the windows. They have eyes.
  3. Do not rely on the shutters being closed, act as though any small movement can be seen.
  4. Do not make any loud noises. Or any quiet noises that cannot be helped.
  5. If they see you, stand still and stay silent.
  6. If they see you, pretend to slumber. They do not harm the sleeping.
  7. If they see you, do not run.
  8. If you run, you will perish.

  Follow these instructions, and we shall be safe.

  Do not fret without me my dears, I will return soon once I have gathered the needed help.

  Yours with God,

  Mother Superior
