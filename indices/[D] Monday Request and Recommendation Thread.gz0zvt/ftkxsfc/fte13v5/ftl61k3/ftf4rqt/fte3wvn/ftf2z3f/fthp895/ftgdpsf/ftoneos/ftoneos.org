[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/32502/heart-of-cultivation][Heart of Cultivation]] is a xianxia by the author of "A Young Woman's Political Record" that seems promising so far. For a change the main character is not already stronger / more talented than his peers. On the contrary, he's an ex-child prodigy who's hit an insurmountable (so far :P) problem, and has fallen significantly behind. In a culture that primarily values strength and potential, that's not an enviable position.
