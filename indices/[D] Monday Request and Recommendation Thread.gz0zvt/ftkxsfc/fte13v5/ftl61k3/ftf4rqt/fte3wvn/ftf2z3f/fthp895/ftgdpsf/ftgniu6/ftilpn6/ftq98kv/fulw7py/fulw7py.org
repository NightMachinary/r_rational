Kind of late in the week to be adding to this, but the writing and characterization in WoP are really good, which I think has to be a factor in any comparison. I did kind of enjoy the somewhat ridiculous denouement, but it is pretty over the top. I'd also say that WoP is more focused on ethical issues and its interpretation of the alignment system, it's an uplift story but that's not the primary focus of the action. If thought of as pure uplift it's going to be a mild disappointment.
