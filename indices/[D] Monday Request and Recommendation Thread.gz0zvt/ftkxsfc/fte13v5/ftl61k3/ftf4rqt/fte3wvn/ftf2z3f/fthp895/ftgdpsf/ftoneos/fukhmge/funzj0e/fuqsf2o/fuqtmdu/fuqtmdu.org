The stuff you bring up is addressed in the Patreon chapters, at least: he's done some research on the topic, which actually seems to have informed his choice of non-combat specialization; he's also been practicing with a poison that stops his heart for the last few years, since he knows he'll probably have to operate on himself. It's been done before, but generally as a prosthetic for cultivators who've lost their hearts for whatever reason. It's rare because it doesn't actually provide any benefits to someone who can cultivate - and people who /can't/ cultivate generally aren't worth the resources. This, combined with the fact that it's /exactly as dangerous as you might expect/, are why he hasn't brought this idea up with his parents; he's convinced that his family will not allow him to do it.

That being said his plan is "rational" in a very Degurechaff-esque fashion. Exceptionally high risk, exceptionally high reward, with mitigating factors due to proper preparation; and everything is done calmly and methodically, so it's easy to forget that he's preparing to perform open-heart surgery on himself.
