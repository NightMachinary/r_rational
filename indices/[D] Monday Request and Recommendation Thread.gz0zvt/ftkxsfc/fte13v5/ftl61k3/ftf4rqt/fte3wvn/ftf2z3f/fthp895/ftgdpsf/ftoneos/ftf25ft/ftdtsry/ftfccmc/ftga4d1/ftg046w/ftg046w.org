Twig maybe? Sy's my go to for highly manipulative characters that explain their thought processes in a way that feels possible. I can think of a few times when they harm people & blame someone else for an advantage in negotiation/public perception/etc. It's usually not huge amounts of people (depending on your definition of huge) and I'm not sure how well it explores obstacles in doing so since they're pretty specific situations but it might fit your request?
