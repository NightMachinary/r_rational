In case you haven't tried Wildbow's new webserial [[https://palewebserial.wordpress.com/about/][Pale]] yet and would like a "sneak peak" at the contents, I can recommend [[https://palewebserial.wordpress.com/2020/06/06/lost-for-words-1-z/][the latest chapter]]. It's an interlude, and spoils very little of the setting, the plot, or the main characters, but still shows off Wildbow's skill at writing relationships, problem solving, and action. Content warnings for horror and body horror; I don't suggest reading this during, or shortly before eating.

Keep in mind that this is the most intense the story has been so far, most of the other chapters were focussed on setting the scene, introducing important characters and mechanics, and showing each main characters' personal struggles.
