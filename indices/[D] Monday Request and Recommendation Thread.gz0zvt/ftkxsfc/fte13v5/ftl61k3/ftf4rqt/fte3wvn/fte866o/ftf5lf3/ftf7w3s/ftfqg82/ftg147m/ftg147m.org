Yea as the About page says:

  Reading Pact or prior knowledge of the setting is not mandatory for reading Pale.

The story has been really good about introducing most common mechanics and terms, and the Pactverse has such infinite variety that I'm not expecting too much overlap with concepts and Others from Pact.

Depending on where you go to discuss it, you can even enjoy spoiler-free discussion; both the Cauldron and the Doof Discord have a strict no-Pact-spoilers policy. As usual, the [[/r/parahumans]] subreddit is a lot worse about keeping their spoilers tagged.
