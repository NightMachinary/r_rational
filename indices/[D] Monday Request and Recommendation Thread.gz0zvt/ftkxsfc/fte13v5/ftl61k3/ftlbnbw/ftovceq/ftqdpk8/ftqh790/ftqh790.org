Granted no I've not. I saw 80 was leaf focused and the last one an interlude and I just dropped it. I've no interest for that right now, my patience for it has been exhausted after 3-5 months of nothing.

Last one I read was Blue talking to a gym leader and becoming her friend / employee. It's currently on pause, I may get back to it in the future IF people praise it enough, otherwise it's going to stay that way. Downvoting me doesn't really help changing my opinion on it..
