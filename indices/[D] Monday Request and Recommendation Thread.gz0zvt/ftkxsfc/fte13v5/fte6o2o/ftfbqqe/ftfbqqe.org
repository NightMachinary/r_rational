First Off, self promoting at the bottom.

About the only Alien romance that isn't a straight Kirk / Slave Girl type deal was in [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22733729-the-long-way-to-a-small-angry-planet][A Long Way to a Small and Angry Planet.]] Not fully rational, but passable. It's got Human - AI and a very Orange/Blue morality alien romance that I thought was original and rather well done.

As for self promotion, this is a niche I kinda stumbled my way into, but I had a spat of at least sensible stabs at this genre. I'm not going to claim them as rational. Started with [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/wiki/series/life_with_an_alien_girlfriend][Life with an Alien Girlfriend]] series, and then a few interconnected singular ones. NSFW HFY Pancakes on them.
