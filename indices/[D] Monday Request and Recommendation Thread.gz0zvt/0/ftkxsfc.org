It's been recommended a couple times in past threads. Nowhere Land is a jumpchain/horror fic set (initially) in the Pokemon universe.

I have to counter-rec it. The main character has no personality, even accounting for the genre, and the mystery is the kind that insists upon itself, reminding you every few scenes and taking you out of the story, with zero subtlety and much repetitiveness. It's only missing ambiguous text in italics at the beginning of chapters.

Characters in general are pretty one-dimensional and weak, and everyone is reactive. The story isn't really scary either. Honestly, I can't understand what people see in this story. The conceit of the Pokemon jump was pretty original, I guess? It /could/ get more interesting in the far future?
