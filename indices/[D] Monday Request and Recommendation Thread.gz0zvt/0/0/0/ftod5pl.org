Ah, no, that's not what I mean by ambiguous text in italics. A lot of pretentious mystery fics have stuff like

#+begin_quote
  /Beneath the moonlight glints a tiny fragment of silver, a fraction of a line.../
#+end_quote

at the beginning of chapters, which are meant to hint at the main mystery, but aren't meant to be solvable. Of course, the example I used (from HPMOR) is acceptable because it happens once in the entire fic.

The book excerpts are one of the best parts of the second jump, though maybe there are too many. Really, if you want to focus on actionable feedback, the single most important thing in my humble opinion is "fixing" the main character, but I'm not sure if that can be done without a rewrite. Thank you for reading my feedback and good luck with the story.
