Seconded. Pale is looking to be one of if not my favourite of his works despite it just starting out. All 3 of the the viewpoint characters are incredibly compelling and their pitfalls seem like the kind that would be relatable to people of the sub (eg. being overly enthusiastic while learning about/experimenting with magic). Not sure about using the interlude to get a taste of the story since it seems to be the climax of the first arc and it's really improved by all the suspense leading up to it but it not exactly wrong to say that it works pretty well standalone as well.

Also despite Pale having only started a month ago, there's already a fan audiobook that's within 1-2 chapters of being caught up as well as companion podcast by the Deep in Pact people
