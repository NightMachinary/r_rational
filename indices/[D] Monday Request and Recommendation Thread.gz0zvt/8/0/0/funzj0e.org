It's a bit understated but there's some neat stuff going on.

Like I'm pretty sure the reason why it's called "Heart of Cultivation" is because the main character has realized that his insurmountable problem is due to a physical deficiency in his heart, which prevents him from advancing his cultivation. It starts /in media res/ with the MC working as an artificer, with that realization having happened in his backstory.

So his plan is very rational and logical. He's going to replace his own heart with an artificial construct so that he can continue cultivating. In the current Patreon chapters he's just managed to gather a critical component for his plan.

Overall it's a much more sane and rational Xianxia than most, but it's also very much a more traditional Xianxia than Cradle.
