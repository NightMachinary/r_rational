The author said he's trying to avoid what he sees as xianxia pitfalls, but it's way too early to say whether the story is rational or even interesting. I enjoy YWPR so I'd give him the benefit of the doubt.

It's hard to call his plan rational and logical without more in-world medical context, because for a "sane" person, it's batshit crazy and irrational to decide to get a heart transplant in pseudo-archaic xianxia society with an artificial heart that he made as an amateur - all in order to have the infinitesimal chance to cultivate and then consummate the farce of a duel to settle an arranged marriage. That's a pretty convoluted chain of logic to risk his life for, but xianxia period mores I guess? Also the perennial munchkin question: why hasn't anyone else done it already?
