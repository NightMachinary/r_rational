I'd look at [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perdido_Street_Station][Perdido Street Station]], a weird fiction novel by China Mi√©ville. It's almost pure worldbuilding, there's a ore romantic relationship between the main character (a human) and a giant ant. Surprised I haven't seen the novel recommended here much, it's a pretty strong exercise in pure worldbuilding.
