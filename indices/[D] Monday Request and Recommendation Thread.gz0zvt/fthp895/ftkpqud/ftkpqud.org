All in all Companion Chronicles is well worth the read.

However, be aware that occasionally instead of chapters the author writes rants on modern day social issues of M2F transgenders. The worst part about this is that the story /starts/ with such a rant - as such I honestly suggest you skip the first couple of chapters and optionally read them later if the story interests you.
