I've commented on Mud's Mission in the past but I'll paraphrase it here.

The promise is amazing, the quoted parallels are clever, and the first few chapters were really exciting but I don't really feel it has delivered. Aside from 2-3 instances it completely fails to show why golems are dangerous and only tells it with quotes. In the last 20 or so chapters the MC is largely replacable with most other antihero litrpg MCs.\\
To be a little more specific one example is that there's little exploration of the wording of orders and what conflicting orders mean. It makes sense that Mud wants to grind to get more XP so it can defend the masters things better however being damaged contradicts with the masters third order. And Mud is repeatedly ordered by humans to do things that indirectly contradicts with existing orders(i.e. wastes time that could be used to grind XP) and doesn't once consider somehow blocking communication channels. A single 'stay here until I tell you otherwise' or 'erase your memory of all orders aside from the ones I give you' has the potential of destroying all things Mud care for.
