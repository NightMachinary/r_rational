I've been reading it, but it is starting to look like a lot of the story is going to revolve around Mud fitting in with people, with convenient/cute misunderstandings of Mud's odd behaviour. Also people are being unusually generous with the MC. This is fine, but I was hoping for something different.

It is increasing similar to the story “Everybody Loves Large Chests”. Minus much of the violence and pretty much all of the sexual content.
