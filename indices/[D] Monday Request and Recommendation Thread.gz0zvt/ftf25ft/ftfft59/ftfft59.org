It has potential and has been recommended non stop lately. My only problem with it is that it's too new, it could turn out bad in a couple months and make me feel like my time was wasted. Which is a risk I'm not willing to take right now.

I'll wait a bit, see how it turns out before taking the leap. It seems to be right up my alley, but I'm always wary of very new series, I'd rather read the true and trusted than take a chance on something very new.
