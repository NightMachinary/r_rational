I've found /Release That Witch/ to be of a much better quality, on average, than the WoP series --- and they are thematically quite similar otherwise. Both stories had their failures, but RTW still ended up much further ahead of WoP.

- RTW > WoP: Much more detailed and realistic descriptions of various technological processes. The authour [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork][has shown their work,]] the reader can actually learn a few things by just reading the descriptions if they are not skipping ahead to the "fun parts". WoP, in contrast, largely relies on DnD-style RPG mechanics to handwave away many engineering-, infrastructure-, and logistics-based problems that the protag would otherwise have to face and solve. For that matter, prot is often immune to adverse effects of military strategy and (opponents') psychology too.

  - However, the later parts of RTW are less detailed than the starting arcs. So if you find yourself thinking that you're not enjoying the story as much as before, or that it has started feeling like a generic isekai, it will probably not get any better in future chapters, and you can just start skipping through the filler paragraphs.
  - RTW-CON: it has too much anime logic, but not to a degree that would spoil the enjoyable parts.
  - RTW-CON: Like many other Isekai protagonists who come to another world from their day and age, they take their culture baggage as a list of self-evident truths, and the universe of the hosting new world never (or almost never) proves them and their opinions wrong.
  - WoP < any story of average quality: The final 1--2 books jump the shark spectacularly. [[#s][spoiler1]] Protag's personal power curve exponentially skyrockets out of nowhere, he gets unjustified rewards and aid, deus ex machina solutions are introduced to accommodate him. I suggest treating [[#s][spoiler2]] the summoning of his wife as the book series' finale and not bother reading anything after that.

- There's also the [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/40670][1632 series,]] although I haven't read it myself yet.

- [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/WithThisRing][/With This Ring/]] does quite a bit of magic-assisted uplifting. More like munchkining through the entire DC franchise, really.
