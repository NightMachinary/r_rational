To kick this thread off, I'll recommend [[https://myanimelist.net/anime/38691/Dr_Stone][Dr. Stone]] - it's an extremely good uplift anime/manga where the central conceit is that the protagonist is lithogenically(?) preserved for 3000 years into the future.

I'd actually recommend the anime over the manga for those episodes that exist - and in fact, I'd even recommend the english dub over the subbed version. While the manga is of course good, I think the anime does an incredible job with the medium, especially with the sound and music. The dub also does a great job with the personalities of the characters - the voice of Alphonse Elric talking about equivalent exchange is a treat - and with a good adblocker [[https://www.funimation.com/shows/dr-stone/][you can actually watch it for free!]]
