Can't say I've read any "rational romance" stories, but here are some books that I can recommend:

- [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/95558.Solaris][Solaris]] by Stanis≈Çaw Lem can be read as sentient ocean wants to mindf*ck ;)

- [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18423.The_Left_Hand_of_Darkness][The Left Hand of Darkness]] by Ursula K. Le Guin

If you like graphic novels, you can't go wrong with the amazing [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/146415][Saga series]] by Brian K. Vaughan.
