I'd say put it on pause. The author doesn't seem to want to tell an interesting story but actually follow the lives of 3 somewhat interesting people in a very slow methodical pace. It's fine for what it is, and bearable when you are bulk reading it, but when you catch up and updates are monthly with most of them being interludes and non plot driving things it feels almost like it's trying to make you drop it.

​

Most months I completely forget about it, only for me to be reminded of it in a post or email. Which just turns into a boring task I need to get over with.

Nothing against Daystar, I like him, but he doesn't seem to get you either have to do high tension or relevance scenes or overviews of actions characters took over a long period of time. Instead he does no tension, glacial pacing follow along while the characters do boring work for 5k words which he could have done with the same effect in 2 lines during a relevant scene as a "thanks to my practice with X I was able to overcome Y" type of thing without wasting our time.
