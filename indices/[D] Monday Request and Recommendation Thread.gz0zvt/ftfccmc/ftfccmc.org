Does anyone know of any good stories that involve the rational exploration of the obstacles involved in not wanting to disclose your involvement in killing large numbers of seemingly normal/normal people for beneficent or malicious reasons, or any stories with interesting proactively scheming/manipulative pov characters whose successes in manipulation are accurately reflected in their written observations/decision making processes who aren't commended as master manipulators for understanding basic social cues and how characters with all the depth of a 2d image tends to act?
