I read through [[http://mda.wtf/][My Delerium Alcazar]] recently. It's one of those user-input webcomics (though it's also pretty text heavy), and I think people on this subreddit will enjoy it.

It takes place in a vaguely crapsack dystopian future with clones and bio-printers - then weird eldritch stuff starts happening with cult-like shibboleths and (a hint of, so far) anti-memetics. The main character at least tries to be rational, exploring the limits and requirements of the weird situation she finds herself in. One thing I like about the story is that she's also not hesitant to recruit help from the other folks in town who seem trustworthy.

MDA is an on-going continuation to the universe from the completed [[http://bloodismine.com/][Blood is Mine]], which is also good so far but I haven't finished it yet. That one is less about exploration and more survival horror.
