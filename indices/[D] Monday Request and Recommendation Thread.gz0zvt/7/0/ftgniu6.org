Lois McMaster Bujold, Vernor Vinge. You should be able to find a bunch of their stuff at your local library, quite likely even e-book versions, and they are far and away the best authors in this genre. If you have already read their entire ouvre, good recs are going to need some more detail about what, exactly, you are looking for.
