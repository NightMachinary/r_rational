Adding on to what you said:

- Castle Kingside has been pretty good so far about the hurdles in introducing new technology in a medieval society. It has better prose than you normally see in webfiction, and the characters have been good so far as well. It's like what World of Prime could have been.

- Enlightened Empire is also a long civilization building story. It's currently on hiatus, and it's not as good as Castle Kingside. But it scratches that itch without jumping the shark too much.

- I'm currently reading a multicross called [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/cruel-to-be-kind-si-multicross-thread-iv.310606/][Cruel to be Kind]] that has a single stranded character building a civilization. It's been pretty good so far, although it's probably dead. There's a lot of content though.
