He moves further away from catching & training.

He leaves the group to dedicate himself full-time to psychic research. This addresses your irrationality concern, in that he's no longer putting his life into his pokemon's hands on a daily basis, but will perhaps be less enjoyable for you nonetheless.

 

The other popular pokemon fanfics in these parts, which I believe both provided inspiration for Origin of Species, are [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13407176/1/The-Game-of-Champions][The Game of Champions]] (sadly aborted, with the final chapters posted as author notes) and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11273833/1/Pok%C3%A9mon-The-Line][Pok√©mon: The Line]] (probably also dead).

Both do the "pokemons are dangerous wild animals and the pokemon world is a terrifying place to send children into" thing, and they both have a protagonist much more like Blue than like Red/Green/Aiko.
