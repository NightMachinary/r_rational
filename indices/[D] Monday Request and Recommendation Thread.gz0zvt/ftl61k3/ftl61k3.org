Hey guys! Haven't posted here much before and wanted to ask for some advice. I started reading Pokemon: Origin of Species a couple of days ago, and I'm currently undecided in whether I want to continue it or try something else. I absolutely loved it in the beginning - the worldbuilding and characters where really cool. However, I am now just past Mt. Moon and there are two things that's bothering me a lot.

First, the pace. It feels absolutely glacial. Is this going to continue throughout, or does it pick up at some point?

Secondly, and perhaps more worrying: Reds lack of strong pokemon and his attitude towards it. I get that he's not Blue, and I'm not asking him to be, but I find his disinterest in catching and training new pokemon and his attitude towards the competitive aspects kind of.. irrational? He's been in two extremely dangerous situations so far, and clearly understands the value of having strong pokemon and being able to help and protect, and still, most of his time is spent contemplating imponderables. I don't mind him questioning stuff, so I don't think my issue is with ratfic as such, I'm just concerned that he finds questioning his friends biases more important than potentially life saving training, if you understand? Is this just me? If he was just sitting in Oaks lab doing his research, I'd understand, but as far as I can tell his initial motivation for becoming a trainer was also his general interest in pokemon and travelling. At this point, he seems to be just tagging along, losing pokemon and almost dying left and right, without considering his own weakness as a trainer an issue for a second. Is he going to pick up his game at some point, or is his character going to develop even more to the extreme of "I am more worried about my potental future research career than in surviving the next two days"?

I would be very interesting in continuing the series if Red picks up his game and the pace improves, but if not: Are there any other rational-ish pokemon series that you think would suit me better based on my current issues?
