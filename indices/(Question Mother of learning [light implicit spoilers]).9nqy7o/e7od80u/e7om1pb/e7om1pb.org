So Zach, in his typical "die killing a dragon until you succeed" way, assaults the cultists when they're attempting the summoning. He's there when Panaxeth is loosed, and gets his mind messed with.

It makes sense, but it seems like Panaxeth would have created a better mental compulsion. Unless Zach was in the process of activating his suicide switch, so it had to be rushed? Otherwise, how did Panaxeth getting write-access to the controller's brain not result in an instant & total victory?
