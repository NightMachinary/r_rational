I don't think Zorian will enter Zach's mind due to the extreme risk. Doing so would anger and alienate his only friend and ally in the bubble realm, who is also an incredibly potent mage, and more importantly, is the controller of the realm.

It's entirely plausible that doing so would trigger a reset, wiping the memories of all their other allies.

Don't get me wrong. I'm a big subscriber to the belief that something to do with Zach's missing memories /will/ be back to bite Zorian, and very likely Zach as well. Before looking into this, though, Zorian needs much higher apparent stakes, or else a way to effectively mitigate that risk.
