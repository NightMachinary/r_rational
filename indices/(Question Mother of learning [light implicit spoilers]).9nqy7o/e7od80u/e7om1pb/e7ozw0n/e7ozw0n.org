I found her compelling even though she was planning on betraying Zorian, perhaps she was influencing Zach in order to use him as a tool across loops.

I really hope Zorian finally mans up and invades Zach's mind tomorrow. I don't even think it's ethical to let your mind controlled/brain damaged friend tell you not to help him when his reasoning is damaged, beyond the fact that Zorian is letting his concerns over this course of action imperil a stunningly large number of lives + souls.

I could imagine him entering Zach's mind to find a shadow of Spear of Resolve, or evidence of her handiwork, twisting Zach away from full cooperation with Zach.

Weak evidence in favour of this would be slight personality changes in Zach pre and post Zorian's interaction with the aranea, which I think there is a case for. Maybe Zach matured between Zorian's first loop and their later partnership, but I'm skeptical.

also, Spear of Resolve clearly figured out many secrets about the loop like a decade before Zorian did. Like, how did she know that only one could win? Because she plucked it from Zach's head. The only other source of knowledge might have been the Ghost Serpent, but that seems off to me.
