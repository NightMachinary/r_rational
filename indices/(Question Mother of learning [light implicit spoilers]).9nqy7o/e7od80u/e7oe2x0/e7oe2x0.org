It's possible, and not entirely out of character, though I feel like she wouldn't have done anything too drastic simply because she doesn't understand the loops' system and wouldn't want to effect it too much.

My prefered theory is that Zach befriended Veyers early in the loops, together they eventually beat up or somehow tricked QI out of his crown, experimenting, Zach gave Veyers a marke. In the next loops Veyers learns of his limited lifespan and wanted more, so he turned on Zach and sided with QI who after some persuasion and trial was able to break the marker in such a way as to make it permanent, then Veyers learns mind magic from QI until he could sufficiently fuck with Zach's head, which he did though poorly, this made Zach's memory of the early restarts vague and removed all knowledge of Veyers from his memory, as opposed to just the knowledge of him in the loop which Zorian could do easily.
