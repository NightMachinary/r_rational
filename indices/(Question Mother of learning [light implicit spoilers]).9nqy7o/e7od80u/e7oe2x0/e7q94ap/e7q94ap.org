  Veyers learns of his limited lifespan and wanted more, so he turned on Zach and sided with QI who after some persuasion and trial was able to break the marker in such a way as to make it permanent
#+end_quote

Question: Why does QI not want in? Unless his deal required being able to condition red-robe in order to ensure red-robe fulfilled the outside-the-loop part of the deal.

Still, QI has every reason to want to know about the loop, and IIRC when QI first met Zach/Zorian (the incident which brought Zorian into the loop), he didn't realise that Zach was "immortal" until Zach blabbed, and /then/ QI changed tack.

So, QI would have been willing to not be given knowledge of the loop, for some reason, yet still get something out of it post-loop somehow. /Or/ be tricked into meddling with RR's soul to mess with the marker, without recognising the marker's purpose (which seems extremely unlikely).

All in all, it doesn't add up.
