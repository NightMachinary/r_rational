#+begin_quote
  The idea that QI makes a forced compliance of the deal in RR soul is also plausible. I never said that QI never learners of the loop, just that he wasn't added with a temp marker
#+end_quote

If QI knows he's in the loop, he blows himself up rather than permit a hostile looper to gain from him.

  It's distinctly possible QI can't be brought into the loop without access to his phylactory, and the chances of him showing it to anyone no matter the circumstances are slim to say the least.
#+end_quote

If he knows about the loop (which would be a prerequisite to getting a marker, since soulfuckery is serious business), then he'd have no qualms about risking his philactery, for the same reason he's willing to blow himself up.
