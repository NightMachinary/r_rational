It's distinctly possible QI can't be brought into the loop without access to his phylactory, and the chances of him showing it to anyone no matter the circumstances are slim to say the least.

The idea that QI makes a forced compliance of the deal in RR soul is also plausible. I never said that QI never learners of the loop, just that he wasn't added with a temp marker, only the controller can use the artifacts, and Zorian cause he is a fake controller.

It's also possible that Veyers marker was broken by QI by accident, perhaps after they 'beat' him and Veyers got the marker they tried again I'm order to get the crown and add other, but they failed and QI tried to fuckup Veyers soul, Zach killed himself to reset and interrupted, thus leaving Veyers with a bugged temp marker, after that Veyers just did what Z&Z did to learn enough soul and mind magic to fuck with Zach.
