Assuming he can choose which plants in his range to apply his growing power to he could do what amounts to tens of thousands of years of selective breeding in a single year.

I'm fairly sceptical he could use it to overthrow humanity or anything, but it should take him mere hours to develop weeds/plants that are immune or nearly immune to the majority of modern pesticides and would be just terrible for farmers in general.

If his power to assess their genetics via his plant sense was good enough he might be able to make some super plant via planned breeding or something, but that seems pretty unlikely; him being a major economic/food security issue is about the best he can hope for.
