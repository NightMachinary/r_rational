Exterminating humanity is pretty easy: selectively breed some sort of extremely efficient algael bloom that will choke out phytoplankton without commensurately contributing to CO2 sequestration/conversion, ensure its runaway success, congratulations you now have killed all of humanity.

Unfortunately this would also take down most macrofauna. Problematic!
