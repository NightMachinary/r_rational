In the American South, Kudzu can grow at up to 18 inches a day and has been known to kill cows by rooting them to the spot while they were sleeping or grazing. This means Planter can make kudzu grow at 37 feet per minute, and unlike bamboo it spreads out instead of up. He could carry cuttings with him and travel around to farms, spending ~10 minutes at each of them to create a line of ruined land which will still spread pretty rapidly without his presence.

Tree roots are already a threat to many kinds of industry and infrastructure. If he can make a fully mature oak tree in 2.5 hours, he could also drop a bunch of maple seeds in various places to create a mat of less mature trees which will all need to be exterminated. If he does it on the beaches where sub-oceanic fiber optic lines emerge, he could cripple global communications very rapidly.

Almond and Tamarisk trees consume enormous amounts of water. If he went around to the headwaters of various rivers and planted trees all around their shores, he could consume a significant fraction of their flow. If he went to remote areas above major aquifers he could dry them out over the course of several years by preventing rainwater from percolating downward into them.

Ironically, he could probably destroy sections of the Amazon Rainforest even faster than we are by introducing invasive species. The Amazon is usually protected from that kind of thing because the trees absorb nearly all of the nutrients in the ground and prevent any light from reaching seedlings, but if I'm interpreting things correctly that shouldn't matter here. He can just multiply what few nutrients exist and go from there, applying his power only to the invasive plants and smothering the trees.

Kelp grows incredibly quickly, and if he clogged shipping lanes with it he could bring the economy to a screeching halt pretty quickly. The enormous amount of added biomass would also eventually start rotting, deoxygenating the surrounding water in the process. He could probably kill reefs this way as well just by massively altering water chemistry.

This is speculative, but if he got some plant with particularly deep and destructive root systems, he might be able to blow the Yellowstone supervolcano early. This would require knowledge of geology he probably doesn't have, but he would be very unlikely to be caught until it was too late, assuming it's possible.

He might be able to reroute lava flows on Hawaii to destroy cities and towns. If successful, this could give him a reasonable base of operations. He might also get some support from disaffected native Hawaiian communities if he billed himself as driving away the imperialist bastards.
