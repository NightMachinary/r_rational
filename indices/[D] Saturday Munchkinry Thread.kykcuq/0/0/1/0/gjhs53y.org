Oh, aye, Planter could cause a lot of damage if he wanted to. He could even, perhaps, kill a large population of humans with the right choices and luck. The problem I find is that if he wants to destabilise human civilisation to the point where he could pick off the remnants with ease, ruining golf courses or aiding invasive species isn't terribly useful. It could fuck things up severely, but not severely enough. The plant vaults thing though? Didn't cross my mind. That might be enough to cause some real damage if our man is stealthy enough that he can get away with taking the aeroplane rides necessary to get it done quick.

A final note on the plant sense thing is that while Planter's plant sense isn't enough to get /proof/ on dirty deeds, it might be enough to get circumstantial evidence that can be developed into blackmail. It's not a sure thing, but given that he could process the inputs anyway, it might be a good use of time he wasn't doing anything with anyway. For example, if you can effectively track anyone who walks over grass, that could let you track that some sort of meeting is happening between two people who wouldn't want people knowing they were meeting. Even if you offer no evidence that such-and-such was meeting with their handler so-and-so, just telling them that you knew their meeting occurred at this place and at that time would be enough, I think, to freak them out and make them listen. Again, you're right in that it's not terribly useful, but it's difficult to come up with ways to destabilise the world using this power specifically.

But yeah, tricky scenario.
