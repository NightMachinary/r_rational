Ruining golf courses alone might not be civilization-ending, but it'd do economic damage severe enough that it couldn't be ignored, and it also wouldn't have a rational explanation. It could be used in conjunction with other methods to spread societal instability. Historically, the most devastating collapses of civilizations have occurred due to the panicked actions of empowered factions.

Increasing the supply of heroin and building up contacts among the sellers/distributors is a start, but it takes a lot more to bring Mankind to ruin. People need to be in disarray, the assumptions that keep them calm need to be twisted and shattered.

Wealthy people love their golf and other luxuries and in a more abstract sense, like anyone, they like feeling in control. If their property was ruined without any sensible explanation, costing them significant time and money, that could contribute to other stressors that lead to further, widespread decay. Planter could even be selective about their targets, using their power as another way to blackmail.

Their power has decent range for doing this, even if they'd need to do it in-person. Planter would probably find it relaxing actually, a way to let off steam from dealing with humans. Spreading their comrades on the sterile landscape, bringing fear and anger to the bloated, corrupt humans.

You make good points on Planter's espionage, assuming that they could cultivate the deductive skills to use their plant-sense like that. They could use it to cultivate a supernatural persona and/or sow seeds of mistrust in between individuals/factions, obviously being careful to avoid tipping their hand, letting anyone know that their supposed omniscience is limited to plants.

There are people smart enough that they could figure it out with subtle experimentation and ruling out the mundane possibilities. Sadly for Planter, they'd have to stay away from any plant-theming. If they let their fixation on greenery slip, it could bring people that much closer to connecting the dots, especially in a world where plant villains are a part of pop culture.
