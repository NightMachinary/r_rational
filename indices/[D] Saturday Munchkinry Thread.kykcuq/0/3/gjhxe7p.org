This would be a great question for someone who specializes in biology/botany/biochemistry/etc. since Planter would be best suited leveraging the capabilities of specific plants. Lumber comes to mind since trees take a while to grow. TheJungleDragon mentioned bamboo which already grows quickly and has applications that range from construction to fabric to a source of fuel.

Among the first thing Planter should do is head to a public library, get set up, and do research on the computer. It's not like there aren't already homeless and/or weird people in there, and its quiet.

Looking up stuff on certain poisonous plants could raise up red flags in the long term, but really Planter just needs to focus on are applications of plants that are usually limited due to the fact that they grow/spread slowly. It'd also be helpful to research selective breeding and really agricultural science in general.

Planter shouldn't skip on learning the math either. Time to learn the languages of biology and chemical/mechanical/textile engineering. Autodidacts is easier with the internet and willingness to put in the time and effort. Start with garden variety algebra, precalculus, and methods of proof. Build up layers of knowledge in linear algebra, calculus (both single and multivariate), statistics, and differential equations.

Average intelligence or not, if you're not people smart, you need to cultivate other kinds of smarts to compete. I'm tempted to say they should work towards a wide base of knowledge, which to some extent they'll have to. At the same time, being a jack of all trades is of limited use when things surrounding plants and killing the enemies of plants come easily to you.

They'll probably want to pay their respects to the departed trees first, but Planter needs to take notes, lots of them.

Other than that, [[/u/TheJungleDragon]] has good points. Their power would be great for producing drugs and other illegal substances that come from plants or even animals that eat plants. Organized crime isn't easy to stay afloat in, especially on a large enough scale to threaten the human species. Planter would have to operate carefully, it'd be best for them not to pursue a leadership position unless they're acting through a reliable prox(ies).

Our intrepid villain is relatively easy to physically conquer and their power is as much a liability as it is an asset. They're at a much higher likelihood of getting vivisected than most people to say the least. Or maybe just assassinated to get rid of someone whose power is an inherent threat to entire industries.
