The idea of a plant person or plant people is a common trope in a lot of fiction. Someone who has the properties of and/or control over plants. Usually some handwaveium is involved and particularly in the case of plant antagonists, their abilities tend to wander more into the valley of creating and controlling plant-themed minions rather than making plants threatening.

Even Worm introduced the idea of a , "plant tinker" but they turned out to be more of a general wetware tinker who utilizes seeds and incorporates aspects of plants/fungi into their creations, but the end result is more animal than anything

Assuming a setting in our world, the existence of a, "planter" on its own doesn't necessarily bring to mind the trope of plant superhumans being bioterrorists. The applications in agriculture, terraforming, phytoremediation, chemistry, and so on are obvious.

How would you munchkin a villain!Planter?:

- Goal for now is to exterminate humanity completely. There can be no peace until every human is dead, even them exiting the Earth would be unacceptable. The very idea of humans is highly irritating, and associating with them is naturally repulsive, albeit not completely out of the question for Planter. Social skills with anyone besides plants are severely lacking.

- Planter doesn't share this grudge with non-human animals and is, ironically, a rather militant vegan as long as they can minimize their harm to plants as well. Planter believes causing harm to animals should be avoided as much as practicable. No one ever said their ethics made much sense.

- Body can easily survive off sunlight and eating sufficiently nutritious soil if necessary. Otherwise they're a baseline human, average intelligence and unlike Poison Ivy, not particularly attractive. Hygiene isn't great either if we're being honest. Planter is currently a homeless 20-year old on the streets of Tallahassee.

- Can speed up the biological processes x36,000 of any organism in the kingdom /Plantae/ within a 180 meter radius around them. A common dandelion could germinate and reach maturity in under 30 seconds and a white oak in approximately 2.4 hours.

- Planter's power greatly supplements nutrition, carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight throughout the growth dilation to ensure their plants are healthy, but can't simulate more environmental factors like temperature, if the initial conditions impede plant life, or don't provide any foundation for the plants to germinate.

- They can sense what any plant in existence can naturally sense and their brain is well suited to interpret, compartmentalize, and multi-task with all of this feedback, of course their active awareness of how plants are constantly getting mutilated doesn't help with their misanthropy.

- Power doesn't allow them to control or modify plants or to warp reality to spread seeds faster, but they can assess the genetics, age, health, etc. of any plant using just their plant-sense.
