I park my shuttle in a high orbit above the supermassive blackhole Sagittarius A*. The sight wasn't nearly as impressive as I had hoped. Definitely not worth the four-hundred year journey, and that was only going by my time. In fact, several tens of thousands of years must have passed on Earth since I had left. It was funny, scientists had completely conquered aging, mortality, and all of the four horseman, but faster-than-light travel was still as elusive as ever. I guess some rules just can't be broken. Well, whatever. Not like it would matter for much longer. Using the ship's dark matter thrusters, I lower its orbital velocity until I was on a direct course for the black hole itself. It was time for revenge.

Why, oh why had the universe decided to curse me with this strange, inexplicable ability? Not only was it the most useless "superpower" imaginable, but it was unbearably annoying. Drop a pack of playing cards? Well, odds are decent one of them just dissapeared forever. Fumble your boarding pass on the way to the spaceport? It's probably still there, but sometimes it isn't! Who can possibly live a normal life with such inconsistency? Oh, and drop those tiny screws while fixing your glasses? Those things are gone for good my friend, although that last one is probably unrelated to the power itself.

Anyway, after years of dealing with this torment, I'd taken the only sane course of action and resolved to kill every living being in existance. And luckily for me, I've just crossed the event horizon! Looking at the black hole has gotten boring, so I put on my EVA suit and exit the shuttle. Looking back at the direction I came from, I see an accelerating universe. Time from my perspective remains constant, but as I fall into the black hole I move faster, causing all the wonky relativistic effects I was hoping for. On the outside, thousands and then millions of years appear to pass in seconds, and the size of the universe itself contracts from billions of light-years down to millions and down still further. The mass of objects appears to increase, yet the total weight of the universe stays at a constant zero. Why yes, the universe actually weighs nothing at all. Weight implies a downward force, but there's nothing for the universe to "fall" into!

I approach the singularity, and the entire universe shrinks down to the size of a solar system, then a star, and then a planet. Soon it's a mere kilometer, then a decameter, a meter, and now a decimeter. I reach out one last time and clench my hand, trying to hold onto the universe before I dissolve into nothingness. But the universe, being a very fickle thing, slips out of my hand. /Oops/, I smirk. /Must've dropped it/. And in that instant, the entire universe does not get destroyed, because I bet everything on a power that only works 1% of the time. /Damn it/, I frown. /What a stupid ability/. I die.
