Horcruxes and other phylacteries, if we add on other supernatural phenomena. Anything that has an area of effect (and, to cheat a bit, works in some esoteric/anomalous fashion that gets around the "gravity only" part of the OP), though since it'll likely sink in the bottom of Earth's gravity well you'd have to find something that helped with that, too.

Evidence, such as bullet casing or a gun from an assassination.
