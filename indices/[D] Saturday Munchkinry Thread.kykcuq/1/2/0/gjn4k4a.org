I lost a good pen yesterday, just sitting at my desk. It can't possibly have traveled more than 2 feet in any direction but it's fucking /gone/.

I also watched a puzzle piece disappear before hitting the ground the other week. I swear it just fell out of space.

Thanks for the solidarity. There are dozens of us.
