True, which explains why when the trope is invoked, they usually take additional artistic license.

I excluded modification to prevent it from becoming more a matter of mixing and matching to find the best botanical WMD or the combination that lets you make giant, man-eating Venus fly traps that stomp around on root-like legs.

Plus this keeps this true to the spirit of a plant!villain rather than just a plant-themed overlord of an inhuman army or someone who treats plants like Legos.

Keep in mind that Planter's /power/ doesn't give them the ability to modify plants. That doesn't stop them from modifying them the way that plants can already be modified. Such as the way powerless humans have been doing so for millennia.
