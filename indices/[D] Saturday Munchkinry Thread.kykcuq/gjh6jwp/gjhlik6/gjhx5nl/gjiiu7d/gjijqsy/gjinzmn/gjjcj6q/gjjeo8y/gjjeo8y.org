Thank you for the thorough and researched responses.

Hopefully decisive action is taken on a large scale very soon. I can't help but feel relatively unsure and powerless about the situation while also probably going to be around for the next decades to see exactly what the consequences will be. I'd say we've gone beyond the point where the average person recycling or reducing their consumption will fix much.
