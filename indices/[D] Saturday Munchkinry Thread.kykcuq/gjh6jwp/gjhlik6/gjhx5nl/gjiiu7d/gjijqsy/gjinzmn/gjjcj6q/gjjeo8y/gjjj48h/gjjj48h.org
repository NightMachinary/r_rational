Yeah, frankly we've been there for twenty years now. Recycling is only useful for a moderate fraction of what we throw into the recycling bins (about a third), and most of the carbon emission is power plants and vehicles. Electrification and grid-decarbonization are the key to a sustainable future; electrification because internal combustion engines are hard-limited to a relatively low efficiency (so even if you're burning oil at a power plant to turn into electricity for electric cars you still come out ahead) and grid-decarbonization with solar/nuclear/wind/tidal/hydro/geothermal (which functionally is mostly solar, a little wind, and goddamnit we should be building more nuclear power plants) for obvious reasons.

This is all policy, not behavior. In the USA, things like "give the same interest rates to new solar construction as to new fossil fuel construction" and "stop arbitrarily legislating against electric cars" are what needs to happen, and sometimes, we get opportunities to fight for them or demand them directly.

We're not powerless. We're just only powerful through very specific vectors: ballot measures, the ballot box, political organizing, and political action. Want a book to read? I recommend "No Shortcuts: Organizing for Power in the New Gilded Age" by Jane McAlevey.

/gets off soapbox/ Uh, sorry for the tangent.
