Keep in mind that Planter's goal is to exterminate humanity completely, killing /most/ humans wouldn't be much of an accomplishment. If Planter was dead and there happened to be enough people in remote bomb shelters to perpetuate the human species, that'd be mission failure.

Plus a nuclear exchange large enough to kill most people would be devastating to the Earth's biome as a whole, killing a lot of animals and plants in its wake. It probably wouldn't end all life forever, but it'd be a mass extinction much worse than anything humans have done so far.

On top of that people wouldn't be blind to the fact that Planter ages and is otherwise a mortal being, not to mention being suspicious of where their power comes from and what their intentions are. In fact, acting too openly runs the risk of Planter getting exploited by less-than-benevolent governments or private entities who would want to use their power for profit, or at least stop them from disrupting the status quo. People have been imprisoned and tortured on far lesser provocations.

However, assuming we go the route of agriculture, Planter could boost the world's food supply by selectively breeding existing crops 36,000 times faster and then spreading the resulting cultivars. Except Planter isn't benevolent and it'd be difficult to selectively breed crops to be malevolent without being detected. Many people are skeptical of GMOs, imagine how skeptical they'd be of plant powers.
