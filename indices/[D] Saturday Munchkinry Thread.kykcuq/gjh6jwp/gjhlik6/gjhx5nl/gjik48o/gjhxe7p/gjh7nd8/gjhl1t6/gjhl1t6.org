You may be able to go for the long con: act benevolent, use your power to mass produce food to solve world hunger. With the new massive food supply, the world population will surge.

And then many years later, you die from old age, and the world loses its massive food supply. Food prices skyrocket, people starve everywhere, tensions rise and countries fight a nuclear war to end all wars over food, ending humanity.

Sadly I don't think villain!Planter's powers are actually strong enough to generate that much food. 36000 * 180^3 * pi * 4/3 = roughly 879,444,881,075 times as much food generated by planter compared to the mundane generation of 1 cubic meter.

Some googling reveals that the world has 1.5 billion hectares of farmland. 1 hectare = 10000 m^2, so if we assume farm plants are roughly a meter in height, that's 10000m^3 per hectare, so 15 trillion cubic meters of farming, which is much much bigger than the ~900 billion cubic meters of villain!Planter. :(
