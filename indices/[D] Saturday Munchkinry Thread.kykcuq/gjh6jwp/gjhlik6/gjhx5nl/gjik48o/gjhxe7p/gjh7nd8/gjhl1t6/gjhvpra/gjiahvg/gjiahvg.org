One thing a lot of the above has missed is the fact that you can get animals to help too, by creating an ecology that favors them. Tsetse flies making life hell in parts of Africa are supported by the plant life that gives them shelter. I don't know how many other plant/animal/disease combination there are, but just walking along creating the right plants could introduce horrid amounts of disease in the right places.
