Okay, so this was really difficult to munchkin, but I think I potentially have some ideas. The problem is that Planter's personality and motivations means that his effective reach is very low - by the time he uses some method to create a problem in one portion of the earth, the previous problem is solved, the people are more prepared - the task is just very big. So he needs a way to kill large numbers of people very very quickly, and then can use his plant sense to find stragglers. Nuclear war would be ideal, but planter doesn't seem like the kind of guy who could become president. So, some ideas:

- Sell drugs. Planter dislikes humans? Drugs are a way to potentially make a lot of humans very miserable. Interaction would be necessary, but it would give him a lot more financial reach. This wouldn't be how he'd wipe out humanity, but it would cause problems, is a source of income for other projects, and he only needs to be there to grow the stuff - he can sellers, unaware of his true motivations, to do the business side of things. I'm not an expert on the drug trade, but I can only presume that if real people can sell opium, Planter can do it much more easily. And hey, a sphere of diameter 360m is pretty big.

- Bamboo, under Planter's influence, grows at 40cm per second. That's the fastest growing plant I can think of, but at the very least having a huge mass of bamboo grow incredibly quickly should be able to disrupt /some/ important industries.

- In an ideal world, Planter would be able to wreck farmland at a massive speed by growing weeds faster than they can be dealt with, causing famine in some amounts. Unfortunately, his combination of speed and area affected isn't fast/large enough to do this. He could, if he so wished, massively fuck up some town's year, though. Perhaps if he started with small, isolated places?

- The big one - harmful algal blooms. Visit reservoirs, scatter some colony seeds, and create a runaway problem. Even better if there already is some source of phosphates, and you just accelerate the problem. Get rid of enough sources of fresh water for humans and you could cause mass dyings. This isn't enough to destroy humanity, but at the very least if you're smart and lucky you may be able to break down some level of infrastructure, which is step one.

- Use your omni-present nature to get some dirt on high ranking political figures and blackmail them. Of course, this requires some levels of resources, social interaction, and reputation, but the reward is worth it. And hey, the social interaction is both minimal and hostile, so that's a plus. And resources can come from your drug trade!

- ... Ask people for help? I think there's a bunch of people who are invested in massively fucking up large groups of people/everyone. Just... use your money to put them in a better position to do so. It'll take time, some unavoidable amounts of human interaction, but in the end it'll be necessary just to increase your reach. Being a living world surveillance system is good and all, but if you can't actually have a far-reaching, long-lasting impact, then total annihilation is extremely difficult.

You could also ask for ideas on how to destroy the world using your powers on forums like this one, which would allow you to let others do this sort of thinking for you- Wait.

Shit.
