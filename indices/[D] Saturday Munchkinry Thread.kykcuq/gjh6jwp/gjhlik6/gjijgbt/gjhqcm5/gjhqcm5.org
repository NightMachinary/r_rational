  In an ideal world, Planter would be able to wreck farmland at a massive speed by growing weeds faster than they can be dealt with, causing famine in some amounts. Unfortunately, his combination of speed and area affected isn't fast/large enough to do this. He could, if he so wished, massively fuck up some town's year, though. Perhaps if he started with small, isolated places?

There are private storage units where there are massive amounts of seeds. They're intended to be distributed to a multitude of farms for next year's harvest. Planter is well suited to finding them and with some time and creativity could meddle with them to cause large amounts of damage and confusion.

It's also worth noting that you can cause millions of dollars of damage, effectively ruining a golf course or other compulsively groomed, manmade environment just by planting a few wildflowers. Planter could do a lot more than that. There's also the potential in invasive species of plants, or aiding invasive species of animals, or just messing with natural animal populations in general.

  Use your omni-present nature to get some dirt on high ranking political figures and blackmail them. Of course, this requires some levels of resources, social interaction, and reputation, but the reward is worth it. And hey, the social interaction is both minimal and hostile, so that's a plus. And resources can come from your drug trade!

The problem with this is that plants don't have senses that could pick up human communication. Planter is only tapped in to what they can naturally sense, like if something is damaging their body, where the sun or other source of light is, and some degree of ability to sense chemicals. Aside from a basic sense of light, they're blind, and they're not sensitive enough to the vibrations of human speech.

Otherwise your analysis is solid.

Planter would probably need to be careful along the way since the drug trade has a lot of intelligent, established, and even less sane people involved. Keep in mind that dealing in poppy seeds and their products alone includes corrupt politicians and military personnel around the globe. There's a lot of ways Planter could end up murdered or worse, even assuming they play it safe.

Walter White must have had a top-of-the-line guardian angel to get as far as he did as an outsider to the drug trade, and Planter is way beyond being in the empire business.
