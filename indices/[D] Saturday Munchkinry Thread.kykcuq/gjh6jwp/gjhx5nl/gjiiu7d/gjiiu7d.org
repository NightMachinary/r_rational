How quickly could this theoretical death-algae choke the atmosphere?

Humans are by far the most likely macrofauna to notice abrupt, unexplained changes in the planet and take emergency actions in response. I'm guessing most people would die, but a minority of people could be saved before the species is exterminated completely and hopefully find a way to persevere.

That could make for an interesting reverse Munchkin. Someone else mentioned that Planter could also contaminate water supplies in a similar way.
