There are a whole lot of ways this can happen! It's not alarmism; it's not, like, an unremarkable thing to say, but it's well within the scientific consensus as a strong possibility.

Rule of thumb: right now 25% of our yearly carbon output is sequestered by plankton, very approximately. (Source: NASA and vague Googling just now.) A die-off (whether orchestrated by a supervillain named Planter or a supervillain named Murdoch) means not just no more sequestration but also whatever outgassing/decay happens to release. Per a random PNAS paper I read the abstract to, marine biolife is in the ~6 Gt of carbon range, and if the sea plants die, it all dies, but that's just ~one year's worth of lost sequestration at worst. (This says a lot about how much plankton do for CO2 scrubbing. Their cycle time is ridiculous.)
