Based on something that I'm sure doesn't actually happen to me, but definitely feels like it does.

Whenever you accidentally drop an object weighing 10 grams or less and measuring 15 centimeters or less on the longest dimension, there is a 1% chance that it permanently vanishes, essentially becoming dark matter--conservation of mass is preserved, but it can't be seen or physically interacted with besides observing its gravitational pull. This will not happen if you intentionally drop the object, or if you pick it up with the purpose of eventually losing it through habitual handling & eventual accidental fumbling.

I probably won't use any suggested munchkinry because IRL this is just me being clumsy & bad at finding things, but in a world where it functions as above I'm curious if there's any way to make it useful.
