Well, the typical work-around for intention-based restrictions is to get someone else to do it. Get a business partner to act while you are sleeping: placing items into your hands and then pulling open your fingers so you "accidentally" drop the items, letting them vanish.

Ideally, you could do so using nuclear waste, but that doesn't seem likely to fit in under 10 grams and 15 cm^3. So the question becomes: what is small and light and needs to vanish from the face of the earth?

.... can't think of anything that wouldn't kill you to hold... Hmm...
