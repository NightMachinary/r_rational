god, I have this power too.

The other day I wanted to change my tongue stud so I removed a ball from my new one and proceeded to drop it. On my hands and knees, looking around as thoroughly as I possibly could. Couldn't find it. Get the vacuum cleaner, vaccuum, go through the bag, nothing.

Finally as I'm doing one last pass with my phone's torch I realise that there's a gap between my wall and the floor and look there: sure enough the little ball managed to roll into that gap!!!! I gently levered it out with a skewer.

Then I went to take it to the sink to give it a wash (obviously) and I dropped it /again/. Fortunately I found it but you'd THINK I'd have put it in a napkin or a small bowl or /something/ so I couldn't just drop the damn thing.

I then went to the piercing shop to get my tongue ring changed over as I did not want to drop any of the components (doesn't help that I have long fake nails that make fine motor control difficult).

I'm not exactly sure why I have typed this out and it doesn't answer your question, but rest assured I see you and there are more of us out there.
