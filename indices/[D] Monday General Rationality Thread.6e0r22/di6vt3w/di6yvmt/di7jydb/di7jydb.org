What does it mean that I already knew this and used to it give both myself and others hope for the future after the election, only to end up in the situation I am now. I used to be able to love the people I hated because I loved humanity in all our flaws, but now I don't know if I can do that anymore. I don't want to believe that past me was naive, I despise my newfound cynicism and the fact that I'm not sticking to the philosophy I chose to follow in spite of it.
