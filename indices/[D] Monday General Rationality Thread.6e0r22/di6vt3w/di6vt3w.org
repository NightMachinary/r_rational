I am depressed about politics again and hate how much hatred I have allowed myself to feel towards my political opponents. It's not even Trump that gets to me anymore, it's the fact that his supporters and allies continuously fail to question his competence or admit his failures. The White House didn't even deny the $2 trillion accounting error in the budget proposal and people are still backing it.

I hate this so much that I worry that I may become a hypocrite towards my belief that all humans deserve equal rights and all suffering should be prevented. I care less and less about these people who proudly choose to follow a path that will harm themselves and others, so I'm worried that I wouldn't be willing to aid someone or prevent them from suffering purely because they disagree with my political views.

I don't want to be that kind of person. I used to identify as a centrist because I was worried about bias from both parties, but now I fear one party so much that I'm allowing myself to feel bias against anyone who voted differently from me and doesn't regret it. I want to be the kind of person who's better than that, someone who feels compassion towards everyone and does not compromise their views.

This is kind of an alien idea for me since I've always hated stories about revenge. I don't feel catharsis from seeing evil people get punished, just stopped from inflicting more harm. Except...part of me would be okay if the people I hate suffer and I'm not adamantly rejecting these thoughts as strongly as I used to. I just know on a detached intellectual level that such a course of action won't make me happy and won't make the situation better.
