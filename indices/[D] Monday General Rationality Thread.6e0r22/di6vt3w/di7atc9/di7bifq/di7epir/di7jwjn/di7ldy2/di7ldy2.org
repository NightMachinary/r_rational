The ACA is merely ok. It's what you get when you let the insurance companies write healthcare legislation. It has, though, gotten millions more people insured than what we had before. So that's good.

I would also like to point out that 500 billion is one fourth of 2 trillion, and this from the party that claims to be about fiscal responsibility (except that claim is a lie as national debt has risen far more under every modern Republican presidency than under Democratic ones, on average).

And I object to being called genocidal. I have no desire for violence, and while I might fantasize about a world with no Republicans, I know that isn't happening.
