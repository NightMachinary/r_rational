  you should ask them what 1+1 is.

Given their praise of a budget proposal with an estimated $2 trillion shortfall, I can confidently claim that their faith in alternative math is unshakeable. They might tell you that 1+1=2, but you can't trust them on that because they do not act as if that were true.

And here's the thing: even if there weren't a current event which calls their belief in math into question, I could call you out here on, ironically enough, cherry picking. Given the truly vast array of indisputable facts which they are unashamedly wrong about, you have to dig deep to find one where they completely agree with reality. The reason I made the claim that they are totally wrong about everything is that I have failed to find a counterexample.
