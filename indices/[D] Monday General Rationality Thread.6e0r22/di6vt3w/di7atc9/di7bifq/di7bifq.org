  These people are objectively wrong about every single thing they believe

That is impressive. You should ask them what 1+1 is. If they don't answer 2, I'll concede to you on this point.

  It is a sad fact about our world that sometimes you are forced to behead all of the blood purists. That no matter your convictions, evil people must be prevented from ever holding a shred of power, no matter the cost in misery or broken faith.

The problem is that that is the exact logic that leads people to do evil things (like kill all the horrible Jews who are oppressing the Germans, or kill all the horrible kulaks, and so on). Just because you feel very confident that someone is evil doesn't mean you're right and doesn't mean you can't become more evil than them.
