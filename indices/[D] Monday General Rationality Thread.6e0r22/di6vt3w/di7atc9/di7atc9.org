I've been through this myself, and I've decided that recognizing that I hate these people (and more so, that hatred is the only emotion appropriate to feel for monsters of great magnitude) is not a moral failing of myself, but simply accepting a fact. I tried very hard not to hate them, to make excuses, to see whatever shreds of worth they might have, but ultimately I failed.

These people are objectively wrong about every single thing they believe. There isn't a single position they hold where they can be said to be morally or factually correct. All of their ideas tend towards maximizing human suffering. My realization is that I should not hate myself for believing that.

At first, this felt horrible. Like I had compromised something precious that I could not get back. But that didn't change the fact that I hate these people. I can recognize this fact about myself, accept it, and move on.

It is a sad fact about our world that sometimes you are forced to behead all of the blood purists. That no matter your convictions, evil people must be prevented from ever holding a shred of power, no matter the cost in misery or broken faith.

Don't beat yourself up about this. It doesn't make you a horrible person if you hate horrible people. It just makes you a human.
