Well it would be difficult especially because people would fall to the coordination problem of voting to a new party that doesn't seem like it's going to win so people see voting the third party as letting the opposing mainstream party win, and people seem to prefer to be divided in two opposing big tribes rather than more. But it is possible, for example here in Spain it happened ,two new parties where created , in the end they took some bad decisions and they weren't able to pact which each other and we ended up whith the same government as before but they actually won in some regions and in the capital. Maybe the situation in EEUU is different, maybe not but unless people try nothing is going to change , half the country already decided they wanted to change things and voted to trump that will change things to worsen them( and the intention is not what counts in this case) , for example climate change , now the other half of the country has to stop complaining and find ways to actually change things for better and convincing the other half to also do so ,and maybe a lot of them would keep voting trump but at least some of them only voted trump as a way to vote notHilary so they can be convinced for the next elections to vote a new candidate try to repair all the damage that trump will cause .Also before new elections come there are things that can be done , Elon Musk keeps trying to convince trump to do something for the environment , and maybe he won't change anything but he has more possibilities of doing so than any of the people that decided that they didnt want to have anything to do whith trump.
