Starting to see where Eliezer's opinion on politics as the mind-killer comes from.

Everyone is talking in circles about their hatred for the current US government - yet no one seems to be discussing how to actually fix things.

There really are only two opinions:

1. It's impossible to fix.
2. It isn't.

If you earnestly believe (1) then why bother bringing it up? It'd be like ranting about gravity.

If you believe (2) then you should be discussing how to attack the problem. Ranting about it just wastes time at best and helps the target of your hatred at worst - I suspect Trump's victory is in part because of the brand recognition received by people mocking him.

Alternatively if you're not going to attempt to fix the problem, then this must be for the sake of catharsis. If that's the case, you're going about this the wrong way.

News spreads because it seems important and controversial in the moment. But that gives you a method for dealing with it, just step back and assess how important it really is. You wont feel so hot blooded if you wait a month before peeking at the shenanigans of government.

Sorry if this has been overly confrontational, but we're supposed to a community of aspiring rationalists.

In other news my GP has prescribed me antidepressants - specifically escitalopram. Anyone got any on the ground experience they could offer?
