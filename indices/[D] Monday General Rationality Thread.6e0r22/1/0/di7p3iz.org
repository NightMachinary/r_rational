I think a lot of people feel that they're incapable of influencing large-scale politics and so just take a back seat. Not exactly the best approach but I can understand it.

I don't know about those specific antidepressants, but I do have unwanted advice in general about them. The biggest thing that I see incredibly smart people fall for is the idea that now that they feel better, they don't need the medicine anymore. I think it's better to look at it as something that improves your life in a positive way, and something that you should get used to having for the rest of your life, even with the common stigmas people have about mental ilnesses and medicine.

Completely unwarranted advice but I just felt compelled to say that after seeing it happen so often. Hope that the medicine works well for you, depression is a bitch.
