I second the importance of continuing the medication, but it's worth noting that it is sometimes (often?) possible to reduce and eventually discontinue the dosage.

The crucial thing is that you follow medical advice (i.e. ask your doctor before altering your dosage), and that you carefully monitor yourself for signs of depression or suicidal ideation until you're stable (for at least a month after you've ceased intake, preferably 6 months), and to inform your psychiatrist/GP if

I'm not on escitalopram, so I don't have any specific advice. In a general sense, depression medication is at least partially a stop-gap measure. Whether you're experiencing suicidal thoughts or not, depression impinges on your ability to live your life. This is, obviously, a bad thing. Medication may not cure you in the short term, but it should allow you to regain more ability to function.

This is an important concept. The thing that will ultimately cure your depression is you, whether it's through lifestyle change, cognitive behavioural therapy, or even continued use of medication. Medication is what allows you to get to that point.

There may be side effects, and that's one reason why the end goal is usually to discontinue the medication if it's safe to do so. Make sure you know what side effects escitalopram can cause, and notify your doctor if more serious ones occur.

It's like any other prescription, really. If you had epilepsy, would you stop taking the medication that helped control it just because you hadn't had a seizure in a while? Hopefully not, but you might be able to stop it if your doctor agreed that a non-medication treatment plan would be sufficient (and, it bears repeating, you'd monitor your health and tell them if you relapsed).

*TL;DR:* Depression is an actual illness that needs to be treated. Medication is often a key component of that treatment, either temporarily or indefinitely. Don't ignore the treatment plan just because your disease is neurological.
