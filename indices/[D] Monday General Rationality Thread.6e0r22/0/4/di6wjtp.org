  I hate this so much that I worry that I may become a hypocrite towards my belief that all humans deserve equal rights and all suffering should be prevented.

we all have limited time and energy, and that cuts us off from some possibilities, especially when there are people actively working against us, including the recently elected political regime. there is nothing wrong with pushing that suffering onto the people causing it in the first place in order to help the people they would try to hurt, even if the only reason to do so is so that you have more to help others with. it is a difficult decision to make, but it is the rational thing to do.
