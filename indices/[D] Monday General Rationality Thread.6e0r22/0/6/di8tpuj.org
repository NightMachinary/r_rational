  It's not even Trump that gets to me anymore, it's the fact that his supporters and allies continuously fail to question his competence or admit his failures.

If it helps, I've more or less resigned myself to the fact that Trump may be approximately as incompetent as his opponents claim. As far as I'm concerned, he's still a categorically superior choice to the alternative we were presented with, and he's already demonstrated his value as a vehicle to drive more people to ethno-nationalist and dominionist movements. Even all else being the same, his rise coincided with tons of people becoming woke on the JQ, the thots, race realism, etc. We won't be lied to by the international cliques and the rootless cosmopolitans any more, and as long as Trump's in power we have a reasonable chance of keeping our 1st and 2nd amendment rights to transform beliefs into actions.

  I hate this so much that I worry that I may become a hypocrite towards my belief that all humans deserve equal rights and all suffering should be prevented. I care less and less about these people who proudly choose to follow a path that will harm themselves and others, so I'm worried that I wouldn't be willing to aid someone or prevent them from suffering purely because they disagree with my political views.

Congratulations, the rest of us got there long ago. Your enemies don't deserve compassion, they deserve defeat and suffering. I thought this was a universal human emotion, but somehow, of course you people managed to suppress that just like you try to suppress everything sane, natural, productive and beautiful.
