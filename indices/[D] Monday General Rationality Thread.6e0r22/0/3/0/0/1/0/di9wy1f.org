  Climate change /remains/ life and death.

I remain in full agreement with this stance. And further; it is /important/ for the American political establishment to take climate change seriously.

It seems that Trump is not taking climate change seriously. The next question, then, is obvious; had his opponent been elected instead, then would said opponent have taken climate change seriously?

From your previous post, it seems that the answer to this question is 'yes'. Which leads to the following question; do the people who voted for Trump agree with you on this?

A man who thinks that neither Trump nor his opponent will do anything good on the climate change front will not consider this matter when deciding where to vote; in his mind, he's deciding on a dead heat, and must pay attention to other factor instead.

(Mind you, you Americans /do/ need to deal with the climate change problem properly. Have you considered organising a protest march to the White House, or as close as the public is permitted?)
