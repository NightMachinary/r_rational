  I fear one party so much that I'm allowing myself to feel bias against anyone who voted differently from me and doesn't regret it.

Understandable. But consider - there are sane viewpoints that agree with /everything/ that you think about Trump and /still/ would defend a vote for him.

The simplest and most straightforward of these viewpoints is the idea that Trump is not significantly worse than any other politician - he is merely worse at hiding his transgressions. This point of view relies on the idea that /any/ President would be as bad, but at least with this one everyone can /see/ how bad he is and work on mitigating the problems.

The second possible viewpoint is the single-issue voter - a person who thinks that one single issue is /so important/ that Trump's support for it (and his opponent's lack of support for it) is so incredibly vital that it outweighs all of his problems.

Mind you, I'm not saying that either of these are necessarily in any way right. I am simply presenting these as positions that sane people can hold.

(Personally, as someone who doesn't live in America, I have no say in your voting; but I think your entire electoral system is broken and needs some serious revision).
