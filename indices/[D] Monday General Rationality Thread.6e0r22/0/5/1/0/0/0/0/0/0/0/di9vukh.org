My concern with emboldened fascists in our country is not with violence being committed now, but with the normalization of fascist rhetoric. The last time fascism was normalized in an industrial nation 60,000,000 people died, and it is simply not worth taking risks around that kind of proven threat.

I don't know how we de-normalize this scrap. My ultimate goal is to make everyone who believes it slink back into the darkness in shame, but the box has been opened and we have major news outlets giving time to people who openly advocate violence upon innocents. The last time this started happening, war became the only way out.

I don't want them to die (most of the time. I do get irrationally angry about this stuff sometimes). I just don't see how we stop them before it gets to that point.

Moving on, I also work in healthcare and there are several obvious solutions to the innovation problem which you don't appear to have considered. For instance, we could massively increase funding to NIH, taking the burden of funding preliminary research entirely off Pharma's shoulders. We could give stupidly generous tax benefits to any company which spends some large percentage of revenue on medical research. Sure, things would almost certainly be worse for Pharma, but "collapse the pharmaceutical industry" is alarmism. There are better options available than allowing millions of Americans to have no access to lifesaving preventative care.
