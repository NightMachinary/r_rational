Yeah...yeah it does.

I'm just so angry about this. I won't call it irrational anger, because it is rational to be angry at existential threats to human civilization (referring to climate change denial here), but I am /extremely/ angry. And I do, at this point, believe that if there were a button I could press to instantly de-Nazify all neonazis and their ilk I would press that button in an instant, no matter the cost to myself and no matter anyone else's qualms about mind control.

I know being this angry isn't terribly helpful to me, but I've been angry at one thing or another for practically my entire life. I don't exactly know why that is, but it's true.

I've just decided that recognizing my anger, rather than trying to hide it or pretend it's something else, is better for me. I am /enraged/ by the concept of climate denial. It makes me incredibly angry when someone tries to spew blatantly false apologetics for healthcare in this country. It would be rhetorically accurate to say that I am racist against racists. I don't know how I can change any of these things about myself, and considering that all of those are due to my wish to protect all of humanity from death and misery, I am unsure that I should.

Thinking on it, I think it /would/ be easy for me to have been a racist scumbag in a world where I was raised by some. Instead I was raised by the good kind of clergy: those who preach about justice and mercy and actually attempt to walk that walk most of the time. As a result, the people I cannot tolerate are the people who don't try to do that. I think it's better this way.
