You're right that intervention/isolationism is often an independent issue, but in modern US politics it's a somewhat separate issue from the use of military power and foreign relations. Liberal voters tend to be less hawkish, and while many conservatives talk about how the US is spending too much time/effort caring about other countries, which is a part of isolationism, they're also often the first ones who support overt military action to resolve conflicts.

See for example the recent wild beating of the war drums against Iran during Obama's presidency. I believe Rand Paul is the only well known Republican who speaks loudly and consistently for isolationism, and that's because he's mostly a libertarian.
