Foreign policy maybe? We really need to stop using our military in stupid/neocolonial ways, and considering that terrorism is not a real threat I don't think we should be doing much in the way of drone attacks in countries which don't contain ISIS. ISIS is just so completely evil that I'm more fine with expending resources to help whittle away at them, but no other group is a credible threat to us right now and nobody seems to be paying attention to that fact.
