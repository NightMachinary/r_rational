I agree with the spirit of what you're trying to say, but I think you're taking it to an extreme. It's okay to acknowledge that political opponents are wrong, that their desired outcomes will be a net negative, that their values are harmful to your values. It's incorrect to say that they're literally wrong about every single thing.

Out of curiosity, do you believe they are the way they are because of their upbringing, or because of biological factors inherent to them?
