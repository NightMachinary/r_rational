My partner is on a high dose of escitalopram. Like most SSRIs, it is very likely to interfere with your bedroom function (the equipment still works OK, but getting to completion is an issue).

In terms of doing "what it's meant to", he seems pretty happy with it. He's gained a lot of weight since he was on it though, and sleeps almost all day (he's got a script for modafinil that he takes daily, and he will still regularly sleep 2-6 hours during the day). He also has sleep apnoea which can't help.

But he's on a big dosage (40mg/day) so you may not have such a hard time with it depending on how much you're getting. Another friend's on it and they only take 10mg a day. Partner has severe OCD so he needs a higher dose than someone with depression does.
