My takeaway from other comments is that controlling your distance from other people is key.

You'd be basically unable to live a normal life, since I'd assume all in-person interviews and transactions would fail.

It seems to me that if you could foster enough trust with an accomplice online, it would be easy to scam people. Just have your accomplice feed them the scam, then walk up and tell them it's a scam and your accomplice cannot be trusted. Since you yourself will not be trusted, people will be likely to take your accomplice at their word. Just make sure you stay physically separated from your accomplice or you'll need a new one.
