Its totally a thing casinos do. If they think you are cheating even if they have no clue how they kick you out. Hell, if you are winning too much money even if they know you aren't cheating (notably card counting) they kick you out anways.

Now obviously if you can prove it being actually discriminatory instead of it being about them losing money then you can sue, but unless the person who kicks you out explicitly says so it isn't going to be a suit you would ever win.

E: I also feel the need to point out that (in America at least) businesses can arbitrarily kick you out without even needing a reason. Obviously if the reason is Rasism/Sexism its illegal, but unless you can prove it is discrimination there isn't really anything you can do.
