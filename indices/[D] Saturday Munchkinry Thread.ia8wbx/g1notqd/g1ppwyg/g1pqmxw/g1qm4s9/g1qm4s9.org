It depends on whether, for top tier athletes, the filter is execution, adaptation (perfectly replicating an archery shot can still fail if the wind condition is different; perfectly replicating a fencing move is useless), or physical ability (ultimately limited by genes & willpower, neither of which you necessarily have). Varies from sport to sport.
