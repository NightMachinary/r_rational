Your power let's you cheat all three of these categories to an extent. The biggest general hack is the time savings: you have so much more comparative time to work on everything than your competition without technique practice.

Execution: Your execution is perfect every time if you're physically able.

Adaptation: Others are thinking about both what to do and how to do it, you only need to think about half of that. Other archers are guessing the wind AND how to adapt to it, you're still guessing the wind but then you recall the perfect shot for those exact conditions. It's not useless for fencing, you do have to recognize the situation fast but the response needed is still technical. You can also copy the world's fastest moves, even for initial lunges or flicks this would be devastating. You can also totally change your style without technique cost.

Physical ability: Current world class athletes are genetically and mentally gifted enough to get better results than everyone else while doing essentially the same thing everyone else is. You don't need to do the same as everyone else, so you don't need the same mental or physical advantages that benefit that schedule. You don't need the same talent if you can spend more time on it and do it differently. You can also hack these in execution: you have perfectly efficient form unless you flat out quit, there's not a gradual technique breakdown due to willpower/focus issues like everyone else.
