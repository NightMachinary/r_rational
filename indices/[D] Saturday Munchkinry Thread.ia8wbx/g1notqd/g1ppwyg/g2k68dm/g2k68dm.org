Lot of variance in how good it would be for sports, but in general if you're not already an excellent athlete it's probably not

Pretty bad for baseball, for example, since even a perfectly placed pitch isn't gonna do that much without the muscle and leverage (pitchers usually tall with long arms) to make it fast, and replicating movements wouldn't help your batting much.

Almost completely useless in football, so much of being an NFL-level QB is decision making and reading the field, and again arm strength is still a huge issue.

Basketball it would have potential. Forget never missing a free throw, an average person has plenty of strength to make a half-court shot. Still wouldn't be amazing though, since the other team could lock you off on offense and you'd be a huge liability on defense. You'd be good enough for the NBA, but not a superstar.

Soccer lack of speed on the field and power on shots would be an issue, though being perfect on set peices (like corner kicks) might be worth it in such a low-scoring sport. Again, you'd be able to play, but wouldn't dominate.

Golf your main issue would be be wind/grass conditions. Would likely have the most potential if you could learn to adjust for them though.
