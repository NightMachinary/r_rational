Can you copy a /recording of yourself/? Perfect repeatability, trying something thousands of times and succeeding by luck, then reviewing the footage and being able to recreate that 100% of the time, then iterate this, and build several of these independently made movements together as modules, is far more powerful than just having the same skill level as others.

Also, "to the millimeter" is actually a really bad resolution for this. Many movement that /most/ humans can make have far greater precision than that, and would fail if only done with that precision.
