In that case, my iterated method would work great, and once you start getting exploitable skills you should definitely invest in a high end motion capture setup, slow motion cameras, and a hemisphere around it all covered densely in normal cameras.

Skills to use this with are primarily extremely fast small hand movements, that require extremely little energy and thus cause no strain to do all day and night; one of the biggest advantages of perfectly repeating something as a human is not doing it the first time, or the first 8 hours, it's being able to force yourself to do it flawlessly even given extreme fatigue and your brain having almost completely shut down, when a normal human would be shaking violently and unable to even stand up. If you set up a long chain, you might even be able to keep your body doing work while your brain is 100% asleep, and still wake up rested.

To be more specific, sketching and drawing with pencils or a computer tablet is the first thing I'd try; while there is obviously a lot of mental skill and creativity, and some dependence on style, motor learning is also many years, especially of photorealistic styles. And you're not limited to copying stuff other have drawn; you dont copy a whole drawing, you copy drawing a single line that doesn't look like anything on it's own, and then layer lots of them. At the very least you can translate and rotate them by moving the paper on the desk, and most likely once you've learned lots you might be able to interpolate between them. I expect you might become especially known for drawing fractals.

Exactly HOW fast and precise you can become depends on how exactly the power works; Does the signal need to go all the way from the brain? Does it generate at the end of the nerve into the muscle? Directly trigger the myosin proteins inside each muscle fibre? The muscles and bones of the human body can handle a faster oscillations and higher precision than the brain can conceive or the nerves have the bandwidth to convey.
