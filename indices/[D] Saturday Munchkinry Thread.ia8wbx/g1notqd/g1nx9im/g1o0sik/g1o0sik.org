The precision depends on how long the action was seen for, and the resolution of the action. Basically the more uncertain the action is the less precision you get.

If you're just seeing someone's back as they're standing, you'll be able to perfectly recreate that pose /as seen from the back/. However, there will be significant uncertainty on what the front of the body is doing (like facial expressions, eye movements, etc.). However, if you see multiple angles of a karate kick from close up and encompassing the whole body, you'll be able to recreate it to the millimeter. The more angles and time you see it for the more precise it gets. The action automatically gets adjusted for your body proportions and level of fitness, so you may be able to perfectly recreate the moves of a 1000lb deadlift, but you won't physically be able to do a 1000lb deadlift. You also keep your own fingerprints and other unique identifiers. So you'll be able to leave the fingerprint within a millimeter or less of where the other person put it, but it'll still be your fingerprint.
