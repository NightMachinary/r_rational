Password theft.

See someone entering a password anywhere? You can recreate their password entry perfectly.

I assume this works even if you don't see their fingers, just their back.

Actually I wonder what the precision on this ability is. Say you see someone leave a fingerprint on something. Could you perfectly recreate that action and leave the exact same fingerprint? Because that action IS physically possible for a human being, just not for you.
