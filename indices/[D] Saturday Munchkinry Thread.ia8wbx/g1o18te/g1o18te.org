I posed this on the Discord a week or so ago but I just saw this thread pop up in my feed and figured I could give it another spin.

The power is increasing or decreasing temperature, it's done by will and sight, so you look at something and it grows hotter or colder. There's fine control over temperature and the exact area of the substance affected. It's kind of like heat or frost vision, you could look at a car's tires and make them melt, or make the whole car melt. On the larger end, you could look at an Olympic-sized pool and start raising the middle of the pool to boiling, or all of the pool, or everything in the vicinity of your sight of the pool.

Maximum size is more than an Olympic sized pool, no minimum size but the person must be able to see it directly, the power would work through direct sight, so my ignorant ass assumes lens-based magnification would work and digital image reproduction of magnification would not. Please, please correct me here.

Maximum temperature would be higher than enough to melt diamonds, minimum temperature would be just above absolute zero. There's an intuitive sense of temperature but it's not precise, so if a person for example wanted to use it for a specific materials application at certain temperatures they would need help, but with the assistance of temperature measurement they could easily bump it up or down a degree.

My main question was asking how it could be used to make money (seems the standard create steam drive turbine was best) but I'm still curious about stranger ways such a power might be used or things you clever lot might come up with.
