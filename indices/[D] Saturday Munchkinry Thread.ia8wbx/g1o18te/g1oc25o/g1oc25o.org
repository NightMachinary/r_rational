Creating super low temperature is really hard and expensive. If you can get things to just above absolute zero, I think you could get a lab or get grants for low temperature research, for example studying Bose-Einstein Condensates. The Olympic sized pool area means you could create low temperature at a larger scale than any research before. The only reason this wouldn't necessarily pay better than powering turbines is that the funding setup that most Research Institutes and Grants may not be able to and/or allowed to pay you your full worth.
