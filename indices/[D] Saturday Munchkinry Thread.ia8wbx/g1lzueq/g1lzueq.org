Meta-Magic Munchkinry: Degrees Of Reasonableness. Take this magical system, and cross it over into a setting you like and munchkin that setting's magic using this magic. In Worth the Candle, there is a concept of Degrees of Reasonableness, and one of Juniper's powers is to bend them. For instance, if you have a magic spell that affects dogs, it would only take a single degree of reasonableness to make the spell also affect wolves or coyotes or dingos and 2 degrees of reasonableness to make the spell affect foxes.

We only have a few canon examples... so with apologies to Alexander Wales in advance if I give the audience bad headcanon by firming up the rules and inserting a few more examples for the purpose of this Saturday Munchkinry threads.

To give the canon examples:

- Holding an improvised weapon just so that it is "three times less likely to break" takes one degrees of reasonableness.
- "Reflection Blade provides a reflection of wounds for someone that you've cut". One degree of reasonableness is enough to increase the axes of reflection from just "between left and right, which was called the sagittal plane" to also "between top and bottom, which was called the transverse plane and between front and back, which was called the coronal plane"
- An amulet lets the user shapeshift into non-magical animals. One degree of reasonableness is enough to include humans in this definition.
- "defining the letter A as B took five degrees of reasonableness"
- "defining A as 1 would be six"
- "defining A as banana would be seven"

And to generalize some rules:

- One degree of reasonableness is enough to bend common definitions between technical and colloquial definitions. Defining a square as a rectangle or a square as not a rectangle takes only a single degree of reasonableness. Or wolves/coyotes/dingos as dogs. Or defining a tomatoes as a vegetable or a fruit.
- One degree of reasonableness is enough to stretch plausibility slightly in a way that would require a bit of luck.
- Three degrees of reasonableness is enough to stretch plausibility have highly improbable luck.
- Standard Munchkinry of Harry Potter spells requires 1-2 degrees of reasonableness.
- Two degrees of reasonableness is enough to broaden a definition by one conceptual level i.e. by dogs, the spell/magical effect means all Canidae, which includes Foxes.
- Three degrees of reasonableness is enough to stretch fuzzy limits on mass/volume/weight limitations and to bend the conceptual category as well. This is enough to make the motive name from Unsong (which turns wheels) unlock the Panama Canal.
- To increment by one requires 5 degrees of reasonableness. Example: the Bulletproof name from Unsong can now protect you from the next two bullets instead of just the next bullet.
- At seven degrees of reasonableness you can basically bend reality with even the slightest of spells. Seven degrees of reasonableness with Wingaridum Levioasa would be enough to place anything the spell hit under your complete telekinetic control with high level of acceleration/max velocity/maximum force.

Degrees of Reasonableness users is a bit of a mouthful... so let's just call them Benders. This power works on instantly on anything a Bender is doing themselves, but requires an extra degree to be applied to something someone else is doing if they are physically close to, cooperating with, and allied with the Bender.

*/So what can you do if you are a Bender with 1, 2, or 3 degrees of reasonableness in a setting of your choice?/*

*To add some rules about learning time:* after a year of study of both the relevant magic you will be applying it to, related conceptual definitions, and seeing other Benders at work this power can be acquired with 1 degree. Further practice for a year will get to 2 degrees. Another three years of practice and careful study can get you up to 3 degrees (for 6 years total to get to 3 degrees).

*Some additional modifiers:* Being directly involved in the creation/utilization process can get you an additional degree. Complicated, long rituals with lots of symbolism and setup can add another degree. Lots of Benders, working together at once can add yet another degree (to the degrees of the least skilled Bender working in the group).

So in total you can reach 6 degrees.

*And if you want to munchkin it in the real world with no other magic:*

- Two degrees is enough to increase the durability of a material in accordance with the maximum "probable durability" it would have
- Three degrees is enough to keep a perpetual motion machine in motion (with the bender's mental focus) but not output any additional energy
- 4 degrees of reasonableness and a perpetual motion machine that abuses the difference between a layman's understanding and actual physics is enough to get a perpetual motion machine that can maintain a slight positive output of energy so long as the bender stays focused on it.
- 6 degrees is enough to make that perpetual motion machine stay active and outputting energy with only initial construction and periodic maintenance from a bender.
- For shapeshifting, (one of the more straightforward applications). Two degrees is enough for a bender to make themselves subjectively (up to the level of good hypnosis) seem more like an animal to both themselves and outside observers. Three degrees is enough to cause minor physical changes. 4 degrees is enough for moderate shapeshifting into a humanoid animal, and 5 degrees enough for complete shapeshifting.
- For a boring application, 5 degrees to make two platinum bars into 3.

*Edit*: First nerf, of the example effects listed at varying degrees of reasonableness, you can't apply multiple different effects at once or the same effect to multiple different things. I.e. one degree of reasonableness bends one conceptual definition, if you want to bend another conceptual definition you will need an additional degree of reasonableness or another Bender working on the other definition separately.
