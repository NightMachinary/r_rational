Delve: there's a class called Worker that grants a 50% bonus to all non-combat skills. Most magic can be modified by several metamagics at once, the MC's specialization of auras being particularly extreme in this department. One degree of reasonableness to have the boost apply to non-combat spells' metamagic applications, three to classify metamagic skills as "non-combat." The main character's build revolves around a very fast mana regeneration rate, but even this highly specialized build can be beat by simply applying the Worker class buffs to all metamagic skills and activating Winter. It's even more dramatically better in combat.
