IMO, pun pun, Wish and the Word, and most other Total Optimization build in D&D require around 2 degrees of reasonableness to succeed.

In The Wheel of Time, the main characters (at least the Ta'Veren) have around 3-5 degrees randomly assigned to actions around them. Rand eventually gets minor control of it (and has maybe more like 6 or 7).
