Good fix. It also goes away if there's no way to stack that many six eyed effects (which is true in Worth the Candle), and mostly goes away if the scaling is superlinear (+1 at 5 degrees, +2 at 11, +3 at 18, and so on).

Also, I really like your thought experiment of using degrees of reasonableness in a different setting.

(But no proper response from me, as the only place I can really think of to apply it is D&D 3.5, and I'm not opening up that can of worms again.)
