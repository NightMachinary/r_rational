If you can stack enough six-eyed like effects to hit +5 degrees of reasonableness, you can increment how many degrees each of those effects grants you, shooting up by however many effects are in the stack. If we assume that incrementing again takes another 5 degrees of reasonableness (ie, +2 takes 10, +3 takes 15, etc), then this blows up to infinity if you can find at least five separate six-eyed like effects.
