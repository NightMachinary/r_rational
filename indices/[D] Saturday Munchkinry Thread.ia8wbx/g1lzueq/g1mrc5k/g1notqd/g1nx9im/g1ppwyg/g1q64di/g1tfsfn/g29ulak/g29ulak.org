I watch a ton of baseball. Armed with my new ability to throw any pitch anywhere in the strike zone totally perfectly, I become the greatest pitcher of all time. I'll be able to throw as fast as the strongest pitchers ever, I will never miss, and I will be able to change the way my release looks to throw off the batter at will.

I also go to the olympics and fighting world championships every chance I get in order to have amazing body control.

I observe surgeries to get footage of hearts beating healthily (and whatever other organs I can physically see working correctly) to boost my longevity.

If I want to learn a language, I watch native practitioners speak in order to gain a flawless accent.

I use my baseball money to hire two absurdly talented and expensive high-end escorts, one male and one female, and just watch them go at it for a couple hours a night for a week or two. Now I'm also really good in bed.

I watch artists and craftsmen and chefs at work just for shits and to round out my awesome skill set.
