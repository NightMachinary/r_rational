"To the millimeter" is the lowest precision you get, applied to the move the /first/ time you see something (given that you see the most significant part of the action, not someone from behind). This applies to full body moves like kicks and squats as well as more precise stuff like forging a signature. The more angles and time you view the action for the more precise it gets. I'm not gonna write a mathematical expression for the increase in precision each time you see something, but suffice it to say at the higher limit it's more precise than modern transistors.
