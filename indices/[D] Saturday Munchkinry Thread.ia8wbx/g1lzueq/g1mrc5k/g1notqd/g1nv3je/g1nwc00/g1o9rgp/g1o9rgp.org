How does the animal's age/physical health interact with your own? As [[/u/ShiranaiWakaranai]] suggests, the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydra_(genus][Hydra Jellyfish]]) is an obvious choice for the immortality. If you can change back and forth quickly and at will, and reflect the Hydra's physical condition onto your own, then you can periodically deage yourself with the Hydra's regeneration. There might be some quirks with the way Hydra's regeneration works and the characteristics of the species. For one, regeneration from maiming occurs without cell division, the cells reorganize themselves. In the case of switching back and forth, this means if you use the transformation to regenerate a leg, you might lose size/mass from elsewhere in your body. In addition, the Hydra never progresses beyond the Polyp phase, unlike other organisms in it's class, which might mean that you revert into a child form when using the transformation to reset your human body?

Alternatively, if the animal's form is always the same and completely independent of your own... the obvious choice is human. Transform into your new human form and use that most of the time, only periodically transforming back to your original human body when you need to reset the age/health of your transformed human body.
