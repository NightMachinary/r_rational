Huh.

I must admit I am not familiar with the legalities, but it seems a bit odd that a store of any kind could just point to an arbitrary customer and say "Your face is ugly! Get out!" and kick them out without any consequences. I mean, if the customer is just loitering around instead of buying anything, or breaking the rules/laws somehow, sure. But otherwise, it seems kind of discriminatory.

What if you livestream yourself? Since your power is proximity based, viewers won't be affected by it. Then they can all see you get thrown out of the casino for no good reason.
