You would probably also make your clients and your co-workers paranoid, so I wouldn't suppose that to work well. Even with a great reputation, your client will expect you to be a mafia goon trying to lock them up for every crime they didn't commit, and it would even fit to the weird reputation (assuming bribes or intimidation could be a convincing rationalization for this phenomenon, for example)
