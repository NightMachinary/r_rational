Bending social skills could be nasty strong.

One degree of reasonableness probably lets you make an argument (diplomacy/intimidation roll) in any language capable of being expressed by humans. In a language you already speak, even a weak argument has a high chance of landing with someone neutrally inclined toward you or better.

Two degrees lets you try to win over animals too.

At three degrees of reasonableness, you can get a "highly unlikely" favorable outcome. That sounds to me like allying with BBEG's, finding out that every girl at every bar you choose to hit on has a thing for guys /just/ like you, finding out that the guy sent to kill you had a nightmare where you said the exact same intimidating line right before killing him...you get the idea.

And with rituals to get to higher levels? Extraplanar beings, inanimate objects, loose concepts. You could politely ask a bullet to hit its target (or not hit you!).

You could talk the universe into bending physics as a favor, convince a chunk of lead it better turn into gold /or else/, and otherwise bend reality to your whim.

The world is your oyster.
