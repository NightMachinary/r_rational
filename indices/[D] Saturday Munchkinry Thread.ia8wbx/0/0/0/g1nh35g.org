As written... I failed to specify how many effect a Bender can apply at once, so that works. You don't even need to get it to blow up to 10 necessarily, 8 should be enough to start warping reality, but as written 10 blows it up to infinity which should be arbitrary godhood. Good job getting the Locus excluded. I wonder if Solace would try to kill Juniper if that happened.

I edited to nerf this, but even as nerfed, if other groups Benders can participate indirectly, each group performing a side-ritual can modify a step of the main ritual by an increment (+3 from skill level, +1 from ritual, +1 from group, +1 from involvement in process, but -1 from indirectness) to get the main ritual up to degrees beyond 6.
