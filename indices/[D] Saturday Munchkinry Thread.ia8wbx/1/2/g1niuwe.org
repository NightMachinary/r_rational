In X vicinity around you: 1. You emotionally force paranoia/hatred against you 2. You unnaturally stress people out

I see four general situations to exploit this: 1. Situations where the other party can't harm you 2. Situations where you exploit the vicinity limit 3. Situations where you want others against you 4. Situations where paranoid emotions harm others

My initial thought was to make a law firm, specializing in defense, to take advantage of the prosecution acting irrationally. Being defense is essential: stalls or failures of the system inherently benefit you. If you can keep the judge far enough away during trials you get to win a lot of cases you shouldn't and unnaturally stress out the opposition. The real fun is when the judge is in range: you eventually win even more cases for even more money.

Making the judge oppose you along with the prosecution loses you that case, but then you just appeal to higher courts! Higher courts will see the lower courts paranoid/discriminatory rulings and throw them out. Even if this requires more in person hearings you can just send another lawyer, you yourself aren't tied to the case.

Edit: This would give you an extraordinarily weird reputation as a lawyer. Being in this position would also give you a good opportunity to give cases/politics you are against the "hug of death" and establish precedent: by overly supporting a case you are against you can turn people against it. If you can do this at the highest court or in other specific cases you can establish precedents and have a huge impact. You could also do this for political issues.
