You would definitely have to take those things into consideration. I think you could avoid contact with your client if your firm is big enough by using other lawyers outside of the trials themselves. Co-workers would be harder, I guess you could try to pay them well enough that they think "he may be ripping me off somehow but the money is worth it"?

I didn't even think through how messed up the reputation would be since on top of your weird career results there's still the power. Mafia lawyer seems like a good fit
