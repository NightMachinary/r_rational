Play Poker for money. (Or any other gambling game involving bluffing and close proximity to opponents.)

That supernatural power will make it really really hard for opponents to read your true intentions, because they will always feel like you are cheating. Even when you lose they will feel like they are falling into your trap. And if they call you out for cheating, rejoice, because they cannot prove it and you can demand compensation.
