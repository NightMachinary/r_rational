If you disguise yourself as someone else, will people in your vicinity think the person you're disguised as is getting ready to betray them? You could really mess up someone's personal relationships or public reputation this way. One obvious application would be to disguise yourself as a politician you don't like, then attend (or just stand around near) as many meetings and events as you can without blowing your cover.
