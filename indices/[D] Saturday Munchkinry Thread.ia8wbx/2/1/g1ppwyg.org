Become the world's most versatile dancer and be perfectly tied for best in every style. Every time someone else innovates, you're going to be able to match them shortly and pull out their once in a lifetime moves every time.

This power would also in general make you a world class athlete even without the physical ability to be the best. Perfect technique and no choking. Throw textbook perfect spirals every time, never miss a free throw, always have the perfect serve/pitch etc.

Edit: Golf seems like a sport you could dominate: replay the best strokes in history for that hole or just mirror the best strokes from your competitors until you think you can beat them.
