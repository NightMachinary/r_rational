Are you immune or resistant to these heat effects at all? I mean, even being relatively near something that's 4000C is going to blast you with so much radiant heat as to be deadly pretty easily. if you have precise control of everything in your vision, you could force cooling around things you're heating. You could do heat treating/ annealing/ aging for sheet metal pretty well, and also do the quenching. Very large drop bottom furnaces can easily run in the millions to buy and probably somewhere between half a million and a million annually to run. Overall probably not as lucrative as the turbine, but you could get pretty close. At extreme ends, if you could supercool the oxygen out of the air around it, and heat the metal to 2000C, you could replace vacuum furnaces, and probably do the work in a tiny fraction of the time. Of course, just providing liquid nitrogen, liquid oxygen, and liquid hydrogen would probably make you loads more money.
