It lives!

Here is a [[https://heroessavetheworld.wordpress.com/2017/12/22/story-recap/][recap of the story thus far]], if you want to refresh your memory without rereading the whole thing.

The final two chapters of this Sequence will be published next week, and then the story will enter another hiatus, but I've gotten things more in order on my end and I should be able to actually give a better ETA for the next Sequence (I'm going to pausing between 13-chapter Sequences so that I don't pause /during/ them, and so that I can work on some other projects and avoid burning out. I have every intention of completing this, but I'm going to have to take it a little more slowly than I have been. My overall fiction output should not be reduced, though).

I hope that these next few chapters have been worth waiting for.
