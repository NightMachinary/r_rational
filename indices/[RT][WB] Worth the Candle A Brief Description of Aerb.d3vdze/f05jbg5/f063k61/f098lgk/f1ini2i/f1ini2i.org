  A throw apple will follow a parabola through the air, and when altered by the entad's magic, will follow a different, likely shallower parabola. If a revision mage revises the apple, the apple will not go backward through the air following the shallower parabola, but rather, follow a parabola which the apple would have followed if it were not affected by magic. This backward path will have the apple end up in a different position than the one it began in, sometimes radically so, though often it will be stopped in its backwards, ahistorical journey due to inconsistencies or ambiguities that cannot be resolved.

At the beginning it needs to be "A thrown apple" and near the end a space is needed between "a" and "historical".

  Cidum has different policing for its various levels,

  The majority of Cidum fits within the Grand Crevasse, a natural V-shaped section of the Cliffs of Cidum.

3 instances of "Cidum" when it should be "Cidium".

Also, I feel dumb for not making the connection earlier, but velocity mages are referential to Velocity from Worm, right? The details of how their magic works are what finally clued me in.
