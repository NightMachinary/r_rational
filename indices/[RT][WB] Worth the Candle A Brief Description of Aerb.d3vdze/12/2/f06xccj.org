Didn't we already know or at least strongly assume that? The story is labeled as "self-insert" which appears to refer to our main character having inserted himself into a simulation based on his own ideas, probably in an attempt to cure his own mental issues. I'm still curious how this happened. Where did the brain/body scan come from? Did he actually end up killing himself but his brain was frozen and then restored in some far future where spinning up a custom world-simulation is a normal way of dealing with mental ailments? Or maybe Juniper's entire life took place in a simulation in the first place.
