  it was a bit wierd to come across the City Made Manifest several times and not have a clue what it meant

By not have a clue, you mean more than this?

  “Manifest Destiny - The fall of the Second Empire was, by some accountings, inevitable, but by others, it was the work of a single incident. The exact nature of the magic that allows the immortal man named Manifest to puppet his subjects from a distance is unknown, as is his exact location, but it is clear that with the magic excluded, his range is limited to only Lankwon, once the Imperial City, now the City Made Manifest. Defeating him will be an impossible task, but one that you have taken upon yourself.”

Regarding Renacim, I think it's safe to bet that any royalty in the world will take care to keep their pregnant women away from the bubblegums (elderly or not). And if it fails, they can always kill the baby.
