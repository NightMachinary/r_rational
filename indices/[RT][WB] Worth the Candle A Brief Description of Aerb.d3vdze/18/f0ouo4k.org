This is fantastic. I understand why there's no time or space to write out the whole world, but I really hope we get to see some more details in the rest of the story. I'm especially interested in the exclusions - it was a bit wierd to come across the City Made Manifest several times and not have a clue what it meant; these seem to be things that any well-educated child on Aerb would know about but that I'm missing.

One munchkinry/question on the Renacim:

#+begin_quote
  When one dies, they will reincarnate within a few days, taking the place of the closest available embryo in an already-pregnant woman.
#+end_quote

Is "Closest available" just a distance measurement? Because it seems like that would lead to lots of elderly renacim choosing euthanasia in the attic above a pregnant queen's bedchamber. The highlights of the special exceptions at Sound and Silence and education processes to maximize utility for Pallida seem like they would be greatly aided if you were born into wealth and power, which could be easily accomplished under that reincarnation strategy.
