Nice worldbuilding document. I like it.

Keys and cloaks - this whole thing about big enough pyramids distorting time reminds me a /lot/ of Pratchett's Discworld book Pyramids.

The >9000 hells - seems like inspired by D&D's 666-layer'd Abyss?

Interimperium - I would have used the word 'interregnum' here, as it's an awesome word.
