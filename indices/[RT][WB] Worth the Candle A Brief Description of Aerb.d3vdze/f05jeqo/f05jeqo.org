This worldbuilding doc was a [[https://patreon.com/alexanderwales][Patreon goal]] from awhile back that took a lot more focused time and effort than I expected it would, partly because there was so much that I wanted to add to it. You will notice a few omissions:

- Not all 200 of the mortal species are listed
- There's no complete list of exclusions
- Bloodline and specic magics are generally not listed
- There's no comprehensive list of magical flora and fauna

All of that would have made this thing about twice as long, and it would have taken three or four times as long, in part because it can be creatively draining to make long lists of things (even if I do have some extremely brief lists).

All of that might get chucked into a Part II sometime in the future, if I feel like it, though it might be after /Worth the Candle/ is finished, because I'm going to go ahead and not look at this thing for a bit (corrections or necessary changes excepted).

Note that there's no section on gods, clerics, etc.: this is deliberate, because they haven't been formally introduced in the story yet.
