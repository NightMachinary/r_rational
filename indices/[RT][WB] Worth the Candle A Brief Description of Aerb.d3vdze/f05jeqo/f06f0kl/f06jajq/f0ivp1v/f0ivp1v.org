I would note that if you're worried about scope creep---there's a certain point where this stops being a hobbyist “worldbuilding document” and becomes a freestanding, commercially-viable RPG campaign-world splatbook. So the ROI graph kind of trends down for a while, then spikes way up.

(Obviously, it'd only make sense to commit to a project like that until after WtC is done, once there's nothing more to spoil and you don't have any other active projects immediately calling to you. But such a project would be---like this doc is---a nice byproduct/outgrowth of your working notes, and yet still wouldn't require the sort of heavy game-design + QA work that actually making a fully-fleshed-out RPG out of WtC's---not necessarily wholly existent---mechanics would.)
