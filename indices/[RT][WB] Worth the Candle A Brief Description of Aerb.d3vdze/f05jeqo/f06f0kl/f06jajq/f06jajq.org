I think they're a lot of fun, but there are also canonically fifty-three of them (by a conservative count), and I tend to find similarly formatted lists to be really draining after about ten or so, and I would want more than a single sentence for each, covering what the magic/effect is, whether the place is livable, how you would be likely to die there, and its history ... conservatively three paragraphs each? Which would be one hundred and fifty information-dense paragraphs. I'm not saying that I wouldn't/won't do it, but it would nearly double the length of the doc, it would include things that are definitely spoilers, and this project suffered enough scope creep as it was.

(I'm trying to think of how many are namechecked in /Worth the Candle/ to figure out how much work is done:

- 13 Horrors
- Glassy Fields
- Blue Fields
- Parsmont
- Risen Lands
- Datura Desert
- Everblood
- Nightsmoke

Plus a bunch that are implied to exist, one way or another. My own list of excluded skills has 82 of them, but I would have to cross-reference that with the text, and I know some of them would have to at the very least be renamed, if not refactored.)
