Different people have different standards for what constitutes a spoiler, but generally speaking, I would say no, there are no spoilers for much past the first book, and there are a number of things that have been fully covered in the published materials that aren't in this specifically because they'd be spoilery. That said, part of the thrill of reading is seeing new things get introduced, and there /are/ one or two things that will be gone over in the text that are in the doc, I think.
