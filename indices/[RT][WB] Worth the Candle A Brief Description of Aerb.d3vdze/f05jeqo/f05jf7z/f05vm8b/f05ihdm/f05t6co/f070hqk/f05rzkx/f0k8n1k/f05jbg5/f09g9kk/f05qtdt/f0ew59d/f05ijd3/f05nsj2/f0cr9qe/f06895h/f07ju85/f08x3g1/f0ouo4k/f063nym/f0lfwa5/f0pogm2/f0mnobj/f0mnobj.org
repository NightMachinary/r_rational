I think we're going to visit Ink and Ardor for sure, even if most of the other athenaeums get left out of the story. Passion magic is a well contrived excuse to talk about psychology and how it's handled in rationalist circles. My guess is it'll be towards the end of the story, since a "self-actualized" Joon has to be approaching a god in terms of power and temperament.
