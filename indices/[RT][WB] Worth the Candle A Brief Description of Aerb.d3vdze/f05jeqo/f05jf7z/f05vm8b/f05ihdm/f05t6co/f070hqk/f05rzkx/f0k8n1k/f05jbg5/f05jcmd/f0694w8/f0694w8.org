- Chapter 1

#+begin_quote
  “The history of Aerb prior the First Empire is one of civilizations rising and falls”
#+end_quote

rising and falling

- Chapter 3

#+begin_quote
  “owing to both the increased prevalence of goods and from around Aerb,”
#+end_quote

not really sure what this was supposed to mean

#+begin_quote
  “WIthin the major imperial cities”
#+end_quote

capitalized ‘i' in within

- Chapter 4

#+begin_quote
  “For technical purposes, a six-axis directional system, with the three axes sixty degrees offset from each other.”
#+end_quote

Something's missing here.

- Chapter 5

#+begin_quote
  “Because of the precision necessary and the way that minute changes in bodies can invalidate a pattern, elves are the only species on Aerb that regularly use skin magic”
#+end_quote

scar magic

#+begin_quote
  “Curiously, it's the only bloodline magic that I have available”
#+end_quote

Seems to be incompatible with this from chapter 171 of the story:

#+begin_quote
  “It was a bloodline magic, one of the only ones that I had access to”
#+end_quote

One of them should be changed

#+begin_quote
  “When first discovered, void was used for everything from weapons to carving to removal”
#+end_quote

seems to be missing something here, specifying removal of what

#+begin_quote
  “from deathwatches so the soul can be taken immediately on death, to euthaenasia”
#+end_quote

euthanasia

- Chapter 8

#+begin_quote
  “Parovartako are one of the species with variable biology, though not to the extent of the doppelgangers”
#+end_quote
