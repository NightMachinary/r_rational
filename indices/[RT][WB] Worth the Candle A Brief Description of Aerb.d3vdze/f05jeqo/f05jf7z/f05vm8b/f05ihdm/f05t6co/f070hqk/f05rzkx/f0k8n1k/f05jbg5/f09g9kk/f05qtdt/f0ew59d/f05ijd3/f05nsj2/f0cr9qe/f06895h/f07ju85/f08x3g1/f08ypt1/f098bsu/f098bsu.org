A rock the size of a shipping container doesn't need to fall very far in order to crush someone or something. Objects could be teleported to block roads or other means of transportation. You could swamp an area in something difficult to remove, like tar, or something noxious like animal corpses. An animal corpse wouldn't be a direct threat, but if there are a bunch they could quickly rot and cause problems. A spy could teleport vital materials to their own army. Transportation of otherwise stationary weapons would be practical. You could also swamp an area in propaganda, causing demoralization. Depending on how the spell is set up, you could make tons of pitfall traps by using the teleportation spell as an earthmoving ability.
