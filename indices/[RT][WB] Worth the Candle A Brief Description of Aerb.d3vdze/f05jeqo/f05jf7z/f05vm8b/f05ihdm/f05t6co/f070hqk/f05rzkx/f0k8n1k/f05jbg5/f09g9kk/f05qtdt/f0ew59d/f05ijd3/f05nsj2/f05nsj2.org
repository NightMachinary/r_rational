During the Second Empire, there was research into using Soul magic to predispose Passion mages towards heightened emotional states, one aim being power generation through the resulting magical effects. Although a theoretical description of Passion magic remains a futile endeavour, it was empirically determined that peak magical output resulted from not a single intense feeling but instead a repeating series of transitions between four distinct emotions. The first such set to be discovered was the Lust-Hunger-Anger-Fear loop, which led to the erroneous belief that only primal emotions could form the vertices of these "carnal cycles".
