This comment confuses me. Isn't that the nature of the phrase here on Earth? Wouldn't it mean exactly the same thing?

To break it down "a rising tide lifts all boats" means that a win-win solution has been achieved. All she's saying is that it's a rare case where there's a win-win situation, rather than win-lose, except that the magnitude of wins is different, which makes the aphorism inapt. She's not commenting on the action of the tides.
