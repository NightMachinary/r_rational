A lot to think about.

First of all, Aerb is a shitty place. I thought Warhammer 40k was shitty, but Aerb is on a whole other level. It's not as grimdark, but it would be so much worse to exist there.

Are there still elves on Celestar? It sounds like there still are. So for all the bullshit on Aerb, there's even more bullshit there (Is it smaller or bigger than Aerb?). And considering the type of stuff that goes on on Aerb, there should be stuff happening there that threatens all life on Aerb, cue star quest.

The magics are so arbitrary. At this point, I wouldn't be surprised to see mist magic, snow magic, steam magic or ice 2 magic.

I wonder if the powers of the Ice Wizards or Apocalypse Demon are going to get explained. I'd like to get a feel for the type of threats Arthur faced. I don't really have a sense of how powerful he was atm. Ice Wizards are mentioned 3 times, the Apocalypse Demon 6,

Do Infernals reproduce or are there a set, finite number of them? Is it possible for the mortal species in the Hells to fight back against the Infernals? Do they just not because there's no magic available and the Infernals are much better fighters? If that's the case, I can imagine a scenario where you industrialize the creation of souls and swamp the Hells with overwhelming numbers of mortals so that they stand a chance.
