  For a period of roughly a thousand years, Scamadus was known for its steel, which was folded some hundred times, giving it a unique pattern and several beneficial properties.
#+end_quote

Not a typo as such, but folded steel is only folded a few times, maybe a dozen or so at most, because each fold doubles the number of layers. Folding 100 times would make the steel completely homogenous. This is in ch2.

  This zig-zag while moving up the ranks has made blood magic one of the less favored of the magics in recent, more peaceful times.
#+end_quote

For the section on blood magic, I think this should specify that becoming a master blood mage is less favored, as blood magic in general is one of the only healing magics left. The various abilities that the novices get aren't combat exclusive, and could help you in mundane situations in various ways.

  Combat-focused gem mages are quite rare: it's usually a contingency of some kind, or a readily-used burst of offensive power.
#+end_quote

This line in the gem magic section is confusing since gem magic seems to be only useful in combat.

  Additionally, a still mage can only affect whole objects.
#+end_quote

This line in the section on still magic seems explicitly false, unless im not understanding it correctly. Still mages can still someone's heart, which is only a part of them, and this is a commonly known ability.

  They carefully track their food intake, supplement their means with medicines,

In pustule magic, means should be meals

#+begin_quote
  Wards can either act as barriers against the specific magic, or they can act to annihilate the magic that passes through them, with the latter costing far more concordance and taking considerably more training to use.
#+end_quote

In the warding section, this should probably read "annihilate or suppress the magic that passes through them", since entads can be warded against, making them non-functional, without destroying them.

#+begin_quote
  Sinusoidal
#+end_quote

You use this word a number of times, but I think you're thinking of a sigmoid function. [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function?wprov=sfla1]] A sinusoidal function is a sine wave, which in context would mean various parameters decrease as more of another are added after a certain point. I explicitly noticed it in the water magic section, but saw the word a few other times as well. A sigmoid function increases quickly at first then levels off, which is what I think you intend.
