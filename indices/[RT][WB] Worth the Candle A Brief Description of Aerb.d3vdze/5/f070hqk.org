It's funny, the story usually compares the Empire of Common Ccause to the UN, but the first chapter really made me think about the EU: political bloc originally conceived as an economic zone to maintain peace after the collapse of a genocidal empire, check. Ever increasing scope creep, check. Byzantine bureaucracy that nobody can actually change because all decisions require an unanimity vote, check. Only thing that's missing is a member polity deciding to leave after a referendum and almost driving itself to civil war in the process.
