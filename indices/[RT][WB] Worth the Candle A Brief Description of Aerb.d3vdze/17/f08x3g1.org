It's funny that the document states that the bulk-teleport spell was used in warfare, but also that it's unuseable by living creatures due to it sterilizing anything that the spell transports. It's unlikely that they used it to drop heavy objects or tele-frag people, since the document specifically states that the spell would fail if it was aimed too high into the air or into spaces that are already occupied. So how the hell did people use the bulk teleportation spell in war? I suppose it could have been useable for living creatures at one point and then been partially excluded.
