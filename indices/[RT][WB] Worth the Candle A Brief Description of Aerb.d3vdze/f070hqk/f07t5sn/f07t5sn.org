I think this has been discussed before. The EoCC is compared both to the US

  “It's complicated, Juniper,” said Amaryllis. “The Empire of Common Cause operates under a legal framework that's meant to govern interaction between polities, and which has slowly crept into everyday life -- lots of parallels with your own United States, actually, minus the Civil War.

and the UN

#+begin_quote
  When people said “the empire” they meant something akin to the United Nations, in that it was a rather toothless organization whose real power came from member countries agreeing to impose standardized laws or make global (they said hexal, for obvious reasons) sanctions against one another.

in the text, and the EU does sit somewhere in between on the toothless/not-toothless scale. Overall, I'd say the EU is the closest analog, with a couple of caveats.

- The legislature appears more similar to that of China, the National People's Congress. They have in common both that they're very large, and that they are only rarely in full session, instead delegating legislative power to legislative subcommittees. As far as I can see, while western legislatures do delegate a lot of power, it's almost always to departments under the executive branch.

- The EoCC clearly isn't always toothless, and there's been references to the organization as whole declaring war or taking similarly extreme action, which is beyond what the EU has ever done.

- I'm not read up on the Court of Justice of the EU, but I think that on balance, the concept of a powerful judiciary that often rewrites the legal reality, with limited recourse by the traditional legislative process, is more prevalent in the US than the EU.
