Telefragging won't work because the spell fails if the target space is occupied.

Another application you overlooked is teleporting time bombs shortly before they explode, or chemical weapons in general. Hell, if you have a good enough layout of the enemy's garrison, you could teleport blockages into all the main corridors, entrances, etc.
