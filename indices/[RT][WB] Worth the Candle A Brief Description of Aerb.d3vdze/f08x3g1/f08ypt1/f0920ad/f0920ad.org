Sure, I don't disagree that completely removing your supply chain is awesome, I'm just not sure it's such a game-changer that it would require the formation of an empire to restrict its use in war. It's even stated that cities had to be warded against attack by bulk teleportation, so clearly they had /some/ kind of offensive use.

#+begin_quote
  The Athenaeum of Barriers was put to work fortifying cities against attack by bulk teleportation as best as possible, and pacts of mutual defense and/or teleportation-in-warfare bans were put into place, which, along with trade agreements and enforcement mechanisms, formed the basis for the rise of the Second Empire and its eventually legal formation in 176 FE.

And the section where bulk teleportation is described states that it fails if the chosen space is already occupied, so telefragging would appear to not be an option.

  Given the proper ingredients and a copy of the ritual, anyone can teleport a volume of space to nearly anywhere else on Aerb. This teleportation will fail if the destination location is high up in the air or if the destination location is already occupied.
