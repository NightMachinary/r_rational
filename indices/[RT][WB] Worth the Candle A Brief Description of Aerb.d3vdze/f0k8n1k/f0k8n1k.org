  In the naive case, a velocity mage will increase their own velocity at the expense of mass, conserving power. This allows for much faster movement, at the expense of an ability to affect the world. A velocity mage at ten times speed will punch with one tenth the mass.

  The big problem with speedsters is that velocity is extremely powerful, since power equals mass times velocity.

I think the above still has some issues. Momentum equals mass times velocity, but energy equals 1/2 times mass times velocity squared. If you're at half the weight and twice the speed, your punch is still effectively more powerful. This means that as far as damage is concerned, increasing speed by some factor at the cost of reducing mass by the same factor.

The basic example would be one billiard ball hitting a second of the same mass (head on, and assuming the collision is elastic). If the two have the same mass, all the momentum and kinetic energy of the first is transferred to the second; the first ball comes to a complete stop. If you halve the mass of the first and double its velocity however, conservation of momentum and energy work out to the second ball receiving 8/9 of the kinetic energy of the first, i.e. 16/9 times the kinetic energy (meaning 4/3 times the velocity) it would have received without the change in mass and velocity of the first. The remaining 1/9 remains with the first ball, which bounces back at 2/3 of its original velocity. (I hope I did the math right)

In other words, while velocity mages have to worry more about recoil, their punches would actually be stronger. A more even trade might be increasing velocity by a factor x at the cost of reducing mass by a factor x^{2,} preserving kinetic energy rather than momentum. In the billiard ball example, that would mean only 16/25 of the original kinetic energy would be transferred to the second ball (i.e. it would move at 4/5 of the original velocity compared to the case without mass/velocity adjustments), while the first would recoil at 6/5 of the original velocity (which makes recoil an even bigger problem compared to the first case, and actually seems to reduce the ability of a velocity mage to interact with the world (obviously the math would be more complicated compared to the billiard ball example, but I'm fairly confident things would work out in much the same way)).
