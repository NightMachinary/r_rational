Quite an impressive world building document! It's nice to see all the one off species and places complied into one place. It seems I missed or forgot many minor details or else they weren't given in the main story. Like, for example, all I could remember of the Vitrics was that they were blue and that we had only seen female members of their species, their lightening magic and mono-gender I had completely missed.

Seeing this document, I can see how Juniper is constantly reminded of his own world building. Aerb feels both more (seeing more details) and less (seeing more hackey obvious simulated and inconsistent elements) real now.

The things that aren't described are somewhat interesting in that the lack of mention makes me suspect they are likely to be future story elements that are avoiding being spoiled to strongly. (I am mainly thinking about the Gods of Aerb, but also somewhat about the exclusion zones)... oh wait

  Note that there's no section on gods, clerics, etc.: this is deliberate, because they haven't been formally introduced in the story yet.

already addressed...

One minor question comment... was it intentional or accidental giving the full work link instead of the chapter by chapter link. The full work link tempted me into reading it all in one sitting, not that I mind, just noting how it may alter reading habits from reading it incrementally to reading it all in one big chunk.
