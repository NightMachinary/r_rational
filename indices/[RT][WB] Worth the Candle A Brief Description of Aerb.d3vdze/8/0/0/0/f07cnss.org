I see what you mean. Looking at your examples they feel right to me as well, but there's something about the original that twigs at me. I guess it's probably just a stylistic difference rather than any real grammatical error. A few more actual problems I found, since you probably won't see edits to my original comment:

#+begin_quote
  Because of the precision necessary and the way that minute changes in bodies can invalidate a pattern, elves are the only species on Aerb that regularly use *skin* magic, though the practice was more common during the Second Empire when skilled soul mages had a method of temporarily boosting individual soldiers through scar magic.

This should be scar magic as well.

#+begin_quote
  For a large building *this,* can take as long as half a day, but for something smaller, it might be as little as half an hour.
#+end_quote

Comma needs to be removed.
