  #+begin_quote
    It was, however, a natural fit, given the close similarities between the two magics in terms of how they're practiced, and in spite of their different presentations and effects.
  #+end_quote

  inconsistent present tense.
#+end_quote

I'm not sure on this one, because "how they *were* practiced" seems like it would indicate that they're no longer practiced that way. Compare:

#+begin_quote
  My wife and I were a natural fit because we share a similar sense of humor.
#+end_quote

That intuitively seems perfectly fine to me, because though the tense isn't consistent between the two clauses, it doesn't have to be, and breaking it apart would be completely fine:

#+begin_quote
  My wife and I were a natural fit. We share a similar sense of humor.
#+end_quote

It's mostly a question of connotations. (And I don't particularly like putting those two verbs in line with each other in this case.) Usually in cases like this, I would just rewrite the whole thing so that the problematic structure isn't there at all, but I'm not actually sure that it's wrong, or if it is, /why/ it's wrong.

Fixed all the rest though, thanks.
