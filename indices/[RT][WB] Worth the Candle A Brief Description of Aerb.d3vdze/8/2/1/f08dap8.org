The bit about folded steel is probably a DM Easter egg to anime subculture, referencing the meme “SUPERIOR NIPPON STEEL, FOLDED OVER 1000 TIMES”. The bit about them having superior ore makes it especially tongue in cheek, since the poor quality of Japanese ore was why they used folding for their steel.
