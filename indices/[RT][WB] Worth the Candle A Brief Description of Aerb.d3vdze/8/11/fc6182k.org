Shimmerplate: Currently held by the Empire of Common Cause (specifically, Imperial Affairs), shimmerplate is not an entad or entad set, but rather, the result of the action of a single *enatd*, the Armoring Rifle, which encases anyone it hits in armor. This armor, presumably dubbed shimmerplate because of how little it reflects light, is strong, breathable, nullifies minor damage, and resizes to anyone who wears it, all common on entad armor. Aside from allowing the mass production of entad-equivalent armor, the Armoring Rifle allows revocation of armor from a distance at the wielder's command, though it gives little information on who is wearing each specific armor and where they are, which must be corroborated and tracked by a small department within Imperial Affairs responsible for that in the event revocation is required.
