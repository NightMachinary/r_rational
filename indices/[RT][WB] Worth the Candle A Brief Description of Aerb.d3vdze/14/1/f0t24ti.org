I suspect ice magic is extremely degenerate, designed as an NPC-only skill and excluded when Uther tried it out. Ice powers are generally broken in battle shonens, with a tendency to do weird metaphysical things at high levels. I can think of multiple ways a single application of ice magic could create an exclusion zone: a freezing spell that fuels itself with the heat it destroys, ice-nine from Cat's Cradle, general matter generation shenanigans, maybe even just extreme lethality against most of the mortal species making Ice Magic 100 a solution to way too many fights in the DM's opinion.
