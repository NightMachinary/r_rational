Sparked some really interesting discussions on [[/r/blackmirror]] about whether we should feel bad for Cookies - [[https://www.reddit.com/r/blackmirror/comments/2pvmug/why_does_everyone_feel_sorry_for_the_cookie/][the amount of people]] who think it's silly to empathize with [[#s][spoilers I guess?]] is insane.

The episode was quintessentially /Black Mirror/, and I'm with you on being extremely hype for S3. Whenever it will be.
