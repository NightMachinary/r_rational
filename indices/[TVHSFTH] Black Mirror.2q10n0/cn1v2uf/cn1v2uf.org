I don't think anyone really acts in their best interests in any of these episodes. The ones that jump out to me most are [[#s][S02E02 White Bear]] and [[#s][S02E03 The Waldo Moment]]

However, I definitely recommend the show to practically everyone. The episodes are all self-contained, but I don't recommend starting with the first episode. Each episode has its flaws, and I can't quite figure out which one to go with.

The Waldo Moment was probably my favorite episode, but that's not the best introduction to the series (it's a bit of a break from the usual pattern). Maybe The Entire History Of You (S01E03), which was the best-received episode (and yes, quite good, and definitely in the full spirit of the show).

Edit: I'm less than half an hour into the most recent episode, White Christmas, and this could very well be the one to start with. It's great, has a pretty good twist. And then, of course, you have Jon Hamm. He is just a phenomenal actor.
