I read the first couple of chapters on Tor recently. The writing style didn't put me off, but one thing that sort of bothered me was how much time those chapters devoted to religious themes. At least so far, it seems to be portraying religion in a pretty positive light, which is... not really the kind of story I want to spend time on right now. Did I misread the tone? Does it get less religion-y later?
