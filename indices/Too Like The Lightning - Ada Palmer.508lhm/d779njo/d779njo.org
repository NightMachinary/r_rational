I second this recommendation in terms of it being an awesome book. Totally blew me away. I don't think it qualifies as Rational (or Rationalist), but it very much falls in the realm of "thinky fiction with thinky protagonists" mentioned on Writing Rationally. I had to put down the book about halfway through and seriously consider what I wanted out of a novel before I continued.

It is slow in many places, esp near the beginning, but the punches that it lands make it absolutely worth it. I will remember this book for a LONG time.
