I'm now beginning to fill with nerves and dread about my upcoming JaNoWriMo (January Novel Writing Month), for which I have even taken some time off work. I'm writing a paranormal romance story which I summarise as "gay vampires kissing" though it's obviously more complicated than that.

My sources of nerves/dread, to which I am going to write counter-arugments:

- I will not be able to write something I am happy with (Counter: Of course I will be happy with it, because it will be my story that I wanted to write. Of course I will be unhappy with it because I obsessively edit everything I write.)

- I will write the scenes I like, but the boring stuff in between will be missed. (Counter: If stuff in between the scenes I like is boring, then yadda yadda through it like /most novels I read do/)

- My dialogue will be bad. (Counter: I have a good sense of William's voice. Red's voice I have very little sense of, but my roleplaying partner will edit things to fix them up, and lots of the dialog will be based on roleplay skeletons, so there's no concern).

- I have taken the mantle of having part of it set in WW2 which I am not personally interested in, and I might screw that up from a realism point of view. (Counter: It mostly happens with WW2 as a very far-away backdrop. I have a friend who is a WW2 buff who said he'd be willing to read important scenes. I am writing paranormal romance, not historical fiction, so realism, whilst important, is not vital)

- I will write something and share it here but people won't like it. (Counter: I'm not writing Animorphs: The Reckoning. I can't expect people to like it. It's not /for/ [[/r/rational]], this community has just inspired me to do JaNoWriMo in the first place and also to improve the rationality of my stories. Other counter: The sort of people who enjoy paranormal romance might not enjoy A:tR (BLASPHEMY), so it might be more popular than I think)

- I will write something and share it here and people will say "this is not rational fiction why are you posting it here". (Counter: other people might say they like it. Might be an opportunity to discuss rational aspects to fiction in general)

- I will not get it finished. (Counter: so what? You can keep writing after January. Also, you are taking like a week off work for this, and you are motivated, so you are sure to acheive your goal word count provided you don't slack off. This fear will help you with that. If you acheive your goal word count but don't finish the story, that's fine. It just means the story was longer than you thought.)

- I will get it finished but the people important to me in my life (partners, parents) who I share it with will think it's lame. (Counter: so what? They think Survivor is lame but you know they're wrong.)

Thanks for giving me a place to write all that out! I feel a lot better now. If anyone else is feeling nervous or insecure about their writing, I am happy to attempt to reassure you as best I can.
