*Seeking advice: writing while depressed*

To anyone interested - my personal warning flags have tripped, and I've finally realized I'm in another depressive bout, which explains why I've been doing no writing for the past week, just the occasional poking at one background detail or another. (I'm still working on figuring out those flags, to avoid both false positives and false negatives, but when they include things like 'notice I've wanted to curl up inside rather than take a daily walk for at least two days', it's a whole subjective mess that lends itself poorly to Bayesian analysis.)

I think it's safe to say that these bouts aren't going to stop for the foreseeable future. But, perhaps, there might be some trick or other I haven't thought of, which would let me keep doing productive writing work even when I'm as anhedonic as all get-out. Within a week or so I'll probably be back to normal, but I can predict that, in said week, I'll be annoyed at myself for the loss of the week's progress, despite all the standard stoic lessons about letting go of that which is outside one's control.

Any thoughts?
