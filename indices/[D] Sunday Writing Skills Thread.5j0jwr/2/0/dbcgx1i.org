It depends.

I know that's not the answer that you want to hear, but you have a lot more space for characters when you're writing a character-driven drama that's all about the relationships between characters, when compared to, say, a travelogue, or a war epic, or something like that.

And the number gets much lower if they're not related to each other in some way; if you're jumping between characters who do not know each other, you can have less of them than if one is the boyfriend of the other, or they're cousins, or father and son, or childhood friends, or whatever. Partly this is because some of the character and setting building you're doing serves double duty, but part of it is also that you can keep someone "on-screen" and in the reader's head for a longer time.

But if you /really/ want a ballpark, then you can establish two characters within the space of 1,000 words, so long as they're talking to each other (I mean, I personally couldn't, but I've seen authors who can). The more words you spend on them, the longer we can go without seeing them again, which I think is probably what defines the upper limit of number of characters. Wait too many words to revisit them, or increase the complexity of personal interactions too much, and the reader won't remember well enough for those characters to be effective.
