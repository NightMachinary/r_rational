Does anyone know if there is a ratio of the number of characters that can be fully developed in a story to the number of words written?

I don't mean how many characters are introduced or presented as more than one-dimensional figures, but rather characters who spend a significant amount of time 'on-stage' and whose personality/actions/choices we get to know very well.

For example, we often have stories with one or two protagonists and then there is a jump up to stories with five characters forming a group (adventurers to the rescue!). Greater numbers appear to be uncommon unless the writer is creating a epic-length story aka Wildbow, Tolkien, Robert Jordan, and other such authors of very long series.

So I was wondering if some sort of words/chapter to character ratio can be derived somehow. It'd be useful to estimate how long I should spend on each character throughout the story. Even a ballpark estimate from two or more people can help.

Think about it. If you have a completely random number to guess, then you are equally likely to over estimate as you are to under estimate. So with at least two people, you are drastically closer to the true answer than if only you made the guess. It's a useful trick when you have to guess on something and can ask just one other person to guess too.
