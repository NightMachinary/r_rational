So would you estimate for five major characters plus world-building and a support cast in the story I'm planning, I would need 135k to 165k for the story in total?

How about fanfiction? Since people already know the characters from the source material, does that change the estimate by a lot? For example, what if it was Scooby-Doo fanfiction about Velma, Daphne, Fred, Shaggy, and Scooby?

Thanks for replying! I appreciate it.
