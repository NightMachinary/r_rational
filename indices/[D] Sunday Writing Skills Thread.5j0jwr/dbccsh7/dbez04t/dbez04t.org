Don't want to apply any hard-and-fast rules here, but Orson Scott Card's "MICE" quotient might be a good metric to consider this. MICE is an acronym for Milieu (setting), Idea, Character, Event. Every story is based on one or more of these things changing, and how many of these you get to explore is dependent on the length of your work.

Short stories (~5k words) get to develop one thing, novellettes (~12k words) get to do two, novellas (~30k) get to do three, and novels (40k+) get to do four. So novel-length works are the point at which you get to do "one of everything," whereas in the context of a short story, you might focus solely on changing circumstances around an event to the exclusion of things like world-building and character development.

I'm not sure that a strict "words/chapter" ratio is exactly the correct way to think about it, because if you think about a 50k word novel that develops one main character, it's not as if all 50k words are about that character's development: a significant portion of the word count is going to be devoted to things like worldbuilding, or exploring the events and ideas in the story that make up its plot. Based on this, it seems relatively intuitive that adding a second "main character" would have a marginal cost; I think it's plausible to come to a conclusion that you could take your 50k story about one character and turn it into a 70k word story with two main characters.

However, a big thing to consider is what you are adding to the story. Looking at the example of a 50k story that is expanded to 70k words with an additional viewpoint character, that assumes that you're not adding a significant amount of worldbuilding and plot, which you could conceivably do if the two characters are traveling together in a party. However, if your second viewpoint character "splits off" from the first viewpoint character and gets into their own shenanigans, then you aren't just adding a new character; you're also expanding the story to include new events. Also, if the second viewpoint is (for example) from a different culture than your other viewpoint character, and you want to explore that meaningfully, then you're also going to do more worldbuilding to accommodate that.

In short: it depends. Sometimes, adding another viewpoint character means just that: adding another viewpoint to the story. But oftentimes, it can mean expanding the scope of the story and its plot and setting. Obviously, these two different approaches to "adding characters" will require different word counts.

  How about fanfiction? Since people already know the characters from the source material, does that change the estimate by a lot? For example, what if it was Scooby-Doo fanfiction about Velma, Daphne, Fred, Shaggy, and Scooby?

I think it depends a lot on the source material. If I'm writing Wheel of Time fanfiction, I can write memorable viewpoint characters from the series as though the audience already knows them, because anyone who has read the series is familiar with the different viewpoint characters and how they think/talk and just generally how they see the world around them. On the other hand, TV shows usually don't render characters in this kind of fidelity. Even TV shows that take a long time to develop their characters (like the Sopranos and Breaking Bad) only let us see characters in terms of their behavior; we never really get to know what a day in the life of Walter White is like from inside his head, and usually the only way to get around this is by cheating with voice over like Dexter does (the HBO serial killer, not the Cartoon Network boy-scientist).

Now, think about how much readers know a given character from Scooby Doo. Do we really know how Velma thinks and how she sees the world? Compared to the fidelity of character that we get from viewpoint characters in written prose, the cartoon versions of these characters are practically caricatures. I don't think Scooby Doo spent much time on character study; the episodes always felt more like a collection of short stories that are event or idea focused. (Going back to the idea of Orson Scott Card's MICE quotient, a weekly short story doesn't give you the chance to explore everything, and often deeper character development is the thing that gets eschewed, being that status quo is often maintained for episodic shows.) I feel like I could sum up most viewers knowledge as, "Velma is the nerdy yet somewhat athletic glasses-wearing girl who is witty and sometimes sarcastic." Granted, you'll have some super-fans who will know every biographical detail about her that the series ever alluded to, but those allusions are /rare/, and you shouldn't assume that your audience is going to be familiar with them. Your audience being familiar with Velma does save you the time of having to establish a pattern of consistent behavior for her (she can start "behaving like herself" right from the start of the story, as opposed to original characters which have to take time to cement themselves in the reader's mind), but if you're going to be writing a 100k+ word fanfic, I'd be inclined to proceed with the assumption that you'll be developing your characters mostly from scratch in terms of presenting their viewpoint, which encompasses everything about how they see the world, like the experiences that color their perceptions, their motivations (short term and long term), and so on. I generally like to operate with the assumption that my audience is smart (I don't want to take the time to explain things to them in agonizing detail), but also might be ignorant of certain aspects of the subject material.
