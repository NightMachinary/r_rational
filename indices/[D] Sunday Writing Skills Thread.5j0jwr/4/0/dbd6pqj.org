I have the same thing happen. I've tried my best to get good at curving back toward the story I wanted to tell, or failing that, to get better at finding the point of divergence, then developing the skill of rewinding and rewriting in order to get myself back on track. But I definitely hear you about the quality of "looks right", I just happen to believe that there are multiple "looks right" paths for any given story at any given point, and you can't constrain yourself by just thinking that the first solution you come across is the correct one. (If it helps at all, think about writing fanfiction of your own work, diverging off from the story that you were in the process of telling in order to tell a new one.)
