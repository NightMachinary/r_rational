Ah, maybe I should clarify. What I write is /random/, not organic. From inside the algorithm, there are only so many patterns of words that "look right", and each additional word added to a sentence constrains those choices further. Trying to stick with only patterns of words that "look right" often leads me to wind up with something that "looks right" but isn't what I was /trying/ to write.
