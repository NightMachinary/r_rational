I've noticed that what I intend to write and what I actually write aren't entirely the same thing. When I decide to write Scene C, what I end up with is somewhere between Scene A and Scene E - not entirely off the mark, but unpredictable and usually destructive to the plot. Does anyone else have the same thing, or is this problem unique to me?
