My writing skills are terrible and I'm trying to improve them but I want to know the best way to go about it.

I spent around 45 min writing yesterday and only managed to come up with ~2 paragraphs. My question is should I go for quantity over quality, or is writing more something that comes with perseverance and practice? Another question I wanted to ask is whether I should plot out the entire chapter before writing or is that something that depends on the writer?
