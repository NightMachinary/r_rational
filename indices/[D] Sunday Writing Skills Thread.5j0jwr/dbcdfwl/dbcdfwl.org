*Word count vs structural work*

In [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jPU6QKEohcrw6l6O3SxorIxf2Tnq54h36LtQO6Qv86w/edit][Extracts]] (still debating a better name), at the current most-forward part of what I've written, I know one thing I want my protagonist to do - but I've realized that I haven't figured out enough about significant parts of the setting to work out even the next scene (a press conference), let alone the next series of shenanigans. So I decided to abandon my usual goal of words-per-day and focus on some structural work. Yesterday, I did some reading on relevant topics (modularized data centres, looking at a particular [[http://www.datapacrat.com/temp/The%20Geysers.kmz][location]] north of San Francisco in GEarth, etc), including posting a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/datacenter/comments/5iubnr/writing_scifi_story_seeking_info_on_data_centers/][couple]] of [[https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/5iufuj/writing_scifi_story_seeking_info_on_adminning_a/][questions]] to other subreddits, which have led me to much useful info that I expect I can incorporate into the story - and should provide enough of a setting-skeleton for my aspiring-rationalist protagonist to try to leverage his resources to achieve his goal.

My goal today, if real-life events don't end up using up my writing time, is to take my various and scattered notes on ideas I want to incorporate, and refactor, streamline, and just plain move them to where they'll actually be relevant.

Tomorrow I'm unlikely to get any writing done; the plan is to go see a matinee with some family.

If all goes according to plan, then I should be able to resume daily writing on Tuesday. Maybe Wednesday if today's a bust writing-wise.

... But that's just the plan I've come up with on my own. If anyone here has better ideas, I'd appreciate the suggestions. Not to mention anyone willing to hold my toes to the fire if I spend too much time playing Dungeons of Dredmor instead of doing something more productive. :)
