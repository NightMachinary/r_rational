In light of the edit, I'm not sure what I'm supposed to convince myself of. I don't remember a future me visiting, so this version of me is a slightly different person, one that got a visitor from the future. I could probably convince them that we have an identical past, using passwords and so forth, but does that make me actually them, in the sense needed for the experiment?
