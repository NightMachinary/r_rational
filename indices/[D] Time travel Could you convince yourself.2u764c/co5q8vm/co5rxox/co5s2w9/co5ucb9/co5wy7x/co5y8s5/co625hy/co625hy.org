The best bet would probably be to look up old transcripts of CNN broadcasts and memorize them, then quote them back a few minutes ahead of it showing on television. That would still be /really/ easy to fake compared to creating a physical duplicate of a person or reading their mind, but it seems like it would be your best bet if you want a demonstration of predictive power.

If someone told me "they're going to crash a plane into the Twin Towers" and then I saw it happen the next morning, my first thought wouldn't be that they were a time traveler, it would be that they were somehow involved in the plot.

So you need statistically unlikely predictions about the future that the supposed time traveler couldn't have foreknowledge of, and couldn't fake, which is a pretty tall order.
