It's easy to distinguish between a mind reader and a time traveler: a time traveler can make correct and statistically unlikely predictions about the future, a mind reader can't.

Now, an all-up telepath who can write to your mind as well as read it...then you're just screwed. You can't trust reality at all, they know your every plan and trick...I don't think that's a winnable fight.
