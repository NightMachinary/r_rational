Yudkowsky planted the idea in my head. "Recognition Code 927, I am a potato?" And I don't have a pass phrase. I buried a box with a combination lock on it in a location of great personal importance to me and very little importance to anybody else. Anybody who approaches me and possesses the item contained in that box (which is, of course, handmade and unique) is automatically trustworthy.

It's far more likely that a limited telepath who can only read surface thoughts wanted the trust of somebody known to visit this board, and is using this question as a trap to finally find out their password or password-equivalent.
