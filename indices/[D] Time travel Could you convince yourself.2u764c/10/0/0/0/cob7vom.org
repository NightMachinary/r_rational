No. Only /stupid/ religion. Something you might be honestly mistaken about won't work. Telepaths deal with that all the time. You have to believe something so on its face false that a casual glance out the window would prove you wrong, and yet still believe it. This will be destructive to the telepath. They will have to switch off to avoid taking abrasive memetic damage.
