Actually, I've recently been training myself to immediately start singing in my head whenever I start following certain trains of thought. This will, hopefully, shift my attention sufficiently that the only thing the telepath can hear is the singing. Of course, also depends on the mechanics of telepathy. Can they review your memories, etc. Ah, well. Just gotta hope they ignore me.
