Is doing puzzles in your spare time a failure mode? IRL, there is only so much I can plan and prepare for, so if it amuses me to devote spare effort to solving fictional or improbable situations is that really a failure mode?

It is not like there is some shortage or scarcity of planning power I have as a human being. I do have a finite amount of time, but if I have time to enjoy myself with fiction, I have should also have time to plan for unrealistic or fictional scenarios. Its not like I've devoted financial resources to it. And people that do spend financial resources for say, Zombie Outbreaks, are also preparing themselves for a conventional disaster (Almost all of the things needed are the same: evacuation plans, a bug out bag, emergency food rations, etc.).
