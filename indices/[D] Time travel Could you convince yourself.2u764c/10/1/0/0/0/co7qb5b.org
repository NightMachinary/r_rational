If you do not have such a system in place, you would not be capable of convincing yourself you performed time travel in the first place, and as such, you would not have the prior you would need to set up this system.

It also depends on the mechanics of time travel. Are there paradoxes? Do you terminate the future? Does it turn into a stable time loop for no reason? Etc. This way, you're probably going to be prepared for whatever, if there isn't a stable time loop and you don't remember meeting yourself in the past, so you wouldn't remember any codes you think up on the spot in the future.
