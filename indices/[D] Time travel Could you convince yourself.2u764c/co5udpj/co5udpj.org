I have a password system, but it isn't really developed yet, and I can't remember a couple of them, so if any of them are stolen I'm stuck. The only ones I remember are the ones for 'Yes, this is you,' and the one for 'Don't trust this guy.'

I'm feeling slightly paranoid about the fact that I can't remember 'Run Away!!!!', 'Play along for now, then run away,' and I really think I /should/ remember those. It's important, you see.

Of course, a system like this isn't proof against Telepathy, but then, what is? Damn those Telepaths.
