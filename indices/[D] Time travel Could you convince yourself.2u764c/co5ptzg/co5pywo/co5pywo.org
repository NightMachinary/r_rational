Depends on how far back you go. You probably don't want to go back to before you were born, as you can't really convince a you that doesn't exist.

And I suppose convincing a child might be easier, but think about this: You have 24 hours. And in that time, presumably, you would need to approach your past parents and convince them to let you interact with their child, and hope they don't prevent you, whether through keeping you away physically, or telling your child self that you must be a crazy person.
