This is along the lines of what I was thinking. I feel like because of my hard belief in time travel being impossible, I wouldn't be able to convince myself in 24 hours. I think I'd posit too many alternate theories.

E.g The government found a lookalike, plastic surgeried him into resembling me, and is attempting some sort of plan that involves my believing said lookalike is me from the future. In addition, barring eidetics, memory's more fluid than most people realize. There's no guarantee that I'll have the exact same memories as my past self. Not enough to break my disbelief in time travel anyway. Not in 24 hours.
