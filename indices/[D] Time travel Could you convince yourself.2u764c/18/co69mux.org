I actually attach pretty high probability to time travel being possible; it's predicted by GR, after all, and the most common objection seems to be "but that would confuse the way I think about causality!" Well, so does all the other implications of relativity.

But, um, I don't have a password set up. Embarassing. I mean, I'd rather not precommit to helong any sod who reads my mind of tortures a clone of me or whatever, but still, it's unfortunate.

Anyway, I'm actually really easy to convince, and I'd probably look pretty similar. I have a bunch of things I haven't told anyone, but those aren't /conclusive/, especially if timetravel is on the playing bard.

Honestly, I think a good conversation would be enough for me to notice we had the exact same personality (I'm pretty weird): an having done that, I'd be an incredibly easy sell on the timetravel thing. Although I probably wouldn't mention the "fade from existence" bit until later, that's fairly specific and strange enough that it seems like a weird manipulation ploy or something. I trust myself.
