You'd have to define "convince". I think it would be hard to convince myself, mostly because the situation sounds insane, and I would keep coming up with alternate hypotheses that also fit the evidence. There are a lot of advanced technologies that would explain someone who looks like me better than time travel. And my double saying that I have to be convinced would read as the setup for being taken advantage of, not to mention fairly nonsensical. Not to mention that he wouldn't be able to predict the future very accurately due to my poor (mostly outsourced) memory.
