If someone came to me now and gave me tomorrow's stock closing prices for 1000 stocks to the exact penny, there are two options: the market is rigged, or this person has some supernatural ability. I would say the time travel hypothesis is still slightly less likely, but combined with knowing personal info about me that no one should know, and future news headlines, it should convince me.
