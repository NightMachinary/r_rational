Am I the only one who expects to have more trouble convincing myself from before age 8 than after? I can probably talk elementary school-me and beyond into anything, especially with all the secret memories and ability to explain how I failed to invent timetravel. But preschool me was a better skeptic than /present/ me, and wouldn't believe crap from some random stranger.

Although the undisclosed memories and thought-processes would be compelling, the end result would be past-me asking an adult's opinion. ... I said preschool me was a skeptic, not that I was good at realizing I shouldn't ask the opinions of people who triggered my skeptic sense half the time.

Anyway, that would end in me needing to convince my father, probably. I can't decide if that'd be harder or easier.
