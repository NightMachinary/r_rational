  Even if I succeed in convincing past-me, I still have to interact with my past and produce a net-positive outcome for it to be worth anything, let alone a 5% chance of death.. and I am very very far from convinced that I can manipulate time with that kind of accuracy.

You wouldn't take a 5% chance of death for a 95% chance of becoming the richest person on Earth (which presumably can be used to further your expected lifespan)? Either that or you don't think time travel can be used that way, which doesn't seem that defensible. Just do the right options on stocks with leverage and you can do it in under a year.
