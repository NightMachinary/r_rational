In response to the edit: if I thought this scenario was at all likely, I would start memorizing proofs and stuff, but as I don't, no luck.

So I still think I could convince myself just using my own secrets. You could choose the date, right?

If it was recently, I would use my passwords, plus the motivations behind them. I've got at least some passphrases not stored anywhere and just used for encryption, so someone knowing those is strong evidence.
