I've spent a lot of time thinking about personal identity and the philosophy of space and time. I think our views differ in slight ways that are relevant to this particular hypothetical. I'll try to keep it brief for you but:

(1) I believe that what makes me "me" is the full set* of decision making heuristics that I would follow for any actual or potential decision.

and

(2) Any physical being that shares a direct temporal link to me is also me.**

So I disagree with "The hypothetical me who didn't make those decisions is probably better off than the current me, but *that person isn't actually me*" Instead I'd say that if I had different knowledge in my past I would have made different decisions, but those decisions would still have been made by me. It's my heuristics even if it's working on a different set of data. If I had been given foreknowledge of my entire life (as it actually in fact worked out) the resulting person would still, in fact, be me.

This also means that yes, if I traveled back in time and told my younger self something that I in fact never experienced and it was significant enough to shake up my younger self's decision making process, the younger version of me /is no longer me/ by the end of the conversation. So I could agree there might be a death of sorts but it would be because I'm breaking the temporal chain between my past and current self and causing a significant change in mental evaluations. The paradoxes here are more time travel than personal identity I think.

Anytime you live your life though and have any significant events you are becoming a different person. In fact, I'd say that any time you have a significant life event and, through self reflection, change your own heuristics for the future, it is the /most free decision you can ever make/. This isn't a detriment it's a benefit of the human condition - we are capable of self-improvement through self-reflection as bayesian decision makers.

Would I want to update my current heuristics with 20 years of additional data at no cost to myself? Of course. The updating is still mine.

*This set is obviously not knowable in full (and honestly might be a class rather than a set, but that's splitting hairs).

** Without this clause or something doing very similar work you have a lot of problems with ethics and punishment.
