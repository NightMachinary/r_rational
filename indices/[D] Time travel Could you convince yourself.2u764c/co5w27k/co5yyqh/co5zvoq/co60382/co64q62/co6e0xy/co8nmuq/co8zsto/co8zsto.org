  Honestly the biggest piece I'm missing is exactly what time of day we had sex in order for my wife to get pregnant.

Consider that seriously, because this sort of thing forms the crux of my objection: isn't your /particular/ daugther a big deal to you? I can pretty much guarantee you won't get the same daughter. Of course, there is nothing optimal about your daughter - she was a genetic dice roll and there is no reason you won't get a better or worse one next time. Yet, would you really erase the currant instance and roll again for a new child?

I guess there are certain things that have happened in my past that are not the best way that things could turn out..but even so, it's my life. It's not the best possible life i could have lived, but it is /mine/, you know? The hypothetical me who didn't make those decisions is probably better off than the current me, but that person /isn't actually me/ and to reverse those decisions would be a death of sorts. I wouldn't want to vanish in that way.

But past-me has the potentiality to become either of those people. Past me does not have any particular affection for any /particular/ instance of future me. Imagine there were /two/ future me's who had gone to different colleges or something, and both wanted to steer past me's towards /their/ respective wives and lives. There is a particular affection that I have for my /particular/ life and wife which has nothing to do with whether or not it and she were optimal and past-me does not necessarily share those particular affections. (In simpler terms, when you really love someone, you no longer /care/ if better opportunities without them are out there)

Of course I would be in a better position than past me to /know/ what is best, but if past-me wants the best possible future and I want /my particular life back/, then we have a conflict of interests.

Are you are /really/ confident that your current life, family, everything... is optimal or even above average relative to how it might turn out for a person who knew all that you know now? And yet...even if you were knowing that it's not, I doubt you'd give up what you have. in exchange...not because what you have is better than the other life, but because what you have is inextricably yours now, even if you wouldn't advice a younger version to walk the same path.

  I think you can ask that about yourself now - would you want the memories and experience of your next 20 years dumped into your head right now?
#+end_quote

I want to point out that you aren't /just/ getting 20 years of experience. You are /becoming a different person/. I assume you get future you's /motives/ along with your experiences.

The /other/ half of this equation is "would you erase the past 20 years and wake up in your younger body, and you now must do things in a /very/ similar way to last time if you ever want to go to anything resembling the home you left behind". Because /that/ what the /other/ half of the person you have become in the moment of the dump is experiencing right now. (Keep in mind, not all moments can be recreated. If winning a basketball game, or rolling a dice, or a specific innocent facial expression you made altered the course of your life, there is no guarantee it will happen the second time around, especially if you make any intentional changes to the timeline. And yeah, there is /no way/ you are getting the exact same daughter, you cannot control egg and sperm to that extent).

However, if you're just asking if present-me would like foreknowledge of everything, while somehow eliminating the complications described above, then hell yeah, who doesn't want free knowledge? (One way to accomplish this is to be able to talk to future selves, and the future selves just go back to their future lives after talking to me, with no vested interest in the matter aside from generally wishing their alternate selves well.)
