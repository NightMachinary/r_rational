Past you doesn't /necessarily/ care about living life according to your time line though.

How would you feel if you got a message from the future telling you that you /must/ have unprotected sex tomorrow at 7:02 am - nevermind if it's really awful timing to have another child - you must do it to preserve the timeline and prevent your future you from losing a child? And even if you would do it...how /far/ would you go, how much potentiality would you be willing to lose, in order to preserve the timeline?

The conflict of interest here is interesting. And then, what if you suddenly get future-you's memories and motivations added to your own immediately upon reaching the time point that future-you went back to visit you? Would you necessarily /want/ those memories, want to change so much in that one instant that you are, in some respects, a different person, who has huge emotional memories of a past which never existed? Would the prospect of eventually having Future-You's soul added to your own motivate you to fulfill Future-You's desires even if they are not /yet/ your own? How different / similar would Future You have to be for you to say no/yes?
