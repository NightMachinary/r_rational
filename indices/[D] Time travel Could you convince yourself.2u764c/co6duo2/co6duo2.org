Even if a doppleganger fould be found, I don't think most people would replicate birthmarks and scars for a joke. I'd believe /something/ weird was happening, and time travel would be high enough on the list of options even before I did any "convincing".

  If you can't, then you fade from existence.

You know, that's .... /scary/? But, at the same time, I do have a back up copy of me, and I've sufficiently dissolved the philosophical weirdness surrounding "souls" and "continuity of self" this to be /okay/ with it even if not particularly happy about it. My level of unhappiness would /mostly/ be a function of the number of memories lost - the little extra dollop of angst from the breaking of continuity, while significant, wouldn't be nearly as bad as /really/ dying.

(Or do they have to go through the same time machine?)
