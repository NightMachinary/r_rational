It shouldn't be hard. I know so much personal info that no one else knows.

Or I could just go back to a date where somethng notable happened and predict it, or do any date with news headlines. The problem is that 24 hours is not a lot of time for predictions; it has to be something you couldn't know otherwise. Stock prices should do nicely.

Or do all of the above.
