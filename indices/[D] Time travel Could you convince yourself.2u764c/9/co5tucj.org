I assume it's reusable? Then I'd think of a serious password, wait 20 minutes, visit past-me just after he thought of the password, and then give it to him. Now he is (and I am) convinced of time travel, so I can use it arbitrarily in the future to visit my past at any point /after/ that time, an extremely powerful tool.

Sure, being able to visit arbitrary points before that would be /more/ useful, but you were already time-limited by your birth, this just moves that limit forward a ways, while allowing you safety from the Great Fade.

I am a little curious though - what is the definition of 'convinced'? A rational person ought to be convinced in some degree by various unlikely events, but the prior probability of time travel of that type existing and /not/ having already thrown the world into significant disarray is significantly low. I can't imagine /any/ evidence that would be sufficient to make me believe with /no doubts/ that this other me is just future-me.
