If we need to stick to the spirit of the question and visit myself from well before receiving the machine, then I'm going to assume that 'convinced' means "assigns more than 50% probability to".

In that case I wouldn't attempt to use the machine, because I can't realistically be more than about 95% confident that I could convince myself of something like that, and my life is already decent enough that a 5% chance of death isn't worth any improvement I can picture achieving via time travel.

Even if I succeed in convincing past-me, I still have to interact with my past and produce a net-positive outcome for it to be worth /anything/, let alone a 5% chance of death.. and I am very /very/ far from convinced that I can manipulate time with that kind of accuracy.
