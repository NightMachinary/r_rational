If it's reusable, I'd find myself in middle school. Old enough to be unsupervised and approachable, gullible enough to be convinced with, I don't know, say, names of childhood crushes. Then if I wanted to use it again, I could just tell any of my past selves after that point, "Hey, remember that other time? Yep, actually happened. No, nothing terrible happens; yes, I /did/ know you were going to ask that" etc etc.

If I complain to my past self about the odd way my device actually works, and it makes him doubt, will his disbelief erase me, or is convincing him of the truth just once enough? Because I would be very tempted to complain to my past self about they way my device appears to work.
