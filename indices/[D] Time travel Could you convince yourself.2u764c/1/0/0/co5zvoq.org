(1) Give myself the resources to get easily rich. It's not hard to give broad things that would work well (timing the housing bubble and subsequent crash for one, bitcoin for another).

(2) I'd hand myself a bunch of envlopes marked "Do Not Open Until After XXX, XX, XXXX" and explain - the reason they are so marked is so that specific important events happen unaffected (like getting together with my wife). I'll point out that they're some safe distance beyond the event ranging from days to months depending on how well I remembered what happened -- so don't worry so much about "oh an envelope is coming up". The idea here is to give specific advice tailored to certain times in my life without wrecking the rest. I could write these up in a few hours. As I know myself, I know I'd actually be able to keep them safe and actually obey my own orders.

I think that's pretty sufficient. If I'd come back to the present and gain the alternate past's memories I presume they'd be mostly similar to what happened with hopefully a bit less unhappiness and a lot more money.
