Past you might not, but past me certainly would have. I know for an absolute fact if I convinced past me that future me believed things were best going in some certain fashion I'd trust future me.

Let me put it another way: there are people in this world who are not me that I would trust and do things that actually /are/ in my worst interests. My wife is one. I'd trust my future self more than even my wife because my future self is evaluating things exactly as I will given the same experiences. If he says some things are not worth giving up no matter the opportunity cost, I would always have trusted him.

The second conflict you post is more interesting. I think I would have taken those memories and motivations along with a decade plus of experience, but I'm not certain about that. I am certain that with time I could convince him to but I'm not sure that's in your hypothetical. Also the memories are of a past that may not have existed - you could still largely bring it about. Depending on the date in at least my personal timeline it would take very little for me to have the same general outline of a life. Honestly the biggest piece I'm missing is exactly what time of day we had sex in order for my wife to get pregnant.

I think you can ask that about yourself now - would you want the memories and experience of your next 20 years dumped into your head right now? I'd take it for certain. There are a lot of things that would be very comforting to know. That neither my wife nor I get a debilitating degenerative disease in the next 20 years? That would be nice to know! My brother finds a girl who is actually good for him in a few years? Great! I'm certain I'd have better perspective on how to raise my daughter, too.
