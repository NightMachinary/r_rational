I feel contradiction in believing that any being who is temporally linked to you is still "You", and yet any major life events makes "you" a different person. Isn't it better to say that there's a spectrum in which beings are closer and farther to "you", and the farther you go the more potential for conflict of interest?

Decision heuristics are one thing, but fundamental changes in preferences are another.

Coming back down from the philosophy level to the object level, practically speaking, what about the daughter thing? Don't you have preference for being with your /particular/ daughter?

Provisionally assuming the answer is "yes", suppose You, IHaveNoTact*B*, exist in future B. There exists an IHaveNoTact*A* in future A. Both of you prefer the company of your respective daughters, because you love them and don't want to swap places.

Now, suppose your past self saw Future A and Future B. Future A seems way more appealing from your past self's perspective. Your past self doesn't care about the differences between Daughter A vs Daughter B - both are wonderful daughters, but Future A also involves being a millionaire, Daughter A having a nicer life, etc, whereas Future B is a struggle to make ends meet.

Now here you are, IHaveNoTact*B* from the future. You have the knowledge that allows your past self to pick Future A or Future B

...Now, let's separate this into Scenario 1,2.

In Scenario 1, you go back to your own Future B, with Daughter b, and live happily in the knowledge that your past self is happily whatever Future they chose. In this case, you'd tell your past self everything you know, and your past self would rationally choose A, and that's cool with you.

In Scenario 2, you travel back in time. Now, you obviously try your hardest to get back to whnFuture B, with your own wife and daughter, but maybe make a few minor changes. Your optimal future now is decidedly /different/ from what PastIHaveNoTact's optimal future would have been.

This is what I mean by "conflict of interest". (There isn't an /actual/ conflict in either of these scenarios - it's just a demonstration of how you and a past self cn have fundamentally divergent preferences about how the future turns out, and that it would be possible to construct hypothetical scenario 3 where both IHaveNoTact*B* /and/ PastIHaveNoTact have to deal with identical consequences for PastIHaveNoTact's actions, informed by IHaveNoTact*B*'s advice , creating a conflict of interest between them. This is the scenario I thought we were in.
