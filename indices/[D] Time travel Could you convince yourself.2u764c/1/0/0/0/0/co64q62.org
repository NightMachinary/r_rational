Most of the stuff I could easily come up with wouldn't give me seriously big money until 2008 or later and that is when I got married.

If the way it worked I could never come back then I'm sorry but I'm not taking you up on the deal - I don't want to leave my wife and daughter like that. I'd go back and give myself the wherewithal to be in a better spot now, but I wouldn't go back and potentially obliterate what I have.
