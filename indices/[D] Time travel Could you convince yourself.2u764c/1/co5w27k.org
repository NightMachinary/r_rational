Doesn't everybody remember enough specific details about their childhood that nobody could remotely copy them? Seriously I could list very detailed random shit and convince myself in under half an hour anytime after age 11 or 12. Even if someone could have known a specific detail or three (depending on the date chosen), nobody could get them all. Even my wife who has heard all of my stories.
