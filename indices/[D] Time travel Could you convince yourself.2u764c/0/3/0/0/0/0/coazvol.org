No, more like, influenced the thoughts you would think by astroturfing links to the right kinds of sci-fi in the right places and planting people in your peer-group to ensure you cultivated an interest in them. Think less fantasy, more gaslighting.

One interesting result from a study I recall: it is very easy to influence what people will choose as a password through priming. This is actually the biggest reason, once you know about it and are at all worried about long-con social engineering as an attack vector, to only rely on RNGed passphrases (put through whatever humanizing encoding as they might be.)
