I have had a password system since high school (about 7 years ago). I think it was a TvTropes page that inspired me. I have multiple passwords and I have planned how many of them I will give to other people if I need to let myself know to trust them. Thus I could also use them if other people are traveling back in time, or in the event of a memory gambit. I also remembered the events that made me think of each password, so if I travel to an alternate reality I can guess at how likely it is for me to have the same password.
