I'd be pretty inclined to trust future me, since I'm a pretty awesome and moral dude. Unless I saw some evidence he'd gone nihilist or something.

It's proving that a due that looks like me and knows what I know is really me from the future instead of a mind-reading shapeshifter that's the problem.

I don't actually believe in ANY of those things, so my worldview would be broken when he showed up... at that point, all of those possibilities become possible...
