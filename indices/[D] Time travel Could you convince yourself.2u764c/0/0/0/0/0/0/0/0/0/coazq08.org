Does NIST use an isolated atomic-decay source (like those in atomic clocks) for the random numbers it publishes on the hour? I'm not sure whether just showing up from the future would cause enough of a "ripple" in gravity or anything else to throw off such a source if it was out on a satellite or something, but if it wouldn't, that's all you need to know.
