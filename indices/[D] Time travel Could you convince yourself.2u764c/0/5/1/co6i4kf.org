I overcame solipsism when I realized I was too stupid to make up some of the world... and too smart to create some of the stupidity.

I think a similar concept without invoking narcissistic qualities is post-positivism. You can't KNOW the full truth, only disprove theories (and this whole exercise asks: how can you disprove that other people aren't just p-zombies or that the duplicate of me is a time traveler from the future?)
