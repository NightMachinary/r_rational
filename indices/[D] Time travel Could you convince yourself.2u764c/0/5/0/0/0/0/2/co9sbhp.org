Maybe it is my inexperience with philosophy but if you believe that you are the only human isn't the term 'human' already meaningless? I mean you could just replace it with "I" and that word doesn't really need a 5 letter synonym.

On the other hand the word 'human' would still always be pretty useful to describe those 4-limbed, upright walking dream figments that you imagine heavily interacting with all the time.
