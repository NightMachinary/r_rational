Except that you /do/ perceive "stuff". Which gives you a reason to believe in yourself experiencing something. What "yourself" and "something" are and how/why you experience can be up to debate, but without it you couldn't, well, deny that you may be experiencing something.

Other than by, you know, being a figment of /my/ imagination maybe. But /something/ must be experiencing or else all this around us couldn't be experienced, which so far as I know, it is.
