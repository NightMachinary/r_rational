Arcane Ascension is more than a three book series, which is why I'm taking a break (and planning to take more breaks). It was originally planned to be six books, and I expect it to be at least that many, if not more.

I'm glad you're excited to see more of Corin - and there'll be plenty more of him in the future. =)

Thanks!
