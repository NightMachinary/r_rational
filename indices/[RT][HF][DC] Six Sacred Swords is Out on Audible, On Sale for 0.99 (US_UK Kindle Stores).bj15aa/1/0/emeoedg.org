  So I am in the middle of reading On The Shoulders of Giants. Would you recommend I finish that and then start this?

Yeah, I'd finish that first, as long as you're enjoying it. There are a couple things from the end of OTSoT that are relevant in small ways.

  Also, if it wouldnt bother you too much, what is the War of Broken Mirrors about? It sounds like the Lightbringer series from just the title

WoBM is a little more of a Western RPG style, rather than a JRPG style. It's also multi-perspective rather than focusing on a single character.

The first book follows three characters in the city of Orlyn, where the local gods claim to be able to raise anyone to divine status if they earn it through sufficient service.

The three perspectives are:

- Taelien, a wandering swordsman with a powerful weapon he can't properly control. He's searching for answers about his heritage, which may be divine in origin.
- Lydia, a court sorcerer for the city of Orlyn. Minor spoilers since this is revealed very quickly, but she's actually a paladin from another nation investigating the claims of the local faith.
- Jonan, an illusionist and spy from a nearby country, who claims to be investigating the disappearance of a group of children.

There's a stronger component of intrigue to these books than my other novels, and they're generally more serious in tone. It's hard to say if an Arcane Ascension reader will like them, but they're in the same universe.
