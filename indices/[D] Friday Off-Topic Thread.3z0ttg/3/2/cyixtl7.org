That depends on what you find crazy about it. Most of us on rational are atheists so if you're trying to explain why religions are mostly nonsense I'd take some notes from Dawkins book the God Delusion, which is full of arguments against religion. However I'm guessing what you actually mean is you can't see how someone who is religious could be anything but a duelist. I think I would ask him that if he believes their to be an afterlife what does he think goes their if he believes everything is based on physical things. Or basically since he doesn't believe in a part of you outside of the physical then how could he also believe in an afterlife
