He had a tendency of deleting his old fics when he wanted to rewrite them. I have an older draft of "hypothesis space" on my ipod from back when he posted it on FF.net as "People Whom the Stars Watch". It's a shame that he pulled it down again. He's a good writer and gave me advice on one of my fanfics.
