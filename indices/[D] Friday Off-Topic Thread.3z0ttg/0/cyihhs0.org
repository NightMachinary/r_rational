Does anyone know something about the user writingathing? He used to write things in [[/r/rational][r/rational]] but seems to have disappeared. I only noticed because I was browsing older threads on [[/r/rational][r/rational]], found one of his threads and the next day his username was [deleted].

I'd also like to know if "Avatar Korra Punches Her Way Through the Hypothesis Space" exists or existed. It's something he wrote (or was writing) but I can't find it.

He wrote the parody of the chapter of HPMOR where Harry realised something important (not spoiling). So I am kind of interested.
