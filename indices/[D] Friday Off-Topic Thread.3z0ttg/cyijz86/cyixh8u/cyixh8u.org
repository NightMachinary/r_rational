I don't have a quote for this, but I believe in an interview Richard Dawkins mentioned how he doesn't argue with people with crazy opinions because the mere act of arguing with them gives them the(false) impression that their beliefs are valid enough to have a discussion about. However you are right that by simply ignoring them they are more likely to convince other people you know. Ideally the solution would be to convince your friends/family members of rational opinions beforehand and just trust that after that you can ignore the one person with crazy opinions but that doesn't work if you only see these people on rare occasions.
