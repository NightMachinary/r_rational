What's your default choice of actions for dealing with [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhGuXCuDb1U][people who consistently convey misconceptions in social gatherings?]]

Engaging in a debate can be grate because there's a chance your opponent will reveal a misconception that /you/ were unintentionally holding to, tell you something altogether new that you weren't aware of, or that you'll simply make a new acquaintance. But this is mostly applicable to cases where your opponent's reasoning is not a complete mess of logical fallacies and a screwed worldview.

With certain people, however, trying to have a well-structured argument won't work simply because the very “laws” by which they judge what should be accepted as true and what should not differ from what you are using. If you try to disprove [misconception 1] they've been voicing, they can simply support their reasoning by mentioning an additional [misconception 2]. If you switch focus and target this new one, they bring [yet another one], and so on.

More than that, even valid facts you both are aware of will often be interpreted very differently. A scientific study reporting that [[http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2013/12/01/mice-inherit-specific-memories-because-epigenetics/][mice can inherit specific smell “memories” from their parents,]] for example, can be used to leap to conclusions such as reincarnation, nations having “souls”, one nation being superior to others by default, and so on.

Trying to prove such a person wrong will likely result in a debate that's all over the place --- even more so when the opponent intentionally drags it out to milk as much attention out of it for soap-boxing as possible. Not to mention that everyone in general doesn't want to be arguing about anything at all --- that's not what holiday party gatherings are supposed to be about.

The wise thing to do, I reckon, should be to just shut up and let them continue voicing their bullshit opinions. But this contains the risk of contaminating your social environment even further because [[http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2006/05/popular-opinion.aspx][people who talk the loudest without being proven wrong are the most effective at changing the opinions of their peers.]]

So, getting back to the initial question: what do you think is the optimal and most effective way of dealing with these kinds of problem?
