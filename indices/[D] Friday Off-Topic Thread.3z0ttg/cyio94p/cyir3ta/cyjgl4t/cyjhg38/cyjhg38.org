Right. Well, the characters are usually clever, and go about achieving their goals in ways that make sense, although I think it's fair to criticise a few of his villains as sometimes evil for evil's sake. The Begums Millions villain is a German racist industrialist hellbent on world domination who enjoys polluting and researching ever more destructive weapons.
