I absolutely loved him as a kid. Haven't read anything of his in a decade. I remember reading that he took extra care to make all the numbers he used (distances, measurements, etc) as realistic as possible, but early translators just changed the units and kept the numbers in many places, butchering the science.

If you haven't read it, I highly suggest /The Begums Millions/. Among other things, it's got the first instance of chemical weapons in all of fiction, in the form of projectiles filled with compressed carbon dioxide that freezes and suffocates.
