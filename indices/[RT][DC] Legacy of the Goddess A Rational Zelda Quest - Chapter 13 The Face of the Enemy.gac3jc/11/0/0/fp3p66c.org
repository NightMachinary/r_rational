Thanks for bringing up most of my concerns about the details of the potential experiments. I'd just add that the fragments have been able to influence things /before/ an event that tries to take it away from a bonded individual (Zelda's locket broke before Vesyrn tried to steal her wisdom fragments so he only stole the bracers and the chain the locket should have been attached to.) So the catapult could suffer a malfunction because something broke the night before.

A couple other points that make me very reluctant to do this.

If we screw it up, we've lost a fragment. That is /really, really/ bad.

This is a Cosmere crossover, and a fragment is probably a fragment of a Shard. We've seen Shard bearers predict the future, but they've also made some pretty serious errors when predicting the future. The examples are obviously spoilers so I won't list them out. Basically, even though the bearers had a much more potent divination tool, it still didn't work perfectly. Therefore, I'd expect a single fragment be much less able to predict the future. Indeed the Wisdom shards give vague prophetic dreams which is much weaker than what a full Shard could do.

Another thing I'm worried about, is that the fragments have a limited amount of power they're already doing some pretty useful things and I'd hate to make those effects weaker.

Edit: On a reread of the latest chapter, Link thinks it's odd he just stands there after the Lynx throws his fragment out the window. I think the fragment was pushing Link to be in the right place at the right time to retrieve the fragment.
