Spoilers for Mistborn books 1-3

I can't help but see parallels between preservation and Hylia. Both "Died" but much of their power was left in the world, preservation's as the mist and Hylia's as the Triforce. Gathering the Triforce could be a way to channel the remaining power, similar to the well of ascension.

As for the Triforce- I'm getting a monopoly vibe here, as in the first person to get a full set is likely to win. Luckily we one of each already, so that's something.

I wonder who we have who could bind with the power fragment? We should ask Fi what qualities make a person compatible, and if anybody we've met has those qualities as far as she can tell. Though if it switches to a better candidate when it meets one, I think we'll have a hard time finding somebody more compatible with power fragments than Ganondorf is.
