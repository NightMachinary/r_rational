  I mean yeah but it's like... literally religion for him. Gods actually exist in this reality, but we've been outright told that the one god we're aware of that has their hands in this particular nation-state's affairs is dead as of the start of the story (earlier? I might have forgotten) so that's kind of not a thing.

Hylia was apparently dead prior to stories, if the Lynx is correct - but still taking actions (e.g. empowering Zelda) /after/ being dead. This is a cosmere crossover; dead gods can still have a lot of influence, either directly or indirectly. (I suspect we're probably dealing with a [[https://coppermind.net/wiki/Cognitive_Shadow][cognitive shadow]] of Hylia.) Also, we've got the fae in play, which are also fragments of Hylia (irrc) - and Fi, too, who we don't really understand completely at this point.

Precognition is a thing in-universe, too, so we don't know how much Hylia could have already planned for.

  Frankly, this is the only reason why I'm not coming down extremely hard on pursuing this - it's literally a noted mechanic. But like... what have we got to show for it? Would we have gotten more for that VP elsewhere?

Well, we do have the Cane of Byrna's Invigorate effect. Instant stamina recovery could be extremely important in specific situations.

And, perhaps more importantly, we have foundations for other forms of research we can still pursue.

Finally, knowing what /isn't/ viable is also pretty important.

Whether or not those points would have been better off being used for something else is hard to say. At this point, I don't feel like we've explored the system enough to make any decisions in regards to the overall usefulness of research.
