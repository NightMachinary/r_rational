It's bizarre that Hyrule doesn't know how to contact them, but we tried to have Zelda do so in one of the first chapters. The QM response was Zelda doesn't know how to contact them.

My plan has Zelda try to locate Goron settlements from previous contacts or just sending out a scouting party. I'm hoping the problem was just us being too terse and not offering an actual plan for Zelda to enact.
