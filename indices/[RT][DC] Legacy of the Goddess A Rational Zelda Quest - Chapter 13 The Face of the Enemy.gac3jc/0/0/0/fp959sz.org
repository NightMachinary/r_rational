  We've tried to contact the Gorons, but Hyrule apparently has no clue on how to talk to them. They also seem to have no knowledge of any other civilizations out there.

How does this even happen that a nation has no clue about its neighbors? Can we just... send a scouting party out blindly or something?

Yeah, and I actually thought of that while I was writing the top level comment here. But my unstated question still stands: why are we getting caught off guard? Why are we losing? How do we fix these problems? (We're losing because we're getting caught off guard and we're dramatically outnumbered if I remember right - but the question is worth asking, I think, as it might uncover a solution.)

As for the rest, agreed.
