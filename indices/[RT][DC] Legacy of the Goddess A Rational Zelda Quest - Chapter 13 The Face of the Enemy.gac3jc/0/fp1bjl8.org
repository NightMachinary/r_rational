I've only started reading this recently so I don't know what the prior discussions have looked like, but I have a question: How big of a deal is... /narrative/ weight in this setting? Like, the whole story is usually "link gets the Master Sword and goes and seals away the evil" but I'm pretty darn confident that's not gonna pan out here unless the sword happens to actually work that way... I don't really know where I'm going with this thought.

I'm getting the impression from the repeated failed attempts at research and distinct lack of magical tools and how none of the existing spells and things are freakishly powerful and exploitable. The first prelude chapter shows Zelda's plans at trying to use Green magic to increase crop yield and it's /barely working/. My gut says that trying to drive for a coincidental perfect cure-all exploit or spell is barking up the wrong tree, as tempting as it seems to us here given the sort-of [[/r/rational]] shared munchkin background.

I propose that we should try to place more emphasis on a more conventional approach to solving our kingdom's problems. What assets do we have? What problems do we have? What are the priorities for the problems? Diplomatic envoys - can we send someone else to do the talking? We have an entire kingdom and we're just letting it /sit there/ while some unMarked NPCs run the thing. Surely we can come up with some nifty ideas in that department to better our relations with any allies in the region?

--------------

Further brainstorming:

Someone probably has a big list of problems and assets somewhere, (is [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XAcqTsEhNs9l0y_ttb9Vhv5kfQwq4qzdQCVmtqMaoSk/edit][this]] up to date?) but if not, I'll try to throw some out there - unless there's a list with this stuff already out there, please let me know if I'm missing stuff.

Problems:

- Ja'Bu
- Ganondorf
- Demise
- Vesyrn?
- Diplomatic relations with Shesan
- Hyrule is under... attack?

Assets:

- Military - normal footsoldiers. What have they been doing? Are there any inefficiencies (too many deployed somewhere)? Would we get value siphoning off a small portion of the military to enact a campaign somewhere we aren't kidding? I don't know what this would look like, and I don't know if it's been discussed before.
- Sheikah - we apparently desperately need intelligence. Do we have spies? Scouts? We didn't know this Ganondorf thing was happening until just a little while ago, and don't have any open lines of communications to the Gorons(?) or to anyone in the Lost Woods, Dremen Valley... etc. What's happening over there? Can we send Sheikah to check? Or should we send diplomats?
- Other personnel, like diplomats? ___ The world map is massive, and we only have vision into about a 6th of it. How can we get more info? That's a lot of space for potential allies and threats to just be sitting around with us unaware of them.
