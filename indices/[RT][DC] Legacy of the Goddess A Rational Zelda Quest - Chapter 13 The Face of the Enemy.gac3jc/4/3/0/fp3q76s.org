I'd prefer Zelda goes back to Castletown. Organize an expedition to see what calamity has wrecked the Gorons and +kicking the homeless Zora off our lawn+ helping the Zora recover their own kingdom. I think Zelda needs to be in person to do that because the kingdom is in really bad shape and the NPCs are going to be really reluctant to 'waste' valuable resources on not putting out their own fires.
