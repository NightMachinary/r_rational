  Infodumps and dry conversations aren't usually fun to read or write. I and the other QMs are of course going to do our damnedest to make every chapter as engaging as possible and keep the plot moving. However, that becomes increasingly difficult when we are constrained by player agency saying "have more meetings and talk about things at great length without actually doing anything that might progress the plot." That just translates to more effort on our end to keep things engaging, which means (among other things) lower update frequency.

I'll go ahead and reframe my stuff toward an action plan and put the questions in a separate, optional section for you and the other QMs to address if you feel it's narrative appropriate and fun to write.

  Another point: there is more than enough information given to answer some of these questions yourselves. There are so many details that no one seems to pick up on (hint hint wink wink nudge nudge). If you (players) put in the work to come up with reasonable hypotheses to present to NPCs during info-gathering attempts (as opposed to just scattershotting questions and hoping to be fed the answers), not only will you get more out of the conversations, but we (QMs) will reward you for it with substantially higher VP bonuses.

Something I've found when running my own games over the years, both in terms of my own quest and other formats, is that players will /rarely/ pick up on the specific subtle hints that a Game Master expects them to. Different people think about situations very differently, and I'm always flummoxed when I find people on my subreddit talking about the most obscure details I didn't think anyone would find, but missing things that I considered extremely obvious.

As a player, I'm certainly happy to go back and dig for some more clues, but it's very easy for us to miss things that may seem like they're super obvious from a QM perspective. It's simply not obvious to players which details are relevant in the same way it is to someone who has the high-level view a QM does.

  This isn't to say actions will ever be free of consequence. That is emphatically not the case. I am however explicitly stating that inaction will result in poorer outcomes than taking any reasonable course of action. To put it another way: voting in (some sane variant of) any of the default options at this juncture will result in better outcomes (both IC and OOC) than a plan that does nothing but blindly ask questions of NPCs or which takes a "wait and see" approach.

Understood, thank you for the clarification on this. It's very important and appreciated.
