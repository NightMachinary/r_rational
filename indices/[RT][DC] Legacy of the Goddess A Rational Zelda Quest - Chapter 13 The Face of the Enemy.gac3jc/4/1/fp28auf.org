I agree on the questions to shesan. However, given the QM's repeated admonitions that we need to /do/ /stuff/ or we're forked, maybe we can meld some of that into an actionable plan:\\
What I'd say is, keep the questions but outline some plans of action and discuss them with Shesan. Presumably that discussion will also give some relevant information. I also proppose this because I assume orienting plans to action makes the chapters more fun to write, but I don't know if that's true.
