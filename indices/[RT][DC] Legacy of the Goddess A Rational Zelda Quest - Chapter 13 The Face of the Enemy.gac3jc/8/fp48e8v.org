[*Plan: Spire of the Sands*]

This plan takes some of the discussion items I'd compiled before and shifts them into an action-focused format. The discussion items below the action section are optional for QMs to address in the story at their discretion. My attempt at prioritizing them is based on my own ideas of what may be relevant to our immediate plans, but QMs may choose to ignore this prioritization if it is convenient or more fun for them.

If some of the actions below are boring to write, please feel free to summarize/hand-waive that they occurred.

*Action:*

- Combine maps with Shesan and put points of interest (e.g. potential fragment locations and Link's vision locations) on the map. Attempt to plan an efficient route to visit these various locations safely and rapidly. The plan is to go to the *Obsidian Spire* first on the list, and the route should take that into account.
- Mark down what we believe Ganondorf's current location is on the map. Discuss his goals and his own likely route, as well as methods we could take to potentially interfere with his progress prior to a direct confrontation.
- Discuss that Link's visions probably qualify as *The Champion's Trials* mentioned in Chapter III. Discuss knowledge of these trials that may be relevant, such as whether specific supplies are commonly needed for the puzzles and threats. Pick up needed supplies for a trial while in town.
- Spend a day discussing things with Shesan, resting, and restocking supplies. During/after that discussion, propose that Shesan accompany your group. Use time to discuss high priority items related to the spire itself and any threats that may be encountered along the journey.
- If Shesan is willing to accompany the group, ask more questions on the journey.
- Propose Marking Shesan as soon as we have sufficient Divine Power as a symbol of an alliance between your factions. Use this as a chance to also discuss what Shesan knows about Marks, Divine Power, and Old Magic.
- Head to the Obsidian Spire. Bring everyone (Link, Zelda, sheikah, Shesan if willing). Make camp outside. Current plan is for Link to enter with a group of sheikah. If legends indicate that a Lightsworn candidate must enter alone, take that into account. If the group feels that entering in full force is better, that is also acceptable. Let Link's tactical knowledge and info learned from Shesan about Morudo Geira inform this choice.

*Sheikah Allocation:*

- Get a message to sheikah that is trailing Vesryn to see if they can rendezvous with Vesryn and make a truce. Order the sheikah to cooperate with Vesryn in the search for the fragments, but to keep an eye on him. Make sure Shesan simultaneously contacts Vesryn to let him know we are combining our efforts. If Shesan has no way of contacting Vesryn, simply call our sheikah off the search for Vesryn instead and reallocate them - we don't want a bloody mess if they try to make contact and it turns into a fight.
- Arrange for a sheikah escort for Golvara to meet with us and consolidate our knowledge fragments.

*Discussion with Shesan - High Priority:*

- Ask if Morudo Geira's could have formed a new avatar by now, and if so, what Shesan knows about how Gandondorf defeated it (and if there are any other strengths and weaknesses she knows about it). We should get as much info as possible if we want to hit that location.
- Share what we already know about the capabilities of groups of Wisdom shards. See if she knows anything about the benefits of groups of Power and Courage shards.
- Explain what we know about Marks and that we feel that marking additional entities to generate Divine Power rapidly is a part of our plan. See if she is willing to assist us with this process and if she has any ideas on how to do this more efficiently.
- Discuss our general understanding of Fi's abilities and Old Magic. See if she knows anything that could be useful for creating the foundation of new spells.
- Have Link ask Shesan if she knows anything about the current location and powers of the Sword of Evil's Bane. It sounds like the type of thing we might want to have against an entity as powerful as Demise, and Link would probably love having a magic sword. If we can find out where it may be located, put it on the map as a potential place to visit. If we believe there are prerequisites to claiming it, we can defer visiting it until after those prerequisites (e.g. being a full Lightsworn) are met.

*Discussion with Shesan - Medium Priority:*

- What can Shesan tell us about her own magic? She gave us a vision - how did that work? She knows a lot about us - is that through divination magic? What are the limits of it?
- Does her own form of magic offer any unique abilities that might help us reach fragments before Ganondorf, like flight or teleportation?
- Shesan mentioned that she did not think we could bond to the shards of power. Why? What are the criteria for bonding with them? Who does she think would be an eligible candidate?
- Ask what she knows about Fi's capabilities and nature that we may not already be aware of.

*Discussion with Shesan - Low Priority:*

- Discuss famous items that may be disguised fragments, e.g. The Lover's Rings or The Golden Gauntlets. Does Shesan have any information on them?
- Get a list of sheikah agents that were working with Vesryn from Shesan. Make sure Fi is present when we are given the list. Compare to our list from Fi defections. See if we made any mistakes in our trusted agents list.
- Ask what she knows about Lightsworn. What can she tell us about the egg? The process of becoming a Lightsworn? The capabilities we should expect a Lightsworn to have?
- Ask her what she knows about Ja'bu.

*Other:*

- Depending on how large of a time period the next chapter covers, I'd like to begin testing if Zelda can safely transfer mana to Fi, and if so, if we could start a chain of transferring "excess" mana from others (e.g. sheikah) through Zelda and Link to Fi with the goal of gathering additional Void Power each day through this "excess" power. If Shesan is accompanying us, she if she can contribute to this process (either in terms of knowledge or adding more people we can use for VP farming).

*Personal Research*

- Perform personal research from the prior chapter, as discussed [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/g6dqi0/rtdc_legacy_of_the_goddess_a_rational_zelda_quest/folj79u?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x][here]].
