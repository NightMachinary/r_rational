...Well, that was certainly something.

You can assume Link & Fi updated Zelda regarding the Triforce fragments.

*What do you do next?*

- So about that Ja'bu situation...
- Maybe it's best if we prioritize stopping Ganondorf from completing the Triforce of Power?
- But what about the Spire? Don't we want to make Link a full Lightsworn? How else can he hope to face Demise?
- Or we could try and find more Wisdom fragments. There's Vesyrn, and also Zelda's dreams...
- Maybe Shesan has more to say? ¯\/(ツ)//¯
