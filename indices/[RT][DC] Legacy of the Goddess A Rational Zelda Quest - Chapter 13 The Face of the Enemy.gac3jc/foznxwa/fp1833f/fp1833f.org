Depending on the mechanism we'll get some kind of a "do not mess with time" bleed-off thing that prevents some of these from working - for example:

#+begin_quote
  Hand the fragment to someone. Request that they not hand it back unless they see [something] in the next hour. Or the next day. Or the next week.
#+end_quote

This can be circumvented by someone stealing the fragment and bringing it back to us.

#+begin_quote
  We tie the fragment to a rock, and load it in a catapult. We point that at the sea. We give a soldier instructions to fire the catapult unless we guess a number between one and six, which he has written down. We roll a die, and tell the soldier that number.
#+end_quote

The unstated assumption here is that the fragment is unrecoverable in this context - but Zoras exist, so it would be relatively easy for there to just /coincidentally/ be a Zora hanging around who grabs the fragment and returns it to us.

Overall I guess I'd say that I think your general assertion is correct:

#+begin_quote
  We need to figure out how that pump works, what sort of timescales it operates under, what changes it prefers making.
#+end_quote

but there's so many little ways we can be screwed over and the pump defeated without actually getting useful information out of it... this feels like a situation where we're fighting an uphill battle cheating the system. Using the things as oracles feels like... it doesn't fit /thematically/ with the kind of story Vecht is telling.

Maybe I'm wrong - maybe we spend a few hours one day trying it out, seeing what happens - but I gamble it'll get shut down fast and we'll need to solve things in a more conventional manner.
