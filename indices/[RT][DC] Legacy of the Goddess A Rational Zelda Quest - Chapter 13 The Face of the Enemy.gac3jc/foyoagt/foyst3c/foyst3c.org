Some actual rules for voting this time! I feel this is probably necessary given the divergence of possible paths from this point.

For your post to count as a plan, include "[Plan]" somewhere at the top of your post.

To indicate your assent to a plan, reply to it stating your approval. One vote per plan per person.

(If things look like sockpuppet accounts they will be ignored.)
