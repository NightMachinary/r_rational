  I strongly prefer splitting Zelda and Link up at this point, if visiting the spire takes more than a few days. Send him and a few Sheikah to check it out, and have Zelda stay with Shesan, offer her a mark if she desires one.

I feel like we miss out on the potential VP income of sending Zelda along to do "heroic" things if we're just going to keep her sitting in one spot.

Maybe we could convince Shesan to come with us and discuss things while we travel, then just park Shesan and Zelda outside while Link goes in with Sheikah?

I suppose the main downside of this would be if Link and the sheikah could travel significantly faster without Zelda, but I don't get the impression that is the case, since they're all limited by horse speed and endurance.

  I'd also like to ask Shesan if she knows anything of Old Magic. Zelda's dreams indicate that it's important that she learns of it. That aside, asking after anything from which Fi could create her own spells would be good too.

Good call. Will add that.
