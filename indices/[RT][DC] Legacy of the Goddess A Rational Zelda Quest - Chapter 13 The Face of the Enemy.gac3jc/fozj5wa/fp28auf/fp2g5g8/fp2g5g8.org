  I also proppose this because I assume orienting plans to action makes the chapters more fun to write, but I don't know if that's true.

All the yes.

As players, sure, yes, you need information. I get that. However, even setting aside in-universe time constraints, you have to remember this is a story first. That is, its primary function is to engage readers.

Infodumps and dry conversations aren't usually fun to read or write. I and the other QMs are of course going to do our damnedest to make every chapter as engaging as possible and keep the plot moving. However, that becomes increasingly difficult when we are constrained by player agency saying "have more meetings and talk about things at great length without actually doing anything that might progress the plot." That just translates to more effort on our end to keep things engaging, which means (among other things) lower update frequency.

Another point: there is more than enough information given to answer some of these questions yourselves. There are /so many details/ that no one seems to pick up on (/hint hint wink wink nudge nudge/). If you (players) put in the work to come up with reasonable hypotheses to present to NPCs during info-gathering attempts (as opposed to just scattershotting questions and hoping to be fed the answers), not only will you get more out of the conversations, but we (QMs) will reward you for it with substantially higher VP bonuses.

On the same note, if you come up with intelligent ideas on your own as to how to solve or make progress on the various problems facing you -- including going out on a limb and putting forth preferred options -- you will get /far/ more out of planning conversations with NPCs than just blindly asking them how they think you should proceed. (Also you will get more VP.)

Also also, and most importantly, I will be more motivated to write and get updates out sooner.

This isn't to say actions will ever be free of consequence. That is emphatically not the case. I am however explicitly stating that inaction will result in poorer outcomes than taking any reasonable course of action. To put it another way: voting in (some sane variant of) any of the default options at this juncture will result in better outcomes (both IC and OOC) than a plan that does nothing but blindly ask questions of NPCs or which takes a "wait and see" approach.

In summary: you are absolutely correct on this point, and without straying outside the confines of simulationism, the QMs will find ways to reward proactivity.

Plz do stuff.

+10 points to you for bringing this up.
