Great update. Congratulations on crossing 100k words!

I'll probably throw together a plan at some point, but I'd like to get some discussion going with other readers first.

Some current bullet points I'm thinking about:

Talk with Shesan:

- Have Link fill Zelda in on what we've learned.
- Wait until Zelda is feeling better, then have another group discussion with Shesan.
- What can Shesan tell us about her own magic? She gave us a vision - how did that work? She knows a lot about us - is that through divination magic? What are the limits of it?
- Does her own form of magic offer any unique abilities that might help us reach fragments before Ganondorf, like flight or teleportation?
- Shesan mentioned that she did not think we could bond to the shards of power. Why? What are the criteria for bonding with them? Who does she think would be an eligible candidate?
- What does she think Ganondorf's plan is? How does he play into this?
- Discuss famous items that may be disguised fragments, e.g. The Lover's Rings or The Golden Gauntlets. Does Shesan have any information on them?
- Ask if she knows anything about the current location and powers of the Sword of Evil's Bane. It sounds like the type of thing we might want to have against an entity as powerful as Demise.
- Ask what she knows about Fi's capabilities and nature that we may not already be aware of.
- Ask what she knows about how Hylea's marks work, especially in regards to generating Divine Power. Our capabilities are significantly improved if we can generate Divine Power more rapidly.
- Ask if Morudo Geira's could have formed a new avatar by now, and if so, what she knows about how Gandondorf defeated it (and if there are any other strengths and weaknesses she knows about it). We should get as much info as possible if we want to hit that location.
- Ask what she knows about Lightsworn. What can she tell us about the egg? The process of becoming a Lightsworn? The capabilities we should expect a Lightsworn to have?
- Ask what she knows about Old Magic, both in terms of using it and things that could be useful foundations for spell construction.
- Ask her what she knows about Ja'bu.

Sheikah:

- If possible, get a message to sheikah to see if they can rendezvous with Vesryn and make a truce. Order the sheikah to cooperate with Vesryn in the search for the fragments, but to keep an eye on him. Make sure Shesan simultaneously contacts Vesryn to let him know we are combining our efforts. If Shesan has no way of contacting Vesryn, simply call our sheikah off the search for Vesryn instead and reallocate them - we don't want a bloody mess if they try to make contact and it turns into a fight.
- Discuss with Shesan: Possibly arrange for a sheikah escort for Golvara to meet with us and consolidate our knowledge fragments.
- Get a list of sheikah agents that were working with Vesryn from Shesan. Make sure Fi is present when we are given the list. Compare to our list from Fi defections. See if we made any mistakes in our trusted agents list.

Route:

- Combine maps with Shesan and put points of interest (e.g. potential fragment locations and Link's vision locations) on the map. Attempt to plan an efficient route to visit these various locations safely and rapidly. For example, if the Obsidian Spire is the current closest spot, figure out what the next closest point of interest is and plan on going there next.
- We need to discuss if we want to split our forces. At the moment, I still lean toward keeping Link and Zelda in one place, but we may want to Mark another high-end combatant of some kind that can race Ganondorf for Fragments of Power.

Marks:

- We should consider if we want to mark Shesan next (assuming she's even interested).

Other:

- Depending on how large of a time period the next chapter covers, I'd like to begin testing if Zelda can safely transfer mana to Fi, and if so, if we could start a chain of transferring "excess" mana from others (e.g. sheikah) through Zelda and Link to Fi with the goal of gathering additional Void Power each day through this "excess" power.
