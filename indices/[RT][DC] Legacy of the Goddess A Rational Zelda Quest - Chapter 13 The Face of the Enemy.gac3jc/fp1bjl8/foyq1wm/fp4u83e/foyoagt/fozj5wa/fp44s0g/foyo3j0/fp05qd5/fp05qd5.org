Well, if Ganondorf already has 5/9ths of a triforce, I think it is imperative that we get at least one power fragment to prevent him from having a whole set. I don't know what just the Power triforce can do without Courage and Wisdom, but I'd also rather not find out.

Given the theming of forests=courage, lakes=wisdom, and mountains=power*, it's probably a power fragment the Gorons have. Acquiring and/or securing it should be our highest medium-term priority.

*I don't know if this is known in canon myths/folklore, or if I'm just bringing meta knowledge into this.
