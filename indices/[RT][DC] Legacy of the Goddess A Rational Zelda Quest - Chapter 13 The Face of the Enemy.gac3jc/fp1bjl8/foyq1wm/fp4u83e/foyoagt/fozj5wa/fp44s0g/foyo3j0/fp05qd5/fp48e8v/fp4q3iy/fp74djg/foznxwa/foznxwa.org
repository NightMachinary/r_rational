Okay. We know that Triforce fragments have bullshit levels of power to return to their owners. It will come back even if you want it gone.

I propose the following experiment. We tie the fragment to a rock, and load it in a catapult. We point that at the sea. We give a soldier instructions to fire the catapult unless we guess a number between one and six, which he has written down. We roll a die, and tell the soldier that number.

Repeat a few times. If we keep guessing correctly, up the number of dice. If we start getting like 10d6 accurate every time, assume we have a fairly strong oracle.

If we get 100d6, assume invincibility.

If it does work like that, we are capable of solving np problems in O(1).

Math and codebreaking can be guided by the catapult oracle. So can chemistry.

OOH! this might work too.

Hand the fragment to someone. Request that they not hand it back unless they see [something] in the next hour. Or the next day. Or the next week.

Hand the fragment to someone. Request that they not hand it back unless they win a competition against a matched opponent, then an over matched opponent.

Have someone else place a marker in a forest, and fire the fragment from a catapult. Commit to only retrieving fragment if the catapult landed near the marker.

I've got a bunch of ideas. Generate rain by throwing it into a deep, dry, abandoned well, tied to something buoyant.

The point is, the fragments most impressive power is the nigh unbeatable probability pump tied to them. We need to figure out how that pump works, what sort of timescales it operates under, what changes it prefers making.

Care should be taken. At some point, it might just decide to kill the bonded individual, because that is easier then pulling the fragment out of the mineshaft you just collapsed.
