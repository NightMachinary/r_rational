I strongly prefer splitting Zelda and Link up at this point, if visiting the spire takes more than a few days. Send him and a few Sheikah to check it out, and have Zelda stay with Shesan, offer her a mark if she desires one.

I'd also like to ask Shesan if she knows anything of Old Magic. Zelda's dreams indicate that it's important that she learns of it. That aside, asking after anything from which Fi could create her own spells would be good too.
