Also, at this point I think I would separate Link and Zelda: if lightsworn are as powerful as they seem, Link should go to the spire and see what's up. Regarding Zelda, not only can her time be better spent, it seems that going with Link (and a team, I guess) to Morudo Geira's lair is actually less safe than being in many other places.

(I'll be more proactive in propposing stuff to do as soon as I have time!)
