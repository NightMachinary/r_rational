Some of my favorite chapters in things I'm reading (Delve, Forge of Destiny, etc.) are based around when characters just sit around and chat about the world and systems. That said, the QMs apparently agree with you in this particular case, and thus I will tune any actual plan toward action and put the questions in a prioritized section where the QMs can pick and choose which to answer.
