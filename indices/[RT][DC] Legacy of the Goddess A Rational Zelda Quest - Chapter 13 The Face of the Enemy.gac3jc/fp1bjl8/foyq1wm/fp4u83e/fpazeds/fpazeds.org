I support this plan.\\

  Of your six Sheikah:

  Koja: Very strong green. Specializes in healing and ranged combat (magic).\\
  Malg: Moderate blue / Moderate red. Specializes in recon and infiltration.\\

For Link's travel, I feel that a squad of three Sheikah and Link is appropriate. Recommend:

Red - Grenja, melee combat\\
Blue - Laylith, Recon, ranged combat\\
Green - Koja, Healing, ranged combat\\
And then, of course, Link. A badass.
