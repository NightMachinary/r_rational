  I've only started reading this recently so I don't know what the prior discussions have looked like, but I have a question: How big of a deal is... narrative weight in this setting? Like, the whole story is usually "link gets the Master Sword and goes and seals away the evil" but I'm pretty darn confident that's not gonna pan out here unless the sword happens to actually work that way... I don't really know where I'm going with this thought.

Unclear. Link certainly seems to believe in narrative weight, at least in the respect that he has a degree of religious faith that appears to correspond to some degree with the traditional Zeldaish meta-narrative. Whether or not any of this is actually "Hylea's will", as well as whether or not we're dealing with any narrative causality, is something we don't know a lot about yet.

I'm particularly interested in knowing whether or not we're going to put ourselves at a disadvantage if we try to send non-Link characters into dungeons. I don't think we have any real answers on that yet. My current leaning is toward trying to send Link into the first dungeon with a team, rather than solo, but there are risks involved in either approach. (This presumes that areas actually turn out to be dungeons, but we'll see that soon.)

  I'm getting the impression from the repeated failed attempts at research and distinct lack of magical tools and how none of the existing spells and things are freakishly powerful and exploitable. The first prelude chapter shows Zelda's plans at trying to use Green magic to increase crop yield and it's barely working. My gut says that trying to drive for a coincidental perfect cure-all exploit or spell is barking up the wrong tree, as tempting as it seems to us here given the sort-of [[/r/rational][r/rational]] shared munchkin background.

We have spell research as one of our mechanics, but thus far, our results with it have been mixed. I submitted a few things to try to test the system further as a part of the last chapter discussion (using the new ability to use our "personal" points for research), but we don't have the results yet.

My current feeling is that research is still a potentially important part of our long-term success, but we have so little information that determining the right subjects to focus on is a challenge. I feel that we absolutely are going to need things like exploits if we want a fighting chance, given that we've been told that our starting conditions are awful and that our chances of victory are low.
