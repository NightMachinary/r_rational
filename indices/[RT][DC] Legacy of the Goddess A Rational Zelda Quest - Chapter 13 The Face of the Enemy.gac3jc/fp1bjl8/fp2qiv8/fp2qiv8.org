For your first question, the answer is 0%. Or at least as close to 0% as possible for Vecht.

Quoting from the about page with bolds added for emphasis.

  Legacy of the Goddess is a rational-deconstruction take on the Legend of Zelda setting, as an AU cross with the cosmere setting, and explored in the format of a Quest. Among other things, this work aims to be:

  Rational:

  *Characters behave realistically and according to their motivations, not just because the plot, players, or QMs demand it.* NPCs have agency, care about the world they inhabit, and will take action towards fulfilling their interests even where it conflicts with player intent. Magic behaves lawfully and has strict rules on what it can and cannot do.

  *It is important to note that no character is immune to consequence and anyone can die. Destiny and prophecy are nowhere to be found here.*

We've tried to contact the Gorons, but Hyrule apparently has no clue on how to talk to them. They also seem to have no knowledge of any other civilizations out there.

The problem I have with focusing on managing Hyrule more is that "/NPCs have agency, care about the world they inhabit, and will take action towards fulfilling their interests even where it conflicts with player intent."/ NPCs aren't incompetent. Wymar is an experienced general and I'm pretty skeptical that us armchair generals can do a better job than him. The same with Taetus and famine management, etc.

Zelda is very young and inexperienced, so unless she has something game-changing like the Fi lie detector she's better off delegating and focusing on important stuff that only she can do. This is all assuming the NPCs are actually working in the same direction as us of course.

On the other hand, Link does have more experience in the being a military officer thing, so he might be able to improve the war effort. But his skills there aren't unique, meanwhile his proto-lightsworn status is.

We should be able to get some more maps from Sheshan.
