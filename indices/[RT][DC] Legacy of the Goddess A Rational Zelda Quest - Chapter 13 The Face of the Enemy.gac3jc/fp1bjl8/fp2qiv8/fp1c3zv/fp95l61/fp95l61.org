  Unclear. Link certainly seems to believe in narrative weight,

I mean yeah but it's like... literally religion for him. Gods actually exist in this reality, but we've been outright told that the one god we're aware of that has their hands in this particular nation-state's affairs is dead as of the start of the story (earlier? I might have forgotten) so that's kind of not a thing. When I wrote this I was a bit concerned we might be falling in the trap of /expecting/ things to work out, but I think that was my own misunderstanding - I hadn't reviewed the previous discussion threads yet.

#+begin_quote
  We have spell research as one of our mechanics, but thus far, our results with it have been mixed.
#+end_quote

Frankly, this is the only reason why I'm not coming down /extremely/ hard on pursuing this - it's literally a noted mechanic. But like... what have we got to show for it? Would we have gotten more for that VP elsewhere?

#+begin_quote
  My current feeling is that research is still a potentially important part of our long-term success, but we have so little information that determining the right subjects to focus on is a challenge.
#+end_quote

Agreed in principle with both of these.

#+begin_quote
  I feel that we absolutely are going to need things like exploits if we want a fighting chance, given that we've been told that our starting conditions are awful and that our chances of victory are low.
#+end_quote

Also agreed... but my main concern is whether or not we'd be getting more value doing things /differently/... Then again, I'm not crystal clear on the cost breakdown now. Is the research costing us anything besides banked VP? Is it costing us time or anything? If it isn't really costing us anything then I guess I don't have a problem with it happening.

The main reason why I mentioned this is because I wanted more discussion and thinking around the idea that we may need more /conventional/ strategies for solving our problems, rather than discussing what the next spell might possibly look like..
