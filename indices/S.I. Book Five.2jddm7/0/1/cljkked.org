It's times like this that I wish I had a TV Tropes page I could point to (and make suggestions for). :) But traverseda has it right; the core idea I started with, and which still seems to apply, is roughly "present-day cryonicist is woken post-Singularity, starts Walking The Earth". I've also described it as "Jack Chalker crossed with Charles Stross", or "playing with breaking the usual one mind to one body ratio".
