For someone completely new to this story, is there an "about" section that goes further than just "Looking back, I suppose my story really begins on the day I died. Of course, I didn't realize that had happened for quite some time..."?

I normally like to know what I am reading before sinking too much time in to it and "rational and/or rationalist fiction where someone's story starts with him/her dying" is kinda vague.
