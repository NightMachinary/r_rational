There'll be at least six books, yes. I know where I plan on ending up with the story - I still have some leeway on how to get there from where it currently is.

Relatedly, I've got the first two books uploaded to [[https://www.fictionpress.com/u/983729/DataPacRat]] , and the first chapter at the story's permanent home at [[http://www.datapacrat.com/SI/]] . There's a bit of grunt work in setting those up, such as my preference for writing italics with /slashes/, so I'm not updating those particularly fast. (If anyone has enough regex-fu to be able to, among other details, turn apostrophes 'surrounding text' into proper HTML left-and-right curly quotes (as seen in the first chapter on my site), without affecting apostrophe's that are just part of words, that could certainly speed things up, and I'd appreciate the assist... :) )
