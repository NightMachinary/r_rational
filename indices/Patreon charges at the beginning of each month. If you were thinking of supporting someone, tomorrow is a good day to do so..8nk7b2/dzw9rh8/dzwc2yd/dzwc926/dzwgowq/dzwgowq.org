Meh. I more intended it as a method to remind those of us who said we would let a particular author allow us to pay him some money that we were going to do that (but just didn't want to be charged twice in such short proximity that we were going to do so) But the shoe fits...

Though I wish there were some better tax deductible way to give. To bad more online authors are not in Canada. Because I could work to hook them up with something. Right now Patreon is the best thing we got.
