"Gone with the Sun" dealt with survivors on the way to Andromeda a year before the Mass Effect: Andromeda trailer showed the future of the franchise.

Posted so far: the first two arcs of eight (it's the last arc which ends with survivors on the way to Andromeda), viz:

Arc 1 "Eternity" (chapters 1-9): Prologue to a story of seven arcs, observing events surrounding the ME3 finale from the point of view of characters coping with the fog of war. "Eternity" opens with a few lines from the very last chapter of the novel, then covers the events of ME3's destruction from the point of view of survivors in the fog of war. It's rather slow to get started - please bear with me, this was my first novel and first piece of creative writing for many years. By around chapter 7 things move more freely.

Arc 2, "Queen's Gambit" (chapters 10-18) - Set following the return of the fleet to Earth, this is the true beginning of the novel. Survivors are licking their wounds, setting things in order: rebuilding, and thinking about remaining Reapers in dark space.

Remaining books will be posted in order when complete. Chapter lists:

Eternity: 1 Intro -- Prologue/Epilogue 2 Parity Violation 3 Night and Fog 4 London Calling 5 Coming in from the cold 6 Buster 7 Alone in the dark 8 Charity 9 A rush through the dark 10 Location, location, location

Queen's Gambit: 11 Va, pensiero 12 Faith 13 Memory 14 By indirections 15 Hope 16 And Now 17 Find directions out 18 These three remain 19 Briefing for a descent
