*This show resolves the conflict of the first season BY SCIENTIFIC EXPERIMENTATION with the fate of humanity at stake.*

I imagine at least a few people here dropped whatever they were doing and began watching just off of that sentence alone. If you need me to continue to describe why this is the best anime ever, I shall oblige.

Humanity has been sandwiched between two reality-manipulating-ancient-eldritch-tree-gods called The Tree of Genesis and the Tree of Exodus, respectively. The show starts when a few members of the Kurasibe clan (secret mages who serve the Tree of Genesis) switch sides, strand their princess on a desert island, and try to destroy the world by awakening the Tree of Exodus.

Except, that's not what's actually happening. According to the rebels, the Tree of Genesis controls everything, making free will an illusion. The Tree of Exodus is the only power that can match it, albeit at significant risk to basically the entire planet. The show constantly asks the question of /how much of this was predestined?/ and still manages a compelling story.

*You're still here? What's wrong with you?*

The show is very, very tight. There's like ten recurring characters in the whole thing, and never a wasted moment. The two main characters, Mahiro and Yoshino, really do behave like what two smart young adults would, given their situation. They're the most Genre Savvy pair I've seen, and play off each other's strengths and weaknesses like the lifelong friends they are. The begin in episode 1 mature and responsible, with a large portion of the story told as flashbacks (in fact, one of the most important characters died long before the story started, but still has enormous presence).

It also contains a huge amount of Shakespeare. /Huge/, and it's actually some of the most effective use of literary allusion in anything. Seriously, this anime made me dig out my old copies of /Hamlet/ and /The Tempest/ with more excitement than any english class.

*I'm trying to say that this show is practically prefect in every way while spoiling as little of it as possible.*

*If you have any doubt at all, just watch episode one. This anime also has the best first episode of anything.*

I know that content on this sub can suffer from overhyping, but this show really is up there with /Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood/; it's just as good and much shorter.

I can't recommend it enough. I can't.
