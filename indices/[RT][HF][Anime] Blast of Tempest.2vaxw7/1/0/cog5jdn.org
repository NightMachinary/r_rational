I liked it as well, not "this show is practically prefect in every way " kind of liked, but defenitely something i recommend to other people..

there are a few points about the story that i remember not being as sure i liked, but to be honest i no longer remember if the story resolved them in the end properly or not.

But in any case, don't you think your post is fairly spoilerish and takes a lot of the mystery out of the story?
