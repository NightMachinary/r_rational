Just finished the third episode and I haven't seen either of them do anything smart yet. Mahiro in particular is an idiot. He knows that the talismans have limited uses and he keeps spending them recklessly. He fights that spear guy despite the princess telling him to run and doesn't even ask her for advice. I would have thought that the princess, in the interest of keeping her only link to the outside world alive, at least give Mahiro some tips since he was so dead set on fighting.

Yoshino ins't that much better. Points for asking if he could resurrect the dead when it didn't even occur to Mahiro but I can't believe he just dismissed the idea completely. I understand that the 'most powerful mage' in the world told him it wasn't possible but Yoshino doesn't *know* that it's impossible. Just a few hours ago he discovers that magic exists that follow these vague rules and yet he swallows that healing magic can guide you to people but it can't ressurect the dead?

I'm probably being harsh on Yoshino since he just had his world turned upside down so I'll keep watching to see how he makes sense of this. Mahiro seems like a lost cause though.

Good show by the way, I just wouldn't call the characters smart from what I've seen so far. Average probably.
