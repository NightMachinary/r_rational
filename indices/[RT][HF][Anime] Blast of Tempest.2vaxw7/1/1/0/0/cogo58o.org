Facepalmed on the next episode. Where he tried to save those people and he did the incredibly stupid thing instead of using magic. I don't know what to mention since it could be a spoiler but god damn was Yoshino an idiot in that scene.

Edit: The helicopter thing was pure luck. It didn't matter that Yoshino could predict where the helicopters would be since he couldn't control when spear guy would be there. He had absolutely no idea that Mahiro was in the tunnel or would have led him there. He couldn't control when the helicopters would get there, being either too late and spear guy following after them or too early and blowing up the tunnel before they reached it. Yoshino had incredibly little control over that event.
