I don't think pointing out Mahiro's irrationality is a valid criticism; I think the whole point is that Yoshino is the one with a good head on his shoulders.

Speaking of which, you're not giving Yoshino enough credit for the tracking thing; he only saw it once and then made some radically lateral thinking under duress later. Conversely, predicting the helicopters (which you didn't even mention) was /too/ good to be believable: even if he had the exact timings of all the other strikes (which I think it's safe to assume he didn't), the margin of error in extrapolating to the last one would be way bigger than the ~3-second window (generously) that was his target.

You're absolutely right about the resurrecting thing, though. First, if that doesn't qualify as healing, then I don't know what does. Second, dismissing things for being "against the world's logic" is so obviously invalid that I almost literally facepalmed when I heard Hakaze say it. A few hours earlier, Yoshino would've said that /magic/ was irrational by definition, and he wouldn't have drawn the (actually nonexistent) distinction between "magic" and "miracles." And if he was scientifically literate, he would've said that "the world's logic" was the second law of thermodynamics, meaning that healing magic would be the kind that was the /most/ "against" it.
