The [[https://www.youtube.com/user/vlogbrothers][vlogbrothers]] (John and Hank Green's popular YouTube channel) *[[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dtzfu9RpTs][tried something interesting]]* last week that I thought I'd mention.

Hank was sick of the cesspool of hate and intolerance that is YouTube video comments, and suggested that the reason they are so universally terrible is the YouTube comment promotion algorithm, which tends to feature the comments that get the most replies. Due to reasons explored in Scott Alexander's [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/17/the-toxoplasma-of-rage/][The Toxoplasma of Rage]] or CGP Grey's [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE3j_RHkqJc][This Video Will Make You Angry]], this inevitably rewards the most controversial, divisive comments instead of the comments that bring the most to the conversation.

Having no control over YouTube's algorithms, Hank asked vlogbrothers viewers to game the system, by replying with a single plus-sign to high-quality but uncontroversial comments. It's been working fairly well so far at the stated goal of vastly improving the quality of the comments that appear on the front page of their videos.

It has had the side-effect of making genuine discussion difficult, because substantive replies get buried in a sea of "+"s, but (a) that's still a strict improvement, since there was no genuine discussion happening /before/ either, because no one was ever /seeing/ the good comments, and (b) that's a potentially fixable problem; e.g., someone has already written a [[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/youtube-plus-filter/lhjhfienbklemmabjgkepbiihihnhacg][Greasemonkey script]] to hide all "+" comments.
