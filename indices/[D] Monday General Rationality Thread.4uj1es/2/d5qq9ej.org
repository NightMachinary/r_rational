I'm approaching US politics as if I'm reading a rational fiction, and trying to interpret everyone's actions like that.

I have hit a brick wall with one action though - Hillary appointing DWS as co-chair of her campaign, literally the day after revelations of collusion. What possible reason could Hillary have for doing this so soon, it looks like a terrible mistake to me.

Obviously she was going to give something to DWS in exchange for running the DNC in her favor, and as hush-money so DWS wouldn't talk about the collusion. By why appoint her to the campaign? And if you're going to appoint her to the campaign, why the day after corruption news? It seems like such a stupid move by probably the most adept player in the game of thrones.
