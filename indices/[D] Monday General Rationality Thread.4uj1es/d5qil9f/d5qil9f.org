Anyone know of any websites doing national presidential election predictions (preferably by state, as well as national result). I'm working on gathering their predictions and comparing their accuracies when the election ends.

I need it to either be somewhat easily web scraped, or have an API, or provide historical prediction data.

I'm already scraping PredictIt and Five Thirty Eight.
