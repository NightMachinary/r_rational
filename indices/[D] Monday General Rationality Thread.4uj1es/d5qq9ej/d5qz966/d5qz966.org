An alternative to the others' ideas is that Hillary simply realized that the loss in votes spread out across the country would not matter compared to the concentrated loss in Florida without DWS. This state is far more in danger of turning Red than most others, and getting the Old Jewish Vote isn't a sure thing.

As anecdotal example, most of my family/friends are voting Hillary (many with their noses very firmly pinched), but a decent amount of the extended Jewish network I'm in contact with is on the fence or pro-Trump.
