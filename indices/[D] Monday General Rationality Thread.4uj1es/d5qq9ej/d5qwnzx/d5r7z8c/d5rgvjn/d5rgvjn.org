Politicians make big, gaping mistakes all the time which are unconnected from any plan of action or concrete motivation. They do things that are simply, objectively wrong given their stated and implied preferences. It's tempting to think of politicians as being Machiavellian figures weaving this intricate web of alliances, and some politicians even like to see themselves that way, but even from the outside there are too many screw ups. This is why people get undone by sex scandals so often or make huge gaffes that blow up in their faces.

Hillary Clinton has debatably weaseled her way out of a number of scandals, but many of those scandals happened because of her own idiocy and incompetence. The worst is probably the Bosnia sniper fire scandal, where she lied about having been under fire /for a thing that cameras were around for/. A rational politician might lie, but not for something that they'd be so easily caught out for, so it's probably the case that Hillary just made an unforced error. For a lot of things that happen to politicians, a combination of Hanlon's razor and Occam's razor lead you to the belief that politicians are sometimes just not that clever.
