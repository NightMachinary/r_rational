Assuming that all players are playing some game of four dimensional chess at cross-purposes from each other, which is definitely not the case:

Hillary doesn't make obvious mistakes and she doesn't make blunders. So why in the world would she do something so contrary to party unity and so blatantly corrupt? Simple: Debbie Wasserman Schultz is also a player in the game. She didn't get where she was without her own political accumen, and in fact gained her position despite ranking very unfavorably among contenders. The best thing for Hillary would be to burn DWS in effigy ... but DWS has prepared for this eventuality and made some very pointed threats which Hillary is inclined to believe that DWS would follow through on. (The nature of these threats is a matter of almost pure speculation, but it's entirely possible that DWS has "dirt" that isn't out in the open and hasn't been exposed by Wikileaks. Alternately, she might have been willing (or perceived as willing) to torch the convention to the ground and spike any chance of Hillary becoming President by simply fanning the flames of disunity on any cable television channel, all of which would be happy to play host to internal party conflict.)

The optics are horrible for Hillary, but that indicates that the alternative would be worse.
