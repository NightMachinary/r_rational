I don't think Hillary is /actually/ that adept. I think she's become very, very good at getting out of scandals, and has convinced herself that each and every allegation against her is mere Republican propaganda. Effectively, she's told herself she can do no wrong, so anything she does is clean and acceptable by definition.

There's also the party-wide belief, reinforcing her behavior, that nothing to the left of wherever the Democratic Party is (and that location doesn't /really/ matter) /ought/ to exist.
