I've been collecting resources about that subject for a while. As Traiden04 said, Dartnell's book is exactly what you're looking for. I can also recommend The Way Things Work by C. van Amerongen. There's another version of these same set of books which you can find as How Things Work Volumes, I to IV by Roger Jean Segalat but the other one is cheaper.

From the amazon.com description:

  These volumes are not a reference in the ordinary sense. They have been designed, instead, to give the layman an understanding of "how things work," from the simplest mechanical functions of modern life to the most basic scientific principles and complex industrial processes that affect our well-being. The result is, we believe, a unique series - a graphic and original introduction to the modern world of technology. Here you will find the answer to the question posed by the inquisitive child who wants to know how a vacuum cleaner or refrigerator works, or by you yourself, puzzled by the complexities of lasers or the secrets of Polaroid color photography. The various subjects are shown in the list of contents, overleaf, and may prove useful for cross-reference purposes. In addition, there is a full index at the end of each volume, in which both machines and topics are listed alphabetically.

Not exactly related but "mechanical thinking" has been always a weak spot of mine. I've never been good with cars or other mechanical things and someone interested in "making things from scratch" will need to get good at that kind of thinking. Here's some books I've found that will help:

- Basic Machines and How They Work by the U.S. Navy
- The How and Why of Mechanical Movements by Harry Walton and Ray Pioch
- Mathematics Meets Technology by Brian Bolt
- Making Things Move by Dustyn Roberts
