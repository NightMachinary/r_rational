Well, XKCD has the book Thing Explainer, which covers a lot of those bases but isn't really geared towards starting from scratch. Includes completely jargon-free explanations of how stuff works from the bottom to the top. Then there's the classic [[https://www.topatoco.com/graphics/qw-cheatsheet-print-zoom.jpg][Time Traveller Poster]], which would likely be useful. It sounds like you're after something a bit more comprehensive though.
