I just caught up with A Hero's War and it made me wonder. Does anyone know of a book/website that is a "Guide to the Modern Era"? Containing most of the details you would need to build up an industrial civilization from scratch. It seems like it could be really interesting to read. Also, anyone who has made a real life "tech tree" civilization style. If it doesn't exist, it could be a cool variant on the "How Stuff Works" style books, as a tool to teach kids (and adults) about how the world around them works and was made.
