I've... honestly never seen it. This bad comments thing. I've seen inane but funny comments peak. I've seen hilarious poe comments peak with fools replying to them assuming them to be serious.

But I've never seen a legitimately pointless, legitimately purely hateful comment at the top of a youtube comments section.

And frankly, sorting reddit by controversial isn't really a bad experience either. It would be nice to have both options on youtube as on reddit of course.
