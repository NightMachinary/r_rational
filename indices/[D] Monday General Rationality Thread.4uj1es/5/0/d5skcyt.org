As I'm in my 3-5pm work slump, I'll take the "expenses drive innovation > agricultural labour is cheap because of illegal immigration > less innovation in agriculture" theory to be true and reply with some cached knowledge rather than think too hard about it:

The US isn't the only place where innovation happens. In NZ for example, our primary export/industry is the dairy industry, which we know is not sustainable (fertiliser run-off, water scarcity, overseas competition etc) and rather negatively impacts our "clean and green" image thereby impacting tourism (fewer rich people come to fly-fish in our rivers for example). So a large proportion of the government's and grant organisation's science investment/funding goes towards agriculture and dairy innovation. As a result, NZ has done some of the leading research in certain aspects of the industry like twinning vaccines to produce more livestock, kiwifruit plant varieties and milking equipment as some examples.

So competition and challenges in particular regions can drive innovation - then areas with less drive for innovation in those industries can take advantage of it.
