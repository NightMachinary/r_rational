Earlier today I was thinking and driving, when I realized that the concept of a near future post need society has a severe problem.

The mass of unskilled labor is too great for there to be a need for innovation in agriculture. Food costs have been much flatter than most other costs over the last thirty years or so.

Innovation in agriculture is required to feed a post need society with minimal or no human labor.

Expenses drive innovation.

Expenses are kept constant by excess availability of cheap labor. In the US this cheap labor is normally kept cheap by utilization of illegal immigrants.

It seems to me that illegal immigration is preventing us from developing and utilizing technologies that can lead us to a post need society.
