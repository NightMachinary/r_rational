Sure. You describe a market driven labor wage. If the economy of home countries gets stronger, and/or the economy of the host country gets weaker, financial incentive to immigrate grows less intense.\\
Still, farm wages will have to go up immensely before automated pickers for crops that are not fairly simple to pick. Bushes, trees, perennials, etc. We can already do most grains with machines, and a lot of annuals. But for post need, machines will need to be able to plant, tend, pick, and process crops.

A secondary concern - as more low-medium wage jobs are eliminated due to wage costs making them attractive automation targets, I think a lot of those people will be forced into agriculture jobs, keeping the wage low on farms even without excessive immigration.
