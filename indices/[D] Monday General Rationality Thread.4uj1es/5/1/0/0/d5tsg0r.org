I think you are right, and I see two main forces fighting the other direction. One is increasing demand for food as countries develop, and the other is education. If education was cheap, many people in the farming labor market will want more than the very low wages of their current position, and could move up into higher paying industries. Neither of these look like particularly powerful forces, as historically social mobility is just not that high and increased food demand doesn't seem bigger than increased productivity.
