You do have somewhat of a point, though all immigration, not just illegal, reduces labor costs. I think that the wage pressures of immigration will probably level off though, particularly because of remittance. If immigrants are sending money back home, then it seems likely the pressures to immigrate away from the home country will be reduced. Similar to how people freaked out about employment pressure from China, but now China's wages have risen enough that it isn't necessarily cheaper to employ there. Does that make sense? I guess the best thing would be to look at historic precedence to see how it has previously effected the economy.
