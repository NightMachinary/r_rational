Alicorn has written some glowfic that gives her Bell template the role of Homura. There's some on the old Dreamwidth site, and the content on the new site can be found through [[https://www.glowfic.com/characters/399][her character page]]. (Note that she doesn't seem to start with the first loop, and the Silmaril pieces want to be read in a specific order.)
