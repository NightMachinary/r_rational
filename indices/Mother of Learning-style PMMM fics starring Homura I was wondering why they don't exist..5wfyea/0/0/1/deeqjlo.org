  The only real experience I've had with time-loop based resource management outside of spawn camping in Quake, (that counts, right?) is the text adventure Hadean Lands by Andrew Plotkin, where you're learning better ways to solve the same puzzles with fewer resources as you become a better and better alchemist.

I ended up playing this on your recommendation (and only just realised it was you who recommended it! Hi!). It's really good so far, thanks.

  But the thing I rather enjoyed about the game was the ability to quickly redo long chains of actions and have it solve the dependencies the same way as last time. It fit nicely with the literary convention of the time loop fics, just skipping back to where they were and tweaking, and tweaking, and tweaking...

The major problem with this feature for me is that it's so good it might have ruined all other IF for me.
