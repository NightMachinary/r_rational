If you want to branch outside of interactive fiction, per se:

[[https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/meanwhile-an-interactive-comic-book/id458451517?mt=8][Meanwhile]] is an interactive comic book, with a (minor spoiler) time loop theme. It is a collaboration between Andrew Plotkin (the author of Hadean Lands) and Jason Shiga. Basically, Plotkin banged out an iOS app for the existing comic, and Shiga reformatted the comic to fit one gigantic virtual page.

Shiga's [[https://www.patreon.com/shiga][Demon]] is a non-interactive comic that is probably popular around here given its rather rational take on an immortality power, so you may be familiar with the art style and sort of story Shiga likes to tell. Meanwhile is somewhat less obsessed with bodily fluids.

Sticking, stricly to the text adventure space?

- If you just want to get your feet wet in the space and haven't really played any interactive fiction games, [[http://ifdb.tads.org/viewgame?id=mohwfk47yjzii14w][Lost Pig]] is decent 'on ramp' for folks into interactive fiction. Orc looking for pig. Nuff said. It is fun, lighter fare.

- For feels, [[http://ifdb.tads.org/viewgame?id=ju778uv5xaswnlpl][Photopia]] by Adam Cadre is excellent, but really sort of stretches the definition of 'is this a game?'. It definitely touches feelings that aren't the usual for IF. [[http://ifdb.tads.org/viewgame?id=ywwlr3tpxnktjasd][Varicella]], also by Cadre is also oddly brilliant with some excellent puzzles and humor. Just the inventory of the main character is enough to put a smile on my face. He does oddly amazing work for a man whose first foray into the genre, [[http://ifdb.tads.org/viewgame?id=a3ym4ipix7sjsfrf][I-0]], was er.. of a rather more adult nature.

- Stuff written by Emily Short tends to be a bit more exploratory. Her [[http://pr-if.org/play/galatea/][Galatea]] is probably one of the best realized characters in all of interactive fiction. [[http://ifdb.tads.org/viewcomp?id=p6s9uem6td8rfihv][Counterfeit Monkey]] is pretty popular.

- The father of 'modern' interactive fiction is probably Graham Nelson, who wrote [[http://ifdb.tads.org/viewgame?id=28uhmejlntcbccqm][Jigsaw]] back in 1995 and started the [[http://inform-fiction.org/introduction/index.html][Inform project]]. Jigsaw is interesting in that it manages to pull off a completely ungendered romance without being obvious about. (Plus it has time travel, which is always fun, even if the destinations are a bit trite.) It is a bit hard to get the maximally "good end" without a guide, though. The start can be a bit frustrating for players as well, but it did pretty much reinstate interactive fiction as a thing. I tend to think of it as the first real "complete package" of interactive fiction since the Infocom era. It is a game I think almost all fans of interactive fiction should play at some point.

- If you've played some of these sorts of games before, but you've sort of tuned them out since the Zork era, I'd say, take a look at the other [[http://www.eblong.com/zarf/if.html][stuff Plotkin has done]] as a starting point, particularly [[http://www.eblong.com/zarf/zweb/tangle/][Spider and Web]] from1997, which is probably what he was best known for before Hadean Lands. The protagonist acts as an unreliable narrator of past events while being interrogated.

- If you want a darker tone, [[http://ifdb.tads.org/viewgame?id=032krqe6bjn5au78][Slouching Towards Bedlam]] provides a fairly creepy dark horror steampunk adventure game feel.

None of these capture the whole diegetic reset/time-loop thing, but that's probably a pretty good "who's who" of interactive fiction for the last 10 years. If you want more, Nick Montfort's book [[http://nickm.com/twisty/][Twisty Little Passages]] provides a good overview of the genre.
