  the text adventure Hadean Lands by Andrew Plotkin, where you're learning better ways to solve the same puzzles with fewer resources as you become a better and better alchemist.

Reminds me: I've been thinking lately about interpreting successive playthroughs of the game /Factorio/ as /The Martian/ set in a time loop.

Presume that you have no /food/ on Mars, nor means of making/growing any. Every time you build something /by hand/, you spend a little bit of your own metabolic energy, which you have no way of recovering. Thus, you can only "get home" if you manage to do everything /as lazily as possible/.

Sort of the opposite of a speedrun---you'd be frequently going to sleep for long periods waiting for things to get built up. (But the resources on the planet would /also/ be finite, so when you woke up you might find out your assembly line became input-starved after the first hour, and now the one starving to death will be you.)
