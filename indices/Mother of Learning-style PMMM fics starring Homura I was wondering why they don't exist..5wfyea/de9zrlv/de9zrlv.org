There's a few Homura-based Quests out there, but none of them really take advantage of the time loop. I actually had some vague thoughts about a quest that did, with the "meat" of the quest being based around Homura being perfectly able to recreate the events of any past loop attempt (so long as she doesn't lose any equipment required, which would require her to go and get it again). So it would be a weird open-world puzzle-based quest, where in one "route" she runs into a problem, and then explores alternative "routes" to gain information to solve the problem, or altering earlier stages of that route to do the same. It would be a bit like /Radiant Historia/, except it wouldn't be weird alternate timelines interacting with each other, but actually changing the timeline in a way that doesn't violate the law of causality.

Given the open world nature of such a quest, I'd have to plan out puzzles and obstacles for the players to overcome, and then adjust them so they could be applied to whatever scenarios the players move towards. And there would have to be a way to "win" by beating Walpurgisnacht (or several ways, that the players would have to think of and then achieve).

I've never run a quest before and have done very little writing so I don't know if I'll ever do it, but I'm pretty enamoured with the idea.
