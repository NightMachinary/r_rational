The only real experience I've had with time-loop based resource management outside of spawn camping in Quake, (that counts, right?) is the text adventure [[http://hadeanlands.com/][Hadean Lands]] by Andrew Plotkin, where you're learning better ways to solve the same puzzles with fewer resources as you become a better and better alchemist.

Having a diegetic reset mechanism in the world, dying-restores-the-loop, works well for handling such long term resource consumption puzzles.

But the thing I rather enjoyed about the game was the ability to quickly redo long chains of actions and have it solve the dependencies the same way as last time. It fit nicely with the literary convention of the time loop fics, just skipping back to where they were and tweaking, and tweaking, and tweaking...

This is obviously a lot easier to express in a quest than a video game, but I thought it was nice to actually see at least one game explore it extensively.
