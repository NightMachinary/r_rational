The closest thing I know of to what you're describing is [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/puella-ludio-homura-magica-pmmm-roguelike-inspired.21940/reader][Puella Ludio Homura Magica]], which is basically a Gamer/PMMM/Scribblenauts crossover quest. Unfortunately, it seems to be abandoned, and the players only get through a few loops. Most of the munchkinry is about the players exploiting Homura's Scribblenauts-like power rather than the time loop.

I was also thinking of writing a PMMM fic in which Homura tries to use the time loop in a somewhat more rational way. For example, she could offer various governments future information and let them use her loop for accelerated weapons research in exchange for supplies, support and some of the products of that research.
