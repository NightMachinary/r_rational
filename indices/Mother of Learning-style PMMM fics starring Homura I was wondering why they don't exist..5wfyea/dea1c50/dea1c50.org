/First of all, I am not from this timeline./

/I was na√Øve back then, a shy little girl just out of the hospital. I was nervous, alone./

/There was this girl, her name was Madoka Kaname./

/She was nice to me./

/Anyways, I was attacked by a witch. I almost died. I should have died./

/But Madoka saved me. She was...amazing, glorious./

/And then Walpurgis Nacht, queen of all witches, came./

/Mami didn't stand a chance. She died almost instantly. We were...broken over her./

/So she died and Madoka... she killed Walpurgis by herself, but she died to do so./

/So I told the incubator, that I wanted have a chance to do it all over again. To protect Madoka instead of being protected by her./

/So he made me a Puella Magi, and I returned to the past to try again./

/I have done so many times since, more than I could care to count. I will not give up. Never. Even if it takes a million years./

/You can help me, but I will succeed, one way or the other./
