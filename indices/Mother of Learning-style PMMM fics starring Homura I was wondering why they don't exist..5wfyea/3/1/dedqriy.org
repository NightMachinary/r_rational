Not real rational, though, nor was it meant to be a crossover with The Gamer. It's supposed to a crossover with rogue-likes (nethack etc), which meant that random enemies could one-shot the MC if they got lucky, for example. The most powerful exploit found in the first iteration of the quest was about how to best to grind potion-making.

Don't misunderstand me. I like the quest.
