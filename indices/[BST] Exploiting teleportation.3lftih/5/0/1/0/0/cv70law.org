You accelerate to 0.1 c away from Alpha Centauri, which is 4 light-years away. You teleport there. That brings you there at 0.0402... years into the past from the lab reference frame. You then accelerate to 0.1 c away from Earth and teleport back. You are now 0.0402 years further into the past from the lab frame. Each teleport did not bring you into the past from your own perspective, but both of them together brought you to the same place but 0.0804 years earlier.

  However, an observer who is two-thirds of the way to Mars from Earth will see events on Mars from one minute in the past and events on Earth from two minutes in the past. From their perspective, they see you on Earth, then you also appear on Mars at the same time.

They see you on Earth and Mars at the same time. That's not the same thing. Once they take into account speed-of-light delay, their observations will agree with anyone moving the same velocity as them, regardless of position. But it will disagree with people moving at different velocities.
