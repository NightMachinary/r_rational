What are the parameters?

- How far can you teleport?\\
- How far can you teleport /upwards/?\\
- What can you and can't you take with you? (Mass/size/material limits)\\
- Can you teleport something without teleporting yourself, or is going along for the ride mandatory?\\
- Is there a refractory period? (i.e. you can't teleport within X seconds/minutes/hours of teleporting)\\
- Are there any other limits, such as not being able to teleport controllably around certain materials or locations, not being able to teleport accurately over large distances etc?\\
- Are you teleporting as a super power, or with the assistance of external devices/magic/phlebotinum?\\
- Can you teleport from anywhere to anywhere, or only to/from certain locations? Can you add another location to the list? How long does this take / how much prep work?

Minor questions:

- Can you reorient yourself during a teleport (i.e. if you are facing one direction, you can come out of it facing another direction or standing on your head if you like)?\\
- Can you change body position during a teleport (like going from sitting to standing)?\\
- Can you dump inertia? (for example, going from falling off a cliff to standing at the bottom of it without splatting yourself)?\\
- If you can't dump inertia, can you reorient it within the same reference frame? (going from falling /down/ to falling /up/ without having to teleport to the other side of the planet)?\\
- Is your departure or arrival marked by anything that would be detectable either by human senses or artificial sensors? (bright light, whoosh sound, minor thunderclap, sulfurous smell, gravity blip as your mass disappears)?

All these things are going to affect which tricks you can pull off effectively.
