I notice that no one has suggested using some minor form of teleportation to only be able to teleport small objects.

What's the use of that? Why you can act as a healer by teleporting out gallbladder stones, tumors, blood clots, and all sorts of nasty stuff like one of the characters from the [[http://www.amazon.com/Telekinetic-Hyllis-family-story-1-ebook/dp/B00LQZ7SZS][Hyllis Family]] series. Also the first book is free.
