Universal transportation like this is probably most easily exploitable as a means of setting up space infrastructure. Make a deal with NASA or ESA or your local space agency of preference, to take payloads up to geostationary for even just a tenth or a hundredth of the cost of a rocket (get lower and start taking on 'charity' jobs once you have enough money to be comfortable the rest of your life,) and you'll be rich beyond your wildest dreams while helping humanity explore space and colonize the planets.

If teleporting into the middle of something doesn't kill you (let's say that it causes you to swap places with a person-shaped piece of whatever you're teleporting into) then there are obvious applications here for deep-core mining, asteroid mining, and espionage if you absolutely /must/ lead a life of danger.

Depending on how much matter you can take with you, this may also be a means of practically creating negentropy/infinite energy: Take a big heavy thing, make a generator with some sort of bucketed vertical treadmill that can take the heavy thing and turn its fall into electricity, and teleport the heavy thing to great height to let it fall over and over again.
