Mmhmm, and I'm glazing over a lot of detail and carefulness in favor of laying out general goals.

Like, how would you /test/ whether you can safely teleport into matter? I'd probably do it by first seeing if I can teleport 'in place' (For example, see if I can teleport from a sitting position to a standing one) and if I could, I would try teleporting myself so my hand has the tip of its pinky inside of a small rock. Worst case scenario, it hurts like hell and I need minor surgery.

If it works, see if it works on larger scales; try intersect-teleporting a couple of fingers, then a hand, then a leg, and so on. Test everything /carefully/
