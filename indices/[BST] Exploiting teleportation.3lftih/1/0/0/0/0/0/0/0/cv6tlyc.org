Yup. Teleportation isn't exactly a well-known science; the result could be anything.

Well, nearly anything - presumably teleporting into a volume of air doesn't make you explode or become fatally radioactive. The most likely scenario is that you swap volumes, so teleporting into solid matter would just mean that you get embedded in it and a statue of yourself appears at your source point. (And if you teleported into a load-bearing solid, you might get crushed because you've removed a critical volume of concrete or steel holding up tons of pressure.)

Likewise, probably not a good idea to teleport into extremely deep water (pressure) or hostile environments without a suitable environment suit.
