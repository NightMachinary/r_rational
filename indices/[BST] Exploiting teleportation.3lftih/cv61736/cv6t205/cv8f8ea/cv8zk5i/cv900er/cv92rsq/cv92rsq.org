Question: What's the flip side of the AC axis look like, ie on the other side of the AB axis? Is it pointing from A to the top left, mirroring AC about the AB axis, or pointing from A to the bottom left, continuing the AC line straight on the graph?

If it's the former, then teleporting from point C to point B will not make you end up at origin point A, it will make you end up at point 2B along the AB axis.
