By special relativity, FTL is necessarily time travel. How far back in time you go depends on your FTL speed, your sublight speed, and how far you jump. This is a spacetime diagram:

The line marked 0t is the time axis, measured at rest, with the future going up. The line marked 0s is the space axis, measured at rest. The line marked 1 represents the speed of light, moving at one lightsecond per second away from the origin. The remaining lines are the space and time axes measured in a reference frame moving away from the origin at 0.5c. The fact that these axes are skewed is an inescapable fact about the nature of reality: space and time are relative.

Teleportation is instant. You move exactly parallel with your space axis, appearing and disappearing at the same moment in time, without interacting with the intervening space. You start at rest at the origin, at spacetime point A. You wait a while without moving, ending up at point B. Then you instantaneously teleport to point C, disappearing and reappearing simultaneously. At point C, you accelerate to 0.5c, instantly, somehow, by non-teleporting means. You brought a really good engine with you or something. Finally, you try to teleport back to point B. You move exactly parallel with your /new/ space axis, appearing and disappearing at the same moment in time according to your /new/ time axis. You end up at spacetime point A, which is the same point in space as B (according to a rest observer), but earlier in time. Every reference frame agrees that you just telefragged yourself.
