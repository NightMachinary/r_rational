I am assuming special relativity. If your teleportation only works from some preferred reference frame, then you can't use it for time travel. But if it works from whatever reference frame you happen to be in, then it can. It's not about moving through intervening space. It's about the idea that if we accelerated everything involved by a certain amount in a certain direction, there shouldn't be any way to tell that it's all now moving.
