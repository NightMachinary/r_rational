t' = γ(t-vx/c^{2})

= (t-vx/c^{2})/√(1-v^{2}/c^{2})

= (0-(0.1c)(4 ly)/c^{2})/√(1-0.1^{2})

= (0-0.1*4yr)/√(1-0.01)

= 0.4yr/√(0.99)

= 0.4yr/0.995

= 0.402yr

Looks like I put the decimal in the wrong place. And come to think of it, I'm pretty sure I got t' mixed up. If t is the lab reference frame and t' is your moving reference frame, it should be

0 = (t'-(0.1c)(4 ly)/c^{2})/√(1-0.1^{2})

t'-(0.1c)(4 ly)/c^{2} = 0

t' = (0.1c)(4 ly)/c^{2}

= 0.4 ly

So, now that I've corrected it, you should actually go back 0.8 years. Is that better?
