It's not past from every perspective; it's past from some perspectives which do not include your own.

Example: You teleport in a fraction of a second from Earth to Mars, which is about three light-minutes away at closest approach. You are now outside your previous light cone. You wait a minute and teleport back. If you were carrying a clock, it still agrees with Earth time, and the local school has you arrested.

However, an observer who is two-thirds of the way to Mars from Earth will see events on Mars from one minute in the past and events on Earth from two minutes in the past. From their perspective, they see you on Earth, then you also appear on Mars /at the same time/. A minute later, you vanish from both planets, and a minute after that, you arrive back on Earth. From the perspective of the observer, you traveled back in time because you were apparently in two places simultaneously, due to lightspeed lag.

However, from your own perspective, you cannot at any stage access previous points on anyone's timeline once you have interacted with it. You can outrace light, but you cannot prevent a signal being sent if you act after you see it being sent. You can take a message from Earth to Mars and back in one second instead of six minutes, but you can't do it in negative one second. The only 'time travel' is purely perceptual, and only by observers external to yourself.
