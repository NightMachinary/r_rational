Like many of these questions, it all depends on the rules of the world you are in, and on things you haven't specified, like:

1) What happens when you port to somewhere that changes your potential energy? (i.e. nearly everywhere)

2) What happens to your velocity vector when 'at rest' where you arrive is different from where you left?

3) Do you have to touch things to bring them with you? Can you port part of a solid object?

4) What happens to air/water/solid objects in the volume you are porting in to?

You'll get whole families of different things to do based on different answers to these questions.
