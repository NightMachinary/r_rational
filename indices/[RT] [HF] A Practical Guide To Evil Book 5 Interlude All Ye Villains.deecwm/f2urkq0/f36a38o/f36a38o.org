Is there an argument for Scribe /not/ being Assassin?

Evidence for:

- Narratively, there should be five Calamaties: Black, Captain, Warlock, and Ranger are the first four
- Black said that Assassin had already met Cat early on in book 1 (though presumably Assassin's aspects might make this possible in either case)
- From what little we know of Eudokia's aspects/skills, we know they would be well suited to an Assassin: She is nearly impossible to notice if she doesn't want to be noticed, and even more difficult to describe.
- Most recently, we learned that the Augur refers to both Scribe and Assassin as 'the spider'
- Despite the above points being fairly obvious (to me at least), no one in the story has commented on the connections, possibly due to name trickery

​

Evidence against:

- It would be very much like Black to set up an obvious story to hide the truth. Being assumed to have a proper band of five largely matching the Woe would give him an ace up his sleeve if he truly had six.
- I vaguely remember Scribe and Assassin being in the same room at some point in Akua's Folly, though given that no one really knows what either looks like, that wouldn't be difficult to claim falsely
