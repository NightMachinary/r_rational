Pretty sure Praes is still the greater evil, and Catherine has made clear that she will personally gate any armies heading for the Tower through Callow. Also, despite being the High Priestess of an obviously evil religion, she's using that religion to transform its members into a democratic society based on rap-battle oaths. Even if Praes fell, Kairos is still the obvious pick as next biggest bad, as he has none of Catherine's redeeming qualities.

She should have plenty of time to integrate Callow under her regime into Calernian politics.
