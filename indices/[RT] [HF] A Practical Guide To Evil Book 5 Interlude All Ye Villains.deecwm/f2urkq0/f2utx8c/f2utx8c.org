Heroes are the gun to his head. He's survived so long being the Hidden Horror by being mostly hidden. As long as he's the thing which goes bump in the night, he remains a narrative piece which can't be taken off the board. A villain who broods in secret can't be defeated until he makes his first move, after all, and the first step of a plan always succeeds in any case.

At the same time, he must also be a horror. Before this incursion, it had been 700 years since last there were mortals who knew his wrath. Had he continued to brood, he would have gone from hidden, to forgotten, to gone. He cannot allow his story to end, as that would end his existence in short order.

Therefore, he absolutely must make incursions often enough to remain the subject of nightmares, and those incursions cannot existentially threaten Good nations. Existential threats are obliterated by children shouting platitudes, after all. Even though hundreds of heroes have failed to take him down, that is just fuel to the story which can.

He's done that now. He's reminded the world that he exists and that he could sweep across Calernia at any time if he wished it. This part of the story complete, he retreats to the Serenity for the next 700 years, awaiting the time when the nightmares fade once more.

At the same time, though, a massive alliance of every nation against himself can't be allowed just for strategic reasons. Black proved that stories can be sidestepped with superior planning, so no matter the legend he cultivates he absolutely could lose to a sufficiently large and motivated horde of foes. He can't break that alliance up through military might, so he'll do it through intrigue.
