Interestingly enough though, does Catherine really want him dead? I can see her wanting to push him back into his hole, then sealing him in there tighter than ever by giving the Drow dominion over Keter, but if she actually kills him then the now unified goodies have no reason to keep her around, so they will almost definitely move on to the next big bad that they see, which would be either the Drow or Praes, Cat would be all for matching on Praes so long as it didn't tear up her country side, which it wouldn't with the new gates, but she is kinda attached to the Drow.
