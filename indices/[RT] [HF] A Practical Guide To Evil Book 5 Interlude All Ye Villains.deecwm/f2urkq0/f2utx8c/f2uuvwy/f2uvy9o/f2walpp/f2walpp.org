I do not believe the Grand Alliance to be ready to fight the next big bad after a war with Keter. They are, as was said before, in tatters already and would have no chance of winning this war, maybe even with the story on their side, if not for outside factors (i.e. the drow and the dwarves).

Catherine wants to use that moment of peace forced by the cost of this war against Keter to craft her own possibly long-lasting peace treaty/new world order.
