  does Catherine really want him dead?
#+end_quote

She thinks long term. Real fucking long term. There are two factors that comes into play when she wants the Dead King dead, I think. 1) She doesn't believe the Liesse Accords can last if there's a Dead King. 2) She doesn't really want people being systematically farmed in a personal Hell.

A new 3) would be: She already sold the land of Keter.
