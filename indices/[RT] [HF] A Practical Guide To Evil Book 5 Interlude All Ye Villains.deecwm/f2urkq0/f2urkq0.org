Hrm. This seems weak to me. Maybe there's a narrative argument about heroes winning when things are are their worst, but Procer's on its last legs, Ashur is basically already beaten, the Free Cities are, well, the Free Cities, and the Dominion is spending as much time squabbling amongst themselves as they are thinking about fighting Keter. The Grand Alliance is basically in tatters.

Without Catherine's drow and dwarven trump cards, Neshemah's got little reason to think he can't steamroll, or at least take some major chunks of Procer and severely tilt the balance of power his way. If we've been interpreting things correctly, his main objective here is to destabilize Procer and stop it from becoming the bastion of Good that could pose a serious threat to him. I can't really think of anything that would be worth a truce now that Cat doesn't have the gun to his head that earned them the short truce they're already operating under.
