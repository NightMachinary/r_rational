  Neshemah's got little reason to think he can't steamroll, or at least take some major chunks of Procer and severely tilt the balance of power his way.

Neshemah plays the long game. Time means nothing to him, but every wound he takes is permanent. If there's a chance his enemies can reach him, it makes sense to deny them that. It doesn't matter if he retreats now. He can return in a few decades with his forces intact. His army might even be larger from all the dead he's raised and "farming" the Serenity.

If he offers a truce now, what does he lose? He's spread discord into the Grand Alliance, undermined Cordelia's rule, and weighed the scales in his favour. The other nations also suddenly don't need Callow, and the Black Queen goes from being the lesser of evils to the greatest (only) evil.
