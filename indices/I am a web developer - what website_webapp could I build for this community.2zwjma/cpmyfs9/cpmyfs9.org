first let me describe a "real life action tracking" system. this system allows the user to create one-time or time-recurring goals, or constantly on habits. when users notice they are doing a habit, or complete a goal, they manually tell the system.

ok, now take literally any easily-copied free-to-play web game designed to get you addicted to it, then get you needing to pay for premium currency. (candy crush, anyone?)

now, instead of charging for premium currency, reward or deduct it for actions via the tracking system already described. you just built a powerful self-guided training tool.

to my knowledge, the only thing that comes close to this is habitrpg, but it has issues which make it less effective than it could be. for example, it's also free-to-play monetized, which lets you pay real money to bypass having to complete goals, which is a bad thing to train into people, and hurts its training effectiveness (do you want your users to be addicted to completing goals, or paying you?)
