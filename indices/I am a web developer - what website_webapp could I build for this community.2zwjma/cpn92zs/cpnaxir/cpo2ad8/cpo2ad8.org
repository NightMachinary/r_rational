Mary Robinette Kowal was actually how I was first introduced to the concept of automated anachronism checking. She [[http://maryrobinettekowal.com/journal/the-jane-austen-word-list/][scraped a list of all the words in Austen's novels]], then fed that into her text editor as a spellcheck dictionary, which then highlighted [[http://maryrobinettekowal.com/journal/words-i-couldnt-use-in-glamour-in-glass/][words that Austen didn't use]]. But this method is sort of clunky, and not easy to generalize.
