This is sort of pie-in-the-sky, but what I've really been wanting for a long time is an anachronism checker.

Here's my basic use case:

1. User enters in a chunk of text (likely a chapter of 5k-10k words)
2. User enters a year (for example, "1900")
3. User clicks "Check me!"
4. Program highlights suspect words, phrases, etc.

How this would work on the backend is that it would interface with something like [[https://books.google.com/ngrams][Google n-gram viewer]] or [[http://weblm.research.microsoft.com/][Microsoft N-gram Service]], run a check against every unigram, bigram, trigram, etc. to find its frequency in that year, then compare that against its frequency in the current year. If a certain threshold is exceeded, the n-gram is highlighted.

So in our use-case example, the phrase "Albert Einstein" would be highlighted if you selected the year "1900" because Einstein was a complete unknown then.

As a bonus, it's a very short step from doing /that/ to having a webapp that can help highlight Americanisms in works which are set in British worlds.

(There are a few ways to do things like this - mostly hacking spellcheck libraries - but all of them need setup and manual processes that are a pain in the ass.)
