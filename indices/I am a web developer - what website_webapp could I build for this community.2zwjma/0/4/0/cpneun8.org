Google Ngram viewer already outputs that ngram as percent of the corpus. I'm not really clear on what you mean by a captcha-like service, but the actual logic for evaluating ngrams shouldn't be too much more difficult than:

#+begin_example
  percentChange = ngramTodayValue / ngramPastValue
  if (percentChange > threshold)
      flag
#+end_example

The hard part is getting those values into the system - the evaluation shouldn't be terribly problematic.
