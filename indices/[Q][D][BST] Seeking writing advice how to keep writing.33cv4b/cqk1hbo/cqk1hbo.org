First, try modifying your work environment. When I hear "shoulder pain" and "typing" in close proximity, my first thought is "keyboard is too high." Read up on ergonomics, find what the correct height for your body would be, see if moving your keyboard to that height fixes the problem.

Second, try getting an ergonomic keyboard. It used to be that typing for a full day gave me horrible hand and wrist pain. I bought a Datadesk Technologist Smartboard II keyboard and boom...problem solved. Sadly, I think DT is now out of business, but there's probably other keyboards out there that will work as well.

As to how to keep writing, several options. Use them in whatever order seems best:

- Butt in Chair, Hands on Keyboard

Put your ass in your chair, put your hands on the keyboard and /do/ it. Life is full of things you don't want to do. Pick a time that you're going to block out for this and BiCHoK. You'll find some words.

- Pomodoros

Ugh-y things are less ughy when they have known limits. Trying doing a 25/5 pomodoro where you set a timer for 25 minutes and then break for 5.

- Wash a spoon

Every day, you have to write one sentence. Once you've done that, you can stop. Just one sentence, and then you're done. Usually when you write your sentence you'll find that more words come. At that point you've done your sentence and everything that comes after it is you being awesome; when you get to the point where you want to stop, stop. And then smile, fist-pump, and say out loud "Yes! I'm awesome for doing more than I had to!" (No, literally, do that -- it's a simple, low-cost, and effective form of reward.)

The only rule is that you have to write your sentence /every single day/. I don't care if you're sick, the dog ate your homework, or your mom just died. You can find 20 seconds to write your damn sentence.

- Aversion Factoring

Set a timer for 5 minutes. Write down what it is about this task that is ugh-y for you. Keep writing things down until the timer dings.

Look at the list. Is there any way to get rid of item one? Item two? Etc. Example: "This is ughy because I'm really excited abou $OTHER_PROJECT and this is keeping me from doing that." Okay, can you make this more like $OTHER_PROJECT? Is this /really/ the only thing keeping you from doing $OP or can you set aside time for both things? Maybe you can watch less TV in order to free up time for $OP so that you can keep doing this as well?

For the things you can't get rid of, is that a limitation that you actually respect and think is reasonable, or is it something that you can accustom yourself to? One of the CFAR instructors had an example: he wanted to climb trees, but (among other things) he didn't like getting his hands dirty. He decided that wasn't a limitation he respected / wanted to have, so he practiced putting his hands in mud and then just sitting there, looking at them and experiencing the emotion until it stopped bothering him.

I've had a similar experience recently, traveling in Southeast Asia. One hostel that I stayed in had bed bugs; at first this was a horrible disaster for me, a great calamity that I was afraid of and all aflutter about. The hostel did their best to get rid of them, but it took a while. I had already paid to stay there for a month and didn't want to lose my money, so going elsewhere wasn't an easy option. After a couple of days I realized it just wasn't that big a deal. It stopped bothering me and then they managed to get rid of the bed bugs.

- Goal factoring

Do this on a piece of paper (obviously, substitute your own reasons and goals):

Goal: write this story Why do I want this?: because finishing things is good. Call this "completion satisfaction"

Goal: completion satisfaction Why do I want this?: There are reputational benefits to being known as a person who finishes things.

...etc

For each item on the list, see if there is an easier way to get it. For example, instead of finishing the story, would it satisfy your various goals to simply post an announcement "I am moving on from this project, here is the plot outline that I was writing to so that all you readers can have closure. Meanwhile, here is my other project that I'm excited about!"

Good luck. I hope it all works for you.
