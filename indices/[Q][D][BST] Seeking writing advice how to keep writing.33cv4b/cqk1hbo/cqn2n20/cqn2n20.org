+1 for writing 1 sentence every day. This is how I wrote my first novel. Actually, my rule was that I had to just write /something/ each day, and there were days on which that was a /word./ There were of course other days when it would be 10 pages. The point is to keep some amount of forward motion happening, no matter how small. It's surprising how effective this is, in my experience.
