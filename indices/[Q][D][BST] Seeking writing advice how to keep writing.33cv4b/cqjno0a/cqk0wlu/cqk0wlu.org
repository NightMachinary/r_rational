Definitely agreed. As an author I respect once told me, "inspiration is, like, 2% of the final product".

As for me personally, after assessing my life ambitions and the like, I decided it's not actually worth it for me. I accept the doom of never publishing any long work because really I write for fun, not for profit.

OP, you've written a very long work and as such probably know way more about the subject than most people here. My biggest advice, though, is don't let a medical problem cause you to cut out a source of joy and satisfaction in your life, /without/ filling it with something else. If you make a conscious decision that "yeah I'm probably done with writing in general for now", try to have a plan where to go next. (That /is/ speaking from experience, now.) Good luck! And bravo for writing such a large volume already - that's something most never accomplish.
