Continuing on with a project that you've lost your motivation for is a learned skill. I feel like most people /don't/ learn it, because it's really easy to get by without it, and you hear a lot of authors and artists talking about "inspiration" as though that was all there were to creation. The question shouldn't be, "How do I get my inspiration/motivation back?", it should be "How do I keep writing, and at the same level of quality, when I don't feel like it?"

Partly it's a matter of practice. The more you work on things that you don't feel like working on, the better you'll be at it. If you want tips on practice, what works for me is blocking out time to do the thing that I don't want to do, and being held accountable in some way. If that's not working, I think it's helpful to step back from a project for a while (though that's dangerous, because that's the kind of motivated thinking you'd do when you just never wanted to see the project again). It's also helpful to get someone to read through what you've written so that you can get some fresh eyes on it, and maybe rediscover what you liked in the first place.

But mostly, I think it's a matter of sitting down and doing the work, regardless of the fact that it's not so fun anymore - so long as you can ensure that it will be fun for the reader.
