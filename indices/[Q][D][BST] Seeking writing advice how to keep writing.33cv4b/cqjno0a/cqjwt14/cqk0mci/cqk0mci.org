Writers can get into this trap where they start something, let it run for some certain amount, and then put it on the shelf for some shiny new idea. And in this way, nothing ever gets completed. This is /very/ common.

And yes, I do think that this is bad for the writer, even if there's no financial incentive for them, and even if they're not showing their work to anyone at all. It's a stunted form of expression. What happens if you keep starting up new projects and not finishing them is that you get really good at starting projects and never improve at actually finishing them. And then, looking back, you'll see a bunch of failed projects behind you that were entirely transient and ultimately hollow.

There's probably someone out there who loves beginning things and hates finishing them, and who thinks that it's perfectly fine and natural to have never finished the act of creation. But to me, this is a fundamentally /untrue/ way of creating art. Which is not to say that you can't make a work of fiction intended to run in perpetuity, or one that leaves threads open for sequels, or one that leaves threads open because that's the whole point of it, or one that ends right in the middle because /that's/ the point of it, or other ways of being unconventional. But that's not the same as stopping because you weren't having fun.

(And sometimes, you need to know when what you're writing isn't working, and you're falling victim to sunk costs. The problem is when you do this on a regular basis.)
