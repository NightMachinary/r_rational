There is definitely happiness to be found in a job well done, and from creating something that others enjoy. It's not the same kind of instant gratification that you get from writing while inspired, but in the modern world of the internet, videogames, netflix, instant communication with friends, etc - I sometimes forget that there /are/ other kinds of fun. Heck, many of us here prefer the faster gratification of fanfiction over investing time and risk into a new novel.
