But would it still be fun for the writer in that case? I mean don't get me wrong as a reader its definitely in my interest for writers to write. But what you said sounds like it would mostly make sense for someone who is gaining something other then fun out of their writing, so i suppose its relevant if you are trying to convince people, or maybe make money out of the story, or possibly not make money at the moment but aim to in the future thus using the current story as practice for then.

Unless i misunderstood and you are saying that after a while the motivation\inspiration will come back to the writer so it could be worth it regardless of other benefits..
