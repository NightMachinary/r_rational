Again, as a reader what you are saying definitely works, I would much prefer authors finish stories and not just start new ones all the time. And I would definitely prefer for authors to improve their writing by continuing to write even when they don't feel like it and get better.

And of course I don't think anyone could really argue that as an art starting lots of stories and not finishing them, not because you are doing it intentionally but instead because you lost the drive, is bad form.

But, I cannot imagine how that would be convincing if i were the writer and I didn't feel like writing. Again if I had other motivations other then the direct fun that is one thing, but I figure a lot of people that write fiction, fan or otherwise, do so because they enjoy writing and your description doesn't suggest there's too much of a happy ending for them.

You did add a point though about people who are going to look back and feel like they are less capable\successful, which is a good argument for anyone that feels its likely they will be disappointed in themselves looking back at it..
