Last time I tried it, this is what resulted (Warning: did not try very hard):

"So you want to fight in my tournament for a foretelling? I'm flattered, but I haven't been able to update my ensemble of fighters since your father defeated them. And I don't feel very good about letting Yamcha participate a second time. Disqualifications roll over."

"Actually," Gohan said, "I just wanted to talk to Akkuman. I've already looked through Dr. Breef's science magazines, and learned that Dr. Gero's lab is near North City. I got Yajirobe to do all the detective work after that, since all this sneaking around is already putting me in hot water with my mom..."

"Akkuman? What for?" Baba didn't look like she liked where this was going.

"Dr. Gero has technology that can withstand Supersaiyans," Gohan explained, "But if Akkuman's Devil-might beam is based on the evil in the victim and doesn't concern itself with power..."

..........

"You brought me all the way out here, and he's mechanized himself? I'd better still get paid."

..........

"So, you thought you'd kill Dr. Gero before I had a chance to fight the androids?" Vegeta menaced, "Now what did I say I would do to anyone who did that?"

"... Give them a gentle pat on the back that will in no way knock them through a mountain?"

"Try again."

"... Crapbaskets."

..........

"Makankosappo!"

..........

"Thanks, Mr. Piccolo. I didn't really want to kill him, though..."

"Then you should have come up with a plan that wouldn't have made him angry."

..........

"Awe, Gohan! Why'd'ya hafta go 'n kill Dr. Gero /and/ Vegeta? Who'm'I gonna fight now?"

"Mr. Piccolo is pretty strong..."

"AND YOU'VE BEEN FALLING BEHIND ON YOUR STUDIES!"

"But Mom,---"

"NO BUTS! YOU'RE GROUNDED, MISTER!"

"Doesn't it matter that I saved millions of lives, including our closest friends and family?"

"I'm with your mom on this one. That was very inconsiderate, Gohan."

..........

Gohan waited until Goku and ChiChi were busy trying to make a child who cared more about studying and fighting (at the same time somehow), then sneaked out and stole the dragon radar, gathered the dragonballs and asked Shenron to make everyone immortal. Babidi decided this was awesome.
