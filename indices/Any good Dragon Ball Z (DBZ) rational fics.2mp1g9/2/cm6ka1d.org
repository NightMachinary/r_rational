  What is ki and how does it work? How is it that the characters can increase their ki seemingly without limit just by training it like a muscle.
#+end_quote

DBZ insists that ki cannot be reduced to numbers. Considering that battle powers were useful enough that all of Freeza's underlings, from himself down to Raditz and Appule, were equipped with scouters, there's clearly something to the measurements, and a reason that they fall apart when introduced to the Shounen Spiritâ„¢.

  Goku eats a lot, but the energy he gets from eating food isn't enough to explain how he can make world shattering ki blasts.
#+end_quote

The exaggerated power scale is the biggest WTF factor of the series. Off the top of my head, all I've got is "Clearly, the process of learning the kamehameha gives one the ability to produce antimatter instead of HCL in one's stomach.", which is a very unsatisfying explanation. It would have been nice if Dr. Gero had published the results of his research*.

  Immortality. There's a lot of potential here. Roshi doesn't seem to age. Dr. Gero turned himself into an un-aging android by putting his brain in a robot body. There's also a magic wish granting dragon that was created by god.
#+end_quote

Roshi's immortality is given two plausable explanations in the series, but if you go back to the roots, he's a Sen'nin, and traditionally, immortality is among the powers attributed to Sen'nins.

He and Umigame/Sea Turtle both state that he drank from theFountain of Youth / the Elixor of Immortality. He also claims that he lied about this just before going up against Piccolo. There's also the Immortal Phoenix, which was supposed to grant Goku immortality (except it died of food poisoning before the series began).

  Most of the gods in this series just seem to be long lived aliens that have special ki powers.
#+end_quote

And what's more, they can die and lose their job (or die and keep their job); the circumstances are not elaborated upon. (I've suggested the Mazoku / Demon Clan effect might be involved, but that doesn't account for the whole 15 generations of Kais between the Elder Kaioshin and the generation of the series.)

#+begin_quote
  An afterlife definitely exists. Only a very few people like Goku get to keep their bodies, though. The rest seem to turn into body-less spirits that may or may not be conscious.
#+end_quote

It doesn't come up often, but those spirits eventually get reincarnated (or the evil ones do, anyway; I'm not sure about those judged "good" by the afterlife bureaucracy). It's more or less a cartoonish version of the Japanese take on the Buddhist afterlife, with adjustments here and there for rule of funny.

#+begin_quote
  The power of a saiyan's child depends on the power level of the parent at the time of conception. This one is implied only, but notice how strong Goten and Trunks were as kids and how easily they became super saiyans compared to Goku, Vegeta, and Gohan.
#+end_quote

This subject always drives me nanners. It's probably intended to be the case, and Toriyama once stated that tails are recessive (but then how does Gohan have one?)... Gah! My fanon is that tails inhibit the Super Saiyan transformation, and very few saiyans lived long enough without a tail to discover this in the ancestral environment. And that the tails were probably just removed as thoroughly as Bulma could afford, but if we insist on the genetic explanation, there really need to be at least two genes involved, otherwise there should be humans with more saiyan traits.

#+begin_quote
  Why are there dinosaurs and animal people on earth? Possible post-singularity or post apocalypse civilization that collapsed and by the time of the series is recovering civilization in some places.
#+end_quote

The last time I tried this, I got stuck on "must be set in the Wheel of Time universe" at this point. This was very silly and ruined the attempt.

Maybe anthropomorphic animals are a natural consequence of the sorts of ki and magic floating around out there?

I've been trying to figure out how to do a rational DBZ ever since reading HPMoR, and have gotten stuck many times. It's easier to pick at the characters being silly than the mechanics of the world (though people have pointed out that Goku could just toss ki blasts at a turbine all day and power a city). I dunno, maybe if interet keeps up I can get around to it, but the outside view says not to get too hopeful.

* According to Dragonball Online, Gohan finally published ki research after completing his education. This covers half the explanation for how said game is possible (the other half is villains doing world-breaking things with timetravel and explosions).
