Looking at it as an outsider from the series it's magic that the writer just made up.\\
I look at it from the perspective of a rational person who exists in the world of the series. They would know what should be possible, but then see an impossible thing like Goku being able to output enough energy to shatter a planet. They're really there and just saw the impossible thing happen, so they have to come up with some way that it could have worked. I just find it interesting.
