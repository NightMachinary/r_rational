  The power of a saiyan's child depends on the power level of the parent at the time of conception. This one is implied only, but notice how strong Goten and Trunks were as kids and how easily they became super saiyans compared to Goku, Vegeta, and Gohan.

The fact that child Trunks was able to do it earlier than alternate timeline Trunks strongly speaks for this as Vegeta was driven by alt-Trunks to train harder before fathering him. If my memory doesn't completely fail me.
