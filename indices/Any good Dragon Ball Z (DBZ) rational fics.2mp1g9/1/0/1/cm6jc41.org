This description made me do a doubletake to see if it was actually Mr. Cell that was being linked. The premise being that Cell turns good and starts optimizing, but the trouble being that the story started out as a joke and got serious as it went on (an excellent metaphor for Dragonball as a whole), so the early chapters were heavy-handed and silly.
