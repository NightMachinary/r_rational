Re: Post apocalyptic explanation.

If you dig into the minutia, there are islands formerly known as "America" and "Japan" (both of these do require acknowledging non-manga material), and Christianity and Buddhism exist (Mentioned explicitly: Namu is a devout Buddhist, and Upa wards off Draculaman by making the sign of the cross while "JESUS CHRIST!" flashes in the background). There is a one-world government, but its rule is arguably nominal outside of major cities (and the king is a talking dog for some reason). I don't remember if population figures were ever given for the world (I wouldn't be surprised; I also wouldn't be surprised if they were supposed to resemble our own around the time that the numbers were published.) There's also the calendar (the series covers the time from ~Age 760 to ~790, but unless it's been revealed in the past two years, there aren't any hints as to what started the Age calendar).

AI is also such a crapshoot that Gero tries to focus on modifying biological brains instead. Our current AI abilities seem to be approaching the capabilities of most of the robots in the series other than Androids 16 and 19 (I assume 8 has a biological brain, but I could be mistaken). If you take the Dr. Slump crossover into consideration, though, the only reason there hasn't been a singularity yet is because Turbo is nice. It's also worth pointing out that there is no indication to my knowledge that Freeza's empire made use of AI for anything other than piloting their spacecraft, yet Freeza is feared throughout most of the known universe.
