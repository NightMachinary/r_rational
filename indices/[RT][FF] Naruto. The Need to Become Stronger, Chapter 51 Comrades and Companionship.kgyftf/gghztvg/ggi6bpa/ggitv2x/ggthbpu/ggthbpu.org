Love the chapter! I've been thinking a bit about the permanent mind control though. Given that flaring your chakra removes genjutsu by purging out enemy chakra from your system, how would the permanence of Kotoamatsukami/madness plague work? It wouldn't be very permanent if it was removed the first time someone flares chakra during training or combat. And I've been assuming genjutsu fades over time even if you don't flare it away. Otherwise it seems like many or most civilians in the world would be under the control of ninja since they can't flare their mana to remove genjutsu.

I guess it could be some fancy stuff like it forcing the target to always recast a genjutsu on themselves without knowing it. So that even if the enemy chakra from the technique is purged the genjutsu continues because it's maintained with your own genjutsu using your own chakra. In that case it could be possible to purge that genjutsu by flaring using some other source of chakra (nature, bijuu)? Though given that it was hypothesized that ninja basically are chakra creatures, momentarily replacing the chakra in your sysyem with some other chakra source might kill you. But if there's some time limit before any genjutsu fades from your system you could try to somehow make them unable to cast genjutsu for that duration.

I suppose this could also explain why it's mostly powerful ninja/genjutsu users who we've seen act strange as if they are being controlled. Maybe it's only powerful genjutsu users who are able to recast the recursive self-genjutsu flawlessly enough for it to not be scrambled and useless after a few iterations.
