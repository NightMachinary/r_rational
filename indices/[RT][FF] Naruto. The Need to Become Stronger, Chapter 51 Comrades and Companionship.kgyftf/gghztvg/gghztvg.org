Apologies for deviating from the promised weekly schedule. Actually, I'm not entirely sure what I should be aiming for: Weekly updates followed by a small delay before the finale of this arc, or consistently updating once per two weeks? Let me know what you guys prefer.

Anyway, this time we venture into the bold new world of HTML Tables (!). Yes, you're definitely not allowed to do that in a "proper" novel, but who cares. I've always thought it was ridiculous that you're only allowed to put text in 'real' books and that maps and illustrations are reserved for children and fantasy stories. I really love those old stories like the Jungle Book, where the text is accompanied by beautiful sketches to help stir up the imagination. Never let pretentiousness stop you from using all the tools available to you, I say.

(that said, please do let me know if the table looks terrible or is unreadable or something :P )
