- Bavarian Fire Drill (a.k.a "dress and look like the boss, claim I'm doing a surprise inspection and shout down any objections") will get me into almost any place I want. /Once./
- Maintaining an identity in a small town will help. I can explain my symptoms away as being symptoms of a curse by a horrible witch.
- Festivals that include costumes make it easy to maintain my disguise. I should encourage the formation of such festivals if they don't exist (e.g. by pretending to be the Prince and simply decreeing it in some distant part of the kingdom where the real Prince is unlikely to turn up until the festival is well established).
