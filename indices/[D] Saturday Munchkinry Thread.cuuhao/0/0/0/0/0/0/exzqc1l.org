Yeah, it could accidentally kill someone if done wrong. But you could do things like remove the bits of gravel that stick in people when they get severe road rash, or if someone swallows something like a needle it wouldn't be much of a problem. Children swallow stuff that they shouldn't all the time. People also get things stuck in their butt, which usually requires surgery, but now could be simple to remove. Broken glass is probably a big problem to remove from someone currently as well.

Also, I edited the above comment with two additional things that might work.
