So nonliving solids are in the background tube; living solids, gas, liquids and light are in the foreground tube. The foreground tube moves with you, but the background doesn't. A bottle or airplane would spill its liquid/living contents.

You might be useful in search and rescue, moving through a collapsed building without collapsing it further, and carrying out buried people.

It sounds unhealthy if a person is sitting on the boundary of the tube and then I move, shunting a solid object into them.
