Ah, I get ya. Solid objects still interact with each other as normal while they are in the ‘background ‘ so you can't overlap them any more than you normally can. You can still get overlap to happen but it would need to be with something living, and something solid.

In earlier discussion the power settled on being essentially two overlapping layers of reality.

I don't know what the result would be. But we'd have to assume on a physics level that with the amount of interactions it goes through just by moving, that it's not likely to cause any explosions or anything else that would have been quickly devastating and should have reasonably occurred by now if it was going to happen.
