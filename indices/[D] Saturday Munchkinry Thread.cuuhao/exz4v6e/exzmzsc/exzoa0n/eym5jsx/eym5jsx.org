You wouldn't hit the magma directly. You'd be pushed down into the tube by air pressure and gravity, accelerating thru a vacuum while being burned on the sides by magma and probably being crushed by the pressure on the sides, until you shoot out the other end into space, there to probably go into orbit until some day that you burn up in re-entry.

The magma wouldn't be shot out anywhere as it would disappear when it enters the column as well.
