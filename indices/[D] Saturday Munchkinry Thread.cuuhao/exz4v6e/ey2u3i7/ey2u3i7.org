You are a Kitsune: an intelligent, talking fox with two tails. You possess the power to shapeshift into any human you have ever seen. You can also perfectly imitate the sound of anyone's voice, though you will need to study people's mannerisms if you wish to imitate them perfectly. Your power does not grant you any knowledge of other languages, besides the ones you already know.

This power is purely a magical disguise. It will not make you any stronger or fitter than an average human of your disguise's supposed age. It will also limit your senses to those of a human, so you cannot use your fox hearing or sense of smell while in disguise. It does make you taller, give you the strength of an average human (of the appropriate age), and give you opposable thumbs, but those are the only extras it grants.

Your shapeshifting does not affect any clothing you wear. You need to find clothes if you turn human, and stash your possessions somewhere safe if you become a fox.

If anyone directly, verbally accuses you of being a fox, you will instantly transform back into a fox against your will. You can change back into a human right away, but never fast enough to keep your vulpine nature a secret. This effect can be invoked as many times as a person likes -- anyone who knows your secret can out you at any time.

You cannot cannot hide your tails. When you are a fox, your two tails are always visible. When you are a human, at least one of your tails is always visible, extending out of your disguise's tail-bone. You must conceal your tail inside your clothing, or possibly leave it out and invent some lie to justify it (hunting trophy, part of a costume, etc.).

Any footprints you leave always take the form of fox paw-prints.

Your shadow always bears some visibly vulpine features (ears, a snout, fur, etc.) no matter who you shift into.

All dogs can see through your disguise, no matter what. How they respond to the presence of a human-shaped fox may vary, but most will react with hostility.

You are living in a pre-industrial, medieval society. There are things you wish to do within human society, but many humans fear and distrust Kitsunes, and will not tolerate you if they find out your true nature. What are some good ways to keep your nature a secret, while still having a good degree of freedom to move among humans unnoticed?
