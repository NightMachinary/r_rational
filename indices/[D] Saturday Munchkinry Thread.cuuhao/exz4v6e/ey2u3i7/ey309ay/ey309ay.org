Shift into a baby with the strength of an average human. Train in a mountain forest with your "grandpa" until he accidentally discovers you and you are forced to kill him. Resume your disguise until a princess finds you while out for a ride. Allow her to convince you to take your most prized possession and join her on a quest to collect more like it. Use the time to get her nonchalant about oddities such as your tail so she doesn't question it or make a joke that accidentally outs you. Like her rival on the quest who looks like a prune child or his talking dog. Those are just normal things and not even worth commenting on. Once you've collected the set of seven objects, of which your prized possession is a part she'll wish the dragon would grant her the perfect boyfriend. Be that boyfriend so she gets too starstruck to ever question you. Oh and also climb the world's tallest magical tower and defeat piccolo.
