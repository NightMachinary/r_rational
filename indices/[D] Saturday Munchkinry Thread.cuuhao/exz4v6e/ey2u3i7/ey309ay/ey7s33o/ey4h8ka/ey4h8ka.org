-In human form cut off tail.

-Wear shoes/sandals to have normal footprints

-Go to a city where the large crowds will hide my shadow

-Figure out if I can control what the shadow reveals, if I can then have it default to fur

-Ignore dogs

-Kill any who find out about shapeshifting and immediately leave the area

Now as for freedom. Find an old man in a village, save old man disguise. Steal old man's clothes when they're out to dry. Travel to city by day as a old man to get used to physical abilities and to wear clothes ragged.

Enter city, become beggar, move freely through out the city as a beggar and at night find rats to eat.

Perhaps put on puppet shows to utilize mimicry ability and to earn cash outside of begging. Other than that accomplish whatever goal I have.
