This would not work. It was clarified that an overhang would not fall, so solid matter in the tube interacts with solid matter outside the tube, so the weight distribution of the wheel would be unaffected, as it's entirely solid. But you are onto something here. You just need to use a combination of liquids and solids. For example, put the flywheel underwater and stand under one side. Then that side won't experience buoyancy, while the other will and you get your free power.
