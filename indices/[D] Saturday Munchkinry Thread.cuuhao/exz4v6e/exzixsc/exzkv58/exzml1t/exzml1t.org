Yeah it would be pretty gross, but luckily termite poop isn't living matter.

Oh, just thought of a better use: hospitals. Anybody who has a foreign object in them, like if they swallowed something they shouldn't have or have a bullet in them or whatever, could just be passed above your head. If the power works how I'm thinking it does, the object would then fall out of the person and be revealed whenever you moved, but the main thing is it could be removed from someone painlessly and without surgery.

This could possibly be extended to instant tattoo removal.

I'm assuming, mostly for convenience, that any bacteria or viruses would be considered as part of the host for the purposes of this power. If not, you could sterilize people very easily, which might be bad for digestive purposes but could also cure someone of any biological or viral disease.
