Ok, I don't think I'm communicating this well. This is what I'm trying to get at in my examples:

Take a robot arm that holds a solid log of wood over your head. The wood and connecting part of the arm is in vanish-space. Then take a few hundred pounds of drugs packed into a cylindrical bag of slightly smaller diameter, and bring over your head so that, in vanish-space, it is completely overlapped by the log. When you walk away, what happens? Does the bag, being placed in vanish-space later, overwrite the log? Do the two materials interact within vanish-space, preventing them from overlapping? Or will there be some atomic fusion going on?
