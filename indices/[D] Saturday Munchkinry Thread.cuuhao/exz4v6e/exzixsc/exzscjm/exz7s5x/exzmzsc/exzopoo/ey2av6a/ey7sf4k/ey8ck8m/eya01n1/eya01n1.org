How far up does it go? Just to the point where the atmosphere thins out? Or forever, in which case when you walk around, you're poking temporary holes in infinite planets and suns and moons somewhere.

Does the cylinder stay a perfect cylinder at all times? If so, you now have a method of communicating that's faster than light. Might not be simple to implement but if you have someone lightyears away from you, and they can detect where holes are appearing, you can communicate one way with them. Assuming you can accurately point at their planet, that is.

Good job. You've broken the laws of physics and now the universe rage quits.
