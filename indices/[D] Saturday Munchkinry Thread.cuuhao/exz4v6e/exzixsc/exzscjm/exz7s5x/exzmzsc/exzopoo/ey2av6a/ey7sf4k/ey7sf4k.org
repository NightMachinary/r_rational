I find rain terribly annoying. Perhaps I can train an eagle to hold a wing over my head? ...unlikely.

Does glass count as a solid, or as an exceptionally slow-flowing liquid? If the second, I could use a glass umbrella.

Imagine this situation: A robot arm holds a steel bar (vertically) underwater. I swim under the bar. Bar vanishes, water flows into the gap. I swim away.

I then have a steel bar molecularly bonded to an equivalent volume of water. What uses does this new metamaterial have? (Aside from dunking me the /next/ time I walk under it?)

Is there any actual point to me going inside, ever?

What happens to the electric charge on vanished solids?

Say there's a lightning rod, and a thunderstorm. The rod builds up a charge, and I walk directly under it /just before/ a bolt of lightning would strike it. Does the lightning still strike? If so, where?

Or I walk under a large electromagnet, vanishing it. Are things still attracted to the non-existent magnet?
