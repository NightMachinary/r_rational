Step 1: Massively increase the size of the cylinder directly above you by massively increasing your horizontal size with skin grafts.

Step 2: Make public arrangements to stand on your head at a certain time, causing a large chunk of the Earth to temporarily stop existing, significantly reducing the gravity of the Earth, and allowing for really really cheap rocket launches.

Step 3: Repeat until humanity becomes a space faring civilization.

EDIT: Depending on whether the non-existent solids stay attached to their vehicle, there may be an easier way to launch rockets: just point your head at large chunks of the rockets themselves, so their weight is significantly reduced. Then once they leave the cylinder directly above you all the solids reappear in space.
