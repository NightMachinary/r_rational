Termite extermination. Walk under a building and all the termites above you fall out. You couldn't get them if they were in the walls, depending on how much larger the cylinder is than you are, but you would have a good chance of killing a majority of the nest.

Geology could be interesting, because if you walked through a tunnel in a mountain people could look at rock strata without having to dig. Same with finding veins or ore.

You become a moving no-fly zone, as any plane directly above you either dumps passengers or fuel in midair. Neither of which is particularly useful. You are similarly prohibited from travel by submarine. Dams don't want you anywhere near them.

You're probably never going to want to walk in a building taller than 1 story because you might walk under a waste line, a gas pipe, or a water pipe. Hot water heaters kept in attics might accidentally kill you even then.
