I think the capability to separate solids from liquids would have lucrative applications in various industrial processes. Off the top of my head I can think of sifting gold (probably not effective nowadays) or removing solids in a water treatment plant.

You have clarified that the solid objects continue to exist, and can in fact interact with other solid objects outside the tube (the no falling overhang rule), so I guess the space of the tube above you would eventually be invisibly filled with the solids coming pouring in with the liquid and would block new solids from flowing in, until a plug formed outside the tube stopping the water flowing as well. Then you would have to move to a new spot. No, wait you could remove the solids with a piston or whatever, it would exist for the solids even in the tube, so it would work normally.

Oh, I got it! The solids in the tube would experience a perfect vacuum. High-tech clean room manufactories would probably pay better than water treatment plants.
