hm. Regarding Waves of Stone:

I am a go player, and enjoyed the story. That the protagonist might be a 'throw in' sacrifice to destabilize and destroy a larger group is a cute literary trick. I found myself befuddled by what the actual "conspiracy" was, though.

They are playing a massive game in the attic, and they use stones that are being embezzled somehow, and the hill tribes could potentially influence the cost of Obsidian used to make the pieces, and the government keeps them oppressed so this won't happen... so what?

What does the big game actually signify? Why is it being played? What revolution is the protagonist actually trying to instigate with his sacrifice?

It feels like some elements are missing from the story, or maybe I'm just missing them.
