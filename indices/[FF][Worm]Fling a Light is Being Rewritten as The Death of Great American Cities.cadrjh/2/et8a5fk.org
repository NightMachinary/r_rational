It's hard to articulate why, but I don't like this as much as the earlier version. I think the focus is too tightly on economics. Here are two comments [[https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/9ejzkm/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_september_10/e5rsokl/][[1]]] [[https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/b7y7p7/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_april_01_2019/ek5q6dl/][[2]]] I've written elsewhere describing why an overly direct political theme is offputting. Explaining that for resources to be distributed efficiently in the aftermath of a disaster markets are useful is a worthwhile theme, but only in an organic fashion over a couple of chapters. In the space of a couple paragraphs it verges on trite. You could maybe do it so briefly if you had a different tone, but that was still emergency mode.
