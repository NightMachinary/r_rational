Ah, and we come to a common crossroads in rational fiction involving young protagonists. While the sensible thing to do would be to go and find another Professor that has proven themselves trustworthy (McGonogall, Flitwick, etc.), that doesn't make for as good a story as our plucky, eleven year old heroine deciding to try her hand at apprehending a murderer. Of course, this could be the influence of Old Hermione, considering how much of this shit she did in canon.
