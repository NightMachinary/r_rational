That's precisely why it would be such a good ruse. The dramatic final signature suggests that Old Hermione is gone for good, if you're thinking like you're in a story, so young Hermione (and readers) would lower her guard and stop being paranoid about possible mental manipulation. But really, how good of an indicator is a dramatic gesture outside of story logic? It costs nothing for Old Hermione to make a dramatic gesture even if she has no intention to give up.

These kinds of subversions of the usual narrative rules are one of my favourite things in rational fiction.
