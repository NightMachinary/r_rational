Old Hermione is not dead. I'm 95 percent certain. Simply because the way she "went out" doesn't fit thematically in the slightest with her intended goals. I can't see a competent, adult Hermione being content with leaving things as they are, considering how much there is to lose. Pomfrey's death was sad and unplanned and a complete blindside but DH!Hermione should be able to move past it. I'm confident any implication she's actually gone is a ruse perpetuated by her and the author.
