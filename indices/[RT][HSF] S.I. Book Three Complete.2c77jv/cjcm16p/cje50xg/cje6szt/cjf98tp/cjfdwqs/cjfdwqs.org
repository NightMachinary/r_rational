That's... not out of the realm of possibility. I can certainly do enough worldbuilding for Bunny to keep exploring around and interacting for that long; and I'm taking a couple of days off writing, to try to avoid the crash-and-burn of my previous attempt at long-form fiction.

I have some ideas about where the end of S.I. should be, after which any further adventures would be part of another story, but I can't guarantee satisfying. I'm not sure I've gotten the hang of Reddit's spoiler tags yet, so I'll try using both those and ROT13 in case anyone reading this cares to weigh in on whether it's a good demarcation point: [[/s][SI finale spoiler]]
