I think you're probably right, especially given the amount of detail provided. There's NO WAY Lady Foundlings plans ever work out exactly the way she wants; that's not the way this Universe works. She'll have to improvise to get out of this.

I don't think there's any way she can resign given she's stuck in Arcandia; but it's a good thought.
