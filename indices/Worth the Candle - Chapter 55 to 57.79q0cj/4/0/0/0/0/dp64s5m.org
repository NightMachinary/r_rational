Sorry, I failed to emphasize that the intelligence seemed capable of higher reasoning, not just basic indexing and retrieval. Also, recognizing the source of any violence is part of the knowledge representation, a priori, expected of an autonomous prison built to deal with a number of equally autonomous inmates. The analogue depends heavily on the magical mind-control's limitations - does the mind-control cause the intelligence to ignore all evidence, given that the "attack" backfired and harmed the allegedly guilty party for a minimal payoff?
