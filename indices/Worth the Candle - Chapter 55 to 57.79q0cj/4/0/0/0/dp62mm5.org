Orthogonal intelligence. The penitentiary's mind may be quite inhuman, and have "instinctive" understanding of certain actions and concepts, such as who prisoners/visitors are, what they're allowed to do, et cetera. "Sending a letter" may be something it understands as an action of a certain type, with certain possible consequences that do not include "an explosion". Hence, when an explosion happens, it puts low odds on it being caused by "a letter", and decides that "visitors" caused it.

An analogue: imagine that someone gave you a letter and said to pass it on to another person. That another person, upon your approach, attacks you. The letter had a magical mind-control enchantment meant to influence this person, but would that be your most likely explanation, a priori?
