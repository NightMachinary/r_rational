I'm thinking Fallatehr have found some kind of loophole or blindspot in the Amoureux Penitentiary's rules or mind, and used it to "pass on a letter" --- which the Amoureux Penitentiary honestly believed was a letter/was harmless/wasn't an object whose consequences could be an explosion. As such, when the "letter" detonated, the penitentiary naturally assumed it was a hostile action on Juniper's party's part. Buggy AI, not a malevolent one.
