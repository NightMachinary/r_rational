I demand that everyone show their support for this amazing story by voting for it over on [[http://topwebfiction.com/vote.php?for=worth-the-candle][top web fiction]]!

You can also help by adding a review on [[http://webfictionguide.com/listings/worth-the-candle/][Web Fiction Guide]].

Or someone can make a TV Tropes page for the story by following the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/HowToCreateAWorksPage][directions]]. I can't do it now because I need to go, but if no one else does it by tonight then I'll set up a page.

I don't have an account, but I'll be happy to make one just to make the page. For anyone who doesn't have an account on TV Tropes but have a trope they want to add, just reply to this comment with the name of the trope, a link to the associated TV Tropes page, and the event in the story that invoked the trope.
