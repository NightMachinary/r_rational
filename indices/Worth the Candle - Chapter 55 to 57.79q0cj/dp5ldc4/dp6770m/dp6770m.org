I couldn't figure out what enlightenment she reached. If cards=rules+RNG and illusion=realistic narrative suspending disbelief, the obvious conclusions are Luck (RNG) matters to the PC and more levels means greater agency in exploiting/bending the rules by extending the bounds of the illusion.

Druids! I was thinking about faith-based druidthink as a method to circumvent a DM-imposed traditional narrative of conflicts and resolutions. Adopt a Jedi Code mindset: accept the nature of the game reality, forgo attachments, and sidestep strict narratives by living in the present. A corollary would be self-imposed narratives -- Joon, unlike whatever we know of Uther, has a personal objective that likely aligns with the DM's endgame for him. The narrative cycles of repetition might not apply to him yet. If he believes in his own plot and precommits, the “place your figs” bit made me consider whether it's possible to always "roll for initiative" during quests (which appear to be guaranteed narrative arcs). Because at this point, none of them seem like freebies.
