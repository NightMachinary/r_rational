The cards are observable indicators of the rules, not necessarily the rules themselves. Joon explained why he let Mary's character die:

  “The game has rules, everyone had read them, so violating them would be violating this sacrosanct contract between gamemaster and players. It would be saying that grand gestures matter more than reality. I would have fudged it, if I could, but ...”
#+end_quote

Druids use grand gestures to affect reality, sort of. They just have to commit to /not knowing the rules/ so that the DM is allowed to "fudge it" behind a screen without being found out. If they learn enough physics, for example, to realize that a spell isn't possible, the DM has no choice but to let the spell fail. The screen is gone, everyone can tell what's happening.

I'm not sure what this means for the looping narrative structure. If it's a Rule, then learning more about it just means they're stuck with it, and the DM won't help. If it's just DM preference, then learning about it (and trying to manipulate it) just means the DM will abandon it to stop them from metagaming. Maybe they need to follow it to keep the DM happy, but don't pay too much attention so the DM can bend its rules a little? I don't see any easy answers here.
