I think Mary's insight at the end of chapter 56 is /really important./ For one thing, it explains druids pretty well. Druids are really good at staying "in character" and impressing the DM with their ideas, so they can convince the DM to let them cast powerful spells as long as they don't try to "peek behind the screen" to see if the rules are actually being followed.

Fenn's strategy of not thinking about the narrative might be the best plan in that case. Hopefully she's as popular with the DM as she is with everyone else, and if they don't inspect the narrative structure too closely, maybe the DM will help her out.

Is this the mistake Arthur made? The DM probably didn't appreciate his efforts to look deep into the rules of the world and /publicize/ it, if that's what he was doing. Maybe that's what Solace was alluding to when she implied he wasn't spreading only beneficial memes.
