Was the prison host subverted by Fallatehr when the voice changed? Before its pause, it seemed quite lucent, even sapient (sapient = soul to manipulate?), i.e. making predictions on why Amy is visiting. Maybe a partial subversion that triggered the indiscriminate blanket response to the bomb threat? If the prison itself planned an ambush, it'd likely be a TPK already - supposing the majority of its magic isn't confined to the prison proper.
