The italics aren't quite right throughout the fic, mostly because of how AO3 does their automated tagging, which will put a space inbetween italicized and unitalicized characters. It's a pain in the butt, and I mostly just let it be that way so I don't have to spend time reformatting it. Hopefully this isn't too annoying (and hopefully you won't see it everywhere once you notice it).

Fixed the other one though.
