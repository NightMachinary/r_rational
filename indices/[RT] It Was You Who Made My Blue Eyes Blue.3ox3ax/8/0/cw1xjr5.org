The story doesn't mention it, but of course, this is a reference to the Fermat theorem. It requires a, b, x and n to be non-zero integers. If you don't take that into account, you should conclude that they must bathe every day, because any x can be very easily represented as a sum of powers of some non-integers a and b.
