I'm thinking the blue-eyed islander problem out and I'm thinking that the following things are true:

- If you, as an outsider, convince the islanders collectively of any /true/ statement that implies that there's at least one blue-eyed islander, all the blue-eyed islanders will leave the island.
- If you, as an outsider, convince the islanders collectively of any /false/ statement that implies that there's at least one blue-eyed islander, they will collectively correct themselves, realizing that it's false. Probably no one will leave the island. (EDIT: Or maybe everyone leaves the island?! IDK, I think my original conclusion was false now that I'm thinking about it more.)
