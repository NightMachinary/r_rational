You can get Newtonian gravity from the motion of visible planets and the sun. You can get a rough idea of phase transitions and thermodynamics by watching cookery. Matter appears to be preserved in all understood cases.

Volcanoes physically grow during an eruption. Magma cools into rock, and appears in the caldera. Since matter can't just be created, it makes sense that it came from below. Since rock and magma are the same, and the Earth is huge, and the caldera narrow, the layer of solid rock has to be thin compared to the size of the Earth, since a column of magma below the volcano can remain molten for centuries. So it makes sense that the solid rock is but a crust, and the magma came up from below for some reason.
