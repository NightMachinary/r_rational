I wonder if the only reason that no-one has induced a self-improvement loop by consuming more and more sparkroot is because everyone concludes, past a certain amount of sparkroot, that if it were possible to induce a self-improvement loop by consuming more and more sparkroot, someone would have already, which has clearly not happened, and therefore the risk of death-by-overdose infinitely outweighs the potential for a self-improvement loop.

Clearly we need to force-feed someone indefinite amounts of sparkroot to see what happens. If the answer is "they die", then we add an entry to the Tablets Of Enku that says "don't eat too much sparkroot" and then never speak of it again.
