The ritual to become a Gold Mage involves marking some gold as your own, you can't do the ritual to become a Gold Mage without doing so, so it isn't quite the same as meeting some other unlock condition. Since your strength as a Gold Mage is proportional to how much gold you have, you can effectively treat Mary as having half of Joon's (fairly low) level divided in half, then multiplied by the amount of gold she's marked as her own, i.e. none.

  We performed the ritual with five pounds of gold, with a street value of about ten thousand obols. It was only a small fraction of what we had available, but part of the point was to test it and see what kinds of demands would be levied against me in the first few minutes. - [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25137/worth-the-candle/chapter/537828/gilding-the-lily][Gilding the Lily]]
