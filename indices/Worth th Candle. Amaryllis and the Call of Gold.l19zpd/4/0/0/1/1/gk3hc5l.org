But that's obviously unworkable, since if they were both gold mages with separate hoards each would demand it of the other and either one would be a double-strength superman and the other unpowered, or both would refuse to act and lose it. You're effectively excluding this one spell type from synergy. The whole point of that perk is to let each of them hitchhike on the other's strength without putting in the effort or paying the price to get the skill. Possession of a hoard is a prerequisite for power, not a mana-type cost (nor an implement like a gem mage's gems), so in the absence of an overwhelming reason to deny it I'd say it's only fair to let her hitchhike on this the way she hitchhikes on all the magic and Joon hitchhikes on her social skills.
