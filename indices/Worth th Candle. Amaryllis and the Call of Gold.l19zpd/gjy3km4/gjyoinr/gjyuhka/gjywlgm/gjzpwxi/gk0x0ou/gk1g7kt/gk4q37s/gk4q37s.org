Good point. I still find this really surprising, in that soul magic had been excluded in pieces, and textually it's the only magic we know that has been partially excluded, combined with the [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin#:%7E:text=A%20title%20should%20tell%20you,It%20Says%20on%20the%20Tin%22.&text=This%20trope%20also%20shows%20up%20in%20naming.][exactly what it says on the tin]] factor (Warning: tvtropes); I predicted it would be more central to the endgame. I still think it might come back a la de-novue wishing, but he'd have to either break the three beat on GM meetings, or make up with the GM /in character./
