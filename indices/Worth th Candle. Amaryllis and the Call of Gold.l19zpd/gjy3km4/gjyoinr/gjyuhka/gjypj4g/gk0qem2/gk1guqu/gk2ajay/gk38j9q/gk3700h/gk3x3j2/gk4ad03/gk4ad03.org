No power set is supposed to be shared between people in the first place. Joon isn't "supposed" to learn at 500x normal speed or spontaneously regrow limbs after accumulating sufficient life experiences. Joon's life is a giant bundle of unfair exceptions, but it's also a game and that punk-ass DM is reneging for no particularly good reason when Mary could have done a lot of damage control before Joon got back from Celestar. Also, it's not clear to me that the Call of the Gold is an independent entity instead of the DM talking into a mic. Joon treats it like one, but in the same way I cuss at my computer at work. It doesn't have much of a personality.
