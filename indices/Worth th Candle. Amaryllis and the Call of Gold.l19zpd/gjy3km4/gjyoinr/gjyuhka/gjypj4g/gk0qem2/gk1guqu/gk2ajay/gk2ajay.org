What makes having a wad of gold different from being tapped with a stick or going through years of study and practice? Bear in mind that Joon has six-eyed so DM legalism should be at least somewhat generous, and defining "having equivalent power to a given mass of gold" as a kind of "skill" isn't that much of a stretch--gold quantity functions as a partial analog to skill in other magics as it is. Saying she personally needs to have gold goes against the whole spirit of synergy, since that's obviously impossible.

If Joon broke the speed record to become a velocity mage, would Mary need to break the speed limit again to use his skill? Since water magic is tied to bloodline, is that barred to Mary? And what about her skill in gold magic is more absurd than Joon having half Fenn's skill in archery in spite of barely-if-ever touching a bow in his life? Or any of the rest of this? A reasonable DM compromise would be to give her half Joon's skill and half his hoard, which I'm guessing would make her substantially stronger than Aumann but with less control.
