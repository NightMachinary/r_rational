The difference is that having gold is a constant requirement that the skill is directly based on, and all the other conditions are initial requirements that unlock the skill without modifying it in any way. Plus, the former is reversible by normal game mechanics (i.e. losing the gold) while the latter isn't.

It also makes way more sense from a thematic and story perspective to not have Mary gain access to it, an argument that holds a lot of weight for a system that is being maintained by the DM, who has a story he wants to tell and can make arbitrary decisions that go against what seems "reasonable" for him to allow. The whole point of Gold Magic is that, ultimately, the Call of the Gold only wants one person to have access to it. If it turned out Mary could use it as well it would likely tell Joon to either lower her Loyalty or kill her to stop that. The idea of both gaining access to it by having separate gold hoards is /supposed/ to be unworkable, because the entire skill is supposed to be unworkable.
