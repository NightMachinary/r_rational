I think a better analogy would be bone magic. You can be a pretty skilled bone mage, but if you don't have any bones to use, your skill isn't worth much. Gold magic is similar in that it relies on an external resource to use the magic, even if that resource isn't consumed through use of the magic. Similarly, gem mages don't do much without any gems, and warders can at most see magic if they don't have any warder's tools. Gem mages might be a closer analogue to gold magic, since the gems themselves do play a significant factor in how powerful the gem mage effectively is.
