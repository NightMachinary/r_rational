Gold magic makes a mess of Synergy no matter how you interpret it. A reasonable reading, IMO, would be to give Amaryllis some fraction of his skill without the drawback of having to separately propitiate the bugbear, and I've said as much before. She didn't have to meditate or get hit with the stick at Sound and Stillness, she didn't undergo the training or initiation process for any other kind of magic except blood, so she should be a damn gold mage already.
