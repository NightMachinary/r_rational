Have we seen her use water magic?

I think having half his skill without the actual ability (so she would have half his skill once she completes the ritual) is completely reasonable, given that the call of the gold is inherent, ongoing cost of the magic, and she wouldn't want to have it unexpectedly. It also doesn't seem like it'd be compatible with a shared hoard.
