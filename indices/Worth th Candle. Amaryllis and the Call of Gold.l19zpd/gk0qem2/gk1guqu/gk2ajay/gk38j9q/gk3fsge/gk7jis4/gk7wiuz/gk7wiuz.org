Nothing is really a close analog, gold magic being weird, but bones are a mana-type fuel and gems and wands are implements, closer to a bladebound's sword. The gold doesn't have to be anywhere near the user (or even on the same plane, as we've seen), it's purely a cap on maximum power exerted. If anything, it's closer to a stat like POI or STR, a secondary limit on skill growth, and Synergy ignores those.
