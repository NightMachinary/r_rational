False equivalency. Breath and concordance are mana bars, meant to limit the amount of power you can use within a given time period. They do not determine strength; Joon seems to control sound equally well whether he has full breath, half, or almost empty. By contrast, telekinesis doesn't use up gold; the limit in that respect is Joon getting physically exhausted throwing himself around.
