Awesome! I just caught up a few weeks ago. I liked it a lot. The Leviathan fight was great but it was a little too exhausting to read. There was an Extra Credits about this sort of thing for games / movies (I'd definitely recommend it but I'm too lazy at the moment to look up the link): if there are small drama breaks, like when Skitter does some medical duty in the canon Leviathan fight or when she meets with the lazer dude in the Behemoth fight then it works much better that way for the pacing. There was one but it could have done with another brief interlude about what was happening at the hospital, for example.

I like Mouse Protector. She's cheesy (hehe).
