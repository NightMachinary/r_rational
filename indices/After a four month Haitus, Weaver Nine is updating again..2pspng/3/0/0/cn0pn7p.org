I actually thought the Leviathan fight was the worst part!

I thought the rest of the fic was fantastic, then Leviathan just went on forever without really letting the interesting parts of the fic (Jack being manipulative, Weaver being terrifying and well-organized, various people being in the wrong place) make an appearance.
