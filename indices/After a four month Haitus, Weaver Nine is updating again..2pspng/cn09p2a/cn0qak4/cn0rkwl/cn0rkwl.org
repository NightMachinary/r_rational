Right, the spacebattles thread is best for now. The only problem is that if you 'watch' the thread on spacebattles you get alerts whenever anyone makes a post, there's no way to limit the alerts to story posts.

After I finish uploading the edited version to ff.net and ao3, my plan is to release new chapters simultaneously on all three sites. Then you can follow/subscribe on ff.net or ao3 if you just want to get alerts about new chapters.

Edit: OK, the ff.net and ao3.org versions are basically up to date (except one chapter that I intend to edit a lot for the polished version). So you can follow/subscribe to the story there. It may be a while before I can update again, but we'll see what I can do!
