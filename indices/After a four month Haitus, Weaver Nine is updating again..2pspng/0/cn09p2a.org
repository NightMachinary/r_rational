Thanks everyone for your comments - I'm glad you liked Weaver Nine! I probably won't be able to update often, but I'll see if I can manage to make an update once in a while.

Also, to answer your comments:

- Eliezer was pretty justified in guessing that it was complete - the fic was at a fairly good place for a stopping point (albeit a bit abrupt). That said, I personally don't have a preference for fics that are 'complete' vs 'incomplete'. Real life doesn't always have clear-cut endings, and if you write an interesting setting, there will always be more interesting stories to tell. So I'm not sure that I'll ever declare the fic to be officially 'completed'.

- Thanks for your feedback about the fic in this and the previous thread, both the positive and the negative. You make a good point about the pace of the Leviathan fight. The fic isn't written in a way that makes it easy to do a perfect fix, but I have a few tricks in mind that should help me fix this a bit for a polished final version of the fic. I've been posting the edited/improved version on [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10898446/1/Weaver-Nine][FanFiction.net]] and [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2776352/][Archive of Our Own]] chapter by chapter.
