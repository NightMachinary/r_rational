Correct me if I'm wrong but didn't Cat already use up Rise? I though she only had three tries and that afterwards she lost the ability. If so, it makes me think that she can learn how an aspect works via Take and then replicate its effects using her Winter power.

I'm very glad we got to see this battle from an outside perspective. It doesn't strike me as particularly important so letting us see other point of views makes it more interesting than just another standard battle.
