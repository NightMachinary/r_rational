Liar Game is a pretty good Rational manga. Here's a summary:

#+begin_quote
  Written by Shinobu Kaitani (also the author of One Outs), Liar Game is a manga and drama series about the struggles of Nao Kanzaki against a mysterious and nefarious organization called the Liar Game Tournament Office that places innocent people through psychological games using their debt as bait. All its members wear masks and any participants of the game are free to drop out, assuming they pay their debt which the game forced upon them. With debt that frequently is in the 100 million yen range and quite often more, it's no small deal. Said organization will also collect the debt "any way possible..." Using the help of recently released conman/genius/Chess Master Shinichi Akiyama, Nao seeks to rid herself of debt and also save those who are participating in the games. Expect all kinds of plans and cunning to apply here, as it is a Battle Royale of wits.
