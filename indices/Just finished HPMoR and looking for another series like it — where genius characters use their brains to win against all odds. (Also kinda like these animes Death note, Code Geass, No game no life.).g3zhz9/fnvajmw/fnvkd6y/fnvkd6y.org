I second this. Significant Digits takes longer to build up, it isn't as light and accessible as HPMoR, but it really is very good.

Even if you don't read the rest of the story, at least read [[http://www.anarchyishyperbole.com/2015/07/significant-digits-chapter-fourteen.html][the Azkaban chapter]]. I don't reread all of SD every time I read HPMoR, but I always read that chapter.
