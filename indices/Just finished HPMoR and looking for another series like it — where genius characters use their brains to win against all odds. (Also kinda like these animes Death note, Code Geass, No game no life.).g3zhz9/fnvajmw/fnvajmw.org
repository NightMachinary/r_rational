If you've just finished HPMOR, go give Significant Digits a try. Unofficial sequel which takes methods of rationality and runs with it. I'd say it's better writing and there are bits that are bloody amazing. Def worth a read.

Otherwise Mother of Learning is my favourite - long, the writing style takes a while to get going, but is a very well thought out and iterated upon universe
