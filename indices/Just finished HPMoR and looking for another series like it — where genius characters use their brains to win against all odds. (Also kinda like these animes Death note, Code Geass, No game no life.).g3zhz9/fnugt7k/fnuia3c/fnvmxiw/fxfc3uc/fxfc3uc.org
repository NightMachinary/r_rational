Agree. At first I was a bit annoyed, because of the edgy MC who got a powerup right at the beginning entirely coincidentally, and also the heavy-handed vengeance porn aspect of the first arc. Some people could have criticized the apparent millitary jingoism as well, I didn't though because I don't care much about such things in fiction. But then the powerup became less and less relevant, the MC chilled out, the demons got humanized, the jingoes became the antagonists, and even before that the story entered a stupidly long streak of being consistently entertaining.
