Probably be another year to complete translation. However, the current translation point is actually a good place to read up to because it's the end of book 5, a major story arc. Essentially, it's the end point of a major series, with a sequel series to follow (kind of like the Belgariad and Mallorean, or Mistborn Era One and Era Two for ratfic).
