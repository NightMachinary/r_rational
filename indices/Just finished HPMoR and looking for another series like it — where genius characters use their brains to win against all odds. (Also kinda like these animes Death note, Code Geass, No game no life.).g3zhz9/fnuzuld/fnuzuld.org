This is more just an anime recommendation as this series only feels like the MC is a rationalist if one justifies it themselves in their head (but if you like anime): Knight and Magic. It definitely has some aspects of trope awareness for example.

Another that I just like a lot as good rationalism and would recommend to anyone after reading HPMOR is Worth the Candle. For the parts you seem to enjoy however it's a /very slow burn/. I'm talking like 1 in 15 chapters displaying the quality that you seem to be aiming for (e.g. in the ~200 chapters currently in the series I would say I can think of about a dozen "extremely smart MC outsmarts everyone" scenes (they are often the entire chapter) though I will say that in the last few blocks of ~20 chapters we got two and a half excellent ones and I really enjoyed it, and there is an implication of rising tension as the MC seems like he will soon be having to face more threats that have been built up throughout the series). I would say read till the end of chapter 14 (the end of first book, the first time this quality is displayed) to see if you like it or not.

Finally as a fantasy example that is somewhat less rationalist (but with a decently rational universe) I would recommend Practical Guide to Evil. It's /sort of/ "young adult" and feels a bit more adventure-y than say HPMOR, or say Death Note. But the main character's thing is definitely out smarting everyone.
