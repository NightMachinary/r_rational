Oh yeah, it's not a perfect series by any means, and the structure of the plotting is definitely a weak point. The author was forcing himself to keep on a writing schedule to practice, so it often does not come across as precisely plotted out beforehand. I will say though that this gets better with time as they author adapts to the webserial format.

Worm has plenty of weaknesses but to me its strengths are so notable and unique that they outweigh all of the bad. One of the most impressive things to me is how the author managed to write such a massive cast of interesting, dynamic and layered characters. It kind of blows my mind how well he understands his characters' needs and motivations on top of everything else.

But at this point I'm preaching to the choir. ;) Glad you're reading it, hope you enjoy the ride!
