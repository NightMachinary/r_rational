40MoC is truly amazing- a rational cultivation novel set in a sci-fi universe that isn't a mere veneer over a traditional one. Characters all have their own solid motivations, and there are layers within layers in plotting, evolving from what appears to be a standard beginning. MC is smart, but within reason since older, more experienced enemies can out-think him.

There are obvious references to Warhammer 40k, Star Wars, and others, but nothing that infringes on the story's own sense of fun. The author really gave a lot of consideration to working out his story and the background universe. Having read up to the latest translation (almost 1900 chapters out of 3335), I'd say it is my #1 pick for cultivation novels (and I've read a lot of these). Those chapters cover a lot of complete story arcs and should keep you occupied for a long time.
