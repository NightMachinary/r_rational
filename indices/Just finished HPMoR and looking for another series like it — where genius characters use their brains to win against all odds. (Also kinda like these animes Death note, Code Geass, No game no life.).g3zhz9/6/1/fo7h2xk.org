I'd agree with what was said except for guide. While Cat is exceptional at bending narratives to her will and is a fantastic military commander she's rather shortsighted and can't play the long-game anywhere near as well as Malicia or Hasenbach. It's referred to many times in the series as being one of her biggest weaknesses.
