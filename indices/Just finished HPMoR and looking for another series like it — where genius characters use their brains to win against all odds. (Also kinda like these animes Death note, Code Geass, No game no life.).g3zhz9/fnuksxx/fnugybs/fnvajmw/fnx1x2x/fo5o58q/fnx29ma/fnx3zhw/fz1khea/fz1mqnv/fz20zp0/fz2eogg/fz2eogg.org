Interesting! But at the same time I'm not sure you can attribute how fleshed out the characters are to that alone. Obviously it helps, but the ensemble cast is so truly massive that I think juggling all the different characters' motivations, drives, breaking points, relationships, etc takes a special kind of talent. I doubt I could ever create something so textured no matter how long I had to think about it. Wildbow's got a gift for sure
