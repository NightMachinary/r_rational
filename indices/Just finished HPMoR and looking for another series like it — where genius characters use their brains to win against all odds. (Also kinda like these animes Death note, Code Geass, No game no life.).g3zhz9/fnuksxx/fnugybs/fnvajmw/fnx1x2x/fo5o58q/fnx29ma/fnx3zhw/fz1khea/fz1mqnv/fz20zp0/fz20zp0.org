WildBaby started writing about Faultline and the gang in 2002, then wrote a story about other groups every two years (The Travelers arc was essentially written in 2007). He also went through eight or nine drafts before starting Worm proper.

I mean, it wasn't like he was working on Worm every waking moment from 2002-2011, but he was definitely world-building piece by piece.
