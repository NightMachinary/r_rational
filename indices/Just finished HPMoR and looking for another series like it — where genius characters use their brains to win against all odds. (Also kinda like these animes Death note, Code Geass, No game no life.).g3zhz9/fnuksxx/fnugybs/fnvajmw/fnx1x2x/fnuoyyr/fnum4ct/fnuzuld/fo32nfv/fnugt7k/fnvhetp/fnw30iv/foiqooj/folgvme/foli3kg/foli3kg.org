The one thing Liar Game does better is that some of the games are more cleverly designed than in Alice in Borderland. But Alice in Borderlands is better than Liar Game in other areas, I think.

Edit: I recommend watching the anime until the last episode, then switching to the manga-equivalent.

Edit: Also Alice in Borderland has violence and blood in it, which makes it less likely to show up in the manga section of an American bookstore, I'd bet.
