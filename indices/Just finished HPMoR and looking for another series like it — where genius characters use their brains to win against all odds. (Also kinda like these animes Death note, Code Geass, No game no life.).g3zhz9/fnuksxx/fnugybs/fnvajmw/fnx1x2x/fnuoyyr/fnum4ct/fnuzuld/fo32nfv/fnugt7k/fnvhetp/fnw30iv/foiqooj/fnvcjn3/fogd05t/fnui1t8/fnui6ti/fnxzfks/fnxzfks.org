Does it seem likely to complete within a definite time? <curiosity> I know of various manga which have had a planned ending reached despite popularity (e.g. Death Note?), but especially for shounen-manga (though also for light novel series...) I have a general impression of series being stretched on for as long as their popularity lasts. (Naruto comes to mind, in which it ending was a surprising blip in the background of it never ending despite not being of remaining interest.)

I would be inclined to recommend instead reading to the end of the first arc or first few arcs, then either dropping it or leaving it to accrue more arcs; it would be a shame if you kept tabs on it for years or decades, it finally ended, you at last started a complete collection of it, and then within a few chapters you realised "Oh, it turns out I don't enjoy this one after all.".

<moment of introspection> Not only in light novel series and manga, but also in long-running Chinese translated novels, I'm seeing a trend in myself of seeking out and enjoying the starts of stories, the parts where the premise is set up and all the interesting moments at the beginning that give a good first impression happen, then dropping out as soon as there stops being meaningful progression and the author drops into a rut/treadmill. The ones that hold my interest are those which can maintain enjoyment despite a rut or especially if giving an impression of meaningful change and progress... hmm. </introspection>
