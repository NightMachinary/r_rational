Metropolitan Man.

Also, since you like One Outs, the author of One Outs did a manga that's like Liar Game called Alice in Borderland. And it's great. I liked it even more than I liked Liar Game.

The anime version was never completed. But there's going to be a live action version soon. Which may or may not be any good. So just read the manga. Or watch the anime and then switch over to the manga.
