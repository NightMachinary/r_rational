I'm shocked that nobody has mentioned *Worm*, I figured it might be very popular in a subreddit like this.

Worm is a webserial set in a grimdark superheroes-and-supervillains universe. Reading it completely dismantled my chances of ever enjoying another superhero setting again, because I know none of them is ever gonna come close to being as good.

--------------

Short blurb: Sometime in the 1980's, for reasons not fully understood, around 1 in every 10,000 people started developing powers. Parahumans -- or capes as they're often called -- can develop a /massive/ array of different abilities: Exuding gaseous shadow, warping landscape, shifting into parallel states of reality, shapeshifting the bones in their own bodies, constructing hyperadvanced modular technology, developing a supercharged ability to pick up on subtle hints and form conclusions, and many, many more.

Here's the catch: Capes usually manifest powers during the worst, most traumatic experiences of their entire lives. Villains are fucked up. Heroes are fucked up. Everybody in the series has more baggage than LAX on a busy day, and when you throw superpowers into the mix, that makes /shit go down./

--------------

Geniuses with mental powers act like geniuses with mental powers, working in the shadows to leverage events to their favor. But /everybody/ plays smart, thinker or brute, because those who didn't often wound up dead very quickly. All powers -- every single one of them -- have strengths that the users exploit and limitations that they need to cover to prevent being exploited. The victors are usually the capes that can outwit their opponents, discover the flaws in their armor, and drive the stake in deep before the other gets the chance to. Synergistic power combinations, truces, citywide strategy, negotiation, espionage, alliances, tactical retreats and logistics/counterlogistics operations are bread and butter for parahumans.

The ultimate example of this powers-as-chessgame theme is the main character herself. Taylor controls bugs. Specifically, all arthropods in a 1-3 block radius. This may seem strong in a vacuum, against normal people. But bear in mind this is a universe where people can literally bathe themselves in fire, use blades as if they had the range of a sniper rifle, transform into hounds of whirring metal saws, fly around nigh invincible, absorb powers, fire energy beams from their hands, increase their size and resilience 10x, hit with the strength of 100 men, conjure infinite weapons and level buildings with their bare hands. Oh, and did I mention that there are 3 massive cryptic beings called Endbringers which show up once every few months in an attempt to systematically genocide the human race? In this universe the ability to control bugs is often, on its face, ludicrously outmatched.

But her power is a lot more versatile than it appears on the surface, and Taylor is completely /brilliant/ at leveraging it. Let's break it down:

All bugs in a 1-3 block radius. Cockroaches, fleas, biting beetles, wasps, bees, spiders. She can feel the locations of people or things through their senses, perceive where each and every one her bugs is, and direct them all individually, but with the coordinated strength of a general commanding an army in realtime. Also, the number she can control is essentially infinite.

Her range of control is limited, of course. But if she chooses to cruise around in a van and collect millions and millions of insects into one place before initiating a fight, who's going to stop her? Spider silk is light and has all the tensile strength of steel, but in the real world collecting it is very slow and difficult. Taylor, however, can have them breed and weave silk all day long. So she gets near unbreakable cords with which to orchestrate her attacks, and can distribute silk-reinforced body armor to her teammates.

What else. Having wasps airdrop other insects that can't fly? Check. Pre-coating flying insects with capsaicin or pepper spray to further incapacitate opponents? Check. Planting insects on people to track them? Check. Manipulating objects with her swarm? Check. Creating simple doppelgangers by forming bugs into a roughly human shape? Check. Emulating speech through the coordinated buzzing and chirping of her swarm? Check. And that's just a few of the basics of her toolkit; how she uses each of these with each other, builds them up, and combines those abilities with those of the people she's fighting beside, is nothing short of genius. It makes her power one of the most dynamic and enjoyable in all of Worm's truly /massive/ cast.

[[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/][You can read it free here.]] It's extremely long, at 1.7 million words (the entire Harry Potter series is just over a million) but excellent all the way through. As a web serial it was released in small chunks, so it's very conducive to being picked up and put down at your leisure.

If any of this sounds like the kind of thing you're into, then you owe it to yourself to give it a read.
