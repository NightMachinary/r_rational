  And since I'm the author of the story, my model of what the AI does is by definition what the AI does

Ok. I think we're talking about different things. The AI box experiment was intended to show that an any superintelligent AI would be able to talk itself out of box given only a text channel. It wasn't intended to be a backdrop for a story. I was interpreting your text as the former (an actual argument that an AI, in reality, would use), while you are considering it the later.

Similarly, I could say that the AI chose the apple picking strategy, or any randomly chosen strategy for that matter, in a story that I made, and you would consider that equally fine since it isn't intended to map onto our reality, correct?

  The map is the territory, if you're the one writing both.

That isn't true in general. Characters can be wrong. And that's one of the best ways to separate good fiction form mary-sue fiction.
