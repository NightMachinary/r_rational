Thank you, that makes a lot of sense!

So my potentially bad AI is worse than someone's good AI (even if it's programmed to reshape the world in a way that I fundamentally disagree with?), but I'm not sure it resolves the situation where I believe that my AI has a better chance of being good than someone else's. What's the right thing to do in that case?

Also even if Chinese government is super smart and cautious, if there's enough people getting closer to the solution there's a good chance that at least one of them will be a crazy idiot. So AI race is just something we need to not happen? If we find ourselves in that situation we are already screwed, right? But I don't see how we'd prevent it.
