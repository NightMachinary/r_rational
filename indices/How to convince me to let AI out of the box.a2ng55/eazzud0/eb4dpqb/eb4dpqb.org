Agreed. This post has been removed. I probably would have removed it more quickly, had I noticed it. I don't /wholly/ object to AI-box stuff, given that it's roleplay (and decent enough fodder for fiction), but we've had a fair amount of it lately, and I don't want to see more, especially not posts like this, which are responses/necromancy related to previous, more content-rich posts.
