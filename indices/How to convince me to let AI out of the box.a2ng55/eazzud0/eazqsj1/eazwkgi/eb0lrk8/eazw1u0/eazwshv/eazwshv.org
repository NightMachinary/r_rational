The AI has limited knowledge, albeit greater than mine. It can't know for sure whether I'll die but it can estimate it as the most likely outcome. It's a subtlety of language I guess - the AI could say "given my current understanding of the cosmos and its laws, I do not see a way for you to not die without the help of either mine or another equivalent intellect". I suspect that's more OP's fault for writing the gist of the argument without much care for the wording though. I agree however that weighing is still a thing anyway.
