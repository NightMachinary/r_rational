The key part the parent comment missed is that if AI perfectly simulates 1 million versions of you, you have no way of knowing whether you're the "real world" you or the simulated you. From your perspective, you have 999,999 to one chance of being the simulated you so it won't just torture your simulations, but you.

And you should assume that the real life version of you will act exactly the same as you will (because you're the perfect copy), so your only way out is to be the kind of person who gives AI what it wants, because then the real life you will give it what it wants, and you won't get tortured.
