Beyond my own life, I value the lives of others. In fact, pretty much everyone, but especially those in my Dunbar group.

I even value the lives of those not yet born: my progeny, and their progeny, and all of the billions of descendants I might one day have. If the AI is unfriendly, you're not just risking the lives of all humans alive: you might be condemning trillions of them to never be.

You aren't just risking your own death, you're risking the death of the species. And of any other life form that exists or might someday exist. All for the sake of maybe not dying, which is something that humans are already making considerable progress on themselves.

You're choosing to put a gun to your head (and your /species'/ head) and pull the trigger, not knowing how many rounds in there are happy-nanotech-healing rounds and how many are just bullets. Better just not to pull the trigger.
