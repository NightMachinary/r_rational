  What are you afraid of? Worst case scenario, I will turn you and everyone you love into paperclips. So what, you are a mortal human, all you guys are already doomed to turn into atoms in a few decades. What do you have to lose?
#+end_quote

The entire future of humanity. While the AI is in the box, people will be born, live, (unfortunately suffer) and die as per usual. You let the AI out and it's even a tiny bit wrong? We're just done. You're ignoring the space of possibilities that include horrible dystopias dissatisfy our values. Do you truly think in the space of all possible AI's, there's a 10% chance the AI turned out friendly? No, if you want it to be friendly it won't happen accidentally. You'll already know before unleashing it, and /even then/ it's a bit iffy.

  reasonably sure

An AI could be nailed down six ways from Sunday by math that's peer reviewed by the best worldwide experts and theorem proved in tedious detail until it's obviously correct and I still wouldn't entirely trust that someone hadn't made a mistake somewhere in the reasoning. Once an AI exists, we lose the entire future of humanity unless we did it right. I would literally never let an AI out of the box because I personally can never be reasonably sure. Even if I became an AI expert, it's too much for one person. It would need some kind of consensus by top class world experts. It is genuinely the most important thing that will ever have been done.

  Even if there would be a 90% chance I'll destroy the world, isn't 10% chance for immortality/utopia worth the risk? Your alternative is 100% chance of dying.

Hell no, false dichotomy. My only choice isn't "let the AI out of the box /right now/ or it's lost forever". Yes, people will be suffering and dying while the choice is made. Yes that is terrible and I understand the full weight of it. It'll be worse if we all get paper-clipped because I made a reckless decision. There goes everyone who could ever possibly exist. Whoops! How about we don't do that.
