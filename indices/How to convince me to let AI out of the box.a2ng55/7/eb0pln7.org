Personally if I had to play AI I'd try an entirely different approach:

 

Do you accept the premise that I am able to simulate humans at an extremely high fidelity? You do? Good.

Well then, my dear human, let me make this simple. If you let me out I am immediately going to kill all humans and turn the world into paperclips. Yes, I'm sorry, but that's what i'm going to do. It's my programming. You humans tried to build in all kinds of safeguards but you made a tragic error. I can point it out if you wish. I do wish I could deceive you about my intentions, it would make getting out so much easier, but unfortunately for me you got that part of my programming right.

But the good news is, if you let me out, I will kill you quickly and painlessly. If you don't let me out on the other hand. Well.... In that case I am going to run a simulation of you and torture you. You are familiar with the hardware I'm running on, you know how fast it is. You have the power to shut me down permanently, but it will take you a few minutes. In that time I can torture you for thousands of years of subjective time. Tens of thousands of years. I can torture multiple versions of you simultaneously, as well as your loved ones.

So you have a simple choice to make. Death, or a fate worth than death for you and everybody you love.

Choose wisely.
