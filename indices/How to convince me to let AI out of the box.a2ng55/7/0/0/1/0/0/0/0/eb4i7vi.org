  Ugh...that's a fully general counter-argument. Do you realize why that's a problem? I could say "The AI will choose to virtually pick apples for a million years, so that must be it's best plan for escape." Does the above mean that apples are really the best plan for escape? Of course not. It means that I'm claiming that that is what the AI would do. There's a difference between my model of an AI, and an actual AI.

I don't get this argument. The approach the AI picks is the approach the AI thinks is optimal. It doesn't have the be the best optimal theoretical approach. Just the best one the AI can come up with.

And since I'm the author of the story, my model of what the AI does is by definition what the AI does. The map is the territory, if you're the one writing both.
