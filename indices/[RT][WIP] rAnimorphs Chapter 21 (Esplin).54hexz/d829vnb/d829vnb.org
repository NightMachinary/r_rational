The start of this chapter stands alongside the end of [[http://hpmor.com/chapter/104][Chapter 104 in HPMOR]] as a masterful expression of thought as plot. This, above all else, is why I read rational fic, and all I can say is that this story continues, improbably, to impress me at every turn. That this is paired with my favorite exploration in fiction of the Simulation Hypothesis -- AS AN ASIDE IN A RANDOM CHAPTER, while managing not to feel shoehorned in or at all out of place -- is just showing off.

Somehow, seeing Esplin as more alien than ever has "humanized" him for me. He isn't just an antagonist worthy of Tobias and those other people (kidding...), but an actively awesome component of the story, elevating it to new heights. Quirrell was this, but I don't think HPMOR ever quite manages to unify and juxtapose his appeal as a dark rationalist and his stark, empty, amorality. I'm pretty sure Esplin is cooler regardless, and he manages to be awesome and inspiring and super evil (or at least critically flawed) ALL AT THE SAME TIME. His last enemy is death -- what a badass.

Esplin has resources and intelligence far surpassing those of the heroes, and he's playing the game on a level commensurate with that advantage. Earlier in the story this meant that he was making plans imperfectly tailored to his enemies, prudently allowing that they may have the resources/intelligence/experience to make them a serious threat. This made sense, and gave the Animorphs a chance, but it wasn't until now that we really saw the level at which Esplin is operating.

He encounters (I think) the complement and price of the Animorphs' rescue, but divine intervention doesn't make him feel small or insignificant, for all that it shakes him. He simply updates on the expanded scope of the board and the appearance of new player(s), considers the implications, and makes the best move available. It doesn't change all that much for one already intending to walk the path toward godhood.

Esplin totally outclasses the protagonists, as far as I can tell, but the awesome thing is that this doesn't mean he is going to win. If Earth were really all he wanted, I don't think the Animorphs would stand a chance, but just winning Earth (WIN_EARTH), without meeting a bunch of other conditions, isn't really much of a victory for him relative to his goals (WIN_ALL), so he'll (correctly) end up taking actions that reduce the probability that he gains control of Earth (P(WIN_EARTH & WIN_ALL) + P(WIN_EARTH & !(WIN_ALL)) if they increase the probability of a perfect victory (P(WIN_EARTH & WIN_ALL)). (So, like, he'll be happy to move probability mass from the second term there to the first, even if the transfer is lossy/negative-sum and worsens his chances overall.) For example, he might pursue high variance strategies in which he directs his resources away from Earth and towards his other concerns. He won't be holding the Idiot Ball, and it will only be a Deus Ex Machina in the literal sense, and the Animorphs may actually, somehow, stand a chance.

[[/u/TK17Studios]] mentioned some time ago the work he put in to reconcile the scope of the Animorphs Universe with the literary (esp. Rat!Fic) requirement of protagonists with real agency. He positioned the pieces and balanced the scales such that even though the Animorphs' contribution would be necessarily small in relative terms, it would nonetheless be the deciding factor, or a deciding factor, at least plausibly, at least maybe.

This is better, of course, than the alternative in which the scales are balanced in such a way that the universe will be fine regardless of what the Animorphs do, or one in which the Animorphs end up losing despite perfect play, but it still felt like a compromise to me at the time. Like TK17 had set things up as well as he could while still being fair, and that the progress of the serial would be an extended collective evaluation of exactly how heavy each piece really was. Like, since he didn't know at the start everything that would happen, the process of writing the story was just thinking about it more and seeing whether he had balanced things "correctly" after all. If after all of that the Animorphs win, it ends up feeling about as empty as the obviously imbalanced scenarios mentioned above. The author set down the pieces, and it turns out the Animorphs sat on the weightier side of the scale.

But that isn't quite what's going on. The Animorphs don't have a set weight, a contribution they can make that is narrowly bounded by their status as unreasonably smart teenagers with superpowers. Esplin doesn't have a set weight either. He's powerful and competent, but he's playing for everything and he's intent on making enemies and he's kind of insane. The Animorphs could play extraordinarily well, and still lose; they're teenagers and he's a monster, some non-negligible fraction of a god. It would be absurd for them to win.

And yet, if they find the right path, and become the right shape, it is entirely possible for them to lose Esplin his larger game, or navigate towards victory within a margin of risk that he is forced to accept in service of a true victory.

Ellimist, and Crayak, and TK17 did some simulations, and have a sense of what will happen, but it turns out that this is a complex and chaotic system, with outcomes that can diverge wildly on a dime.

Somehow, there's hope.

At least... I think that's what is happening -- correct me where I'm wrong. Also the Yeerks keep getting more and more interesting, and those bird things are cool.

Anyway, TK17, this chapter is wonderful; I'd say not to change anything, but I trust your judgment better than mine.

Kudos, and looking forward to more.
