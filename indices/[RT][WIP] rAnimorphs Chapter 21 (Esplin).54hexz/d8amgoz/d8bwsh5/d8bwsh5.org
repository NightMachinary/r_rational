To allay at least one small part of your confusion---

You know how you might be (let's say) all about gender inequality, and yet nevertheless spend an entire Tuesday afternoon fuming because somebody said or did something reprehensible w/r/t sexual politics? Or even more "trivially," because somebody cut you off in traffic?

The true Vanarx is Moloch. Entropy and Murphy, just as you said---everything from multipolar traps and tragedies-of-the-commons down to the waste of useable energy. That's what V3 is focused on "killing."

He got a little bit pissed in this chapter about being jerked around by gods who---in his view---aren't DOING anything with the power that he's desperately trying to get, himself. That included some anger at death and waste generally, but it doesn't change his larger focus. He wants things to make sense and be ordered---in MTG terms, he's a blue-black villain who will be a blue-white villain once all of creation /is/ him (and therefore self-centeredness /is/ caring about the community).

I guess maybe the writing was a little clumsy, if it felt to you like a turn. He'll be visibly centered on Vanarx/Moloch in the future, and maybe I'll want to tweak this to make the distinction clear. But the thoughts about death were a catalyst, and the broader transformation was more about the line between him and Alloran blurring than it was about him changing the target.

Esplin /was/ bothered by Alloran's silence/absence, but he was somewhat distracted by evidence that the whole star system was being manipulated by beings with far greater reach than any level of technology he'd seen previously.
