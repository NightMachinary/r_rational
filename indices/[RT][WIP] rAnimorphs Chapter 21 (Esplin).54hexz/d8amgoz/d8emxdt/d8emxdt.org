Death of an entire pool might be rare, but even the individual Yeerks are sapient, and just last chapter we had Alloran's musing on Yeerk attitudes to the Vanarx:

#+begin_quote
  I did not understand their horror, at first---the hushed tones, the nervous glances, the trembling digits. There are other causes of death, after all, and for all that the Vanarx is inexorable---to a Yeerk---it is also rare. In two long revolutions on the homeworld, I saw only four, and only one at close range.

  [...]

  But the Vanarx does not harm the host. Once it has consumed the Yeerk, it withdraws, allowing the poor Gedd to continue its usual aimless stumbling, until sooner or later it stops for a drink---

  ---at which point the Yeerks retake it, and the memory of death is reclaimed.

  /Every/ death.

  Every desperate chase.

  Every horrifying capture.

  The last shreds of hope, vanishing as the purple closes in.

  It is a nightmare that every Yeerk has lived over and over, a wound that every pool has felt untold times. Whether they carry the actual memories or not, every individual shard takes with it the/dread/, the hopeless helplessness of an endless string of gruesome defeats.

  It's no wonder that even Esplin was afraid.
