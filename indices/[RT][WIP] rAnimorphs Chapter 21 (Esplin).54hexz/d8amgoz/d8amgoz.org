Finally found an opportunity to catch up!

This was good, but slightly confusing.

I thought the "true Vanarx" was entropy/Murphy's law? Leerans can mind-meld two people together now? Alloran is /gone/ and Esplin isn't bothered?! Maybe it's been too long since I read the Visser's last chapter.

I also spent a part of the chapter assuming the 13 representatives were a rationalized Council of 13, but that's on me for forgetting Yeerks just really like the number 13. It ended up throwing me off for that whole section, as they're supposed to be meeting as equals rather than the Visser being called before his boss. I may have to re-read that bit.

But enough about me - so much coolness, with the Arn and the Implications and the Plots, oh my. Great re-interpretation of the Quantum Virus.

If I had a criticism, it would be that the Vissir felt a little too /rationalist/ (as opposed to rational.) He's very quick to start thinking in terms of being simulated in Newcomb-esque fashion (to the point where it looks like he outsmarted himself?), he resolves to defeat Death and treats that like a big deal even though death is almost unknown among his species, he's frustrated at others' stupidity despite knowing he was biologically engineered to be more intelligent and Yeerks explicitly having a sliding scale of intellect - although the avatar he meets doesn't /seem/ very superintelligent. It felt a lot like a conscious attempt to emulate Professor Quirrell.

Definitely gave the feeling the human author was bleeding through a bit, especially during the first section.

But those Arn ... mm. A wonderful re-interpretation of the original. It's a shame we definitely won't get an Arn interlude, because I get the feeling you've worked out a lot of what goes on behind those eyes ... is the fact that they need context for everything connected to their inability to value things outside their homeworld?
