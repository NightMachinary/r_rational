Also, I imagine the Leeran hypersight as sort of self-confirming. Like, sure, perhaps it causes you to question whether your judgment has been compromised/you've been hypnotized, but basically once you're in it it feels unquestionably true, and once you're out of it you can confirm the things you saw inside in objective ways, and that's probably enough for Quat.

Sleeper cells: they were in deep/long-term stasis in tiny nooks in the wall. I had a line about the Visser waking them up with a signal as soon as his ship landed, but it broke the flow no matter where I put it, so I took it out and assumed readers would fill in the cracks with something sane.
