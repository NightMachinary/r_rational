Thought-by-thought review:

- As a general thought, it's great this series is back from hiatus, especially now that Glimwarden is entering one. I need my dose of well-written smart characters. :D

- One think I like about this series is the way it handles concepts in epistemology and decision-taking. It's way less in-your-face than HP:MoR, it's integrated in the story in a very show-don't-tell-ish way. It's been said before, one way or another, but it deserves repeating. This chapter in particular does that a lot.

- "Esplin had stayed well clear of /those/ coordinates" This made me chuckle.

- Interesting that Esplin is thinking in both base-7 and base-13. The chapter shows him thinking more and more like an Andalite.

- Speaking of which, I wonder what's going on with him not being able to hear Alloran? My best guess is, Esplin is starting to degrade for spending too much time out of a pool, and is merging with Alloran (well, more than usual) as a result.

- There are a few possibilities Esplin hasn't considered when studying the bridge. One, the bridge could have been created by E/C to bring andalite reinforcements, but shown to Esplin by C/E to thwart that plan. Two, maybe the bridge was shown to Esplin as a way to tamper with his morale or his decision-making, but originally made for different reasons.

- Esplin decides not to send a probe. I'm 95% sure that's a bad idea, possibly with catastrophic consequences. First off, intel is always valuable. In this case, a probe would be able to detect incoming allies who might otherwise show up unannounced and trigger the mines, or incoming enemies, giving Esplin more time to prepare. His reasoning is that a probe would be useless since the bridge was created by gods, but reasoning like that is letting them bully you. Like Skitter said in /Wake/, you don't let your enemy maintain an advantage without making them spend resources for it.

- Wait, bridge? Isn't it more of a tunnel?

- Esplin and the Arn exchanging civilities is kinda cute. With a stolen space satellite dish no less. Even though I don't get 90% of what they're saying.

- Arn territories sound badass. Like a planetful of Minecraft players. The way they live in a tiny ring on a giant crater, between the unbreathable surface and the superhot mantle, is a pretty great re-imagining of their origin story too.

- Holy crap the Arn communicates in C++.

- "When in Rome, one of his human subordinates had quoted to him, do as the Romans do" Huh. Interesting. Was that Telor or Aftran?

- Oh, wait, I get it, it's a /dorica castra/. Well, sort of. The Arn's language isn't nested, it's perfectly linear. So if the Arn ends his, um, word group with a word X, his next 'sentence' starts with the word X. So "[...] the trees protect the air sustains the Arn defend the Visser commands the ships" means "the trees protect the air; the air sustains the Arn; the Arn defend the Visser; the Visser commands the ships". Very clever :)

- What the Arn thinks of Visser's plan: "Oh, so this guy wants to take over the entire universe and remodel it in his image because he has a few objections to the way it works right now. Sounds cool, I guess. Well, it's not actually going to affect my patch of grass, so it doesn't really matter, but it sounds cool."

- "Most of the biomass and the inhabitants had been killed during the cataclysm. Fortunately, the planetary Club for Biology Enthusiasts was having its yearly convention in a super-resistant bunker that day, so they figured something out."

- How did the Arn know to trust the Leeran hypersight? Esplin knows how it works, but the Arn only knew what Esplin told them. On the other hand, they both have nothing to lose and much to win by cooperating, and the ways to annihilate each other if provoked, so they probably didn't worry too much about it.

- I like that Esplin still has a yeerk part that is completely horrified by all the immoral things he keeps doing.

- The "keys to the stars" remark makes me think of Esplin stealing car keys, then showing them to a crowd of cheering Controllers. :p

- The part about how the soldiers hesitate to shoot Visser makes me think of something that often frustrates me in superhero stories: nobody ever takes the initiative of shooting the bad guy. You never see a guard say "fuck it" and shoot the joker while he's safely restrained, and then worry about the consequences. It always bugs me, because at some point, when you realize that your enemy is pushing you and exploiting your unwillingness to retaliate, you should punish them for trying to manipulate you and retaliate anyway. /Twig/ had a nice scene like that a few weeks ago, where Sy tells someone "stop pretending you're about to stab me, it's annoying" and the other immediately stabs him to make a point.

- How exactly do Esplin's sleeper cells work? Are they hiding in broom closets? How do they stay fed, both in food and Kandrona rays? oO

- Shouldn't Telor require to use the Leeran on Esplin to prove his good intentions? It's harder to refuse than going back to the pool since he doesn't risk getting killed (well, less directly), and they do need a proof of his loyalty if they're going to keep following his orders.

- Wait, [[http://www.enjoy-swimming.com/wp-content/uploads/water-noodles.jpg][foam cylinders]]? In a spaceship? In the middle of a pulsating mass of yeerks?

- I really, really want to have a chapter from the perspective of one of the "yeerk-ropes in your ears" Controllers. Seriously.

- Visser One! He said Visser One! Visser One is confirmed as, you know! Someone who exists! Also, as far as we know, there is no Visser Zero. The yeerks still have much to learn.

- The "black-haired woman on a throne of flesh" thing sounds incredibly badass. I look forward to having a protagonist engage with her/it, if ever.

- Hides intel, requires total /and/ unquestioning obedience from his subordinates, isolates them from each other, encourages distrust... The dark side of epistemology is strong with this one.

- Tobias said at one point that he was starting to think like a believer, seeing acts of (a) god in every improbability. Well now Esplin's doing it too!

And now we're back to the crashed spaceship's cliffhanger. I'm impatient to know what happens then :)
