Nice.

I like how Visser 3 starts madly speculating about what countermeasures Telor might have prepared, then realizes Telor doesn't have any.

I'd expect to change that soon, though. I think Esplin is making a mistake by trying to outsmart Telor. They're a hive mind with a lot of humans who have every reason to distrust Visser 3. Trying to get anything past Telor is trying to get it past many different people, with different perspectives, including some who watched James Bond movies, and that one guy who watched Star Wars III and will go "Hey, maybe we should try to guard against order 66". Visser imposing a dichotomy with a deadline probably didn't go unnoticed either.

Speaking of which, I'd be really interested int the POVs of the humans/controllers in the room. Miss Telor's spokeswoman with a throne made of yeerks probably had a very interesting experience, for instance. And by interesting, I mean traumatic. And by traumatic, I mean interesting!
