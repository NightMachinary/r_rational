I, too, would be interested in some of the controller/human perspectives in the room, especially that of the spokespeople. I agree, Telor can farm a lot of information from the human perspectives in the room, create a crowdsourced counter to the Visser's intellect.

Telor's aggressiveness will probably not help it though, as the Visser can probably redirect its aggressive impulses to the coming real subjugation of earth (no the beta test that Aftran was).
