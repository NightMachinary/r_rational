Telor has access to more raw computing power than Esplin, but is limited by:

- Inability to perceive reality in real time
- Inability to act in reality except through tiny, imperfect agents
- Diffuse motivation in the form of basically being a giant democracy (where Esplin is a monarchy)

... also don't forget that Alloran was unusually intelligent even for an Andalite, so Telor is smarter but not by, like, orders of magnitude. Call it double or triple the total IQ, with the limitations above, and it's easy to see V3 getting an edge, but also conceivable Telor could turn the tables.
