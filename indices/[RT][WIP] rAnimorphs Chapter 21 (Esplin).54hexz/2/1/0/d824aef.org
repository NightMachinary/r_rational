The DNA/RNA sequence is literally translated into an amino acid sequence, so it's not necessary for Quat to have provided an amino acid sequence to Esplin, as it'd've been redundant. Also, a well-designed virus will have the genes for its own coat proteins in its genome. Now, if you want something interesting, you could maybe take this idea and incorporate it into Quat's virus: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/4zxe0o/new_virus_breaks_the_rules_of_infection_a_team_at/]]

If Esplin infects only certain pools with some parts, this would really mess with the pools' desires to swap shards.
