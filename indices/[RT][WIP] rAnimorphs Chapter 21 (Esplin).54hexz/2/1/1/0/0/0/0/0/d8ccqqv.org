All/either. I imagine the evolution of Andalite stalk eyes being somewhat similar to that of bottom-feeding flounders---they had four basically identical eyes facing downward as they skittered, to watch the dirt for edible flora. Then, over time, eyes that were wider/higher/able to see more of the world around them (without requiring that they rear up) conferred a fitness advantage. Eventually, two of the eyes migrated all the way up to the back of the skull on flexible stalks.
