If you were to give a human scientist a bacterial genome or whatever, she would need to insert it into a host cell with its genetic material removed so it could hijack the cellular machinery to start replicating itself.

It's entirely feasible to me that the super-advanced Arn have designed an organism that can't be jump-started just from its own genetic material, and in fact needs a couple of custom-built working ribosomes or whatever before it can start building more of the same and replicating itself normally.

tl;dr: the a.a. sequence could be to assemble the cellular machinery needed to start the DNA sequence actually replicating, instead of chucking into e. coli or whatever.
