You know what could be pretty cool is if Andalites shed tears for other emotions. Does it have to be sadness/grief? Why not something like anxiety, or fear? Watch Esplin try and suppress that because he knows it'd be perceived by his Human-Controllers as a weakness. Or maybe he doesn't know about it!
