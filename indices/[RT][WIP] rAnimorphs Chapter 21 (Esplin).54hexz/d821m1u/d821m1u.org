  There was a cost to hesitation, a cost that grew steeper as the expected value of further thought plummeted.

Oy, that was a beautifully written phrase.

  Holding the swirl of emotion in check, he returned his attention to the display.

  The map was a swirl of soft blues and deep purples, as wide as his body was long.
#+end_quote

Eh, nit-picky on the repeat use of 'swirl' here.

#+begin_quote
  a long sequence of nucleotides and acids.
#+end_quote

You'll have to look up the structure of DNA, I'm afraid. The nucleotides are what forms the sequence. The 'acid' part is just a description of the macromolecule and plays no importance in the sequence. If it helps, you could read the sentence as 'a long sequence of nucleotides and phosphates' to see the issue with it. I'd suggest dropping the 'acids' or maybe 'a long sequence of genetic material', if you don't want to lock yourself into the idea of all aliens being DNA/RNA compatible.

  like tears in the rain.
#+end_quote

Do Andalites have tears, or is this an odd human expression that Esplin has picked up? I'm not sure if this is a good metaphor for the idea of disappearing into nothingness, as 1: Yeerks are water-bound and 2: the tears are rejoining the water cycle, and this runs contrary to the idea of nothingness.

MAN IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU BACK
