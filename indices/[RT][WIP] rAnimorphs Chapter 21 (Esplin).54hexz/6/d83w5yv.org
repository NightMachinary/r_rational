Interesting. Very interesting; the description of how a Yeerk pool might try to think around it's limitations and interact with the world in real time, as well as the Visser's thought processes were quite a good read.

It got me thinking though, of how the human race has any kind of chance against the wider universe, when we seem to just be mentally outclassed. The yeerk pools are essentially super intelligence's; Andalite brains are simply stated to be better... it doesn't look good us. We aren't just technologically inferior, but it looks like our computational hardware might be outdated at well.

You could say that out numbers give us an advantage but... when you look at it from a certain angle, Yeerk pools could be considered millions of parts coming together, each bringing its own experiences and memories back, to merge and so cooperate perfectly in their thinking. And the Andalite's communicate through telepathy, which must greatly increase the efficiency with which individuals can work together.

In canon Andalite's are stated as developing technologically at a slow rate. This doesn't quite mesh with the story, where they can think in 7 streams at once, each with different attitudes; a scientist who could do that would be amazing. I believe that someone already posted the idea of groups of Andalite's behaving like a pseudo hive-mind, with background telepathy making it hard for new ideas to take hold in a population. Maybe that would work, as it would mean that even if individual humans are completely outclassed, groups of us work better together. It would give us an edge that, while not making us even close to dominating the galaxy, at least allows to hope that one day we could exist on even footing.

Or something, you know; humans evolved on (from what's been described in the story so far) a pretty unique, diverse planet. There has to be something, other than tasting, that our brains do better than everyone else (not sure if that's a completely rational thought, but it makes sense to me).

Or maybe you could go into the decided lack (baring the cosmic ascended beings) of post-human technology in the setting, given the otherwise highly developed setting. No cyborgs, not internalised brain-computer interfaces, etc... maybe their telepathy means Andalite nervous systems can't handle such enhancements, but our brains can?

Sorry, not trying to tell you how to write the story, because you're doing a truly fantastic, awesome, incredible job so far. I just thought the Earth was looking like it was heading towards being a perpetually Third World Planet populated by relatively dumb naked apes in this fic's universe; a planet that could never Win by its own merits, not in a thousand years, not ever. And that would be a sad ending to Ratfic indeed.
