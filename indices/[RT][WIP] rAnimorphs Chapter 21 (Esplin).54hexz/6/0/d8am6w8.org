  In canon Andalite's are stated as developing technologically at a slow rate. This doesn't quite mesh with the story, where they can think in 7 streams at once, each with different attitudes ...

Bear in mind we've only really seen /isolated/ Andalites in this story. Andalites with at most one other voice in their head.

Seven thought-streams won't do you much good if each stream is browsing a separate metaphorical Reddit thread, or chatting with a different relative on the phone.
