Little late to this thread, just wanted to say that this is my favourite chapter so far. Most of my reasons have been expressed by others in this thread already, so I'll just add that the flow of the chapter (Ellimist/Crayak revelation, Arn dialogue, Telor confrontation, victory) is extremely satisfying.

How long did it take you to plan the chapter? It's well-crafted in every respect.
