Just caught up with the story recently, and I wanted to say I've really been enjoying it. The characters in particular are just so well-done; they have very distinctive perspectives that come across really well in their chapters. Reading something ambitious, for me, is kind of like watching someone gently juggle puppies; you just know there's a screwup coming in a second, and it won't be the end of the world but it's gonna be painful. You haven't dropped one yet, and I'm excited to see what new miniature mutts you've got up your sleeve.

I really like how Esplin is basically a ratfic protagonist cobbling together all sorts of OP tech for crazy plans, culminating in an ultimate plot to kill Death itself.
