Amazing episode, thank you very much for making it!! The part where you have brainstormed and explored the world together was super valuable, it's really cool to see your thinking process, I would love to hear more of that stuff!! It would be awesome if you would try to plot a story arc or write an episode outline or develop a character. Witnessing what goes throgh your head as you do this is extremely useful.

If I were to live in the splitting-people world, and could control which half gets what, I would probably put the top 50% of my traits(best qualities, memories, skills) into one half, the remaining 50%(flaws, fears, traumatic and sad things) into another half. Then, right after splitting, the cool part would immediately put the unlucky guy out of his misery. That way, over a few generations, I could breed myself into a superhero.
