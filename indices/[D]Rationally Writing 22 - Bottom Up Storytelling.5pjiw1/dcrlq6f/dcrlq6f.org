Hey everyone, welcome back! Today Alexander and I discuss Bottom Up Storytelling, bring up common pitfalls to avoid, and explore some homespun examples.

Alex's recommendation for this week is a scifi book called [[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345460367/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=sl1&tag=dayeld-20&linkId=a407ea0065f7d3a4c8acc59469c936c8][The Integral Trees]] by Larry Niven. The central idea is that of a gas torus surrounding a neutron star with no planet. This gives a breathable atmosphere but only very weak microgravity. All of the other features of the world are drawn from that starting point, from the titular trees (which are 100 kilometers long and tidally locked), to the trilateral symmetry of the inhabitants, to the globes of water that float freely in orbit. Niven started from a solid core idea and extrapolated from there, which is the major strength of this book. While there is a plot, much of the path that plot takes it to showcase the world that the plot takes place in, which adds in travelogue elements and is very typical of Niven. If you want to give it a listen, [[http://www.audible.com/t1/30trial_at?source_code=PDTGBPD060314004R][Audible]] is offering a free 30-day trial with one book credit to our listeners, which helps to support this show.
