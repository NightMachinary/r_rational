Glad you enjoyed it! I enjoyed it too, and with some more forethought we can probably do it for future topics as well.

Interesting idea, I wonder how much evolution in such a world select against such behavior. After all, anyone that decides to do a thing like that is putting all their genetic eggs in one basket. Also, at some point you'll have to be sacrificing useful things too. I wonder if people carefully would parcel out their time in such a world, allotting certain amounts of time to each activity so as not to spend more than 50% of their life on things their "real" child won't be able to keep...
