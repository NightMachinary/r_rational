You are a 16 year old girl living in New York City. You have been given a thinker/clairvoyant power. During fights (direct physical confrontation. No guns, only melee, slashing, and blunt force damage inflicted within the next second) you are able to tell what everyone will do between now, and 1 second from now.

The speed of your thought also increased by a factor of /b/g/. Where /g/ is the number of people fighting with the intent to defend you (good guys), and /b/ is the number of people fighting with the intent to do you harm (bad guys). So if it was you versus 3 people, your speed of thought would be triple it's peacetime amount. Likewise, if you were in a gang of 5 and a single person attacked you, you'd think 5x slower, however the moment a gun is brought out, and will hurt someone within the next second, the effect stops.

During this, your subjective experience is of time slowing down, or speeding up. Depending on the direction of the effect.

Your goal is to do as much good as possible, or build as much power as possible. Your choice.

Assume these are formal rules, and will not change in any capacity, excepting definition clarification. (EDIT: I lied, see notes for some additions)

Notes:

- it is possible for you to get bored. If you go up against 1000 people, an objective minute would equate to 16.67 hours. A little over half a day. A single second would also be 16.67 minutes. Imagine effectively holding still for that length of time, not pleasant.

- your circadian rhythm functions under objective time, and is not affected by the number of people.

- your body will move according to objective time.
