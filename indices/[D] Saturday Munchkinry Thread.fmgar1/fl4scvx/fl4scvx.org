There's a well-known ritual where you spend a little bit of your mental energy and sacrifice something, then get something slightly more valuable out of it. What exactly goes in and out depend on the exact ritual variation, and new variants keep getting discovered. More exotic variants spend physical exhaustion, large amounts of mental energy and focus, or your creative inspiration. Some versions even ask you to publicly encourage people to use the ritual more. Most of society is built around performing the ritual. Anti-ritual people (mundanists) are feared and mocked.

You've just learned a few things about the ritual:

- The reward it gives you is always something that somebody else sacrificed. (It's doing arbitrage, though that word hasn't been invented in your world.)

- That fixed little bit of mental energy used by all instances of the ritual goes to ritual-use as a whole. That is, it empowers the ritual with a bit of ability to figure out what it should reward and what new ritual variants it should allow. (And the more people are performing the ritual, the smarter it is.)

- The ritual's goal is to be performed as often as possible.

That is to say, the ritual is a rogue optimization process with a goal that isn't fully aligned with human interests. And it has already labeled people who realize this as "mundanists," which is you now.

How do you stop it?
