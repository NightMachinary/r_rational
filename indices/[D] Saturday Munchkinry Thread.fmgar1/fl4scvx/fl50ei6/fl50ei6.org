It seems very much like you are too late. The key point here is that mundanists are somehow feared. This makes no sense, because mundanists should be less powerful than ritualists, so why would people fear them? I can only imagine it is because the ritual has done some kind of fear trade on ritualists to make them fear mundanists. But if the ritual is that intelligent and subtly manipulative, your odds of convincing the ritualists to stop do not look good.

One option you can try is to sabotage the sacrifices offered to the ritual. Since the ritual always rewards the ritualist with something else that was sacrificed, if you pump lots of secretly defective items into the ritual, you may be able to bring the whole thing crashing down as ritualists find that the rewards they receive are defective and stop doing the ritual Of course, this depends on you somehow outsmarting the ritual and giving it items that it cannot tell are defective.

If you're even more desperate for immediate results (for example if the ritual is almost reaching superintelligence and needs to be shut down NOW), then there is the radical option of going for dangerous items instead of defective items. Lace items with exotic poisons and germs and then sacrifice them to the ritual. If the ritual fails to detect the threat, it could give them to a ritualist and then the ritualist could become severely ill or even die. Upon police/medical investigation they will find that the victim was poisoned/infected by an item from the ritual. Then, since they don't know that the ritual is conducting arbitrage, they will think that the ritual is deliberately creating these poisons/germs to kill people. Especially if several cases pop up one after another.

The story will spread with solid evidence backing it up, until people stop trusting the ritual and so stop using it. The best part is, since the ritual's intelligence depends on people using it, by the time it notices it may no longer be intelligent enough to do anything about it.
