While I agree that 10x isn't that much compared to comic super strength, its still quite a lot more than the average body builder, and makes an average guy about 3 times stronger than those who hold world record in weight lifting.

And Yeah, I deliberatly chose 10x because having the strenght of 10 men seems something a character in a work of fiction would boast about, but actually struggle to think of how it can actually be usefull except for sport, entertainment and to some degree combat.
