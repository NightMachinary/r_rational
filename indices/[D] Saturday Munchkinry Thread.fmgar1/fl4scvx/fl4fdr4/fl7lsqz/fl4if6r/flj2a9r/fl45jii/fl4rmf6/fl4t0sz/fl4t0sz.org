The Power applies to everything you would consider part of your body except for hair and nails, so if you somehow loose a teeth or bone it would be just as durable, and yes you can remove part of your body that regrow and sell them, but take into account that you dont have a healing factor.

Adding things artifcially into your body will not let them benefit from the power.
