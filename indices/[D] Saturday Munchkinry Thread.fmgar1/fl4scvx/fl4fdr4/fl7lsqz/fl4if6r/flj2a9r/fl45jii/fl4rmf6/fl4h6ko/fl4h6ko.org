As it is, strength and durability would be mostly useless. Durability would be a nice perk for general living, but probably not life altering. Strength would aid you in precious few fields. You're still weaker than most machines. You're deadlifting somewhere from a 1000 to 3000 lbs. So you can spend your entire life training to be 1/3rd as strong as the average forklift. I can see it being useful for hand tools, crafts, moving, and delivery, but not overly so, because we already have millennia old methods for dealing with our limitations. Even worse. Your immense strength is still attached to your body, and many heavy things are just plain unwieldy. Concentrated weight is rare.

​

Weak versions of most other powers would be much, much more useful. Being a speedster would be better from a daily life perspective. The ability to run 70 miles an hour regularly would make me happier, more productive, and healthier. Shapeshifting would let me fly to work and for fun, and get you strength benefits. Mild precognition would still make me rich. Empathy would make me a more effective teacher. Small Telekinesis would help me with fiddly things I can't reach.

​

The best way to use it would probably be to start a super-powered athletic league. You would be offering an irreplaceable good, and could probably make a substantial amount of money. Keep in mind that even something relatively niche like Ultimate fighting makes in the low hundreds of millions. Although I have to wonder if 10x human durability would scale evenly with 10x human strength....
