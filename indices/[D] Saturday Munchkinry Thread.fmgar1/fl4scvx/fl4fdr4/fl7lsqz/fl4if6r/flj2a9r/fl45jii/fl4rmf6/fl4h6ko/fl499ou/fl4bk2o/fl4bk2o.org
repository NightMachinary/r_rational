The holy grail would be to recreate whatever physics-warping ability I have and apply it to machines (and anything else we want to be more durable), but I guess that's off the table given people don't want to study me.

10x human durability... doesn't seem like that big a deal. A 5 metre drop would kill me. Now a 50 metre drop will. Great.

I'm pretty sure kevlar is more than 10x as strong as human skin, but a bulletproof vest still isn't bulletproof to higher-power rounds.

I'm untouchable in hand-to-hand combat, I suppose, and small-calibre rounds might have trouble going through me (but similarly, surgical tools probably would, too!), so I'd make a pretty good bouncer.
