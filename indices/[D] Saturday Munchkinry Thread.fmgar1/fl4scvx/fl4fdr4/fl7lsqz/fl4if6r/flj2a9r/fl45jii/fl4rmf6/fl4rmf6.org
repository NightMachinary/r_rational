Wait so, I will be 10 times as strong and durable as I am now?

Finally, I will reach average human levels of physical fitness!

Jokes aside, what happens if I add or remove parts of my body? Like say I remove one of my bones or teeth. Does it continue to have 10x durability? Bones and teeth are limited, but there are other parts of the body that can grow back. Can I keep extracting these parts and sell them as magically durable materials?

Or if the effect is attached only to my body, then what happens if I add to my body? If I graft new skin onto my body, does the new skin get 10x more durability? What about surgically inserting items into my body? Do the items even need to be organic? Can I sorta pull a wolverine and get metals embedded into my body, and the metals would become 10x more durable as a result?
