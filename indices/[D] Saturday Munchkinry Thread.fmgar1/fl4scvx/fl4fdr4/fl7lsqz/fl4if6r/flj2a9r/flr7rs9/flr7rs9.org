This is terrible at worst and useless at best. You don't get any enhanced reflexes or physical speed, so thinking faster only lets you make somewhat more optimal 1 second choices. Fighting multiple people could actually be a hindrance, since you have a long time to think about how much you just hurt your hand punching some dude in the jaw.

If you're fighting a couple people, you are going to lose. Being able to think for an extra few seconds won't give you time to calculate optimal fighting patterns, and actually removes your ability to respond with muscle memory, which would be a much better way of fighting people when you have no physical powers anyway.

Conversely, this power makes you utter trash in a group. The more henchmen your group defeats before the big bad, the slower you think. When you're down to fewer enemies than are in your group, even the mooks will be blasting you faster than you can respond.
