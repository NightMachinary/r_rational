Fighting only; think of it as more like a skill or a touch-cast spell than an actual virus.

And the mind control... The early version is "like a robot or s zombie." The later one is more like "they have a personality, but it's a reflection of yours; they have no will but yours."

I also hadn't planned on making it contagious. There was a draft where it worked like that but I couldn't figure out a good reason why my MC /wouldn't/ be a pocket-size zombie apocalypse. It was too OP even for me, and that's saying a lot.
