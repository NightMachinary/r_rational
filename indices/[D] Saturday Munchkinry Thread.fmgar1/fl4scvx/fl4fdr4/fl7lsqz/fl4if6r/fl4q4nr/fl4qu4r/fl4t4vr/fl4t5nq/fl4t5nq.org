Is it fighting only? If I implant a bit of my claws into a person would it have the same effect?

I think going into soda manufacturing or water purification would be the best idea for maximizing your power. If there seems to be too much red tape surrounding that, then giving water (with small bits of my claws) to African tribes would likely be my second choice. If we become big enough, the entire continent could be under my control, with very few other countries taking much notice.

How not subtle is the mind control? Could it pass for some strange disease? If I had a tribe of Africans attack another tribe, scraping each member with a stake with a small bit of my claw at the end, how long would it take for the rest of the world to catch on? If I did something similar but with animals, how long before people caught on?
