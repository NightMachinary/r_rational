Hmm, it seems like it would be fairly simple to set up some situations where you get to nudge a large crowd at once. For example, if you shout "FIRE!" in a crowd everyone is immediately going to start thinking about fires. The question then is how much can you nudge someone?

If you shout "I'm going to kill myself!" in a large crowd, and the people all start thinking about your suicide, you can then nudge them all to think "I want to die too"? Though I expect they will snap out of it quickly, they may be very disturbed by their dark thoughts afterwards.

Or even more simply, if you go ask someone for a favor, they will naturally be thinking about the favor you're asking, so can you nudge them into accepting the favor?
