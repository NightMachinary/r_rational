Yes, that's more or less how it got started. There was an earlier magic system that would dump all the sacrifices into the nearest ley line intersection, and kings gained power by controlling those points and forcing people to perform sacrifices. But a sorcerer tricked a few kings into dumping their treasuries into the new ritual. That was about three hundred years ago, it's had a long time to bootstrap.

Most people spend a significant portion of the day performing the ritual repeatedly. Eventually it makes it really hard to focus, since it does burn some of your mental energy and focus.

Each ritual variant takes a different set of inputs and outputs, so you can't easily chain one output to another input. You're more likely to know a few variants that sacrifice things available near you.
