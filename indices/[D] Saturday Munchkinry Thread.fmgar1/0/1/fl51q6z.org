I'm guessing the ritual was seeded by someone dumping an enormous amount of resources into it to fund the initial uses, then generally using "one's man trash is another man's treasure" to seemingly create value endlessly?

I'm curious, what happens to someone performing the ritual repeatedly? Do they eventually end up with something near-perfectly tuned to their desires and diminishing returns on further uses, and if so what would that look like? It's hard to imagine this arbitrage holding up for iterative uses from a user.
