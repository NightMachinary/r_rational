That's an interesting answer. Certainly a dangerous one - you are after all causing harm to innocent people for your cause, which isn't likely to garner favor if anyone finds out.

  The key point here is that mundanists are somehow feared. This makes no sense, because mundanists should be less powerful than ritualists, so why would people fear them? I can only imagine it is because the ritual has done some kind of fear trade on ritualists to make them fear mundanists. But if the ritual is that intelligent and subtly manipulative, your odds of convincing the ritualists to stop do not look good.

That's beyond its abilities; it can only create physical objects. The most advanced thing the ritual has done is release high-reward versions of itself where it must be performed in public and the incantation is propaganda.

"Our enemies are powerless and also scary" is a common feature in propaganda. For example you see this constantly in fascism, where Jews are simultaneously a weak race of cowards and the sinister masterminds of a global conspiracy that controls everything (while in reality they're a tiny and frequently subjugated minority).
