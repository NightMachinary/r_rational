Addendum:

It can take payment in the form of mental energy, focus, creativity, and so forth, but it can't combine separate sacrifices of those. So to come up with its "make the incantation be propaganda" plan, it needed a single dose of insight big enough to do that. To make each new propaganda speech, it takes a dose of creativity big enough to come up with it. Though it can and does try generating a speech, having someone say it, and using creativity from someone who listened to it to refine it into a better one.

So while it's already superhuman in intelligence in some sense, it's a diffuse sort of intelligence. It's not superhuman everywhere, just in total.
