/Nudge/

You can create a slight mental stutter - extremely minor, short lived, confusion, or mental step aside, where for a tiny/minuscule fraction of a second the person nudged thinks something slightly different, but close to and directly related to what they were right in the middle of thinking about. You have arbitrary control of the direction of your nudges, as far as the concept of direction makes sense, but the impact is very situation, target, and context specific.

With some effort (as in, you get really tired and have to rest significantly), you can expand your nudge to a large crowd of (line of sight limited) people, with the restriction that they should all be thinking about approximately the same thing at the same time. So say a captive audience at a tense moment in a movie, you'd be able to nudge everyone, while if it's a boring class at school with students day dreaming, you might only nudge the 2-3 people who are actively paying attention.

The universe is one of an inverse relationship between the impact/strength of a power, and the level of caricature of the person taking it. The most first order/directly powerful are heavy trope laden, caricatures - comic book level villains or heroes (or anti heroes, etc...) while the least powerful have almost complete free will, trope awareness and general latitude in their behaviour. The Nudge power is considered low level and hobbled enough that any trope enforced restrictions on decision making are negligible
