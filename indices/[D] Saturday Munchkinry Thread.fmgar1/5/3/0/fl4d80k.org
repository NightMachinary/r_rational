It's not that people dont want to study you, but rather that experience has shown that studying people with powers doesn't yield any real benefits since physically they're exactly the same except that they are somehow able to do things they really shouldn't be able to. So it would be hard to find people to invest large amounts of money into this knowing that it will likely wont generate any new information that could be profitable or help explaining powers.
