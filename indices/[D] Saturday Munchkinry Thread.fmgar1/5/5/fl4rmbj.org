This is mostly good for amusing yourself. And, I guess you no longer need a car. A custom bike can now be ridden at or above the speed limit - though you are going to have to assemble it yourself to get something that is going to stand up to the forces you are going to put into it and have an extreme enough gear ratio. Also your biking gear is going to be a set of motor cycle leathers. But, still, freedom of the roads at a really low cost! Road trip, no gas.

Your ability to jump and climb is going to be insane, because that is mostly about power to weight, and yours is well outside any human or animal range, but again, that is not a money maker, outside putting on a show. But likely lots of fun.

Professional uses: You are not bullet proof. However, you could wear literally 300 kilos worth of steel plate, which would stand up to anything short of military ordnance, without dropping you through most floors.. so. Join law enforcement. Or become a firefighter.
