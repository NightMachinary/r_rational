Are leathers even necessary if you're ten times more durable?

Since scientists can't detect how you're powers work if you kept them hidden could make a killing if you went into professional sports and went just hard enough to be the best by a slight margin.

I think if you're trying to do the best thing from a utilitarian perspective cheating to become a sports star and then donating your wealth would be much more effective than any direct action using your powers.
