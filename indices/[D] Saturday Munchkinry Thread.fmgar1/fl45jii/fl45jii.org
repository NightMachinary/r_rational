You have Super Strength and enhanced durability.

The exact mechanism on how it works isn't important, lets just say on a physical level you look excatly the same as before, even if a doctor were to study your body before and after you received the power. The only differeence is that you are pretty much ten times as strong now and about ten times as durable. Real world phsyics still apply otherwise, so lifting heavy objects can still cause them to break or yourself to damage the ground your standing on.

Other people with powers also exist, but they number in the low hundreds worldwide and none of them is powerful enough to have any real impact on how civilastion works, think of the Netflix Defenders for example. That means while some interest in your power would exist, dont expect something like a Randi Prize or being able to make a living by allowing people to study you.

So what do you do to gain the most out of it and increase your quality of life as much as possible?
