  A rational Delve sounds like an awesome idea. I can't wait to see it!
#+end_quote

Just to emphasize: this is Delve /inspired/, but not Delve. It's also a short story, only a few chapters long.

--------------

There are plant growth skills (less broken, mind you, but still) and even a fairly easily available skill, Perfect Satiation, that removes the need to eat, drink or breathe. Heck, magic even means nobody really gets ill, and childbirth is a comparatively safe and tame affair.

Hence the need for my big brain solution to overpopulation: people in my setting don't want children as much as people of Earth do. This isn't a result of their culture, it's just how people of the setting are made.

  What are the chemical properties of e.g. the acid in an acid-based blasting attack?
#+end_quote

Magical acid acts like the layman thinks it does: slow, bubbly, corrosive. Some things are more or less corrodible, but it's fundamentally magic that decides, not physics.

  You should probably figure out the maximum wattage of a guy at level n with a strength-based build and a bunch of speed buffs.
#+end_quote

Why?

#+begin_quote
  Literal cheesemaking might be a fun skill tree to add.
#+end_quote

The *Nature » Druid* skill tree exists for wacky miscellania like this. Magical cheese, I like it.

#+begin_quote
  Even stuff like "curse the region with a never-ending hurricane"
#+end_quote

Skills are much smaller scale than this. Temporary mana-hungry hurricane, yes. Never ending hurricane, no.

  Can you make magic items that replicate arbitrary skills?

  How does crafting work, and what exactly can be crafted?
#+end_quote

I don't know the details yet, but certainly nothing that open ended. The process is basically going to be <materials> → <magic> → <output>. The outputs are going to be moderately specified; the most similar magical effects to what you're asking for will come from throwing wands, which cast specific spells upon impact.

  A list of the skill trees would definitely make this easier
#+end_quote

[Economic -- Workmanship, Farming, Construction, Transport, Status]\\
[Employ -- Actor, Scribe, Architect, Mercenary, Judge]\\
[Crafting -- Analysis, Creation, Transmutation, Repair, Spellcraft]\\
[Nature -- Time, Forestry, Adaptation, Druid, Whole Foods]\\
[Reduce, Reuse, Recycle -- Blood, Body, Harm, Corpse, Waste]\\
[Rogue -- Clone, Cloak, Counter, Drain, Dream]\\
[Attack -- Damage, Wound, Strength, Pierce, Assurance]\\
[Combat -- Unarmed, Small Arms, Light Arms, Heavy Arms, Ranged Weaponry]\\
[Grappler -- Capture, Engage, Throw, Disarm, Suppress]\\
[Atypical Hit -- Critical, Reroll, Conversion, Expectation, Evasion]\\
[Defence -- Armour, Deflection, Intrinsic Resistance, Intangible Defence, Warding]\\
[Recovery -- Nursing, Healing, Necromancy, Therapy, Toxicity]\\
[Solidity -- Metal, Stone, Crystal, Fibre, Metamaterial]\\
[Elements -- Fire, Air, Water, Earth, Lightning]\\
[Magics -- Force, Mind, Curse, Antimagic, Final Breath]\\

[Expertise -- Adept, Multimagic, Meditation, Dōjō, Guru]

The groupings are only directly relevant for Multimagic, and are otherwise just organizational and brainstorming aids. Some of the trees are a little different to the common conception (eg. Necromancy under Recovery), so don't feel boxed in by specifics.
