A number of scatterbrained comments, sorry for the low effort and poor formatting:

Plant growth magic is one of the fastest ways for your setting to degenerate into a person-per-square-foot-level broken setting. See e.g. [[https://amp.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/8qmcw0/becoming_rich_as_a_fifth_level_druid/][here.]]

Anything that can produce a lot of light doubles as plant growth magic (at least for agronomy-breaking purposes) as long as you have a heat sink. To employ this, just build a multistory structure that contains floors covered in wet soil. Have a magical light source below each ceiling and constantly use your cold magic to prevent the structure from catching fire or melting. Since blackbody radiation is a thing, a magical source of heat doubles as a magical source of light. Note the high capital investment needed for this approach, though.

Really, just carefully inspect all of your area control spells.

What are the chemical properties of e.g. the acid in an acid-based blasting attack?

You should probably figure out the maximum wattage of a guy at level n with a strength-based build and a bunch of speed buffs.

Be wary of anything that self-interacts.

Literal cheesemaking might be a fun skill tree to add.

Climate-altering magic is big. Even stuff like "curse the region with a never-ending hurricane" could increase the habitability of a subtropical desert.

Can you make magic items that replicate arbitrary skills? We want to heat up a valley in Antarctica to habitable temperatures, but Goldplate Rain can't withstand the mageburn from a constant Immolation Nova even with a really really good LCG.

How /does/ crafting work, and what exactly can be crafted?

A list of the skill trees would definitely make this easier, since otherwise we can't offer much more than genre-general observations.

A rational Delve sounds like an awesome idea. I can't wait to see it!
