The nature of the Litrpg system might matter a whole bunch for your story.

--------------

Did some entity/entities create the system for some purpose? If so, look to how MMOs handle exploits. They discourage exploits that they don't like by punishing early adopters of the exploit, making a credible commitment to releasing patches to remove the exploit and often undoing the benefits of the exploit. For exploits that they do like they often just turn them into features.

--------------

Is the system just part of the physics of that universe? If so, look to real-world physics for how things might turn out. Warfare and conflict will drive a ruthless path toward efficiency. Everyone uses guns and explosives because they are lethal and effective. But also, guns and explosives weren't immediately discovered. The most deadly and efficient builds within a litrpg system might only make sense in certain societal conditions, or they might take a long time to discover.

edit: I'll be adding more thoughts later. But I was curious if you were basing your litrpg system off of something that exists, or making one entirely from scratch?
