I was mindlessly running with the idea of small party-sized groups being standard, but I think you've made me reconsider, especially with point 3. At the highest ranks parties are generally pretty small by simple lack of having enough people to choose those you trust, but low levels going out in small battalions for the stacked buffs seems like exactly the kind of consequence you'd get from a system like this. Exponential power scaling does mean that individualism isn't disfavoured for those aiming for the top (fewer members means more XP), but for the average Joe, sure.

XP comes from killing. Like you say, that gives you a pyramid. I don't know what you mean by “once you reach the top of the pyramid you need to have some ability to grow the base of the pyramid in order to grow stronger”---you never truly reach the top until after a lifetime of nonstop fighting, and it's not clear how growing the base helps you directly, since lackeys aren't going to join your battles.
