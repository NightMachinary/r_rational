  XP comes from killing. Like you say, that gives you a pyramid. I don't know what you mean by “once you reach the top of the pyramid you need to have some ability to grow the base of the pyramid in order to grow stronger”---you never truly reach the top until after a lifetime of nonstop fighting, and it's not clear how growing the base helps you directly, since lackeys aren't going to join your battles.

The level distribution pyramid is going to have some interesting characteristics:

1. The slope of the pyramid will be determined by level scaling. If killing a level 5 creature always brought you 5% towards the next level (regardless of your level) then there would be no pyramid.
2. The maximum height of the pyramid is going to be a function of the slope, and the size of the base of the pyramid. A world that spawns with a million lvl 5 monsters is going to have less experience to feed the pyramid than a world that spawns a billion lvl 5 monsters.
3. Level distribution pyramids will probably be local phenomenon more than a global phenomenon. If there are two continents separated by an uncrossable ocean then they will each have their own level distribution pyramid. Within each continent, the geography might even create more miniature level distribution pyramids.
4. If you find yourself at the top of a local pyramid you have two options. One is to move to another location and no longer be at the top of the pyramid (risky). The second option is to find some way to inject more experience into your local system (less risky). For example, if a summoner can bring forth a demon, elemental creature, or anything that provides experience when killed, then their skills can add experience to the system.
