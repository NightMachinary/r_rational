It brings up an interesting question: Would people worship the system as a god even if there is no evidence for god?

Would religion start to play a role in acceptable build types? If you are a noble you don't want to have to forcefully micromanage all your peasant's build choices. It would be great if they willingly sought your priest's advice on which choices to make for their build.
