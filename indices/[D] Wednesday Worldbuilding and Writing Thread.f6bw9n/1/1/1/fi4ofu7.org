Given you mentioned that the setting is pre-industrial, an unknown exploit might be using existing technologies or magic in unusual or strange ways that others wouldn't have conceived of. Though granted it depends on how education works in this world, if the printing press is a thing, and who exactly is getting educated.

In the Wandering Inn for example, a group of Earth uses crossbows very differently than others do. Crossbows are a well-known thing but seen as inferior because a bow with the right skills can do crazy things. But the Earthlings take advantage of the fact that they don't take much training or any skills to use so that even a normal man with no combat skills can be dangerous, and contemplate that an army of farmers with crossbows could make a big difference.

Tv tropes have it best with their Lethal Joke Character. A slave/servant character might be given an exploratory build that they discover is largely useless with too difficult or situational skills and the build is written off by serious people after a few years of trying. The character is paid a fee for his trouble and sent away. Then the character spends years practicing and becomes so skilled with the obscure and weird abilities that they discover a difficult but awesome way of fighting. The build itself is useless only to someone who hasn't trained for decades to exploit its potential. Since you mentioned that the world is constantly optimizing, there might be quite a few exploits that no one realizes exists because of the necessary training time to actually become skilled at actually using the abilities.
