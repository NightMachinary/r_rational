Thanks for the discussion. I absolutely agree that people will want to keep their sources of strength secret, and there is a lot of secret-keeping in my setting --- it's just a privilege only available to the highest strata of individuals, and there is enough natural information flow that discoveries will /eventually/ make their way to the lower reaches of society, if not the first time then a few rediscoveries down the line. It doesn't take a genius to recognise how a summoning loop works.

I might go more on this when I have time, but the basic idea is that you don't need a lot of information leakage to cause this gradual cascade, as long as you have the continual drive for optimization that settings like this produce. Adventurers who share their skills with their colleagues stay alive. High-ranked adventurers that use slaves or hired hands to scout their future investments avoid wasted points. Kings and scholars compile knowledge for their guards (yes; initially intended to be for private use, but information wants to be free). Those in power trade whole castles and party membership---the later particularly important at the top---for what others know, and local information brokers do the same on a much, much smaller scale selling successful builds in their local villages.

And since those who share, win, there's no going back.

In Delve specifically, no goldplate would be threatened by the idea of training someone to level 18, which is more than it would take to explore Winter. This isn't a meaningful threat---it's a support build; if you suspected it would be Rain-tier broken, you wouldn't have let a peasant explore it. But this alone is still incredibly useful for farming XP, or helping your local guild, or helping you practice, or with your headache, and many other such uses. Given the time investment is trivial and the personal benefit is large (even if it does get copied eventually), it's reasonable to expect eventually somebody would get around to doing it. Maybe not in Delve's society specifically, but my thesis is that such a society would never have been the one that won, realistically.
