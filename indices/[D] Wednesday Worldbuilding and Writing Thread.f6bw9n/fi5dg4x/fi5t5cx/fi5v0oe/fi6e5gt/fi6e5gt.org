Leave it be, I think it's interesting as is.

"Wax statue" is also vague. If you have reinforcements running through it, like wax-impregnated fibers, you can greatly increase the durability of the statues.

Binding objects to wax for reshaping is probably better than glass mages for messages, depending on range/delay. Also especially useful for building structures and the like, if you're not restricted to size scaling, and can possibly result in physics-defying constructions. If you can add a surveillance device to the other end, then you have remote-controlled drones of any size/shape.

Lifelike control replicas I'd expect to be useful for dangerous situations and other remote controlled drones, depending if they can be stored for later use and remotely activated, although I'm not sure they'll see common use if you can only otherwise control one at a time.

Glass telekinesis can make storms of glass shards that could wipe out entire armies, so probably a scope issue there, unless you want power concentrated in the hands of individuals. Glass teleportation would make especially good escape routes, and if glass mages weren't all megalomaniacal then they'd probably have glass portal networks to major hubs, and might set up a cabal/guild for shared access to this transportation network, which also serves to transport goods. Not sure if they transport other people.
