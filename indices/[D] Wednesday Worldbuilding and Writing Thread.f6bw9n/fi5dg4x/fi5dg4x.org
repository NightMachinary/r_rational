I'm trying to find a good story hook for this world I'm building, but so far I've only got two magic systems.

One is Wax magic which has 3 powers: - allows a mage to make non-sentient but autonomous wax statues that only listen to their programmed commands. - let's the mage bind an object to wax, therefore able to change its shape without touching the object. - and gives the mage the power to submerge themselves in wax to create a lifelike replica they can control.

And the second is Glass magic which has 2 powers: - allows them to control and shape glass telekinetically - and let's mages teleport through glass panes that are connected in some way, but I don't really have that figured out yet.

Obviously the wax statues would be good for manual labor/war and glass mages would be good as messengers, but I'm having trouble figuring out more. So what other ways could this impact the world? And what else should I be thinking about?
