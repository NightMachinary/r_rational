I think for the purposes of worldbuilding, what you really need to be concerned about are whether certain things are possible, because they're likely to warp the world a lot:

- Truth detection
- Mind control or compulsion
- Shapeshifting good enough to pass as someone else
- "Perfect" illusion magic
- Time travel
- Weapons of mass destruction
- Resurrection
- Reality alteration
- Metamagic
- Runaway intelligence enhancement
- Sentience creation

Generally speaking, any one of those will (or should) require some large-scale changes to how the world and its societies are organized, even if they're high-level (and thus relatively rare) effects. I also usually try to think about travel times and communication times, plus whether borders can actually be secured, or locations can be effectively fortified, because those will likewise be pretty darned important to how the world looks.
