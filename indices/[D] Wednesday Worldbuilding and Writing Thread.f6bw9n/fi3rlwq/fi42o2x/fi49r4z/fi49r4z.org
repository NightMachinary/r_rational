This is a good list. I think I've mostly kept these pretty tame, but I'll list a few relevant Skills for the categories. Border security is something I'll have to think harder on.

--------------

#+begin_quote
  Truth detection, Mind control or compulsion
#+end_quote

The only Skills that offer this are from the *Economic » Status* tree, like /[Emperor]/, for which you have to actually be Emperor, and whose effect only lasts while in location. These are meant to be society-shaping skills, though.

#+begin_quote
  *Emperor* -- /[Level 10] [Passive]/ -- /*Status (Tier 0)*/\\
  You are indomitable. People are compelled to fealty in your presence. Your strength grows with the size of your empire. You may grant /[Praetorian]/ to any number of subjects.\\
  /Tier 0 skills do not require skill points to unlock./
#+end_quote

*Magics » Mind* only offers compulsions like /[Fear]/ or /[QWOP]/.

#+begin_quote
  Weapons of mass destruction
#+end_quote

The strongest attacks are /[Nova]/ of *Magics » Final Breath* and /[Tsar]/ of *Economic » Construction*; the former is city-block sized and suicidal (potentially survivable, but nobody has or wants to test), and the later is a little larger but expensive to build. Good for destroying guilds more so than cities. The largest spammable attack is /[Weapon of Big Destruction]/, which is a big, strong cannon.

#+begin_quote
  Resurrection
#+end_quote

Resurrection is sort of possible through *Recovery » Necromancy*, but it has limits. You need remains with the soul still inhabiting the body, and regular upkeep is required to slow degradation. The reanimation /hosts/ the original soul inside a ‘fake' soul that the caster creates, so you can either drive the body directly (at which point you should just be a summoner instead), or you can let the original soul indirectly take the reins. Since the ‘fake' soul is always involved, it always takes a necromancy slot. Hosted souls can't feel pain or discomfort, and have dampened emotions.

So necromancy has two main uses in combat. Either use it on people you trust, and let them drive the body freely, which takes a bunch of maintenance but is often worth it for obvious reasons, or use it on a creature and train it to act how you want with only minimal intervention.

#+begin_quote
  Reality alteration
#+end_quote

I have a skill here. It feels like it should be more exploitable than I've managed so far.

#+begin_quote
  *Placebo Treatment* -- /1350 Mana [Level 12] [Magic]/ -- /*Mind (Tier 7)*/\\
  Realize any damage and harmful afflictions that the target thinks it has received, or is going to receive imminently, including damage to its armour or expenditures it used to block.
#+end_quote

The conditions are:

1. The target must not want the affliction; they would avoid it if given the option.
2. A reasonable person must consider the effect as damage or a harmful affliction to the target---so no healing the suicidal.
3. The magic can only use the target and the target's belongings. You can't extract a password that the target doesn't know by carving it into their flesh.

The combat potential is fairly large, especially since it's self-reinforcing (if you get hit by an illusion once, you'll expect to get hit by the next), and there are potentially some painful exploits around safe-cracking, but that doesn't make it obvious how to abuse it further.

#+begin_quote
  Sentience creation
#+end_quote

There are a variety of summoned creatures that are sentient in a weak sense, but nothing particularly smart.
