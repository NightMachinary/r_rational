I think you may be overestimating an average person's willingness to share information, especially when there is a direct correlation to power. There is a vested interest to keep exploits secret as long as able.

What you are describing is analogous to nobles educating their serfs so that they may better work for the noble. With more educated serfs, they could do more complex jobs and increase the innovation and production for the noble.

While true, that's a modern idea. Almost all the nobles banned education to keep their serfs compliant. The less able and knowledgeable about the outside, the less likely they would start an uprising. While the nobles may be literally richer for doing so, they would be relatively weaker compared to the serfs.

  For example, somebody strong would be entirely naturally inclined to power level someone into a build that maximises Winter (a peasant would gladly accept the role), if only for their own use, which would result in a fairly straightforward exploration of Aura Metamagic.

First, this requires them to be willing to give a peasant power. Then, it would require them to give the peasant freedom to explore an additional unknown amount of power. (The empire in Delve forces slaves to be auras, but restricts them heavily by forcing them to take certain skills or be killed). Then, for this to be well known, it would require the noble to spread their great idea to other people. It's far more likely a noble family has a protected passed down position for the Aura holder of the family, but is secretive about their abilities so other nobles don't also do it.
