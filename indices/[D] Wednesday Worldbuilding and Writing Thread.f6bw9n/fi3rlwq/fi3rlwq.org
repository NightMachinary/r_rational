I'm interested in writing a litrpg short story in a setting where the low hanging munchkinry has already been taken. This would effectively be a rationalist reskin on Delve---(but /not/ a fanfic).

Though a great fiction, my issue with the rationality of Delve's progression is that by my accounting, what Rain is doing is not particularly innovative, nor something that others would not have discovered and explored. The first hint to this is that Rain's build is low entropy, maxing out five just tightly correlated skill trees, in equal proportions, in the most natural manner, where the rare Dynamo specialization he uses is at best superfluous, and at worst a poor choice.

For example, somebody strong would be entirely naturally inclined to power level someone into a build that maximises Winter (a peasant would gladly accept the role), if only for their own use, which would result in a fairly straightforward exploration of Aura Metamagic. This would quickly demonstrate the potential of the build, after which an aura-based build would become plausible, the promise of Prismatic Intent would be discovered, and the build would quickly be fleshed out.

Thoughtful stories often bandage this up somewhat by making discovery harder. Delve has the natives using Roman numerals, HPMOR (not litrpg) has the wizarding world generally oblivious to modern society, The Waves Arisen (also not litrpg) uses an exploit available to only a handful of inhabitants, and Delve again has level caps being a scarce resource as well as unlockable hidden skills and classes. Both Delve and Marked for Death (hmm...) also have what seem to me to be irrational levels of societal secrecy.

--------------

*Question:*

What would a story look like where this wasn't the excuse, where discovery happens and information flows as freely as it realistically would, and the low hanging munchkinry was just how people thought the world worked?

Given a preindustrial setting with fairly traditional Skill Trees, what sort of exploits would you expect to be out in the world?---specific suggestions welcome, especially if they're fun! Note that the system in this world is mostly /Rules As Written/, and edge-cases are allowed to do edge-case things.

Conversely, what sort of exploits might exist that you would believe /haven't/ yet been found?

I'm also interested in general thoughts about what sort of Skills or Skill Trees you'd like to see in such a world. A lot of the time these end up fairly dull---Sword skills, Spear skills, Dagger skills,---so I've tried to keep my setting's abilities new and interesting enough to seem fresh, albeit still with a traditional vibe.

--------------

Here is some worldbuilding to help get your brain running. To give some sense of breadth, my plans so far have over 100 Skill Trees, each with 15 Skills. I can share the list of Trees if people want; the 1500+ Skills are obviously WIP.

*General worldbuilding ideas*

Most people follow published builds, with minor variations as a personal touch. There are a significant number of valid builds with varied strengths, though a few near-optimal builds are particularly common. Optimal builds are much stronger than monsters until the very high ranks, where monsters scale super-exponentially to meet the strength of the strongest builds. As builds get more optimized, the equilibrium point---where monsters are roughly on par with same-level adventurers---shifts upwards, never to infinity.

Levelling through low and middle ranks is heavily industrialized, including monster farms and optimal battle orders for gaining experience, customized to each build. Almost everyone has at least a few levels. Correspondingly, worker and support builds are at least as popular as front-line adventuring, with their own specialized exploits, and adventuring is common enough not to make someone important until they reach very high ranks.

How strong you end up is largely a factor of how hard you push yourself and the risks you take, combined with natural talent. Adventuring is fairly safe, if you don't mind the middle of the pack, but exceptional adventurers have as dangerous a life as they ever did. The strongest adventurers can achieve near-immortality, but such a life of slow and inevitable obsolescence and stagnation is little desired by those dedicated enough to reach it, the majority of whom instead die one way or another trying to keep up with their younger competition.

There is a systematic search for effective builds, through a handful of processes. The primary approach involves training low-ranked workers into exploratory builds---a win for both sides, as the workers benefit from the levels even if the build is bad. Information sharing is standard at low-to-mid levels, whereas information is traded for fortunes among the very strongest.

*Some specific discovered exploits*

Spoilers are to reduce anchoring; try to think about this before reading what I've written.

A combination of defensive spells and abilities allows >100% resistances in certain attributes at high levels. This, combined with non-piercing attacks, is the fastest way to heal.

A combination of piercing attacks and modifiers combined with Harmonizing Response (treat a fractional modifier as if it were linear) allows certain classes to gain >100% piercing (bypass fraction of resistance) damage, aka. they do more damage the greater the target's resistance. This, combined with casting resistance buffs on enemies, becomes the most effective and reliable strategy for defeating creatures.

A niche class can, through similar means and a multi-hit move, deal negative damage.

Pure Subjugation (treat a summon as a familiar) combined with Soul Bond (share a mana pool with a familiar) and Member of the Family (have up to 6 familiars) used on a specific magical toad summon allows for summonings with (effectively) negative net mana cost. This is termed a ‘Summoning Loop'.

Soul Bond (share a mana pool with a familiar) is often combined with particularly tanky creatures; the tank sits next to the healers, far from the centre of battle, sometimes far outside the battlefield altogether.

Flight is not the best flight Skill, since there are literally hundreds of ways to turn magic into force, and inevitably one of them is going to be better than the original.

Speed boosting magic is common, since speed is a ridiculously powerful stat.

Monster farms exist for use with Harvest (loot dead entities), but also sell small, bound creatures as combo extenders for Lightning attacks. Lightning users often carry a basket on their back containing a multitude of them, and were at one time considered an optimal build due to their exponential damage scaling.

*Thoughts on undiscovered exploits*

I'm not sharing my ideas for this directly as the two I have are central to the story. I do think that if you want an undiscovered exploit that is usable at low levels, it's almost necessary for it to be high-entropy: aka. it should require combining multiple things from disparate places that are not commonly found together. Ideally it would also be /weird/; in at least some sense, it should require doing something that doesn't normally work, and nobody else would think to do, double-ideally even when they're looking at it.

Undiscovered exploits can be more freely available if they require atypical, large investments, since those are clearly less explored, though I /will/ warn against the overused trope of just making ‘100% Int' intrinsically overpowered. While it's fine for an exploit to involve a lot of mana, exploits should require thought.
