There are strengths and weaknesses to this analogy in my setting. A major difference is that, since this is a munchkin'd setting with no hard level caps, you'll start levelling up around the age of 5-7 or so, and will be settled on at least a build direction by the age of 10. So most people don't get to choose their build archetype with the force of their full intelligence---their parents do, or their dumber kid self does. For this reason, although optimization within common build trees will often come from the masses, archetype shifts to little-used builds will come from outside optimization; scholars, governance, mavericks, etc.

The strongest part of your analogy is that, as you say, most people choose easy mediocrity over risky, skilled excellence. In the adventuring world, this is reflected well: by far the most common way to achieve greatness is to take a known good adventuring build and throw a relentless force of will and bravery into grinding levels and training skills. Most people give up, and most of the rest die, but those who last end up with power.
