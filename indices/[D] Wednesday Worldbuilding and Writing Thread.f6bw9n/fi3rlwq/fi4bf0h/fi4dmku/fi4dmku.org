Worth the Candle has an interesting take on this, but my short story-to-be is focused around a particular itch, so I'd rather not get into gods and patches.

The guns analogy is actually a pretty good example of my distinction between discovered and undiscovered exploits. Lots of ancient civilizations had clever things; armour, Greek fire, castles with stairs that go round one way, moats and fortifications---if your setting has these, people can't be /that/ uncreative. What they didn't have, like gunpowder, were very particular, weird concoctions that seem like arbitrary things until the result actually lights up and goes /*bang*/.
