More thoughts:

1. *Technology die-offs*. In our world technology is generally easy to copy and pass on. If there are crafting professions, and only high-level crafters can create certain items, then the death of those crafters could set back an entire society. Especially if you need multiple high-level crafters to build tools for one another that allow each other to reach the peak of their respective crafts.
2. *Technological stagnation* The existence of those high level crafters could also prevent the invention of industrial technology. Why invent the Bessemer process for mass steel production when you can reliably get steel from lvl 50 blacksmiths? Why invent the flying shuttle when a lvl 50 weaver can work much faster? Why invent steam engines or complex sailing techniques when a couple of slaves power leveled to 25 with all their stats in strength can outrow the wind? In our world human labor has limitations, technology is one way to get around those limitations. In a Litrpg world, human labor has fewer limitations, thus there is less need for technology to suplement it.
