  Before we had money, we had bartering, and currency only came onto the table and proliferated because of specific social and economic pressures. These pressures are very different when you can trust people to honestly (albeit imperfectly) track how much they owe to whom. Even the ten minute cast time is not much of a concern when you can just ask people occasionally whether they'd lied about or lost track of what they owed over the last month.

I think you're underestimating just how much more convenient physical currency is when people don't have things like credit cards to easily and quickly interface with a debt ledger. Relying on people's memory to track debts also isn't a great idea, because people can't feasibly remember that many debts at once and lie detection isn't going to keep people from misremembering things nor can it distinguish false memories.\\
Hell even hunter gatherers would often use things like shells for currency because bartering is an absolute pain compared just using currency.

Overall without computing or a post scarcity society money is just so tremendously convenient that it's difficult to imagine any society larger than a tribe not using it. It's been independently developed so many different times that its development seems more or less inevitable unless there's some powerful taboo against it.
