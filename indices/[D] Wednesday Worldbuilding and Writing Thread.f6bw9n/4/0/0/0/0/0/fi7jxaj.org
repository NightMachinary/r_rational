It feels like you're not taking your own premise seriously enough. Having roughly egalitarian societies with easy access to lie detection lasting over timescales long enough to affect genetics brings you way, way outside the norms of today's society. Never mind cultists or traditional leadership roles, I'm not sure such a society would even have currency.
