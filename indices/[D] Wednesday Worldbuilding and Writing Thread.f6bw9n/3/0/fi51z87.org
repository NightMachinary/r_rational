  Just to clarify a bit: The AI won't be the sole focus of the story, or even the main one, it exists merely because I dislike the trope all kingdom building fics have where the MC is just some random guy who happens to have an entire library with all of human history on it inside their heads.

Giving the MC an actual library (with books like the sort mentioned by TheAnt88) connected to his mind is probably a better idea since AI isn't at all necessary here. Having even just AI which are copies of human minds will impact the setting the MC came from vastly more than you seem to be expecting, and human level AI not virtually identical to human minds will change things far more. So unless you want to spend a massive amount of time working out how AI will affect your setting you should consider whether it's really worth including.
