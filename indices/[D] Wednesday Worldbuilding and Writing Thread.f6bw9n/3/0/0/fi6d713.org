  Giving the MC an actual library (with books like the sort mentioned by TheAnt88) connected to his mind is probably a better idea since AI isn't at all necessary here.

You know what? I hadn't considered that, and I even have something planned that would work perfectly with it already!

  Having even just AI which are copies of human minds will impact the setting the MC came from vastly more than you seem to be expecting, and human level AI not virtually identical to human minds will change things far more. So unless you want to spend a massive amount of time working out how AI will affect your setting you should consider whether it's really worth including.

Yeah, I'm still not entirely sure on the specifics of that. I wanted to use the AI subplot as a way to make the story jump from fantasy to science fiction. I think I'll shelve anything AI related for now and come up with an antagonist that forces the protagonist to think in a bigger scale and to go from Kingdom Building to Civilization Building.
