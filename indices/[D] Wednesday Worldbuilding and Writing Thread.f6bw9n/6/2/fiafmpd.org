I'd use wax as a slow-moving hydraulic fluid. And tons of power (at low speeds) makes me think you'd get massive transport infrastructure far earlier than earth.

So the not!Romans might have dug cart tracks into their roads, and then just run massive trains of baggage cars throughout their empire on a continual basis.

That makes shipping super cheap, and makes it viable for characters to (slowly) drift around the empire.

You'd also end up with a society with very strong opinions on bees. One model might have everyone and their mom tending to a private bee hive. Another might make "bee ownership" into a lords-only right (similar to how lords once maintained the right to run flour mills as a way of basically taxing wheat production)

Society would also produce some huge excess of honey, which would show up in their cuisine as deserts, meads, and military rations.

A potential hook here might be that someone messed with a bee hive and society takes this very seriously. Or, the main character gets his first hive, only to be accused of having stolen someone else's swarm.
