The idea that sounds most similar to what you're going for while still being plausible would likely be genetic engineering lacking any deep understanding of what most genes are doing. The massively polygenic nature of most traits could conceivably result in direct genetic engineering not producing large effects for a fair while.\\
So instead people could use genetic engineering to create people with the most common allele in most of their genome. This would result in relatively low genetic diversity (though they'd probably lack harmful recessive genes), however a lot of evidence suggests that low mutation load determines quite a few other traits. So these individuals would probably be very attractive (since averaging lots of peoples faces together produces a composite which is more attractive than its components), healthy, intelligent, etc.
