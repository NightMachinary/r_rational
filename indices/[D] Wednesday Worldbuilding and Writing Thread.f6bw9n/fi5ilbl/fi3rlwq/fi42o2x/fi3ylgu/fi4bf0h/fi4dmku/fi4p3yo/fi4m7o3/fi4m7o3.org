A couple of additional thoughts that I have:

1. *Build synergies*. I think this might end up dictating a lot about how individuals interact with society. Builds that favor people going at it alone might be more prominent in individualistic societies. Feudal systems might end up with powerful leaders that are highly dependant on a small army of support class builds for equipment, buffs, combat support, etc. Families might be based on synergistic builds between partners and offspring. Also discovering build synergies might be way more research-intensive than discovering useful solo builds (the equivalent of finding a strong elemental metal vs discovering a good metal alloy or gunpowder).
2. *Soft level caps*. How does the leveling up work exactly? Are there ways to generate experience through non-combat activities? If the best way to gain XP is through killing than everyone's levels are going to look like a pyramid. A wide base of low-level monsters or people to support a smaller number of high-level individuals. While you are climbing the pyramid it makes sense to specialize in killing things, but once you reach the top of the pyramid you need to have some ability to grow the base of the pyramid in order to grow stronger.
3. *Munchkinry vs Law of Large Numbers*. Have you ever read up on or played EVE online? In small gang combat, there are some super munchkin type things you can do. Speed tanks, sensor jamming, super high damage resists, spider tanking (imagine a party of 5 paladins all healing and tanking each other), etc. The problem is that all of it becomes irrelevant by just throwing more numbers at the problem, and that is actually the dominant strategy in EVE. A large group of smaller ships (equivalent to a large group of low leveled people) can beat a small group of larger more expensive ships (equivalent to a small group of high leveled people). This has created an ever-growing system of alliances and alliance-coalitions. The devs have constantly tried to shift the meta to avoid political stagnation in player-owned space.
