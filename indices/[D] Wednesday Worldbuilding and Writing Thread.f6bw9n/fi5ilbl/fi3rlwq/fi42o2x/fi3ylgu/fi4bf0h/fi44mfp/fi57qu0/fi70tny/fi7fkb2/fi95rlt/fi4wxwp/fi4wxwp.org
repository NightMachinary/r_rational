If I were to offer one thing about skill trees I'd be interested in seeing, it'd be stuff that our world's cultures don't place that much emphasis on, but which then have culture built around them due to their presence in the skills of the system. It's a bit weird to explain maybe, so I'll give a few examples.

On earth, there is often the notion of 'elements' that make up the world. You have your fire, water, earth, and air from ancient Greece, your fire, water, earth, wood, and metal from China, your fire, water, earth, wood, and air from Tibet... You may be noticing a few patterns here. But there are so many other options for elements in these sorts of systems which aren't explored, which raise interesting questions that may or may not be answered! What about ammonia magic? (Is the system built for multiple, completely different species' biologies?) What about uranium magic? (Are the system's element choices meant to have symbolic significance even for future technology levels?) What about steel magic? (At what point does an alloy become steel in the system's opinion? What does this mean in the grand scheme of things?) The examples I gave may or may not fit into what you're trying to create in your world, but I'm sure you can at least see the angle I'm coming from here.

As for more martial skills, something to consider is what weapons the system deems worthy of skill trees. In fact, at what point does a dagger become a sword? How much must you lengthen the hilt of a dagger before it becomes a spear? And then you get into much more interesting questions, like if the system has a skill tree for a weapon that would never ordinarily be used because it would be outclassed in every category. Perhaps a gyroscope with knives attached along the edges and held at a /very careful distance/ can be spun to cause harm to others, and the system has a skill tree for this weird form of weapon. All this raises questions about whether weapon choices shaped the system, or if the system shaped the weapon choices. I'd like to leave off this point by using the example of scythes, a farming tool which was not often used in actual warfare for a number of reasons, being a common weapon in fantasy. If a scythe can be a skill, why not shovel warfare, or trowel warfare?

Then you have production skills, which could be weird along similar lines. Is glass-making a skill? It took humans a while to learn how to make glass - did the system teach them? Is law a skill? Did it only appear after humans created legal systems? Is gun-making a skill? How many clues can it offer towards learning how to make them without the skill? These could all have profound effects of technology.

Now, for all I know, these might be questions you don't want to tackle (which is completely understandable, since I feel like I'd be in a small minority of people who wants to see them analysed) but they could nonetheless provide interesting ideas to fill out your skill list. And the weirder the skill, the more fun it could be to exploit. To go back to the gyroscope weapon example, I could imagine a skill that allows for a disproportionally long spinning time for input force so long as contact with the wielder is maintained. I could /then/ see, instead of watermills, these people being hired to mill grain quickly and efficiently by sitting down on a chair and using their skill on a small gyroscope connected to a larger contraption. And that's just getting started!

As for more general exploits, there's a lot people could do with negative modifiers. Slow yourself down enough and you move backwards very quickly. Lower your jump height enough to glitch underground (or be turned into a puddle, depending on the specific physics). Lower intellect long enough to... have negative calculation speed? Though that would presumably be difficult. In addition to damage negatives, perhaps other negatives could be used in combat. If you lower the damage of a fire spell enough, does it begin to freeze the area? Though in that case I could see it just approaching room temperature. But even then, a fire spell can suddenly become air conditioning.

As for other, more creative exploits, looking at some of the more notable exploits in IRL video games could be interesting. In WOW, for example, there was a boss (Hakkar I think) who could give you a debuff that was contagious, deadly, and had carriers - unsummoned pets and NPCs - who could contract the debuff and not die. The Corrupted Blood incident on Wikipedia gives a pretty good synopsis, but long story short it was an unintended epidemic/pandemic cause by an oversight in the system. I could imagine something like that happening in a LitRPG world. I won't name any others off the top of my head, but I think IRL would be a good place to start looking for cool exploits.

Hope this all helps! (Or at least provides some interest.)
