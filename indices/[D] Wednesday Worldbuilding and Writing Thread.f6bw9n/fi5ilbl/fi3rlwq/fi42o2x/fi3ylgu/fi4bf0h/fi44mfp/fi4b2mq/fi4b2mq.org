  Production skill * Battle skill. I'm not sure how separate these two types of skills would be in your setting. Would the meta build typically be one or the other?

Yes, like some people will be dedicated farmers, with points in *Economic » Farming* and other trees that synergize like *Nature » Forestry*. They'll generally be fairly low level, but that's fine since they're operating in a different economic niche than the mid/high level adventurers, who don't have points to spare on non-combat skills.
