As for the exploits part:

Adapted from fluff novel Only Sense Online.

A "hunter mark" type of skill in the archery skill tree. Increases ability to track target, increases piercing damage, accuracy, and effective range. Range increase also affects spells, which many have found out, but what many have not is that it allows the user to cast touch-spells as a short ranged attack on a marked target.

Production skill * Battle skill. I'm not sure how separate these two types of skills would be in your setting. Would the meta build typically be one or the other?
