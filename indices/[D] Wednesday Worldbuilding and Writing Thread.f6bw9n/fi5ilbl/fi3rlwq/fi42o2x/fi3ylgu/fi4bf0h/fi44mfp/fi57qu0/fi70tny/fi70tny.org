'Matching penny' combat: Uses negative resistance to counter >100% piercing attacks and >100% resistance to counter normal attacks.

Please tell me [QWOP] does exactly what I think it does.

Another thing is skills that scale infinitely with mana (or all of them if there are no cooldown of some sort). With a large enough mana pool and/or soul bond any magic becomes Explosion magic.

Does the outcome of P vs NP changes anything?
