  In WOW, for example, there was a boss (Hakkar I think) who could give you a debuff that was contagious, deadly, and had carriers - unsummoned pets and NPCs - who could contract the debuff and not die.

At first it was just a cute gimmick played for laughs that Zombie summons could get Rabies without taking damage or becoming enraged, until one day over a suppertime meal an interested apprentice asked innocently, â€˜can I do that too?'

Within the day he was dealing Level 40 damage off a Level 15 build, and it was only after years of development and many village-razing outbreaks that the hype finally died down and its use became regulated. So goes the tale of the Zombie Rabies Meta-plague.

This is /exactly/ the kind of thing I was looking for!

  As for more general exploits, there's a lot people could do with negative modifiers.

You're right. I don't think negative modifiers should reach a greater magnitude than the positive ones, but that doesn't make negative speed any less interesting.

Depending on what's being negated, either of your negative fireballs are plausible. Mind you, though, it's not easy to set up negatives, and they'll generally be worse than just going all out if your aim is damage, but air conditioning anti-fire is within reason and would help set the stage.

My disdain for weapon skill trees meant I only left the generic equivalents (Small Arms, Light Arms, Heavy Arms, Ranged Weaponry), but this idea is actually really cool. A bunch of really wacky weaponry that only makes sense in a magical world would be a lot of fun. I'm a little concerned about scope, but I'm tempted. Either way, +[Trowel Knight]+ [Palette Knight] absolutely has to be a skill.

I think I've done a neat take on the elements thing, but I'll leave the details for the story.

  Hope this all helps! (Or at least provides some interest.)

100% this answer was great. Thanks! :)
