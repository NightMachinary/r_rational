I want to try my hand at writing a kingdom building story. It's a somewhat generic medieval fantasy setting with a few hard and soft magic systems in place, so nothing groundbreaking yet. I know where I want to take the story and have a lot of characters figured out, but I'm not exactly sure how to go about implementing the one-man-industrial-revolution part. I know that one way to go about it is to have the MC reinvent things as the need for it arises, but what would be the 'rational' approach in this case? Go for the low-hanging fruit first? Or prioritize the world-changing inventions?

The MC isn't explicitly rational (in fact, one of the soft magic systems in place that affects him the most is guided by emotions and is seemingly fueled by actions that go against rational or efficient choices, thus influencing his already somewhat eccentric attitude) and for the most part is fine going along with the local customs and social dynamics, so pretty much someone who is driven but only so far as to get what he wants, which boils down to influence, prestige, comfortable living conditions, and magic/magitek research. He's aided by an AI/Spirit of Knowledge companion whose main goal is to bring the society they now find themselves in up to par with the world they origin from, an alternate earth that discovered and created AIs in the 50's and is now pseudo-futuristic (or cyberpunkish, depending on where you live), so it can make contact and rejoin with the main AI that created it. The AI companion will only be able to interact with the world through the MC, so they'll be at odds with each other most of the time because their goals don't align (MC isn't opposed, but doesn't care about going back).

The AI can not upgrade itself (or make more of its kind) until society reaches the level where it can make (and understand) the equivalent of an ERA 1101 computer, so that's around 600 or 700 years worth of technological and societal advancements that it has to achieve in at most 7 decades (the MC isn't immortal). Integration with society is a big part of what allows the AI's existence and helps keep any paperclip maximizer/grey goo scenarios at bay, which are counterproductive to the main AI's goal. Given all of that, what inventions and advancements would an AI focus on?

Just to clarify a bit: The AI won't be the sole focus of the story, or even the main one, it exists merely because I dislike the trope all kingdom building fics have where the MC is just some random guy who happens to have an entire library with all of human history on it inside their heads. At that point you might as well have an actual 'advisor' that has all that knowledge ready to be used. Still, even if it's not the most important part of the story I still want it to be interesting.

Also, are there any tech trees, charts, cheat sheets, or guides I could use to have an idea of the things that are worth reinventing? Something like [[https://i.imgur.com/2psNjiL.png][this?]] It doesn't have to be as detailed since I'll try and research myself anything that could be relevant.
