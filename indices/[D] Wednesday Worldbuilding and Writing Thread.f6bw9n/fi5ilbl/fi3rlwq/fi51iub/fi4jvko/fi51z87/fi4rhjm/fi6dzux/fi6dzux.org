  How to invent everything: A time traveler's guide for the stranded time traveler. by Ryan North. Goes in-depth step by step on fundamental technologies, measurement, trade, farming, useful animals, chemistry, medicine, and labor in simple easy to understand chapters. A super great read that was really interesting and even goes into what order to invent things depending on the place and time period.

  So I would focus on things that make you money first and foremost. Then farming and health to increase the number of available workers. Then pay and treat your workers very well, train them up, attract others. From there follow up on the tech you want to focus on.

I see. The protagonist will make some very influential and powerful allies, but not for the first half of the story. Boiling it down to money, resources, and workforce helps. I also see that I'll have to keep in mind how magic and magitek changes things. Medical inventions that are expensive and only available to a very few are quite pointless when you have healing magic and miracles available, however teaching people to wash their hands, affordable soap, and inventing antibiotics will go a long way to keep alive the lower and middle classes who can't afford a magical treatment.
