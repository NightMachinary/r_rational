Perhaps useful to you, although not specifically what you asked for: [[https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/16/book-review-seeing-like-a-state/][Seeing Like A State]]. I've linked the Slate Star Codex review because it comes at the topic from an angle I think this subreddit would find most useful. The main point that I think is applicable is that some kinds of organisational systems that we take for granted simply wouldn't exist in the past. You can't distribute a recipe for gunpowder that uses very precise measurements, because different areas will have wildly different ideas of how much a pound weighs, for example.
