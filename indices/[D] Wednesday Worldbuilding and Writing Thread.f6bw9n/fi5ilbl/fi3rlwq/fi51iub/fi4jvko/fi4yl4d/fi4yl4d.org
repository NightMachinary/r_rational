I'm trying to figure out how psychology should evolve given easy access to perfect lie detection.

When it comes to the conditions people are evolving under, assume things are similar to the conditions humans evolved under and that tech levels are constant. With a few major exceptions being that:

- People are starting out with egalitarian modern values and a proper legal system. Wars still occur, but strong norms and laws preventing the sort of war crimes that would be typical for most warfare throughout history/prehistory.
- There is widespread access to a spell making the target unable to lie which takes ten minutes to cast and has no other limits on how much it can be cast. People are starting out with "trust but verify" as a norm, meaning people commonly use lie detection in things like marriage vows or minor disputes. Lie detection is also universal in criminal cases and regularly used on people in positions of authority to root out corruption. When lie detection is used people are expected to recite (often standardized) statements which are given to them, which is done to prevent people from simply answering questions in truthful but misleading ways.

So assuming the above mentioned norms/values don't go away, how should one expect humans to evolve in response to widespread lie detection?
