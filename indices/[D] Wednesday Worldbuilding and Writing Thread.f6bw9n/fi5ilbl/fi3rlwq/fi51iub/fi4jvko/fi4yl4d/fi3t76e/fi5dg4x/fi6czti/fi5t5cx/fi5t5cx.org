You need to give /a lot more information/ to work with: What's the tech level? How many people can use magic? How difficult and time consuming is it to learn magic? How much force can wax statues exert, are they more durable than normal wax? How much force can glass telekinesis apply? How quickly can that force be applied, and how precisely?

Try not to add more magic systems until you've fully fleshed out the applications of what you already have. Depending on how common magic is every single one of the powers you mentioned could dramatically alter a setting.
