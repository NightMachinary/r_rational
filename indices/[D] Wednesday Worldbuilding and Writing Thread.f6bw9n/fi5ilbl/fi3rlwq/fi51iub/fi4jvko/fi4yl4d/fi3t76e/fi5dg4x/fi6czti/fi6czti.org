  allows a mage to make non-sentient but autonomous wax statues that only listen to their programmed commands.
#+end_quote

This, right here, is going to make Wax mages very similar to computer programmers. The Wax Statue does exactly what it is told to do. Not what you /want/ it to do, but what it is /told/ to do.

For example, say you have a treasury. You want to make a Wax Guardian. Fair enough. You program it to punch anything that comes through the windows or the door that doesn't give the password.

Then there's a windy day in autumn and someone left the window open. The Guardian is spending all its time smashing its fist into the autumn leaves, one at a time. Meanwhile, the thief who tunneled in through the floor is quietly shovelling gold into her sack without being disturbed.

These Wax Statues /are/ immensely useful. But, as described, they have distinct limits, and it might be worth exploring those limits.
