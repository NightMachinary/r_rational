Rods from God are generally poor weapons of mass destruction. They're excellent bunker busters, and almost impossible to block, but they don't deal particularly sizable area damage, at least not compared to traditional explosives like nukes.

I wouldn't be surprised if it was sufficiently easy to launch moonstuff with the right lunar elevator or railgun, such that asteroid bombardment was practical, though it might be easier to just redirect an asteroid.
