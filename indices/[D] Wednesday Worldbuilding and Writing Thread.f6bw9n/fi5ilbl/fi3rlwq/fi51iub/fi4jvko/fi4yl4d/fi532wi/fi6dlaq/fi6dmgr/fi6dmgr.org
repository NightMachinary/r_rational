Do these standardised statement have potential holes in them? For example (to borrow a recent scene from The Wandering Inn) let's say I'm a criminal thug. I was followed by a couple of members of the Watch, and have turned the tables on them - beating them to within an inch of their lives and then calling in an underworld associate to take them away and finish the job of killing them.

I know I'm going to be questioned about their disappearance. But I don't know how they died. I don't know where they died. I don't know /when/ they died, but they were certainly alive the last time /I/ saw them. I don't even know for sure /whether/ they died (yet) or who (if anyone) might be holding them. (I /do/ know that my underworld associate will hand them off to someone else a few times before they get killed, but I won't admit to that). I don't even know who killed them (if anyone) but I can /certainly/ point out the high monster population in the nearby area.

Do the standardised statements have holes in them that can be exploited by someone who plans ahead in such a manner?

--------------

Also, a lie that suggests /immediate/ action is still useful. For example, assume a thief has run off with your stuff. You're chasing her but have lost sight. I'm a bystander on a street corner - I point and say "She went thataway!"

You /could/ take ten minutes and verify whether or not I am telling the truth, yes. However, if you do, then it won't matter - the thief will be long gone. In such circumstances, a lie is exactly as useful as it is in this world.

--------------

When you say that it makes a target 'unable to lie', then I assume that it forces the target to speak the truth /to the best of their knowledge/. (Thus, I can't cast the spell on a friend and ask him to tell me next week's winning lottery numbers). This opens a loophole that allows a lie - if I am convincing enough to persuade Jim that my lie is actually true, then anyone who casts the spell on Jim will hear him stating clearly that my statement is perfectly true. (Of course, anyone casting the spell on me will quickly find out the deception - which is why I send out Jim to do the negotiation while I remain comfortably out of reach).

--------------

Is it possible to cast a version of the spell which /looks/ like the real thing but doesn't actually work? For example, could I have my ally Sue cast the Truth Spell on my other ally Mark (who's mute) but in such a way that it appears to be cast on me? In this way, I can make false statements that /look/ undeniably true to most observers.
