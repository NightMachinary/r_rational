First off, torture is now a lot more useful as a method of gaining information than it is IRL. IRL, information obtained through torture is unreliable. In this world, you can just cast the spell and tell the prisoner you'll stop whipping them when they tell you whether they know e.g. where the hidden weapons cache is. You can torture people to give /an/ answer IRL as well, but given the existence of reliable lie detection, you can now 20-question your way right to the limits of the knowledge of whoever you're interrogating.
