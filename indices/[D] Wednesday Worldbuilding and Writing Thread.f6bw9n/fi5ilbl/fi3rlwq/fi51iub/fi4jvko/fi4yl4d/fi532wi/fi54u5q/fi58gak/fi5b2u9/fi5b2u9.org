  You presuppose that trust-but-verify is omnipresent as an attitude, but I'd imagine that there's an incentive to spread an anti-magic-lie-detector meme extolling the beauty of trust etc etc etc...

There's strong norms for using lie detection regularly on anyone important because this setting has been nearly destroyed by cultists more than once. For most people though I can see attitudes towards lie detection going either way.\\
Once culture shifted towards its use within a group though I don't see it ever shifting back, because refusing to submit to lie detection at that point would be effectively an admission of guilt. So nobody would trust people advocating against it once its use reached a critical mass, since the only people incentivized to oppose it would be well liars.\\
I can also see lie detection spreading a lot through memetic selection, since groups who utilized it would have an overwhelming advantage in many areas. There'd also be a strong incentive for reputable businesses and many other groups to adopt it immediately, since by default the public already considers any claims they make suspect.
