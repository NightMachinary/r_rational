The standard truth spell is single target and lasts ten minutes, people can also cast zone of truth but access to that spell is rarer and 99% of casters could only use it a few times a day.

  As for the general population, I don't see too much change. The average person probably won't be subject to the truth-spell, and the ten-minute casting time is long enough that it's not something that can likely will be used outside of formalized settings. People will still do things that they would not like others to know about as long as they think that they won't be formally questioned.

Beyond just being really cheap and easily accessible there's cultures where everyone can cast the spell and if you have "trust but verify" as a norm spending ten minutes to check many claims (or using it on yourself to prove the veracity of statements) is hardly a massive hassle.
