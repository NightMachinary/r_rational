Humans IRL spend a lot of energy on modelling each other to (among many other things) aid in deception.

You presuppose that trust-but-verify is omnipresent as an attitude, but I'd imagine that there's an incentive to spread an anti-magic-lie-detector meme extolling the beauty of trust etc etc etc...

Anyway, maybe others having a means of forcing you to tell the truth means that, ironically- assuming the extreme case where there are really no workarounds - lying becomes useless, and tendencies and abilities towards lying become non-adaptive, so presumably over a long enough timescale people with a predilection towards misleading people would be outcompeted by less machiavellian types, ironically making the lie detector less required when it comes to most people.

Then again, it might just enforce a heavy split. If you're always honest- whatever. Being mildly dishonest, marrying someone you intend to cheat on etc., that doesn't work. The only way you could ever get away with 'antisocial' secrets you don't want anyone (spouse, powers that be, etc) to know about is to be /very/ machiavellian and escape notice entirely.

So there's one idea. Populations split into a hawks and sparrows-style situation where most people become much worse at lying, their skills atrophying, but very good social manipulators can get away with it by avoiding suspicion entirely, thus never being asked any incriminating questions under the spell.

If we're going for wacky fantasy stuff, a million years down the line maybe there's an incentive for a highly compartmentalised mind structure that beats the spell by having you temporarily forget something, or have deliberate multiple personality ala /Blindsight/.
