â€˜Communist utopia' is still looking at an alien society as if it were human. Before we had money, we had bartering, and currency only came onto the table and proliferated because of specific social and economic pressures. These pressures are very different when you can trust people to honestly (albeit imperfectly) track how much they owe to whom. Even the ten minute cast time is not much of a concern when you can just ask people occasionally whether they'd lied about or lost track of what they owed over the last month.

I don't know what such a society would look like after equally many thousands of years of development, and I'd have to think about it quite deeply to take a good guess, but I'd be very untrusting of anything that looked too close to what we have today.
