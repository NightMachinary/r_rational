People able to cast the spell can also detect magic so people can't fake the spell with illusions (or at least casters able to do so are so rare and powerful they might as well be above the law). The setting also has a great many very smart people who work on developing statements to be read under the spells effects, and procedures for how to ask follow up questions. This knowledge has also percolated throughout the culture (in part due to examples of people using the methods your describe, and also due to their prevalence in fiction) so people have enough sense to know to ask about indirect actions. Plus you can also ask questions about whether somebody is trying to decieve you or hinder an investigation.
