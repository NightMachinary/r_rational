Fanfic Idea: The Light Of Gotham

So I've recently been reading some young justice fanfiction and really liked the concept of the Light. A group of supervillains whose goal is to uplift and improve humanity's place in the universe. Though they are only so effective because the League is given a bit of the idiot ball and act in rather stupid ways from time to time.

Basically, the idea is a group of Gothamites come together in a criminal conspiracy and create a less powerful but slightly saner version of the Light with one goal: to make Gotham safe and its people happy using whatever means necessary. While they acknowledge Gotham needs Batman, they all agree that Batman is, statistically speaking, useless at actually improving Gotham. Crime hasn't gone down since he showed up, the criminal and justice department is corrupt, the police department is every bad thing you've heard about the police, Arkham is focused on profit over rehabilitation and cant' keep villains contained, the city government is backed with corporate greed/corruption that makes it so no one can afford to live in or improve the city, and Batman simply can't be everywhere no matter how competent he is.

The Light comes together thanks to Olive Silverlock, a teenager with mental issues from the short-lived comic Gotham Academy which mostly involved the students acting as paranormal investigators in Gotham. In canon, she comes from a long line of people with fire abilities that also comes with mental illness. Her mother was a supervillain who was sent to Arkham and later died. She blames Batman for it.

In this version of the story, she found the book of Amity Arkham in the school which showed how to do certain kinds of magic. She used it to raise a zombie that she speaks through and becomes a version of the Arkham Knight who in this canon will have mental abilities. The book also gives hints on the various reality breaking metals from Batman Metal including a difficult recipe to create a metal that can create Meta Humans. Most of the Light's new powers and capabilities come from her and the rest of the Light will not be aware of her true identity.

Natural Metahumans in Gotham Rules:

Powers are street level only. Meaning that a group of thugs with bats and guns is a very real and legitimate threat.

Powers provide both benefits and nasty side effects. At least some of the time the power should act almost like a disability.

No one is super tough. A gun will kill every metahuman.

Olive uses her new powers to form a geas on the minds of the Light to keep them from telling each other's secrets. They plan to do whatever is necessary to fix Gotham with only a few rules of conduct including never murdering needlessly and only attacking people that deserve it. The story details their efforts to fix Gotham and the changes both good and bad that they bring.

Main Goals:

Install a loyal and authentic city government to make administrative decisions that will actually make Gotham better. Get rid of any candidate that fights this through blackmail, exposing crimes, threats, or worse if necessary.

Reform the Gotham City Police Department. Go after the corrupt cops and don't let them get away with their crimes, install a new commissioner, new training and body cameras, pay them more, get rid of laws that they use to abuse people etc.

Close Arkham down and either send the inmates elsewhere, build something better, or find a way to ensure that anyone who can't be rehabilitated is dealt with permanently.

Instead of punching criminals try to rehabilitate and educate them to actually stop crime.

Create more heroes using their special metal to keep Gotham safe until the police department can be reformed. This ensures Batman can focus on more important targets. Of course, they have to provide them with training, resources, and find good candidates.

Finally, murder the Joker.

The things I need help with are finding people to populate this version of the Light. They need to be willing to break the law, not interested in exposing or killing batman, aren't guilty of any serious crimes, live in Gotham, and be of use in the organization. Not sure how many members there should be, but I don't want more than 7 members. Here are a few of the candidates.

Renee Montoya- Similar to canon she is disgusted by the police department but instead of being forced out of the department, the Light helps make her problems go away. She provides information on the police department and her new goal is to raise in the ranks and reform the department. She joins the Light after framing a corrupt CSI which exposes quite a bit of evidence tampering and leads to a round of firings.

Aaron Cash- Goes back to college to become a psychologist thanks to the Light's efforts while working at Arkham. The goal is to take over the leadership of Arkham Asylum and be their main source inside. Joins the Light after murdering Professor Pig during a mass escape while making it look like he did in self-defense.

Janet Van Dorn -- Former district attorney who took over after Harvey Dent became Two Face. Lost her re-election to an openly corrupt and unqualified candidate. She joined the Light after blackmailing her newly elected rival. Hates batman but knows he is still needed.

Charise Carnes -- Sent to Arkham for a crime she didn't commit before being exonerated. A Batgirl villain from the comics. Extremely wealthy with quite a mercenaries under her employ.
