The first example that springs to mind for me is the /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_(franchise)][Dune]]/ books by Frank Herbert. In his series, the Bene Gesserit have a long-term, galaxy-wide human breeding program mainly based on political manipulation, arranged marriages, and subtly guided diaspora. A main character in one of the books creates a separate human breeding program based on controlled marriages within a single population. Also, the Tleilaxu faction in the series does lots of cloning with genetic manipulation.

You might also look to the example of the Cetagandans in Lois McMaster Bujold's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vorkosigan_Saga#%22Vorkosiverse%22][Vorkosigan saga]]. They are a technologically advanced galactic empire with a rigidly tiered hierarchy of so-called genetic perfection. Each tier is relegated to different societal roles, and the breeding program revolves around a sort-of meritocracy that determines whose genes get sampled to create each new generation.

I don't know to what extent any of those tactics would be realistically effective or applicable, but you might find the books to be fun sources of inspiration.
