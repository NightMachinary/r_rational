I'm not sure how useful any breeding-based method would be, because usually that will only select for "fitness", whatever that may be. Conventional breeding is "number of offspring", but usually eugenics attempts to select for something else.

If you have access to genetic engineering tools, then that's probably your best bet. If you can't identify the genes/combination of genes that give the desired traits, then without ethics committees you can always create test groups to evaluate the effects of different alleles.

Without such genetic knowledge, I would say that the classical "breeding permits for the genetically clean" would work out fine, as you are able to test for the traits you wish to select for, and genetic purging occurs naturally.

The main difficulty, as always, is what traits to select for.
