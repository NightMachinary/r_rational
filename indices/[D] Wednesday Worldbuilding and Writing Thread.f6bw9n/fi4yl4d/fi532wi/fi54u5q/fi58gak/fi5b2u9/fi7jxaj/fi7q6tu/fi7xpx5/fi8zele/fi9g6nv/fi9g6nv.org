Currency being convenient is good hindsight reasoning, and I absolutely agree that it's a better way of keeping track of tradable debts than what I described. But history runs on insight and zeitgeists, and those are principally modulated by local social environments.

In your setting, these social environments are super extra weird, and so arguments like “hunter gatherers would often” don't carry much intrinsic weight.

(Note that I'm not saying your setting wouldn't invent or use currency, I'm saying it's not a given, and I'm using that as an anchoring point for how readily and dramatically one should expect the setting to diverge.)
