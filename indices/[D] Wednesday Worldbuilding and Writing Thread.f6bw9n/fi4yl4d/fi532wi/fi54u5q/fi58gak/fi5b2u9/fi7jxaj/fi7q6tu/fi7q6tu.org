Modern developed nations are pretty egalitarian, but that certainly hasn't turned them into communist utopias. It seems like a potentially very hierarchical society could still be quite stable indefinitely if QOL at the bottom is still high and there's upwards mobility for those with enough talent. There's also pragmatic reasons that in lieu of game changing tech markets may stick around forever due to their substantial advantages, especially since nations are in competition.

  Having roughly egalitarian societies with easy access to lie detection lasting over timescales long enough to affect genetics brings you way, way outside the norms of today's society.

Well yeah that's what I'm asking about. I'm not assuming values/norms will stay /that/ similar, just that certain core values stick around in some form because of the ostracization/punishment of anyone who was say anti-egalitarian or pro war crimes. While it seems likely "moral progress" is in part random, certain modern values do seem like they function as strong attractor states which should be stable without top down authoritarian action.
