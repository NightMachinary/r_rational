How long does the spell last? Can it only be cast on individuals, or can you create "zones of truth"?

If the "truth is beauty" meme is popular enough, I would expect all formal statements to be made under the spell, although public statements might be exempt if there's an external threat where exposing the inner workings of the minds of the political elite might not be the best strategy.

Interestingly, written testimonials would be more suspect, and thus you'd likely have professional Witnesses to witness contracts, statements, etc., although the limitations of human memory is still an issue, and "trained forgetting" might be a useful skill.

As for the general population, I don't see too much change. The average person probably won't be subject to the truth-spell, and the ten-minute casting time is long enough that it's not something that can likely will be used outside of formalized settings. People will still do things that they would not like others to know about as long as they think that they won't be formally questioned.

Not sure how easily businesses will implement it; advertising and such requires prerecorded messages that can be faked, as you can't show the ten-minute casting time. A one-time public statement could be done, but truth-statements are nonbinding, and thus you'd need "warrant canaries" and constant public statements (quarterly reports?) stating all the things that they have never done. Again, since written records are suspect, and full-truth cannot be easily communicated to the masses, you might have impartial news sources reporting these, but then you have lobbying and incentives pressures on these news sources (though easier if they release their own quarterly reports), but these sources would have to verify every single piece of news directly (or through chains of Witnesses), which would be difficult.
