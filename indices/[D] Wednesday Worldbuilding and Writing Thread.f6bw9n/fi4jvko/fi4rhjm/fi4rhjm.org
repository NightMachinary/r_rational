Oh, there are plenty of Self Insert fanfictions into medieval/fantasy settings that talk about this very thing. Though granted you have to search for the good ones that aren't just power fantasies. But I have the perfect book and guide!

How to invent everything: A time traveler's guide for the stranded time traveler. by Ryan North. Goes in-depth step by step on fundamental technologies, measurement, trade, farming, useful animals, chemistry, medicine, and labor in simple easy to understand chapters. A super great read that was really interesting and even goes into what order to invent things depending on the place and time period.

Most people go for the low hanging fruit first to build-up money and a reputation for inventing/treating workers well to attract people to you. Unless you luck out into being born into the nobility where you have easy money, available workers, and the political ability to organize, it will take time to build-up infrastructure and a trained workforce to create stuff.

First, it depends on the government in this kingdom, what your rights are, how educated the people are, how good communication is long distance, and how advanced their food production and storage are.

If everyone is farming so they don't starve in winter, you aren't going to be attracting very many workers unless you have some way to improve crop yields. Better harvests lead to more workers for you as they don't require as many farmers to feed the population. Now you have workers but you are still going to need to train them up, house them, and feed them which requires money.

So I would focus on things that make you money first and foremost. Then farming and health to increase the number of available workers. Then pay and treat your workers very well, train them up, attract others. From there follow up on the tech you want to focus on.
