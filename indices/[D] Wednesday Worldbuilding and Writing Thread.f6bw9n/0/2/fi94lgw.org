Lightbringer series has this, Guile family has historically done selective breeding, it started with a women who had a business in horse breeding.. And the world has magic ability that's inheritable and other traits that are also considered beneficial for mages. They end up breeding the most powerful and influential mage warriors ever.

Most people here wouldn't like the ending though.. What I said is basically all you'll get on the subject from the series anyway. You can read it if you want but I wouldn't recommend the series.
