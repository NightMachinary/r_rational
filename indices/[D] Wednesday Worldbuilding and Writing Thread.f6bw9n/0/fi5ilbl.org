Does anyone have suggestions for stories involving realistic population genetics and forced selective evolution in humans? It occurs to me that most of the popular points of reference on the topic (e.g. [[https://diyhpl.us/%7Ebryan/papers2/bio/The%20use%20and%20misuse%20of%20Brave%20New%20World%20in%20the%20CRISPR%20debate%20-%202019.pdf][Brave New World]], or [[https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Khan_Noonien_Singh][Star Trek]]) are not particularly literate, usually being structured as morality tales.

One missing element I'm thinking of is the concept of genetic purging, where harmful mutations are reduced in frequency in population bottlenecks due to inbreeding, which causes recessive alleles to be expressed. The usual way "eugenic science" is portrayed in fiction is with a "master race" that is pure-bred and therefore considered fitter than the base population, but with this effect it's actually kind of the other way around (inbred organisms are normally /less/ fit, and this gives a chance for the bad mutations to die out, such that later generations of the inbred strain can strengthen the base population when they outbreed).

So a dystopian scenario about a villain / villainous regime that wants to make fitter humans while not caring about the cost to the individuals involved, might involve setting up many groups of [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5234482/][70 or so]] individuals that are only permitted to be fertile within their group. The genes of these strains of humanity would be made available to the base population of humanity, but not vice versa, making them net producers of /filtered/ genetic diversity.

Another way to use inbred strains would be to create hybrids, as is commonly done in plants. Members of a given inbred group are near-clones (so there's quality control), and when mixed 50/50 with any other such group that is dissimilar, you get a robust cross that has some attributes of both, and none of the recessive alleles. This is different from crossing the inbred strain with the base population because the 50/50 cross is just as predictable as the inbred variant. While hybrids are fertile, their offspring do not have predictable traits. Hybrid individuals, although and mentally and physically fit, would be plausible targets for sterilization in the name of social order or what have you.
