I think breeding humans is probably more trouble than it's worth for sci-fi civilizations. If you have an understanding of genetics, an amoral government, and the political centralization to make use of these things, you're just going to blitz through or skip the breeding stages and go directly into gene tinkering. Remember, mendelian inheritance was only formally discovered about 200 years ago. That's not enough generations to make a significant difference to the human population, when you take into account the fact that early experiments won't be as productive as later ones, that human generations are pretty slow, and that you have to wait the entire lifespan of a human to see all the results of a breeding strategy.

Plus, I expect that a society with such an amoral focus on hard science will either advance genetic modification technology faster than ours, or they'll collapse and lose their ability to breed people.

That being said, while a near past to future society using artificial selection on humans is pretty unlikely, it might be interesting to have a classical or ancient setting with a society that practices breeding. After all, it wouldn't be a huge divergence from our own history: 'noble breeding' is a concept we already have, along with caste systems, and it would be relatively easy to justify religious or cultural idiosyncrasies leading into a premodern state that practices breeding, and actually takes the effort to get /good/ at it. Perhaps the people they view to be the great geniuses of their cultures aren't philosophers and mathematicians (e.g., pythagoras, archimedes, as in western culture), but natural historians and biologists.
