Your rant about survivor bias is pretty interesting and it relates to psychological studies done on the effects of luck. People who are very lucky develop a very similar mindset to those who were born to privilege. They forgot that others don't have the same resources or chances, and start thinking that either there's something wrong with other people or they're just better.

They got the lucky break because they deserved it and not others. Luck can erode empathy.

Someone online made an analogy using Joy from Inside-Out about this. She's very peppy and happy to share her cheer with others, but she just basically bullies Sadness. It's not out of malice, she just doesn't have the empathy to understand what it's like to not be lucky or constantly happy. Her "life" was too charmed that it blots out other's misfortune.

It can even show up in minor ways. Finding a quarter on the floor can lead to people thinking there is a higher chance an attractive individual is flirting with them minutes later.

This effect is magnified in the individuals who are at the far extreme of the bell curve in being lucky.
