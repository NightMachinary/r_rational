Haha thanks. You're the guy who wrote the long post on RR, right? I liked that comment.

Honestly though, that was actually something I considered from the start, since I had just finished reading Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirits for Uni when I began Salvos, and Hegel makes language/communication out to be an important tool against alienation and attaining recognition. The only problem is I'm a pantster, so sometimes I write things that is probably better saved for a later payoff time, which I'm glad you pointed out.
