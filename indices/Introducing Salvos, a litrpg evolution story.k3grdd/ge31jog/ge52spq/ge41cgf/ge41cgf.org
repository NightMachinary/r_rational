I've been reading Salvos for awhile, and I will say that it's quite well written and the story is interesting. It is interesting watching the MC essentially build themselves up from nothing, and figuring out who - and what - she is and how she fits into the world.

About the survivor bias: I definitely agree here. The story does a pretty good job of showing that those who survive manage largely though luck. Everyone we see is born equal, and they only manage to grow at the expense of others they start out with equal stats, and kill others to gain XP. Sometimes fights are won either because the one side is smarter or opponent is weaker, sometimes it's because it's just a bad match-up.

  Especially since she starts off with no language. The ability to communicate is one of the most important aspects of recognition, after all.

You really took that to heart. Not that I disagree.
