I read your story after seeing this post but I'm not sure if I plan to continue.

In the latest chapter(8) Salvos was able to kill a demon a whole evolution level above her without any advanced preparation. Her winning strategy doesn't use any of her established Skills. And it requires her in an Agility vs Agility contest against a higher level Agility focused opponent (the hell hound's only skill is a speed boost, it's Agility focused). And she scores a critical win despite needing to perform an insanely complicated aerial manoeuvrer with no actual abilities to maneuver in the air against an opponent who only needs to step to the side.

Meanwhile the hellhound makes every possible mistake. It mostly ignores the DPS to focus on the tank, despite the tank not having any Skills to draw aggro and Salvos repeatedly attacking it. It seems to have only one Skill despite the protagonist having two a whole evolution level earlier. It charged straight into the spear despite the fact it logically could see it (dogs are taller than larvae: Salvos' limbs are described as "nubby protrusions" while the hellhound has proper legs. Also Salvos is short enough to fit underneath the spear). Then when the spear is falling it chooses to growl rather than take a step to the side and dodge it.

This doesn't feel like aspiring rationalism or a plausible rpg mechanic, it feels like plot armour where regardless of established numbers the protagonist will always scrape out a way to win.
