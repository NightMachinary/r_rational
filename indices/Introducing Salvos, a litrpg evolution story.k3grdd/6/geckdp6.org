Pretty good so far. I think the blurb about survivorship bias is pretty useful context; without it I would have interpreted a lot of the story in a different light. But, if you do plan to explore those themes more explicitly in the future, then that might arguably be a good thing in that it allows it to be a 'twist' of sorts.
