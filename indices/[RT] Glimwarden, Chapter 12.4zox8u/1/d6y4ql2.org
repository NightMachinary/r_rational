(Mild Puella Magi Madoka Magica spoilers, probably not enough for a tag)

Crack hypothesis: the world of Glimwarden is the nth incarnation of the PMMMverse. The seeming Big Bad is in truth Akemi Homura, who hunts darklings with her time stopping powers and collects grief seeds, seeking to prevent Melanie from making a contract (also known as a /bind/ing agreement) in exchange for magical girl powers, as well as defeating a seemingly invincible monster that regularly attacks civilizations. And only Homura knows a dark secret about the nature and origin of their magic.

Starring: Merry as Mami, a veteran magical girl with tons of guns. Sanders is Sayaka, the main character's best friend. Chloe is Kyouko, a mysterious magical girl from out of town who likes food. And Philip is Alexander Wales' self insert.

Thoughts? Prizes for figuring out Wales' game before the big reveal?

Edit: full name in minor spoilers tag
