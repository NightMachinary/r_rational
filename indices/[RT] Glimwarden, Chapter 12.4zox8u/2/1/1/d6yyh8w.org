Agreed, he's almost certainly a bad guy. That paragraph just felt like I was being hit over the head with it. I don't mind her having a bad feeling, or thinking he's up to no good, I just found it a bit too repetitive. To have that strong a feeling about someone you've barely met is pretty rare. Unless it's intentional for emphasis to set up a twist and he's actually good.
