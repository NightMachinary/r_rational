Not just observing from across the crowd, she heard his speech. I had "danger: fanatic" warning flashing since the first sentence of it. I mean, nominally he advocates tolerance, but from the tone it's quite clear that he doesn't /really/ mean it. He appears either a fanatic with enough reason to bear with heretics while he needs them (despising them all the same), or a cynical type of priest who doesn't believe his own religion and just uses it to gain power.
