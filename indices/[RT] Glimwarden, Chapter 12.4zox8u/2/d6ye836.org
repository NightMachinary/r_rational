Good chapter. Definitely intrigued by the Dark Warden. Dim Warden? Dimwarden.

Sander's description of his powers can probably stand to be cut down and made more simple/obvious. Maybe a very brief example with simple numbers would help.

Also, Melanie's reaction to seeing Farrell was a bit too "telly."

  Melanie could tell that there was something *dangerous* about Farrell though, an *unpleasant* intensity that was looking for a target. He was, to all appearances, their leader. The truth was, there were too many things happening in Light's Hollow, and they were happening all at once. A lantern failure, an influx of immigrants, talk of expansion, and all of the usual things that always went on. The town had troubles in the past, but they came one at a time, which allowed for time to adjust and recover. She couldn't shake the *terrible* feeling that *something bad* was going to come of all of this.

Maybe it's just me, but I think one of those would have been sufficient to get the point across, whereas all four made her feel a bit too intuitive, or Farrell a bit too obviously evil, for someone she was just observing from across a crowd. Unless this is all meant to be setup for a twist and he's not actually evil at all, forshadowed by the misunderstood Lucian.
