With the flying he had both a completely empty space where he could go at high speed without the risk of crashing into something, plus the knowledge that gravity would slow him down and pull him back down, at which point he just had to teleport slightly up to counter his falling momentum and repeat until he was back on the ground.

I imagine in a crowded town, even a series of shorter teleports in the direction he wanted might have ended with him bumping at high speed into someone or something. Plus, we don't know if several short teleports cost more bind then one long covering the same distance (my guess would be yes).

I suppose he could have teleported up, then sideways toward his destination (but not completely there), then fallen in small chunks of parabolic arcs, teleporting up and in the opposite direction in such a way to kill his horizontal momentum at the right spot, then return to the ground like he did with the flying trick before, but the math necessary to get to the right spot and not kill both himself and Melanie might have been to much even for him, not to mention the question I pointed above on whether he would have enough bind to do all that.
