When Sander teleports, does he arrive facing in the direction of his travel, or the direction he was facing when he teleports? Presumably it's the former, since arriving at the speed of a full sprint while facing backwards would cause him to fall, and he only slightly stumbled (with Melanie on his back no less). So if the teleportation turns his body to face the direction of travel, does this add rotational velocity to him and could he use this in his sword fighting? It would be useful at close or long range to add power to his swings.
