Velocity equals distance divided by time. Sander's power allows him to choose his end point (which, along with his current position, determines the distance and direction) and how long it is going to take for him to appear there (the time). Divide distance by time and you've got his velocity upon arrival, plus the direction as if he had run in a straight line towards his destination.

Since he wanted to cross a lot of space in a short time, but also did not want to die from arriving at his destination so fast that he splatters against a wall, he had to figure a way around that.

What he figured, is that the velocity he gains in his teleportation is added to his current one. So, by running in the opposite direction, the velocity he gained was subtracted from that of his running, so he arrived at a more survivable speed at his destination.
