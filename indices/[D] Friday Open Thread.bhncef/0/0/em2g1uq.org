Yes. Absolutely yes. The only downside is some medications might not work as well as others for you. I went to a psychiatrist and they had me take a gene survey (swab my cheek, send it in). Results came in and the medicine I was put on worked far better than anything Ive ever been on. It even helped alleviate my clinical depression.

Going from no medication to medication was like waking up to magical powers.
