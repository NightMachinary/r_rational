Thank you for elaborating.

  Why do you think the thieves would loudly knock in the middle of the night, and then run off when I don't answer the door quickly enough?

An alternate explanation: They were heading to a party and realized they'd gone to the wrong place. I'm not saying that is it, though, because...

  The guy I thought it was had a very solid alibi for that time, he was with his girlfriend, but the other guy was the same in both incidents.
#+end_quote

This made me realize I'm missing most of the information about what happened, and I'm probably misunderstanding some things. I don't know who was the same in both incidents--the two who look like each other? Hmm.

  He was pretty pissed off about that
#+end_quote

It could be that he and his friends are trying to terrorize you as opposed to stealing anything. I really don't know. I'm glad you've talked to the authorities--they are in a better position to help with the incident itself. In fact, perhaps we should return to the original questions.

  How much probability mass should I assign to unknown unknowns?

  How do I reason about things when enemy action might be trying to hide the truth?
#+end_quote

Humans have a tendency to see intent where there is none, and to underestimate the number of explanations they haven't considered. A recent example at work: a typically-angry, vocally dissatisfied coworker from a different division stopped joining my group for lunch. We were unable to get a hold of him for a few days. Our coworkers thought he might have quit suddenly, or that one of us had somehow offended him.

Turns out he broke his ankle and naturally took a few days off.

The point is, it had nothing to do with us, or with his work--and if someone behaves strangely, it usually has nothing to do with most of the people who know them.

But! In this case it sounds like there is a lot of information that we are missing. "Some random person on the internet says it's probably nothing" isn't safe reasoning. "I probably overestimate the level of intent behind events, and how relevant they are to me" is more reasonable, but still: you definitely know better than we do.

I wish I could help more.
