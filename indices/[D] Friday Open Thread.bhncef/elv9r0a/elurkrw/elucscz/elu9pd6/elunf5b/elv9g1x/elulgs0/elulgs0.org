That's unfortunate. Also hard to reason about.

  How do I reason about things when enemy action might be trying to hide the truth?

I put myself in their shoes. I have to ask: is "Convincing a guy who looks like me to attempt to steal from the same place" really a good way to remove suspicion? I'd be worried about the second guy being caught and blabbing that I had informed him--or being mistaken for me!

Also, if the goal is to make you think random burglars are likely to attempt your house, a person who looks completely different is a better choice.

How many times has someone tried to break in, since you've gotten the camera? Maybe the background rate is about this high, but if isn't, then the timing is suspicious.

What information are you supposing they have to convince them to break in? Is whatever you have really that valuable or likely known by random strangers?

The fact that they are on camera should be a deterrent. Do you think the potential thieves know that and are attempting anyway?

Probably a lot.
