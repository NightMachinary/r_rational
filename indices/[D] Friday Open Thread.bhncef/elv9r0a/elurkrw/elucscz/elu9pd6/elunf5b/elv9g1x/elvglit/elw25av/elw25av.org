  The guy I thought it was had a very solid alibi for that time, he was with his girlfriend, but the other guy was the same in both incidents.

I have no idea how he and his girlfriend are getting along, but there's a possibility that she's helping him by fabricating an alibi and you just said how you didn't want to talk to her as well. So there's a chance that you are also on poor terms with her if she's upset with you about accusing her boyfriend of being involved in rape when it wasn't proven. Or he's convincing her that you are scum considering how much he must dislike you.

Just pointing out it might be two enemies, not just the one.

Anyway it sounds like you are keeping alert and cautious. Good luck!
