Some people tried to rob me, and I was pretty sure I knew who it was. I looked at the list of people who would have had the knowledge to try, and it was pretty small. I told the guy's girlfriend and gave her a copy of the security footage, and she confronted him about it. About a week later someone tried to break into my apartment again, this time they're not covering their face at all and they're using a different vehicle. That time I got a pretty good look at one of their faces, and while he had the correct build as the guy I thought it was, it clearly wasn't him. I'm not convinced it was the same person both times.

I'm having some trouble with a few points.

- How much probability mass should I assign to unknown unknowns? Just some guy overheard in a bar that I might have something worth stealing? Things like that.

- How do I reason about things when enemy action might be trying to hide the truth? I'm not convinced the guy who covered his face and the other guy are the same person.

Regardless there's enough suspicion that I don't want any of them involved in my life, but it's presented some more concrete epistemological problems.
