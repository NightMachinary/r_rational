I had a somewhat similar problem for about half a year, renting an apartment which turned out to be near a temporary construction site.

My local-optima solution was to put on earplugs immediately when the workers woke me up (~5 AM). I think this is relevant to your case because after some time (several months), getting back to sleep became almost immediate (or at least felt that way), whereas initially I might suffer trying to get back to sleep for ~45 mins.

I also tried the nuclear approach of sleeping the entire night every night with earplugs, which is not great, but if needs be, maybe try Mack's Slim Fit Earplugs.
