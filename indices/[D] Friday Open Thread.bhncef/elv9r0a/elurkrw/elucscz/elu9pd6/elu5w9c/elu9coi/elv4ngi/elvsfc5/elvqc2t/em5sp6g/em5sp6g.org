Others have made good suggestions. Personally I'd just sleep with good earplugs. (Proper insertion is not obvious; watch some youtube videos, and try many different brands.)

Here's one alternative. If you manage not to get frustrated/irritated when the noise happens, your body will stop associating the noise with danger. Over time (months, unfortunately) you will stop waking up due to the noise.
