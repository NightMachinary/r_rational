  My local-optima solution was to put on earplugs immediately when the workers woke me up (~5 AM). I think this is relevant to your case because after some time (several months), getting back to sleep became almost immediate (or at least felt that way), whereas initially I might suffer trying to get back to sleep for ~45 mins.

Sadly or happily depending on your interpretation, I've gotten to this point as well. But from what I've read, even microsleep interruptions are considered bad, and just waking up for that short period of time still has a noticeable effect on me from what I can tell. Ideally I'd like to prevent the interruption in the first place.

If Abpraestigio's suggestion of blocking the window doesn't work, I may try those slim fit earplugs though, might be better than what I use now. Thanks!
