So for the last several months, I've been woken up by my neighbor's opening their door in the morning between 4-6AM / turning on their truck due to their driveway being maybe 10 feet from my bedroom window (duplex). I've spoken to them about it, used white noise machines and a fan, and occasionally used earplugs (which are decent but don't seem to be good to use on a regular basis), but the issue hasn't gotten any better. I think the wall insulation is just very poor and I can't turn up the white noise to block the sound sufficiently without my ears hurting when I wake up.

I feel like I'm missing something obvious and slight sleep deprivation is driving me crazy; any advice appreciated. Anyone had to deal with something similar?
