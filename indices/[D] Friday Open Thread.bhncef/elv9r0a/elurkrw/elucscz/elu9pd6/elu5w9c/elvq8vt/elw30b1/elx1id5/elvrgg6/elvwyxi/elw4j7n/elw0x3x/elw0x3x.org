Ah right, I was just confused because they weren't too clear on what type of time travel this universe subscribed to in the beginning, imo. I guess it never occurred to me that it was the alternate time lines because that means they just completely messed with the new Gamora's timeline, causing Guardians of the Galaxy to not exist as we know it for that specific timeline. It makes sense theoretically, but not satisfying to me personally storywise.
