I'm interested in reading /Mother of Learning/ but I'm wary of starting something that hasn't been completed yet. Without spoilers, can someone tell me when can we roughly expect the story to end? Any speculation is welcome.

In addition, is the story one continuous one (e.g. HPMOR) or is it divided into individual (e.g. One Piece, Dragonball)?
