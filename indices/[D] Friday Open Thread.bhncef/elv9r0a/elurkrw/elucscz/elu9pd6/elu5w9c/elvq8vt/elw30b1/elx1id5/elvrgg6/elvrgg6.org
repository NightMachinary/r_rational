THIS IS A COMMENT ABOUT THE NEW AVENGERS MOVIE. DO NOT CLICK UNLESS YOU HAVE SEEN THE MOVIE OR DO NOT MIND BEING SPOILED.

Although I realize that blockbuster movies are not really known for continuity, in general Marvel movies have been pretty good about keeping their stories free of glaring plot holes. Which made it extremely disappointing to see the film that ended an era filled with such a large one. There may be more, but the one that is preventing me from properly enjoying the movie is the fact that despite them saying/following through with "Do not mess with the past timeline, it will screw up the future" to the point of giving back the infinity stones, they still majorly messed with the timeline. Gamora is no longer in the past, which means that she can't possibly be there for Guardians of the Galaxy and after. Same with the fact that Thanos and his army had been "snapped", meaning there can't be an Infinity War. Nebula had been killed, which means she should no longer exist. Unless somebody else can explain, please do
