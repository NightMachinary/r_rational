I will not try to explain my politics in detail, however, I will outline them.

I am a social liberal and a fiscal conservative. The closest 'mainstream' political description that approaches my beliefs is Libertarian, and even that is not quite right, because Libertarians are frequently anarchists and isolationists hiding behind a fa√ßade of Capitalism.

I believe that, one day, we might eventually have appropriate technologies to allow us to create a post-need society. However, until we have non-AI machines capable of providing Maslow's basic physiological needs (Food, water, warmth, and rest) we cannot even *begin* to start down that path.

As for why I am active on T_D, it is simple. I am horrified by the direction and modus operandi of modern 'liberal' leftism. While I frequently find myself wanting to wash my hands after dealing with some of the more distasteful T_D characters, I believe in the freedoms outlined in the US Constitution and it's amendments.

*As a general rule...*

Any group who attempts to use censorship, threats of violence, or political correctness to control political narratives is my political enemy.

Anyone who attempts to establish large-scale Socialism before we can provide basic needs for all, utilizing non-sapient labor, is my political enemy, because it simply will not work until no sapient has to do the dirty work unless they /want/ to.

Anyone who attempts to establish a Globalist world without borders is my political enemy. The larger a political entity is, the more difficult it is to change, and the harder it is to root out corruption. Power does corrupt.

*TLDR*

I want many of the same things that many on the left want. I just want to approach the goals rationally, and the modern far left is VERY far from rational.
