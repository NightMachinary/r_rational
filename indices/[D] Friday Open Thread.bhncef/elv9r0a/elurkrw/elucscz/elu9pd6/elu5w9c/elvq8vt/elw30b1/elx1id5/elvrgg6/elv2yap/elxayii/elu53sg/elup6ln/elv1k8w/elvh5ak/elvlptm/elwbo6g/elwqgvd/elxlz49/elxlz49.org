Fair enough, I didn't read the original draft so you have context I don't have. In the current state of the text though, it doesn't at all seem like a "This is the world the liberals want to make" style of government. If anything, I'd argue that it's extreme conservatism taken to a totalitarian extent, and it seems odd to have the big bad of the story be your own belief system taken too far.

But then again, I read it fairly casually and have a poor memory on top of that, so it's entirely possible there was a lot more in there that I either didn't fully comprehend at the time, or have forgotten.

I'm more of a Death of the Author kind of person as well, so I feel that the author's statements outside of the text have no bearing on the content of the text itself.
