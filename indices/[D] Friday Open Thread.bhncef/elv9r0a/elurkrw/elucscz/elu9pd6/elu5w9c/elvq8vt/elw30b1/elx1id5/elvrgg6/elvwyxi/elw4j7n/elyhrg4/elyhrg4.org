I don't think all the alternate realities could have merged together, since Alternate!Thanos came to the main reality and died there. Perhaps alternate realities are only created when a contradiction cannot be avoided or smoothed over by quantum effects. In that case, acts that don't cause contradictions just merge together into one self-consistent timeline. So the New York timeline got split off because Loki disappeared, and another timeline got created because Thanos and Gamora disappeared from it, but the 1950s timeline could have stayed consistent with the main timeline after Captain America returned the stone there; then he just stayed and kept a low profile until the right time.
