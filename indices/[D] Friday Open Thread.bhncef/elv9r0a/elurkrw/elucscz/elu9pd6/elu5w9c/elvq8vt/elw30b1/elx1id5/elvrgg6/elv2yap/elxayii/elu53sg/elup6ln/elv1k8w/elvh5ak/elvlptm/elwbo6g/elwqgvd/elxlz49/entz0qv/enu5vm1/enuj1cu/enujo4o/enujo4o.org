What is this story analogous to in this case? Climate change? If so I have to say that it's flawed. Doing nothing isn't looking for a safer way to get down the cliff. It would look like we're already falling, and the liberals are saying we need to cling to the side even if we hurt our hands because otherwise the fall will kill us, while the conservatives are saying that we're falling and we haven't died yet, so hitting the bottom can't possibly be that bad.
