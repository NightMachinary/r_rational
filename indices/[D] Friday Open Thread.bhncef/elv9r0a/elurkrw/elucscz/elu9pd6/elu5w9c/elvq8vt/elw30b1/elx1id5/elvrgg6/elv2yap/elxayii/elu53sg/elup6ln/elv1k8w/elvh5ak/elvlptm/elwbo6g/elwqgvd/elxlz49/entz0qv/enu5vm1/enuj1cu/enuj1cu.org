The moderate conservative right is no worse than the moderate liberal left. In a very broad and sweeping statement with many exceptions, you can generalize the two by saying that the right generally resists change. The left generally seeks change.

Right now, many of the larger changes that the left are seeking are, IMHO, irrational and, frankly, unsafe.

In the past, I have aligned strongly with the left because I agreed with what they wanted to change. Now I have to stand with the right because the changes that the left wants are not rational at this time.

Imagine this scenario:

Two people are walking along a twenty-foot sheer cliff next to the shore of a lake. They are both very thirsty, and have no water.

The conservative wants to stay on the cliff until they can find a safe path down. The liberal wants to jump off the cliff.

The conservative makes the argument that they need to look for a safer place to get down the cliff - they can jump later, if there is no other way.

The liberal makes the argument that if they wait, they may be weak and disoriented by dehydration, and less likely to survive the fall - jumping later means a greater chance of injury.

They are both right, but it's not black and white. Currently, I stand beside the conservative, moderate right, because I think we should spend a bit more time looking for a safer way before jumping off any cliffs.
