  *What's your optimistic vision for the future? We want to know.*

  In honor of Earth Day and the future of the planet, The Future of Life Institute is co-sponsoring a [[http://futureoflifeinstitute.acemlnb.com/lt.php?s=666437b73e0e0dba690d8ac12efdd365&i=230A474A1A27553][short fiction writing contest]] with Sapiens Plurum. We love the Handmaid's Tale and Black Mirror as much as anyone, but we think the world needs more [[http://futureoflifeinstitute.acemlnb.com/lt.php?s=666437b73e0e0dba690d8ac12efdd365&i=230A474A1A27554][utopian fiction]] right now. So we're asking you to write down your vision for the future and share it with us.

  *First Place: $1000 | Second Place: $500 | Third Place $300*

  Each of us contributes to the future, through our work, our creations, our children, even our DNA.Imagine a being or entity that exists in the future because of your existence on Earth today. Is this entity your descendant in a traditional sense? Have beings evolved? Is your "descendant" still biological? Is your "descendant" a grandchild or a clone? Have we merged with technology or uploaded DNA to create new cyber-beings? Is your "descendant" something completely different?

  Things to consider as you write your story: Let the reader see this future world through your eyes. Let us see how people --- whatever that means --- try to live in harmony with the natural world and society, how they maintain their own health and happiness, how they overcome challenges.  But most of all, tell a good story, with characters we care about, setting, conflict, and resolution.

  Your story should be consonant with the Future of Life Institute mission: /Technology is giving life the potential to flourish like never before, or to self-destruct. Let's make a difference;/ and with theSapiens Plurum mission: /to inspire us --- the first species that can intentionally impact its own evolution --- to aspire beyond what was humanly possible/.

  *Submissions due by June 9th, 2019 | No entry fee*
