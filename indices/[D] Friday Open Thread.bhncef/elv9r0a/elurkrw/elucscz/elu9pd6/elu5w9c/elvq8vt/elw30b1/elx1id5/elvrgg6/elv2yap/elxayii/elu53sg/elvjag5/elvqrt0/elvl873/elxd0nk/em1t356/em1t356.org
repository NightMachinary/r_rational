AO3 is better, but fanfiction.net has a larger audience, has been my experience. If you want it up for accessibility reasons, AO3 is the way to go. If you want as many people as possible to see/read your stuff, put it on both. If you make a website for yourself, it will be much more work for not much more reward than just putting it on AO3, and you won't have much traffic most likely.
