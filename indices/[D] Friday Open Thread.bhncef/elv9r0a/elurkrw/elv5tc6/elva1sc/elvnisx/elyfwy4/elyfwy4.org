I'm sorry.

I haven't spoken to the last person who I considered a friend in about two-and-a-half years, so no trip sitter. But once I hit a certain threshold, I just get in bed and disengage, I don't try to do things. I don't think of psychedelics as being recreational, my use of them is strictly shamanistic. Just me, my bed, my headphones, and the universe. I've done stuff like this off and on for over a decade, and I'm as careful as one can be when messing with this sort of thing.

I /am/ going to edit my original post to include a disclaimer. I remember a year or two ago having a conversation with someone on this subreddit about future goals and it came to light that they were in highschool, so there's no telling who might see what I've written and think "oh wow that sounds wild, I wanna try that stuff." I'm going to go edit it right now.
