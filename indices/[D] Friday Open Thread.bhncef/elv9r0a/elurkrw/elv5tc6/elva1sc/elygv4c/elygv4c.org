Well, I'm not as rigid as what I'm about to lay out, but let's throw out some dates.

March 13th. March 27th. April 10th. April 24th.

Those dates are all exactly two weeks apart. I did the last one on the 23rd, but like I said, I haven't been rigidly keeping to a schedule. And I'd say once every 10 days is probably as frequently as you can possibly do it /safely/. I'm sure it'd work more frequently than that, but it's /rough/ on your insides.

And I'm as careful as one can be when messing with this sort of stuff.
