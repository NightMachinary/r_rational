So recently my counselor recommended I get tested for ADHD. Now up until that point my understanding of ADHD was pretty limited and I only knew the "common knowledge" of it. Upon doing more research on ADHD I was surprised because it was a lot different then I imagined it to be. I had this idea that it mostly just made it harder to pay attention, and made you really hyper. But really these are just some of the most visible symptoms of a larger problem, that being the part of your brain that self regulates develops slower than normal, which impairs various executive functions.

Executive functions affected by ADHD include: 1. Self-awareness 2. Inhibition 3. Non-Verbal Working Memory 4. Verbal Working Memory 5. Emotional Self-Regulation 6. Self-motivation 7. Planning and Problem Solving

This hurts your ability to focus on long term goals, and means people with ADHD have a hard time focusing on things that don't have immediate consequences. I started to see patterns of this in my own life and how I often put things off to the last minute and only worked my best when I was regularly held accountable. I regularly started and switched projects, I have more than one story I started writing for fun that never went anywhere. So I am curious if medication and potentially different strategies would make me a lot more productive. I was already going through life developing strategies for coping with my own attention/motivation issues, but if it is ADHD then having a better understanding could potentially make it easier to develop these strategies in the future.

I highly recommend any person who is currently in college if they are having issues to take advantage of free counseling services if your college provides it. You are already paying for it in your tuition so you might as well take advantage. If I do have ADHD I probably would have never found out if I didn't go.
