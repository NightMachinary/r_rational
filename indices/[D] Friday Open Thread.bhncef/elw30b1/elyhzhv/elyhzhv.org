I've used noopept and phenylpiracetam and adrafinil and phenylethylamine and phenibut. And Alpha GPC, I guess that counts too.

I regret the phenylethylamine and the phenibut. The adrafinil was a long time ago, like 2013, but I remember not liking the way it made me feel and throwing it away.

I /feel like/ the noopept was useful (in the context of creative writing) but that could just be placebo.

Phenylpiracetam is /legit/. It's the only nootropic banned for use by athletes, because it's proven to /actually do something/ (and it doesn't eff you up like PEA or phenibut). Like, I take it only on days I work out. The effect is most noticeable with pull-ups. I started a few months ago at one set of three reps and two sets of two reps. I've progressed that up to four sets of five reps, contingent on phenylpiracetam being in my system. When it's not, I can only do five reps on the first set, and the following three sets I can only manage four reps per set.

OH AND CREATINE. Creatine is considered a nootropic by a lot of people. I think everyone should take creatine.
