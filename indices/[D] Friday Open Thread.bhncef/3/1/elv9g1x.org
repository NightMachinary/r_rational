Some stuff comes immediately to mind:

- Most important! Change the screws on your lock. The screws that you can see in your lockset door strike plate are often just half an inch long and can be broken off by one kick to the door in the right spot. Replacing the screws with ones that are 3 to 4 inches long make it much harder to break in. This [[https://www.familyhandyman.com/home-security/how-to-reinforce-doors-entry-door-and-lock-reinforcements/][article]] goes much more indepth, but if you don't want to or can't do everything on it, step 4 on drilling in deeper holes and changing the screws is very simple to do.
- How well known is all of this to neighbors? Maybe one heard about important things about you have and spotted an opportunity?
- Maybe you should talk to your neighbors just to see if they saw or know anything useful?
- How well are things going with the guy and his girlfriend? If their relationship has deteriorated, then that's a sign that he might have decided to get some revenge. If they had made up before the second attempt, then I would say that he'd be less likely to try anything out of a desire for revenge. Not to say that he couldn't have done it anyway in both cases, but if they made up, the odds should drop since he has more to lose.
- Do you know this guy well enough to say that he has a vindictive personality, sociopathic, or narcissistic one? Does he have a history of anything? If he does, then it's a warning sign for you and the girlfriend.
- Ask about attempted or successful thefts in your area. If the stranger has tried to steal from you both times instead of being someone else to make the guy you know look innocent, then the stranger will have attempted to steal from other people and not just you. If he was just to help the other guy escape from suspicion, then no reported crimes should be suspicious. To find this out, you could ask the police about crimes in the area. This is where Bayes Rule would be helpful on how much the probabilities should shift, but I don't know how to apply it to this situation.
