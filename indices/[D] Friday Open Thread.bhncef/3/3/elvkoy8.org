Ok, so you have your prior for:

1. Guy tries to cover up robbery by getting someone else to show their face: pretty low

2. Guy (or same group) tries to rob same place again: low-ish

3. Someone unrelated tries to rob the same place again: very low in that time frame

Then you get evidence - 'guy shows up trying to rob my place again' This increases the posterior for all 1. 2. and 3. but since 2. and 3 are significantly more likely a priori (for me) it will still be the leading hypothesis (with 1. having way higher chance to be true than before of course but still lower than 2.)

Throwing out some numbers based on my vague feelings for the priors - I'd put something around 20% on it being a cover-up by the same guy and at least 75% on it being the same guy/group as before.

Don't pay attention to the numbers but this would be the way I'd start thinking about it.
