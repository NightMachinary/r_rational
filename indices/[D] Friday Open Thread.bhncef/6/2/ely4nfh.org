I've used some but never did any kind of tests or blinding on myself so can only comment on my subjective experience. If you check out gwern's stuff though you'll find some cool self testing you can do, he's often done self blinding and there are other self blinding methodologies that have I've seen recently (e.g. from the Imperial miceodosing study)

I regularly take Vitamin d, B12 and creatine and feel like they positively affect my energy levels and mood. I eat a plant based diet so the B12 and creatine probably have a more pronounced effect on me than someone who eats meat and dairy.

I sometimes have l-theanine with coffee which for me very noticeably reduces the feelings of overstimulation or jitteriness I sometimes feel (I don't drink coffee everyday so my tolerance to caffeine isn't too high).

I've used melatonin at a dose of 0.3mg, it felt like it helped me sleep better, more regularly and feel more rested in the morning.

I've microdosed. I like how I feel when I do but I don't feel like it makes me more productive. I tend to take somewhere between 5-20 micrograms depending on the effect I'm going for and energy levels.

I've tried modafinil during the day, felt like it did make me more productive and focused. Like coffee but more. I rarely take it though. When I do, around 37-75mg of armodafinil (which is around 1/4-1/2 of the tablet).

I sometimes take zinc, and use magnesium oil. Can't say I've noticed an effect but I just take them because I might not be getting enough from diet.

B6 sometimes gives me more vivid dreams but might be leaving nootropic territory.
