Somewhat random question: does anyone here use nootropics like the folks on [[/r/nootropics][r/nootropics]]? If so, what's it like and do you have any regrets or mistakes you'd like to share?

EDIT: The reason why I ask is because while I was poking around in there as a lurker, I feel like it's not too reliable. I mean the resources in the wiki are excellent, but it feels like people there are biased somehow...like they are cherry-picking from research papers or some issues like that?
