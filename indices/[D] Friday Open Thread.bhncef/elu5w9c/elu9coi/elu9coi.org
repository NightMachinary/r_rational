Well, the most obvious and effective approach I can think of would be to sleep in a different room, though I have no idea how feasible that is in your case.

​

Alternatively you could just go to bed earlier, so that you're already awake or don't lose as much sleep when your neighbor wakes you up.

​

The next most obvious would be to move your bed so that your head is at the point furthest away from the window when you're lying in it.

​

Next step would be to block off the window with something that absorbs or at least muffles sound, be it blankets, pillows or foam. In my (limited) experience it's the windows that are the weak-points when it comes to noise. Try it for a night or two to see whether it helps, and if it does you can rig something up so that you can still use the window during the day.

​

If that still doesn't help you could get some hearing protection ear-muffs. The cheapest ones cost less than 20 bucks on Amazon, so you're not out all that much to find out whether you can sleep with them on.

​

That's about it for obvious ideas on my part, not counting spending loads of money to sound-proof your flat.
