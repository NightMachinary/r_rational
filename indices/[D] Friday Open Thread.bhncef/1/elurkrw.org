So. Easter has come and gone at this point.

I remember saying back around Christmas or New Years that the Mary Poppins story I'm working on might be finished by Easter. I don't think I've given any sort of update on it in a long while, so this is just me confirming that it isn't abandoned.

I've recently been, um, "working with a new writing partner." Her name is Glory. You know, Glory? Lucy's little sister?

/Alright fine, I bought half a pound of Morning Glory seeds off Amazon./

*[EDIT: DISCLAIMER:* I'm going to turn 30 in about a month, and I've been experimenting with my own neurochemistry since I was 18. Drugs are not toys. If you don't have the maturity to treat them with respect then they will fudge your entire world. Do *not* run out and buy Morning Glory seeds based on this reddit comment.]

It's pretty much impossible to get anything meaningful accomplished while under the influence of LSA, and the nausea during the come-up is a bit uncomfortable, and the /other stuff/ the next day isn't ideal, but I feel like it's /useful/.

The last time I did it (Tuesday) I ended up having a weird "ego-death" type experience where I felt myself as a part of the "snake god" who Is the version of our reality that I was occupying at the time of the experience, and "I" felt the twisting of the shape of space / "I" /was/ the twisting of the shape of space, the line between "me" and "the snake" was nonexistent. I could see it (the shape of space) in my mind's eye (which I don't normally have easy access to), it was like made out of a curved infinity symbol, except instead of connecting in the middle it continued on to another infinity symbol layered on top of it... idk, the end result was like a writhing sphere. It felt profound at the time.

When I woke up the next day, I spent several hours reading through Wikipedia about the history of sanitation and waste management and plumbing, as you do. Here's a few articles that stood out in my mind:

It's hard to believe how unsanitary life was for the vast majority of all the humans who ever lived, all the way up to the last couple hundred years. No wonder most people used to die in their thirties.

Anyways, you can't do Morning Glories too often because you'll build up a tolerance and no longer experience the same effects, and it's relatively hard on your digestive tract (plants evolved these chemicals /specifically/ to discourage us animals from eating them), so I've only done it four times since mid-March, but I've definitely found the days following a trip to be especially good for writing. I feel like she's infusing the work with a particular flavor that just suits the content perfectly.

I actually had the thought to make /this comment which you are currently reading/ during the trip itself. I opened up my word processor and tried to write some things... It started out similarly to this comment, talking about the missed Easter deadline and such, then I started typing the stuff about Lucy's little sister Glory and became confused. Here's a quote from that document:

  Oh good. The white square with black squiggles on it now has, you won't understand even if I word it accurately so let's say, swirling rainbows all over it. Like it wasn't hard enough to type already.

Shortly thereafter, I laid down in bed and put on my headphones, and about an hour later (maybe?) is when all the weirdness with the snake god and the strange geometry happened.

Here's a few of the songs I was listening to while all that was happening:

All three of them are incredible, but if you're going to just sample one of them to sate your curiosity then choose the third one. I feel like that one in particular was the cause of a lot of the weird spiraling thought loops I experienced during the timeless ego-death being centered around, well, /death/, and it might've pushed me into a bad trip if it weren't so pretty. A bad trip could've been especially disturbing since I could feel my body... I don't really know how to describe that feeling; maybe, normally you feel like you're the mind occupying a body, and this sensation feels like you /are/ the body... idk.
