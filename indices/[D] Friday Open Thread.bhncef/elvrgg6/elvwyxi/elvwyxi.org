The film treats the past as an alternate reality. That solves all the problems you're talking about. Gamora died, then one came into the prime reality from an alternate reality past. Same for Thanos and Nebula, they're alternate reality versions. The one wrinkle in this is Captain America, though it's possible that he came back off-screen, rather than just taking the slow path.
