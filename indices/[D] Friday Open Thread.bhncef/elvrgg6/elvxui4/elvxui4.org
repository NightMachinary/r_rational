I agree with alexanderwales's comment. On top of that though, I'm wondering why they didn't just keep most of the stones. The time and mind stones are the only ones not used exclusively for evil purposes (except maybe the mind stone between 1970 and Avengers 1 for research purposes?), so I feel like the avengers should have simply kept the others. They seem /pretty/ useful.
