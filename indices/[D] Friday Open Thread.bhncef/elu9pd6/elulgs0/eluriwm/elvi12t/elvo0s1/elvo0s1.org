Yeah, I hear you. That's part of why I tried to keep the question to the bit where my epistemology struggles, it's a big complicated thing with a lot of small details that are important, and also sensitive and not really something I think would be appropriate to share on an account that's connected to my name, especially if the guy does happen to be innocent.

  They were heading to a party and realized they'd gone to the wrong place.

They taped the fire escape. There was a heavier set guy, who looks like the best friend of who I think it was, who was at both incidents. I only caught him on film the first time, the second time he had his accomplice go in so he could bypass all the cameras via the fire escape.

  It could be that he and his friends are trying to terrorize you as opposed to stealing anything.

They were definitely more afraid of me then I was of them near the end there, and they haven't tried since.

I am a little bit worried that I'm creating a just-so story, but the more I think about it the more certain I become. A lot of small details that only make sense if the person is in a particular mind set. The big thing is the difference in MO between the first and the last attempt. The heavy guy was there for both, but I wasn't supposed to know that, I just chased them down. I think that only makes sense if he knew that I'd caught them on camera.
