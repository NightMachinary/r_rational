  I put myself in their shoes. I have to ask: is "Convincing a guy who looks like me to attempt to steal from the same place" really a good way to remove suspicion?
#+end_quote

Probably, the guy came up to my door at 11:45pm on a sunday with his face plainly visible and knocked loudly. I don't know if he was planning on forcing me to open my safe at gunpoint or just trying to be seen. I said "I don't know this person, give me a second". Sometime between me saying that and me putting on pants he ran off, and I chased him down to his car. Why do you think the thieves would loudly knock in the middle of the night, and then run off when I don't answer the door quickly enough? They also jammed a fire escape so they could open it from the outside, something I discovered pretty quickly.

The guy I thought it was had a very solid alibi for that time, he was with his girlfriend, but the other guy was the same in both incidents.

The other guy was on the lobby camera for more than a half hour waiting for someone to let him in, which is also very strange considering their previous MO.

  How many times has someone tried to break in, since you've gotten the camera?
#+end_quote

It's a secure building, not my camera but on belonging to the apartment. They used a lock pick gun the first time. Only the two times, they seemed pretty scared the second time.

  What information are you supposing they have to convince them to break in?
#+end_quote

Well I wouldn't want to get into that on the internet. I haven't kept any valuables in the apartment in months, but I can definitely see why I'd have been a tempting target. Also I let his girlfriend know he was involved (to what extent I don't know) in a high profile rape case/internet-witch-hunt. He was pretty pissed off about that, but eventually calmed down.
