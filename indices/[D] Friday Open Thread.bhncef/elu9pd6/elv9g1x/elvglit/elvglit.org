That's a good list, I appreciate it.

The strike plate is pretty solid, and the first time they tried to use a pick gun, I've also taken some other precautions.

  How well known is all of this to neighbors?

The cops questioned them briefly, but it's a pretty quite place.

  How well are things going with the guy and his girlfriend?

I couldn't say, I'm not really interested in talking to either of them.

  Do you know this guy well enough to say that he has a vindictive personality

Well, his name came up a lot in the anonymous-led witch hunt for a high profile rape case, and there's some information I have that they didn't that makes me suspicious. He was pretty pissed at me when I told his girlfriend about that. Other then that I don't see any big warning signs aside from the standard young-drunk-instagram fuckboy thing he's got going on, which implies a certain level of narcissism. Doesn't have any pictures that don't include himself or expensive cars/watches. I personally think he's an asshole. Aside from the high-profile rape case I'm not seeing any particular history.

  Ask about attempted or successful thefts in your area.

There was one in a building near mine, I managed to get in touch with the guy. I'm of the opinion that they probably weren't related, the MO is pretty different. We don't have anything in common, no common contacts, but we were both specifically targeted.
