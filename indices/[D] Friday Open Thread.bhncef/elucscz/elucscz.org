Earlier this week FB reminded me of [[https://i.imgur.com/4KPIxKw.jpg][a poster]] I made for a homework assignment in an ecology class in college half a decade ago. My partner and I were busy that semester and dallied in making it until the night before it was due, when we worked on it and a few other projects until the wee hours of the morning, set it to print @ 4' x 6', and went out for pancakes -- which in turn made us late to the faux-conference we were meant to present this at. But the "poster session" went smoothly, our spiel accompanied by the GoT opening theme playing softly in the background.

Anyway, since this is the last season of the show (and it's unclear if the direwolves will return, perhaps due to nutritional stress ;]), I thought I might share. Sorry about the poor quality, the original file is who knows where, so this is the facebook version.
