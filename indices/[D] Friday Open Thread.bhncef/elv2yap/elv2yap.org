I'm flying to New York City soon... and recently decided that I prefer a more nature/hiking inclined vacation, so I'm looking for the best way to achieve this. Currently, I'm thinking about spending ~4 nights in the surrounding ~200 km area. I considered driving to the Niagara Falls, but it seems too difficult to be enjoyable (~15 hrs drive for the round-trip). Are there any worthwhile locations to visit? Or any other suggestion?

Thanks :)
