Pitch: reasonable, blue-collar dude from middle America finds out he has a symbiote that allows for practically unlimited self modification. Moderately creative uses and interesting, semi-hard (it's not Star Wars) sci-fi feel.

Anti-pitch: self modification isn't immediately taken to transhuman levels. Some irrational behavior, like planning to use his abilities to become a world famous martial artist who fights for a living. Plot goes all over the place. A lot of retconning previous events to add more drama. Power level scaling is... weird. The author tries to do it through plot but it doesn't always work out.
