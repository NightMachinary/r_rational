Scott has biases, and sometimes they lead to excessive leftist bashing (particularly in his older posts), but I think you're making a pretty classic mistake if you find that post to be full of bias: he's speaking descriptively, not prescriptively. Being able to accurately model how conservatives and reactionaries think doesn't make someone share their beliefs and biases, and he's actually very liberal if you read more of his posts.
