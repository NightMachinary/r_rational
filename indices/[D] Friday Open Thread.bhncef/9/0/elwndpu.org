How about Breakneck Ridge?

It's an awesome hike with incredible views, but be warned it's not for the faint of heart. You are essentially doing a lot of climbing up hence it's a very exhausting hike. I mean you don't need to know how to rock climb or anything, but there's a lot of bluffs. So only do this if you are decently athletic and like scrabbling up over rocks.

It's about an hour and half to drive from Manhattan to the hike.

Here's some decent articles to help: [[https://hikethehudsonvalley.com/hikes/breakneck-ridge/][one]], [[http://www.nycdayhiking.com/hikes/breaksugar.htm][two]]

If you do a google search, you'll hear that it's closing down or something similar. It's not. It just was closed temporarily to repair a fallen boulder on the trail and isn't shutting down for the year.
