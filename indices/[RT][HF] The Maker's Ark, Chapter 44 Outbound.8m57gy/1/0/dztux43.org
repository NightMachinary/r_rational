Imagine the flash as a teenage girl written by someone who does the math where the first real chapter is pure physics porn in a world where architypes justify some of the comic book tropes with the world recognized top tinker as her adopted father. It has a lot of comic book expies and a well thought out plot involving literal and effective demigods protecting humanity from Eldritch outsiders/God's and slice of life. It's a personal favorite.
