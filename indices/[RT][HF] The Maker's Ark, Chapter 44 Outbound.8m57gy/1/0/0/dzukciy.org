Thank you for the summary; A couple of notes: The Maker's Ark is the third novel in the series, The first two are The Fall of Doc Future and Skybreaker's Call. They are intended to have satisfying endings for each individual book, though a lot of background is revealed in each one, so I recommend starting with Fall.

I also wrote a short series of essays explaining what I was attempting to do with the setting; the first one is here: [[http://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/87548056861/behind-the-future-part-1-creating-a-superhero]]
