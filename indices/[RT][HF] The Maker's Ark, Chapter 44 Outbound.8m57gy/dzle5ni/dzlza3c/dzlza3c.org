I'm drawing a blank on which mythological flowers jorney-newsie (sorry along with mad-hatter I found his cap as a pun, now that he doesn't have to worry about people thinking he's too young because he's in with the hero's re-wrighting society and partners with one or more gods, hilarious) might have been stealing. Anyone have any guesses.
