Back, after too long a delay due to RL issues. I really wanted Outbound to be a single chapter, but when it hit 6k words and I wasn't close to done, I realized I needed to split it--and had to keep going for a while to make sure I split in the right place, and everything matched. Lots of subtle stuff for rational readers to ponder here.

One good thing about the split--the next chapter is already halfway written, so (crosses fingers) I might actually get it out on schedule.
