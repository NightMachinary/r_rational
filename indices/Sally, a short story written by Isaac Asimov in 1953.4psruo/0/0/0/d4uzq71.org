Watchbird solution: differentiate murder from state killings, differentiate people from non-people. Problems: things that look like murder but aren't /by some people's definitions/ such as abortion, execution, policing, self-defense; things that don't look like murder such as starvation, kidnap, bullying, economic actions...

Problem: people seem to want to kill.
