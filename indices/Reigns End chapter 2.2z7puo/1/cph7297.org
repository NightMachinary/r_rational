I'm going to second [[/u/JackStargazer]] in saying that you should find a beta -- the story itself is interesting, but the physical writing is rough...runon sentences, paragraphs that are too long, improper separation of dialogue, etc.

I will partially agree with him about Jake; your characterization of him feels just slightly different, but that's fine. The whole point of fanfiction is to explore different alternatives.

Your characterization of Orm as a mental recording and therefore flat is okay, but the logical extension of that is that he shouldn't be flexible -- specifically, him rotating through different settings in order to make Jake more comfortable shows a problem-solving ability that I would not have expected. I think you need to decide whether he is a recording or a true personality; in the former case he should /behave/ like a recording and in the latter he should be less emotionally flat.

In addition, you're burning more time on the conversation than necessary. Despite being told "hey, the Landguard is going to kill you soon", Jake seems to be futzing around a lot asking for burgers and such. Despite repeated assassination attempts, I would still expect this to get his attention.
