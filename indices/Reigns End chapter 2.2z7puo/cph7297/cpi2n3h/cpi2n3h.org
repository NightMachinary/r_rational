I am actually considering getting a beta reader but I honestly wouldn't know where to find one.

The construct Orm was created with the purpose of finding someone who can bring the original back to life should he fail to escape. Construct Orm was given sentience so he would be able to determine and take courses of actions that would have the least chances of him getting caught. The construct is actually quite similar to the Icefi assasins except mentally handicapped to a degree.

Jake appearing way more calm than he should have is due to Orm subtlely using a calming effect on his mind. I added the restaurant scene due have some exposition on Orm's abilties and past.
