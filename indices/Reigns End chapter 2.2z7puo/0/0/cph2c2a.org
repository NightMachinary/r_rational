Thank you for givng the time to review my story and the constructive critism.

The thing about Orm is that there are two versions of him the original and the construct. The construct is an incomplete mental copy of the original Orm with all of his memories and experiences. The construct is somewhat mentally handicapped due to some mistakes the original made when he copied his mind. Because of this he has trouble emoting, expressing himself and understanding people. That combined with him very rarely talking to people he tends to get straight to the point and avoids talking about things he doesn't think are relevant.

As for the landguard they probably go through a lot of mental gymnastics to justify some of their more unsavory actions. Hence if they think what they are doing is the right thing in their minds they aren't technically doing evil actions. This may be due to the allignment system not taking into account grey areas which some people have criticized about DND.
