  The thing is, Paladins can fall in two ways: Failing to follow their code or voluntarily commiting an evil act.

Well, I guess we'll just have to go with "that's one of the non-canon things I did." Although, since people from other dimensions don't actually have an alignment (being from outside the ruleset) killing one of them is not technically the same as killing a "Good" being.

  Plus, although they cannot programmed amnesia they could Mindscrape now to find out if he wants to attack, or can. Or place a compuslion not to do so.

Mindscrape is actually a banned spell in Flobovia and they really aren't supposed to be using it. The spell they used to muck with Jake's head in the first place was Programmed Amnesia. It also wasn't really known before the Draugar War and the FLEA brought it back...Reynard was /aware of it/ but only through a few mentions in old tomes. No one actually had it in their spellbook.
