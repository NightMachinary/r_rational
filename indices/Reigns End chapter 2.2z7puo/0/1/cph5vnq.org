  Hmm, interesting thought - this is more directed at [[/u/eaglejarl]] - knowing that they are planning to betray even 100% loyal and good people, how have the Landguard not fallen yet?

When this whole thing started, they actually did return rulers to their own land, with literally as much gold and jewels as they could carry.

Not all rulers have as (comparatively) nice a time as Jake has, however. Many of them were pissed off at being dragged away from their homes -- the ritual selects for people who don't have too many personal ties, but that doesn't mean that they don't have /any/, and even if they don't they may still have lives that they were happy with.

About four thousand years ago, they sent a ruler home and he found a way to come back. He used the money they'd sent him home with to buy a crapton of mercenaries, and he was only there to flatten Flobovia, not to conquer it. (He wasn't the nicest guy.)

The Landguard and other Flobovian military forces managed to stop the invasion, but most of the Landguard were wiped out, literally a few million Flobovian citizens (members of "the Land") were dead, and several major centers of irreplaceable knowledge (mostly libraries and mage academies) were destroyed.

The then-Commander of the Landguard, a man named John the Red, swore that this would never happen again. He took a binding vow ("...my intent is without deceit...") that from now on they would ensure that there was absolutely zero chance of this happening. He discussed it with the Archmagi and it was determined that while yes, they could use Programmed Amnesia to wipe the departing ruler's memories, that wasn't a viable strategy. PA has 'permanent' duration and can therefore be dispelled; it also falls off if it enters a no-magic zone. Any ruler they sent home to a no-magic world would get his memories back, and anyone they sent to a has-magic world /might/ get them back. At this point there was no other option but to kill the rulers.

As to why they haven't fallen: the Land, the Law, the ruler [1] /in that order/. Protecting the Land from another invading army is a higher priority than preserving the life of the ruler. The Landguard's code -- which their god full supports -- literally /requires/ them to do this. They would fall if they /didn't/ do it, because that would be failing to give their unstinting best to preserve the Land that is their highest calling.

That's what my backstory notes say, anyway.

[1] I really should have called this "the Land, the Law, the Lord" to get that alliteration going, but I didn't think of it at the time.
