I wish there wasn't this idea that rational fiction means the characters are rational. People aren't rational. I enjoy competence porn like HPMOR as much as the next human on this sub, but avoiding the idiot ball doesn't require characters to be intimately familiar with Bayes' rule or expected utility; it just requires the world they inhabit to operate as closely as is possible to either the real laws of physics and human behavior or to the setting's made up internally-consistent equivalents of such (such that if there /were/ a hyper competent Bayesian character they would win everything).
