An excerpt that may sell you on the novel:

#+begin_quote
  “So 20 years helping people with their rental cars, 40 hours a week at $10 an hour would be $400,000.”

  “$400,000! Without stealing anything?”

  “Without stealing anything. So, we'll say the cost of getting caught would be the $400,000 you would give up in income.

  “Now, let's say that you got away with the money 95% of the time. But there is still a 5% chance that you will end up in jail for 20 years.”

  “But NO ONE CAN --- ”

  “Catch the mighty Lifto. Yes of course. But humor me. Stay with the numbers for just a moment longer. So 95% times a $10,000 benefit is $9,500. This is the incremental benefit to you of robbing a bank. That is, if our hypothetical Lifto were to rob an infinite number of banks.”

  “An INFINITE amount of money.”

  “Yes. Very good,” (and very loud, thinks Edwin). “That would be an infinite amount of money.”

  “So I go rob banks now. Thank you.”

  “Wait, wait, we haven't factored in the cost yet.”

  “Lifto don't like costs.”

  “Neither do I, Lifto.”

  “Costs suck.”

  “Yes, they do. But we know that already. The only question left to us is how much do they actually ‘suck' as you say. So, there is a 5% chance that you will get caught --- I'm sorry, sorry, that the hypothetical Lifto will get caught --- times negative $400,000 is negative $20,000. So, over time, each time you rob a bank it costs you $20,000 dollars.

  “But there's an infinite number of banks,” says Lifto with dreams of filthy lucre glittering in his eyes.

  “Yes, yes, so we add the costs and the benefits to learn what the true value of robbing a bank is to you and we see that, over time, it costs you -$10,500 each time you rob a bank.”

  “What!”

  “The numbers do not lie, Lifto.
