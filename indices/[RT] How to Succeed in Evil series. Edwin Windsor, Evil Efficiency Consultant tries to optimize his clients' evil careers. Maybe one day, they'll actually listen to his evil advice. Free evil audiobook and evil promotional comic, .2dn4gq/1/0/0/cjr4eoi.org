  Only without the creepy Mary Poppins vibe.

Aw... but I love the creepy Mary Poppins vibe!

I wonder if any other [[/r/rational]] peeps like Venture Bros. It isn't rational fiction but it is certainly a deconstruction of a ton of old school sci-fi and modern fantasy tropes.

Ooooo Rational!Venture Bros would be cool. Maybe a Rational!Dean taking in and improving upon his dad's utter failure. Maybe uniting super-science and magic via Dr. Orpheus. Could be fun. Though the entire point of VB is that everyone on the show is a failure.
