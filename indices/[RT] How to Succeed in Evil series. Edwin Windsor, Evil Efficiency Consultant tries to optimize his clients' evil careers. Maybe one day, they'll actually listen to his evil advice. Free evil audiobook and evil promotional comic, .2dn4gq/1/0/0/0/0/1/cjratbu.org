I much prefer to read fiction where the characters are rational and tend to act logically, than just do stupid things for no good reason. The value of this subreddit is in giving me access to lots of wonderful stories like that. Lumping in fiction where the characters do not act rationally would detract from that. Calling fiction where characters act rationally rational fiction and coming up with a different name for what you refer to would keep that distinction
