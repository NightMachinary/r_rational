If there's a point to them all being idiots it can still be rational fiction- for instance, exploring in depth what a world would be like if everyone really were idiots. If it's mostly for comedy, like Venture Bros., it's probably not rational fiction anyway, but stuff doesn't have to be rational fiction to be /good/ fiction (it helps though!).
