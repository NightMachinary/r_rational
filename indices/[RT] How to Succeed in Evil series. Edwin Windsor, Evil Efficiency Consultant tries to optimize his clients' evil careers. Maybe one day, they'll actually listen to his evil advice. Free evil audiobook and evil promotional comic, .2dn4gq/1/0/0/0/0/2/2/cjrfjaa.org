I'm fine with such people - my favourite such villain is Mr. Kordana from /Freefall/.

The Idiot Ball trope refers to an otherwise intelligent character momentarily acting like an idiot for the purposes of plot advancement. As if they caught a ball, held it for a few seconds, then passed it on. It's bad characterisation, railroading, and more often than not creates massive plot holes.

Characters who are permanently and consistently stupid are fine by this trope, and I can grow to love them more than any hypercompetent invincible badass.
