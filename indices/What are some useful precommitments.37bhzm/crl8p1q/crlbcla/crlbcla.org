I dunno, if I asked a friend what they were thinking, and they answered "I never answer that question" I might come off miffed. I suppose it depends on the context and delivery. :) I'd say "generally dodging said question, and preparing ways to tactfully do so" would generally be more useful - all a precommitment grants you is the ability to shut it down completely - if you resort to employing it, it'd hard to avoid being rude. (Sorry to nitpick. I don't really have any right to do so.)
