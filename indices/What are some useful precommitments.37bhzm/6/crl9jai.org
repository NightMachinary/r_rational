Precommitment can work as signalling to a political group, in that following through on it can incur costs that would not otherwise be borne. At least in that sense, the 'draft for a libertarian compact' I once wrote, and which can be seen at [[http://www.datapacrat.com/sketches/JustCompact.jpg]] , helped me to feel associated with other members of a political group I wished to be a member of at the time.

(In case you're curious, it was before I was clearly aware of the differences between left/social/civil libertarianism and "markets are always better than government" right-libertarianism. This probably isn't the best thread to cover that, so I'll just point to [[http://raikoth.net/libertarian.html]] .)

I haven't come across any particular reason to renounce that particular precommitment, and it covers certain basic aspects of participating in civil society, so it's at least arguably still in effect, though of little practical consequence.
