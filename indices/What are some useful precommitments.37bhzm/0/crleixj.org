I tend to use "micro-commitments" -

I email people saying when I will send the next update, so that I need to make progress by then.

I make public commitments to do specific actions, so that I feel compelled to follow through.

I tell friends I'm working for the next X hours, and won't be on chat / reddit / etc. and so I don't violate it since it's easy for them to notice if I failed to follow through.

Like now - I'm going to publicly mention that I will get off of Reddit until this afternoon (PST) - and anyone should be able to see if I didn't do so.
