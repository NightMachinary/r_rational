Taking the weak side of an argument is generally just a really bad idea -- basically the definition of rationalization.

If it had more evidence than the opposing view, it would be stronger as a result. So if you notice yourself doing this a lot, getting worked up in defense of the objectively weaker side of the debate, it's a warning sign that you aren't being rational.

"Weaker position" for the sake of this rule can sometimes refer to the entire framework assumed by the argument (the manner in which certain political debates involve two horribly naive viewpoints in collision, debates on the number of angels that can dance on the head of a pin, etc.). So it can apply as "never deliberately take either side in a horribly naive argument" in that case.

Steelman arguments (intending to clarify how someone's flawed argument can be viewed positively without actually agreeing with it) are not an example of actually taking the weak side, but more a case of attempting to understand more fully the flaws thereof (including its appeal). If you didn't see flaws, you'd be agreeing/advocating, not steelmanning.

Similarly, "taking" a seemingly weak position for the sake of making sure all options are explored -- playing the devil's advocate -- is not properly described as taking a weak position for the sake of this rule either; it's essentially the same as steelmanning, attempting to uncover flaws in a position you don't actually hold in order to add a level of sophistication / force opponents to clarify theirs to escape the hole you have dug for them. (If you are /actually/ the devil, i.e. the argument does not appear weak to you, you aren't playing the devil's advocate at that point, but merely advocating.)

This precommitment/rule basically just boils down to a (for me) more intuitive version of "be rational, don't believe stuff that isn't so, update when you have evidence, don't depend on cached reasoning" and so on. But it's also a useful heuristic, as my physiological and emotional reactions can clue me in when I don't have the amount of evidence the position requires to be considered reasonable.
