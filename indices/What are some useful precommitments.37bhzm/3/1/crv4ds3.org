I don't understand why this is practically different than saying something like "I try to make the smartest possible decision." That sounds pretty nice, but is of course mostly contentless. I don't think this what you mean - I think I'm missing something in the disconnect between the facts that A) precommitments (the vanilla flavor, that actually happen in advance) are often (in practice) efficacious because you have set in place external pressure to incentivize something, like, say, the scheduled checkup with a colleague as mentioned elsewhere in the thread, and B) you simply don't have these consequences set up in advance with your strategy. What's missing in my understanding? How do you implement this strategy in a way that it actually does work; what does this UDTist approach look like from the inside?
