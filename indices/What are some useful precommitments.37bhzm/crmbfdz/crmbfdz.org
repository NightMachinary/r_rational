I don't think I have any big ones, but I have a couple of minor ones:

- Stop reading any article about AI as soon as it has a picture of movie robot/AI (like the Terminator or Ultron).
- Share [[http://rileyredgate.com/post/90497064702/batmansymbol-welp-here-it-is-the-final][this song]] whenever I have the chance.
- Never play Monopoly to win.
- Don't share anything that starts with "Share if, " or something similar. The same goes sharing things that try to make you feel bad for not sharing it.
- Don't drink more than 2 portions of alcohol.
