I like it now that I'm caught up, but it's not as well written as Mother of Learning. As somebody trying to get better at writing that isn't meant as criticism and there definitely seems to have been extensive plot planning, but there have been multiple times when the same thing has happened in two different chapters and characters have acted like it's the first time.
