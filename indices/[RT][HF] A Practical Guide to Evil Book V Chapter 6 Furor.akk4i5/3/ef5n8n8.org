I posted a long post on this thread in the other reddit, but suffice it to say. Cat has no theory of government or legitimacy to replace the ones she's destroying. Realpolitik and hypernationalism are great at using existing institutions, but not great at creating long-lasting ones. The Hierarch's appearance as a player means she needs to get one, fast.

I hope this is a problem the character currently faces but will resolve, instead of an underlying unrealistic view of government the author has.
