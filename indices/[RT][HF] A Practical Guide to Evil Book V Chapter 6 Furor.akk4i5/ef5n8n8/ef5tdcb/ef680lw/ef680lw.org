Yep. The Accords are more about binding Named from fucking around too much in warfare and politics. Similar to the technology cap enforced by the gnomes.

It also amuses me that whenever political entities come up in stories people rush to admonish authors for their perceived views. Seems to me that EE is basically shitting on every type of government that has been portrayed in the Guide universe. We see the worse excesses of each, even if they still kinda work. We've seen theocracies, aristocratic rule, military dictatorship. Bismarkian alliances, and democracy. I'm sure I am forgetting a couple.

And Cat has presented a form of government she prefers. A blend of Callowan aristocracy and guilds with military structure and bureaucracy pulled from the Reforms of Praes.
