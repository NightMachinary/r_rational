Oh, just a quick question I forgot to ask a long time ago. Is the Sharingan going to be as ridiculously op in this as it was in the anime? Because one of the things I hated the most about the anime was how strong those eyes got, to the point where the fact that Konoha (and I don't know if this is canon or just widely repeated fanon) needed the Fourth to win the war for them makes no sense. When you have an entire clan of Uchiha, you should curb stomp any other civilization in sight.

But anyway, enough ranting. Are bloodlines going to be more down-to-earth in this fic, or is using and countering the crazy powerful canon abilities rationally going to be part of the fun? Because in a world where genjutsu is actually useful, I can only imagine how much stuff Sasuke could do with his eyes.
