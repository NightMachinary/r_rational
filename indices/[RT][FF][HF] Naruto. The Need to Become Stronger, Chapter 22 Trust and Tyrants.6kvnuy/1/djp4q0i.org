This chapter is one of those I wrote some time ago, and only retouched recently. It's interesting for me to see how my writing style changed, which I guess is mainly that /wow/, I used to be a lot wordier. I mean, paragraphs are NOT supposed to be half a page long, and that's /after/ severe cuttage.

Anyway, more story! Action, excitement, and villainous reveals. And of course, there's that pesky darkness technique again...
