  Is the Sharingan going to be as ridiculously op in this as it was in the anime?

I can answer this one with a reassuring "Nope!"

There are in fact two fundamental differences between canon and NTBS, the first being heightened rationality of main characters and the second being reduced power levels. The reason for this (as you probably guessed) is that there really isn't much opportunity for rationality when you already have overwhelming power - as Kakashi keeps harping on, the best strategy is usually the simplest one, and in the case of canon Obito that would be just "teleport in and capture all the tailed beasts instantly" and in the case of canon Madara "Crush everything and everything by yourself instantly. That's no fun.

And of course, if you put put power like that in the hands of the heroes, the result is even worse.

So no. No invincible Susanoo, no techniques that can destroy entire villages like Deidera and Pain, and no morphing into a gooddamn Shark and causing a Tsunami. Even the tailed beasts are hugely toned down, as you can see in this chapter, due to A) lower chakra levels and B) lack of chakra resistance which makes them weak to genjutsu and sealing.

  Because in a world where genjutsu is actually useful, I can only imagine how much stuff Sasuke could do with his eyes.

Genjutsu, on the other hand, is just as useful in this fic as you would expect it to be.
