  First and foremost, the battle. As our first example of a kage-level battle, there was something rather satisfying at seeing them throw out massive jutsu all over the place.

I'm glad you liked it! It was very satisfying for me to write as well - as overpowered as Naruto and Sasuke are, there's just so much more material to work with when writing a fight between high-level ninjas compared to genin.

  I still felt that the weaker attackers who had preparation time (Zabuza and Haku) could have come up with a more thought-out battle plan? It just kind of seemed like they just charged in knowing they were outgunned by friends and foes as well as the fact betrayal was imminent

You're right, that might be the result of not showing the start from H&Z's perspective. The way I envisioned it is that they knew it was a bad situation, but they took the risk anyway because they were never going to get a better chance to kill Yagura. I imagine that they did in fact come up with a plan to get rid of Akatsuki after beating Yagura (killing Mei would have thrown a wrench in akatsuki's plans and forced them to work with Zabuza) but this was ruined when Itachi showed up as he proved to be just too much for them. Which is of course why Zabuza didn't want to summon Itachi in the first place - but alas, Yagura's tailed beast form was too strong...

Hmmm. Maybe I can put a line in there somewhere about Z thinking about how it's essential that Mei dies early for the sake of their hidden plans...

  Second, the politics of the Village Hidden in the Mist and the things they implied about your greater Naruto world was very interesting. Was Yagura also under a long-term Sharingan Genjutsu in this version of events?

I don't want to spoil anything regarding the ultimate plot (though wow I wish I were able to move it along faster, all this worldbuilding and setup is taking a lot more time than I would have liked), but I don't think it's giving too much away if I say that the canon version of what happened with Obito is deeply, deeply stupid, and NTBS is not going to turn out the same way.

  Third, the small details put in this chapter. Itachi being suitably terrifying and mysterious. Akatsuki using a more compact method for sealing the tailed beasts. Yagura's ruthless practically. All of these helped both satiate my thirst of ALL the details... and make it seem that there was but an ocean of them still out there.

Heheh, glad to see that's well received. One of the things that bothered me about canon (and stories in general) is that the villains never actually used the methods they have at their disposal. I mean, Itachi was specifically shown using the ultimate sealing blade to seal away an 8-headed beast, and never uses it for anything except that one fight. Same for super overpowered mind-control techniques like Koto-amatsukami. Such a glaring waste of potential...

But it gives all the more ammunition to me >:3
