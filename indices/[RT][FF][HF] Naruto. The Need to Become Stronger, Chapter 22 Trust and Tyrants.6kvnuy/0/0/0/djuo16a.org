Thanks for the detailed response.

With regards to Zabuza, your points are fair. It would have helped a lot to have it from H&Z's perspective. The idea of them being reluctant to summon Itachi and their endgoal being killing Mei such that Akatsuki /has/ to co-operate with them completely went over my head. A line or two with regards to Z's thoughts and long-term plan would probably help a lot, I think.

With regards to an ultimate plot... Yesss! I love it when authors have a long term game plan, plan things early-on and put in the grunt-work waaay before any of it comes to fruition. It always makes for a better read... (and is kind of a must with Rational fiction) I can understand the effort required for pre/early-writing worldbuilding required if one wants to write something that is cohesive and makes sense. All I can suggest is that you keep at it and not get discouraged!

I actually went through something very similar with my brief foray into writing a Naruto-fiction. I had a huge premise planned, and went into exacting details about the mechanics of just about anything I could think of... and then never actually got around to exploring any of them as I only wrote two chapters. >__<"

Anyhoo, very much enjoying what you've written thus far. Keep up the good work!

EDIT: If you want any of my notes, I'd be happy to send them your way. Just shoot me a PM with whatever you might be interested in.
