Hi! Many enjoyable things about this chapter.

First and foremost, the battle. As our first example of a kage-level battle, there was something rather satisfying at seeing them throw out massive jutsu all over the place. Mentally, however, there was a lot less going on than in the Kakashi-Zabuza debacle. While this does make some sense to me, seeing as both major parties were (almost overly-)confident of their victories... I still felt that the weaker attackers who had preparation time (Zabuza and Haku) could have come up with a more thought-out battle plan? Or maybe, allude to the fact they they did have many potential plans that were discarded as new information presented itself? It just kind of seemed like they just charged in knowing they were outgunned by friends and foes as well as the fact betrayal was imminent.

Second, the politics of the Village Hidden in the Mist and the things they implied about your greater Naruto world was very interesting. The fact that Yagura was able to look past some of his hate for bloodlines and still use those that have some utility was much more practical than I was expecting. I also enjoyed your resolution of the required change of regime but lack of actual rebelling forces (since all the canon rebels were, well... not), particularly since it accomplishes Akatsuki's as well as Itachi's goals. Was Yagura also under a long-term Sharingan Genjutsu in this version of events?

Third, the small details put in this chapter. Itachi being suitably terrifying and mysterious. Akatsuki using a more compact method for sealing the tailed beasts. Yagura's ruthless practically. All of these helped both satiate my thirst of ALL the details... and make it seem that there was but an ocean of them still out there. I thought that that was particularly well done.
