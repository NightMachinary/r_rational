My novel is made of poo and everything is poo. My protagonist has lost sight of her goals due to SAD (what do you call a Mary Sue when the character apes all of the BAD parts of your life?) and the antagonist is juggling six idiot balls. There is a wise old man just waiting for protagonist if she can get her shit together to meet him, but oh ghods it's like pulling teeth!

Here endeth the midway rant. Only consolation is that I'm nearly at 26k, so not TOO far off par.
