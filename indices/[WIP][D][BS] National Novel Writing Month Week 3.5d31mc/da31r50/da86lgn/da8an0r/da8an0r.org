If you want to complicate the discussion of religion, then one of the standard tropes in SpaceBattles is the ROB: the 'Random Omnipotent Bastard', any one of the possible hypothetical reasonably-omnipotent entities, who often have a penchant for taking modern-day humans and dropping them into fictional or fantastic settings, apparently for their own amusement. For example, if one of your characters is arguing that the evidence supports one particular religion but they don't want to admit that it also supports the ROB theory, then that could be enough conflict to keep the reader's interest for the scene.
