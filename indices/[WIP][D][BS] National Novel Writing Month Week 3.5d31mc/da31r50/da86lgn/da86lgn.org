Protagonist has no met wise old man, and I think I'm mostly making him actually wise-ish rather than super cryptic. I need more brief arguments for an against religion in my world. Brief because no-one will want to read screeds of it, but neccesary because something which makes you literally born again should at least make you consider the idea of a god... Or at least that's what WOM is saying right now
