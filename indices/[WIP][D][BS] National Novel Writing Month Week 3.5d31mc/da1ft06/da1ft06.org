As of the start of this week, I've officially crossed the 100K-mark for total words written for my current book , 'Mapmaker, Mapbreaker' (27K since Nov 1st). This makes the whole concept of finishing my book so much more believable for me, given that my current goal is 200K words pre-revisions and editing. I can actually do this. It's going to happen. I just need to stick to writing every day, keep up the consistency. But it's going to happen.
