Still going on [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jPU6QKEohcrw6l6O3SxorIxf2Tnq54h36LtQO6Qv86w/edit][Extracts]]. I've finally started having my protagonist interact with more fully-realized characters, who I'm trying to stuff as much characterization and Yudkowskyian [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing][advice]] as I can, though it's still too early to see the results.

I pulled my planned "[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChandlersLaw][Suddenly, Ninjas!]]" on schedule. :)

For at least some of the characters, I'm trying an old writer's cheat: drawing up a list of characters I know well from other stories, rolling some dice to pick one, filing the serial numbers off, and writing, say, "Dan Fielding from Night Court if he lived in this setting". (Not that I've used that particular fellow, yet.)

Around a week ago, I planned to take a day off writing, because of anticipated wooziness from a blood donation. I think I'm taking an unanticipated day off today, due to headache and stomach upset from watching a 3D movie. Maybe I'll try some eyes-closed typing later.
