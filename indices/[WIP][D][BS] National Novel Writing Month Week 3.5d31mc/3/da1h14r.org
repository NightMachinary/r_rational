And now, a whinny rant about my story:

I hate everything I've written so far. The pacing's all over the place, the plot isn't compelling, and I think my world building is generic. My characters are the only thing I /think/ is working, but even then, it's just that they're not complete shit, nothing amazing. And the dialogue. Oh god the dialogue. It's so bad that I can't bear it. I just passed 20k words and the only reason I haven't quit yet is because my self-esteem will go lower if I give up than if I shit out a bad story. Not by much though.

This has concluded my halfway point rant. I wish the best of luck to those participating and implore that none of you quit. I just hope most of you aren't as self-critical as me :)
