That sounds like a good idea, but I'm a bit hesitant to do it. I don't really participate in those forums, so I'd feel a bit uncomfortable if I just strolled in there and posted my stuff. I barely feel comfortable doing it here, and that's because I actually use this subreddit. Are they welcoming even if I'm not a part of their community?
