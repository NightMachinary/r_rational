Well, I do find that every time take a break I see some more interesting ideas/settings. So I don't know that you writing daily is actually better for me as a reader. Actually, if I had to guess it seems like writing every day for a few months, then taking a few months off creates the best content.

Alternatively, LSD microdosing ;p
