  I'm enjoying it.

Good to hear.

  Hit on some new neat concepts.

And even better. :)

  I think it would be interesting to see a story of yours with a standard beginning-middle-end format, instead of just an exploration of a world.

That's a bit trickier. I do have one story idea plotted out for such a format - but I just haven't actually gotten around to writing it. I'm trying to use NaNoWriMo to get back into the habit of daily writing, so that once I finish Extracts, I can keep on keeping on with more writing.

(Unfortunately, what I expect actually will happen is that yet another bout of anhedonia and depression will lead to me trailing off on that attempted habit-building in a month or three; I haven't yet found the right combination of tricks to deal with my traitorous brain chemistry, but I keep plugging away on it.)
