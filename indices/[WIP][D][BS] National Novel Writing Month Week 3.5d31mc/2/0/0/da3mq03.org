I guess the problem is that I have two protagonists, one of which is a deontologist, the other of which is a utilitarian. The primary antagonist is /also/ a utilitarian, but following one of what I see as a failure mode for utilitarian ethics, which is a bias towards self-serving behaviors and for-the-greater-good. In the last antagonist chapter he forced an innocent girl into committing suicide so that she wouldn't be a thorn in his side, since naturally having to deal with her accusations would impact his ability to do good.

Which I think probably talks me out of changing the payoff and into just having a "we can rule this kingdom together" moment prior to the finale.
