I don't know if I'd call something purely instinctive conscious. Something about it just feels wrong, like I'm cheating death instead of overcoming it. It somehow seems inappropriate or perverse to preserve my body in the hope of resuscitation without knowing if I will be. What's weird is that I don't have any qualms against mind uploading or freezing a person while knowing they can be woken up later.

I can imagine scenarios where I can be convinced to participate in cryonics, but even then I would still feel uncomfortable during the process. I guess it feels selfish somehow, like the fact that I might live more than others is unfair and I should just accept the life I got like everyone else. I don't have such an opinion of other forms of immortality, though, so I'm not sure where this prejudice comes from.
