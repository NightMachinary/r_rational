I think the lion's share of the issue is how frequently villains go free in comics. CRIMINAL INSANITY DOES NOT WORK THAT WAY, aherm. If you have the Joker or someone brutally murdering and mutilating 100 people, he's not getting out of that once caught. Imagine if Bin Laden had been given an American trial--do you think he would have gotten off even if he was hearing voices and drooling all the time?
