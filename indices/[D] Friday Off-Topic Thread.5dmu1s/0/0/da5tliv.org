Minor digression:

There's this very widespread legal idea of [[http://www2.law.ucla.edu/volokh/guilty.htm][/n/ Guilty Men]], with the most famous formulation being Blackstone's Ratio, "It is better that ten guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer".

Let's say that you have ten supervillain prisoners. For each prisoner, you have 90% confidence that they actually committed the crime you think they did, and each is responsible for more than a hundred deaths. An supervillain released into the world due to a not-guilty verdict at trial will offend again 50% of the time, costing on average a hundred lives.

If we follow Blackstone's ratio, we're basically saying "better that five hundred people die than one innocent suffer", which seems obviously incorrect from a utilitarian standpoint.

I suppose this argues for extreme prejudice in the case of supervillains to an unpalatable degree; I'd have to do the math, but at the very least it's better for twenty innocents to suffer than a single supervillain be allowed to go free. Though I guess there's probably an argument to be made that the government putting innocent people in prison is much better or much worse than a supervillain killing them.
