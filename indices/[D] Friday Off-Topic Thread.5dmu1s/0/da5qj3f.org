I watched the first season of Supergirl. Or to be more precise, I hate-watched it.

I think there's a certain laziness of writing that tends infect science fiction sometimes. It's like the writers think "okay, well this doesn't really make sense, but the whole concept is kind of out there so whatever". Similar to the argument that you'll often hear when someone asks "But how did he travel from the Wall to King's Landing so fast?" and the response is "It's fantasy, it's a show /with dragons/," which is not actually an answer to the question.

Supergirl has that in spades. Yes, I get that people watch superhero shows in order to get a power fantasy and/or get warm fuzzies, and yes, there's an element of both camp and fan service, but that doesn't absolve bad, contrived writing.

(I think one of few highlights was the DEO getting called out on keeping people imprisoned without trial, especially the comparison to Guantanamo Bay, which is the kind of Real Moral Problem that I think makes the best sort of story for overpowered superheroes.)
