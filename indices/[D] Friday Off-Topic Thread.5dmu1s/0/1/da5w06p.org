Speaking as someone who does like campy superhero stories that appeal more to my emotions that intelligence, I don't like Supergirl. I only watched the first few episodes because I didn't like the characters, the writing, or the plot. The closest thing I can compare it too is The Flash, which is by no means rational but still understands what kind of story it's trying to tell. I thought Supergirl was boring at best and nonsensical at worst, I don't know why so many people seems to like it.
