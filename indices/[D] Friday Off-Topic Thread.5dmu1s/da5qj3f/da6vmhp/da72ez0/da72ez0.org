I chalk that up to a combination of them learning as they go, holding back a little because they don't want to kill anyone, and the show's lack of a budget. To be clear, I think Kara is a moron who doesn't use her powers effectively at all. I like Flash a lot more, but there are still episodes where I think the creators are being lazy and padding out the plot.
