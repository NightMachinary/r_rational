An important thing to keep in mind is the effect punishing innocents has on the society at large. If your population cannot trust the system to fairly judge you, why abide by it's rules at all? If whether you are innocent or not doesn't entirely determine whether you will be /found/ innocent or not then there is less of a reason to follow it's rules, since even if you follow every rule down to the letter you may still be arbitrarily punished.
