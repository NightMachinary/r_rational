The biggest reason I like Flash more is that I think the characters are much better. They aren't all that rational, but they still have motivations I empathize with and don't do anything that stupid. Whereas Kara just decided not to use her powers for arbitrary reasons, Barry is wholeheartedly committed to helping people even before he gets his powers. Kara's boss is an asshole and her family is bland, while Wells is an enigmatic mastermind and Joe is an intelligent father figure. Even the sidekicks and villains are more fun.
