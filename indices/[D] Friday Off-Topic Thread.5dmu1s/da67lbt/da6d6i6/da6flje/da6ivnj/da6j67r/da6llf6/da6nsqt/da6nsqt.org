Thank you for the grammar corrections. I'm split on capitalizing cousin/father/mother. On the one hand it's definitely correct. On the other..I just don't like the aesthetics of capitalizing words too much. Weird, I know.

I'll capitalize Byakugan. That's an oversight, not intentional.

Hmm, Sharingan spin when casting genjutsu and at seemingly random times. Mild spoiler: that Sharingan is spinning because it's casting a jutsu-- what amounts to an amalgam of Izanami and Izanami and Aiko's MS technique, supercharged by the collective dying wishes of the Uchiha for a better fate.

Uchiha motto: yeah it's pretty arrogant, but mottos of sport teams, clans, companies, tight-knit groups, etc. often are. Also, I'm going with the idea that the Uchiha inherited in a diluted sense the Sage of 6 Path's Yin chakra, his spiritual energy. This means they can create forms, create reality, but not quite 'fill' it in, or give life to it. They're the outline, not the filler, if that makes sense. That's their strength in genjutsu and Izanami and Izanagi. So making reality fits, even if it's an exaggeration. In my Naruto metaphysics, deep spiritual confidence, especially in the form of a mantra or ideology, strengthens a person's chakra (by strengthening their spiritual energy), so the Uchiha mantra is a kind of 'clap along till you believe' idea that the clan knows isn't really true but helps them .

Thanks for the feedback, you're very thorough!

Any thoughts on the fix as a whole? The tone? Thanks!
