I'm 3 chapters into writing my first fanfiction, and it's way more fun than I thought it'd be. It is as intrinsically rewarding to plan/write/revise fanfiction for me as playing video games, reading about stuff I like, etc. Falls below seeing friends and good food, but not far below.

Man, if I'd known it was this fun, I'd have started years ago.
