Disclaimer: I dont uphold myself to Crockers rules, but here goes.

You cooked for your friends. You ask them how they liked it. Social rules say to praise the food, in disregard how you actually felt about it. "Tastes great!" If you operate by Crockers rules, and your friends are nerdy enough to abide by that, you might get "meats undercooked, and needs more salt. Also kakao was a terrible choice."
