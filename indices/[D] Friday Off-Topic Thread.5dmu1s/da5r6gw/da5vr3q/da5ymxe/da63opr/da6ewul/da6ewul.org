I agreed with Crocker's Rules, but have often found that social norms fall into the opposite of the problem it implies - that is, rather than honest criticism being forbidden, honest counterargument against criticism is forbidden. I have often been accused of oversensitivity for disagreeing with criticism - even though I object to the thought behind the criticism, and not to its being uttered. Criticism is not exempt from criticism; a rebuttal of a rebuttal is still a rebuttal.

To elaborate, if I create something and someone doesn't like it, I fully agree with the interpretation of Crocker's Rules that says they should feel free to criticize it. But if Crocker's Rules are taken such that I'm forbidden from defending my work by arguing against their criticisms, then I think Crocker's Rules have fallen in on themselves in self-contradiction; they purport to prevent feelings from being prioritized over truth, but have in fact only caused a /different/ group's feelings to be prioritized over truth.
