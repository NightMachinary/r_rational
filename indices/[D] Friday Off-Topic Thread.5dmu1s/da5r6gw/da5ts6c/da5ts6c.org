I have peaks and valleys. I worry that asking for feedback is often just asking for validation or attention, because I get those things from feedback. It's like "hey, read this story!" even if the intent is "help me improve this story". And I love talking about things I've written, but sort of worry that time spent talking about writing is time not writing, or its fulfilling some of the same creative desires without actually being creative. For me at least, it's a fine line to walk to ensure that constructive feedback is actually helping me.

And sometimes I just want to sit in a small room beneath the stairs and write without anyone talking to me or knowing what I'm doing.
