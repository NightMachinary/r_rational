Hey, so, Eve Online recently went pseudo-free-to-play. I played for a few years a while back and am thinking of hopping back in.

Is anyone else interested in forming a corporation together? I've got the ISK to fund us for a little bit at least, and it's a chance to try out the infamous meta nerd game if you haven't already (or, like me, are looking to return). Thoughts?
