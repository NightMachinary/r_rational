I don't think its long enough quite yet. Only 3 chapters posted (on spacebattles and DLP, will post to FF eventually too) so its not something I feel comfortable promoting quite yet.

Hoping to get another chapter up this weekend with some real plot advancement so I'll probably share it here then.

Its not really rationalist...its a Naruto fanfic, with a Massacre!Sasuke trapped in a month-long loop leading up to the Massacre. Mostly a mystery/family fic focused on Sasuke figuring out what the hell is going on, how he can stop it, how far he's willing to go, etc. It'll have some action, but since Sasuke isn't anywhere near as strong as anyone important at this point in his life, there won't be any powerleveling style looping. Also, there's a time/looping limit built in (not spelled out, but somewhat obvious in first 2 chapters) that means he wouldn't be able to do so anyways.

I hope the plot will be consistent and interesting (I have some ideas I think are pretty original), the themes poignant, but I won't be focused much on rationalism per se-- no discussions on rationality except as it might realistically come up, etc.
