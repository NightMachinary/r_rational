From the revised Chapter 1...

#+begin_quote
  It stunk of blood.
#+end_quote

Though both =stank= and =stunk= seem to be accepted as representing the past tense of =stink=, I prefer to use =stank= /exclusively/ as the past tense and =stunk= /exclusively/ as the past participle, since it decreases ambiguity.

#+begin_quote
  Her eyes opened, Sharingan spinning.
#+end_quote

Has a Sharingan /ever/ been shown to spin in the anime, outside of the moment of activation and in genjutsu? But this is embedded deeply enough in the fanon that it can be called a matter of personal preference, I guess...

#+begin_quote
  No cousin Tekka at the compound gate

  ---and I need to clean them and be with mother and father and Itachi---
#+end_quote

=cousin=, =mother=, and =father= should be capitalized when they're being used as /proper nouns/ (rather than merely as ordinary nouns), in accordance with =I ran towards Aunt Aiko’s house=. (Ditto elsewhere in the same chapter--=It’s okay mother, father.=, ="See if you can make one," father says.=, =The ball of fire I make is as big as father’s=, etc.)

Compare =The ball of fire I make is as big as Father’s.= with =The ball of fire I make is as big as my father’s.=

#+begin_quote
  No dream could be /that/ bad.
#+end_quote

I assume that =that= should have been italicized.

#+begin_quote
  With my strength, I will reality.
#+end_quote

That's an awkward way to use =will=. Let me see whether I can describe the problem...

IIRC, I've seen =will= used as a verb only in the construction =[someone] wills [something] into being= or =[someone] wills [a belief] to be true=. Note that the object of =will= always is an item that currently /isn't/ true, but is being /made/ true. Your Uchiha motto implies that the Uchiha /create/ reality, rather than merely /altering portions/ of it--and that seems a little too proud even for them!

Maybe =With my will, I shape reality.= would be better.

#+begin_quote
  ---her byakugan, of course!---
#+end_quote

If =sharingan= is capitalized, =byakugan= should be capitalized as well--unless this discrepancy is an intentional way of showing Sasuke's opinion that the Sharingan is superior to the Byakugan, or that the Uchiha are superior to the Hyuuga.
