SvalbardCaretaker covered the basics well enough.

Part of the thought processes behind my attempt at following Crocker's Rules: "If someone tries to insult me and the insult is true, then I should be glad to know more of the truth about myself, and there is no reason to feel insult. If someone tries to insult me and the insult is false, then the air interrupted by the flapping of their lips carries no more meaning than the wind rustling the leaves, and why should I bother letting myself feel insulted by the wind?"

Put another way: Tell me that I'm being an idiot, and I'll ask you to go into as much detail on my idiocy as you can describe.
