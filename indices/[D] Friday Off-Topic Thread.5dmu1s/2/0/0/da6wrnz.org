  I worry that asking for feedback is often just asking for validation or attention, because I get those things from feedback. It's like "hey, read this story!" even if the intent is "help me improve this story".

I've found success in mitigating that by saying something along the lines of, "Looking for feedback, particularly which parts struck you as particularly well done, i.e. made you think or feel an emotion strongly, and parts during which you noticed your interest or suspension of disbelief slipping, or where you didn't think of the characters as actual thinking people."

Unfortunately the number of people who respond also drops by a significant percent.
