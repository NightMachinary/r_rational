I'm going to take you up on posting random music that I've recently fell in love with.

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpuoPiTBooA][Talib Kweli]] has been getting me through the Trump win. Reading and writing only go so far, I needed something less sterile, without being less intellectual. The last verse of that song is incredible.

And [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op-HF0u1Ssc][NIKO IS]] has a unique style and great flows and interesting videos.

What have you been listening to? How have you been dealing with the state of the world?
