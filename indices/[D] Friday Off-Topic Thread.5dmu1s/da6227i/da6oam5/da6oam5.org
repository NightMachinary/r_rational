I've fallen in love with /Django Django/ ([[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QK1m__CqWAk&index=2&list=PLDA692ADC1036B17F][two]] [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4i9ubmuPVa0][favourites]]). Something about the two voices singing at different tones tickles my ears just right.

Although recently I went to see a movie and /Django Django/ was used as the background for an ad by Google. So yeah, if I had any illusions about them being cool unknown indies...

Also, the music station used by my boardgame bar sometimes plays a couple of their songs, but always /at a slower pace/ than normal. Who /does/ that? *Why???* I'm something-something-aspie and sensitive to sound; this never fails to distract the fuck out of me.
