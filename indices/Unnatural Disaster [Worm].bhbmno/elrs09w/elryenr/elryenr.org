Taylor gains a power to change stuff in a wide area and goes to town taking down baddies. A little like Labyrinth but selective, partially sentient, incredibly fine, and with no manton limitations.

It seems that it suffers from the same problem that crazy overpowered heroes have, namely that the power seemswoefully underutilized at least as far as I have read but maybe it'll change. Writing quality is fairly good and there are real consequences which I find appealing. Tentatively giving it a 7/10 for recommendation.
