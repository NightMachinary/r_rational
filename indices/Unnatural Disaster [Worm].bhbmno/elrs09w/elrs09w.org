Is there any chance you could explain why you put this link here? A link by itself is sort of a recommendation, but I'd usually want a little more before I dive into a random fanfic. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/bh32vm/dc_corrupted_data_files_star_trek_si/elplipu/][A short comment like this]] would help me decide whether the linked story is relevant to my interests.
