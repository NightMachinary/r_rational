I feel like I'm missing something... You wouldn't need an airtight tower, or the weights, (you'd only need one, or if you have to keep putting new weights on, then you lose energy getting the weights up there anyway,) and unless there's a, (literal,) bottomless pit underneath then the infinite handkerchief serves no purpose at all... So much WTF...
