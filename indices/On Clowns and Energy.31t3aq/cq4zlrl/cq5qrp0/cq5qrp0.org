You gain more energy from the lead weight pulling down the hankercheif than you lose from bringing the weights up.

The trick is that the infinite hankerchief essentially creates matter from the clown's pocket, giving you PE due to gravity.

Infinite hankercheifs just means you repeat the process with another weight.
