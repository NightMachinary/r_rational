Perhaps, because it is specified that a clown must be up there, "infinite" is not a quality of the handkerchief chain itself, but a quality of any handkerchief which is pulled out of something by a clown.

Until the clown begins to pull out the handkerchief chain it is finite, and so it requires only a finite amount of energy to lift.
