Whenever I read about the alignments in DnD, with Good vs Evil and Chaotic vs Order, and the spell, Detect Alignment, I think about how that spell can be abused and what it does to the world to have an actually objective measure of 'good' (results vary based on how well it conforms to human expectations).

However, it's often a little too simple for my tastes to simply have binary measures for detecting good and evil, since no one is purely one or the other. But just the other day, I ran across an interesting version in [[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074CH5VCC/?ie=UTF8&%2AVersion%2A=1&%2Aentries%2A=0][World of Prime]].

There is a cheap, widespread spell to cast on a person which returns one of six colors, and these colors correspond to [[https://en.wikipeia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Kohlberg's_stages_of_moral_development][Kohlberg's stages of moral development]]:

- Black - Complete amoral sociopathy.
- Red - Mainly motivated by fear of punishment.
- Yellow - Very selfish and focused on what they can gain.
- Green - Very motivated by peer approval and looking good/honorable.
- Blue - Mainly following a social contract or the law.
- White - People who have the character to be concerned with universal rights for everyone.

The story had a poem about the spell about what motivates people for each of the colors.:

  /White for right,/

  /Blue for tame,/

  /Green for name,/

  /Yellow for gain,/

  /Red for pain,/

  /Black for none./
#+end_quote

I'm curious how people think the world would be impacted if there was a cheap, common device to do something similar.

Another interesting fact from the story is that the goblins have a long racial history of killing off any hatchlings with any potential for beyond Black, while the elves have been selecting for only those of the white to reproduce, and over the generations, resulted (in the typical fantasy conceits) of all-evil and all-good races. Does anyone think that something similar would be possible if the hypothetical machine above were to exist?
