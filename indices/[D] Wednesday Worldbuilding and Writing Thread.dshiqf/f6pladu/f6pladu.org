I just thought I would put an idea that I had for quite while now to paper.

Basicly how a high fantasy world with different sentient races could come to be without creationism. And would explain the possibility of half-anythings.

Basically world is populated by humans. Big ice age happens, civilization are separated by huge glaciers. This would would need big mountain ranges in the world to work. Different populations develop in different environments. Orcs maybe in a dessert, elves in a wooded Valley, humans anywhere. Dwarves maybe near a geologically active volcano? Dwarven and elven longevity as adaptions to scarce resources? What do you think about this idea, are there any stories like that out there?

If you throw lightly mutating magic in it could be believable in relatively small timeframes.
