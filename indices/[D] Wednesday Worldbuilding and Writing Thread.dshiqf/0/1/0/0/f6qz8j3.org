  so long as you can keep your cows/sheep from wandering off the edges ;)

I hope that livestock are smart enough to walk off cliffs, but I can't say that I'm certain.

  Because they move around and are so distant, commerce and communication with the ground is costly and difficult.
#+end_quote

Communication shouldn't be that difficult if you can arrange it beforehand. At night, have a fire that you cover or show to slowly transmit a message. If there aren't clouds, that method should be visible for miles. You could use that for transmitting messages between ground locations that can't see each other as well. Across mountain ranges, for example, if the island is in the right spot.

  One important detail regarding interactions with the lands below: I'm picturing the archipelago as existing quite high up, and driving around relative to the land underneath. Those living on the ground catch glimpses of the sky islands in the clouds, and have many superstitious beliefs and legends about them, but reaching them is an impossibility dismissed by most.

I'm not sure why you would want them that high up if it causes other troubles. If the islands are of any real size, comparable to an actual island, they would be easily visible on a cloudless day, and would be extremely visible at dusk and dawn because they would receive sunlight for longer than the ground. They could be difficult to reach by dragon by saying that you need a fairly old or strong dragon to have enough stamina to go up that high, but that's a problem that a civilization could solve by actively rearing dragons. Still impossible for most, because raising or training a dragon costs a lot of effort/food, but something you could bootstrap once you can raise tons of livestock on the islands themselves. After a couple decades, the Azkhai would live almost exclusively on the islands due to the safety and plentiful food, especially since going to nearby islands would be easier than going from the ground to one.
