Thanks for the reply, these are some good observations!

I agree, focusing heavily on pasture animal cultivation is probably the way to go. This makes even more sense for a culture of Dragon riders as they will have need of copious amounts of meat (though in my imagining so far, these dragons also eat some stone, a la the old flight of the dragons film)

as you say, the relatively safe pastures with bountiful greenery would be an excellent environment, so long as you can keep your cows/sheep from wandering off the edges ;)

Your comments prompted some more thinking about the relationship to the people on the ground, as well.

One important detail regarding interactions with the lands below: I'm picturing the archipelago as existing quite high up, and driving around relative to the land underneath. Those living on the ground catch glimpses of the sky islands in the clouds, and have many superstitious beliefs and legends about them, but reaching them is an impossibility dismissed by most.

Because they move around and are so distant, commerce and communication with the ground is costly and difficult.

This raises a niggling issue I've been putting off for a while - how the Azkhal initially migrated to the islands en mass in the first place. If their transfer bandwidth is limited by available dragons, and that first move is even bigger/longer than the trips between neighboring islands, then they should have an easier time getting between islands than the initial migration.

Thus, I think I need some sort of triggering event, like a once every few hundred years alignment of the islands with some other mountain range or natural plateau, that made that first jump easier. Maybe for some months or even longer it was fairly close to an existing Azkhal stronghold or band, and there were a series of trips made, until the entire continent drifted out of range and became more isolated again.

My thought is that now a dragon could make the trip /down/ but would have a hard time getting back. it would be possible for very strong fliers if the islands drifted close enough, but finding and catching them is a challenge.

This leads to an isolated microcosm for some period of time where the Azkhal needs to learn to settle down and become more self-sufficient, rather than relying on conquest and plunder.

To that point, and your comments around roles of Dragons in an airship-capable society: I agree they would be replaced as the primary mode of transport except for the elite. However, they do remain as major status symbols for nobles, and as such wouldn't disappear as quickly as horses. They are fairly long-lived, and some older dragons would hang around their bonded noble families for a few generations as a sort of heir loom and mark of honor.

Private jets is also right on - I imagine going for romantic and thrilling dragon rides will remain plenty in vogue.

I like the idea of breeding lessened aggression - there's the case of the arctic foxes domesticated in just a few generations by some russian researchers (I think?) that started taking on dog-like traits. I think you could see some breeds emerge that would be fashionable or a mark of high status and wealth. "Check me out, I don't NEED a dragon that's a strong fighter, mine is lithe and docile, I just keep him around at great expense to show my wealth."

Also with you re:windmills. Seems like both these and watermills taking advantage of waterfalls at the edges of islands would be in common use. This is probably one of the major stepping stones toward the recent industrial revolution. If they've been there, say, nine generations, mills would see heavy use in gen 3-5, become more refined, then maybe gen 6-7 we start seeing them become more advanced and getting to real factories and steam power.

Thanks for all the insights! This is really helpful.
