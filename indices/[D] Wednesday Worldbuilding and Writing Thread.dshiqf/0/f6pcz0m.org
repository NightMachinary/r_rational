TL/DR:

Hi! I'm doing some worldbuilding for a fantasy setting with flying islands. Thoughts on physical, social and economic considerations are welcome. Some specific questions below, followed by more detail.

Questions/Prompts:

What social changes might one expect in a society of Dragon Riders as they go from warlike Iron Age Mongols to a settled, affluent civilization? Luxury miniature pet dragon breeds? Racing/jousting culture?

What are some key steampunky techs crafty dwarves would create when living on flying islands? (airships, duh, but what other not obvious but extremely useful contraptions might become pervasive? Lots of windmills, probably, depending on climate? Zip lines/belays? Mining scaffolds along the outer edges of the islands? How far can you dig before you break chunks off?)

What clever industrialization stuff could you do with magical crystals that float on their own power, produce a palpable, deep vibration through the ground and air over long distances, and naturally create fresh water and lush plant growth in land around them? Limitations - magical radiation in the immediate vicinity causes cancer and birth defects with prolonged exposure. You can't tell the crystals what to do/grow, it just happens gradually in their vicinity. Lift/buoyancy and carry capacity of crystals varies based on size. Big crystals that hold up the islands are essentially fixed in space or drift of their own accord, but shards can be found that are small enough to move around/manipulate and will provide some lift as they tend to drift back to a “resting” default altitude.

OVERVIEW

I am doing some worldbuilding for a boardgame I am working on. It's a fairly tropey fantasy setting: magic flying islands inhabited by classic fantasy races with a few twists.

I have written a few chapters of backstory for the various factions, and would love to run ideas by the [[/r/rational]] community, as the critical thinking here is the strongest of the various fiction communities I frequent.

For now, I'd like to focus on fleshing out the rules and politics of the world. I have some basic relationships worked out, but I'd like to dig into the likely cultural and socio-economic consequences of the events I've laid out so far. I would appreciate probing questions, suggestions, poking holes, and filling in gaps in the narrative.

WORLD BACKGROUND

I will focus this post on a slice of the world and timeline so as not wander to widely, but here's a brief history as a starting point: (~1000 words)

Imagine an archipelago of floating islands, held aloft by magic crystals that thrum with barely contained energy. The bass hum of their vibration can be felt in your chest and through the soles of your feet with every step anywhere you go.

The islands were once the seat of an ancient cult that guarded the secrets of the crystals and the massive Obelisk at the center of the sky - but those temples are long since abandoned.

The crystals provide the islands with life - lush forests grow, freshwater springs burst from the rocks. (conservation of energy/matter becomes a problem here to be dealt with - perhaps the water is only gathered from the air vapor and oceans below, to which it eventually drains/evaporates.)

The forests are inhabited by the Kipii, a tribe of sentient furry mammals, akin to large flying squirrels or sugar gliders. They live semi-peacefully for some thousands of years in a stone-age state.

Then the Azkhal arrive. Picture something like the Mongol Empire, but with Dragon mounts. They have conquered and plundered the lands below for a few hundred years, until a religious leader sparked a mass migration to the sky islands as part of a holy war/pilgrimage. They believe in a doctrine of Manifest Destiny, their divine right to subdue and rule the world, and see these islands as a holy place they were meant to inhabit, since only they can reach it.

Along with them come the Gragir - a slave class of fairly by-the-book dwarves. They are crafty and industrious, and work as thralls doing metalwork and harvesting raw materials. Originally inhabitants of the mountain caves where Dragons roosted, picking at the edges of their dens which tended to lie on viens of rare metals, they were taken as thralls by Azkhal forces in search of new mounts to tame and dragon eggs to pilfer.

The arrival of the Azkhal goes like most colonial events with a power imbalance. They quickly subdue and drive the Kipii out, who have nothing that can stand up to them. A few attempts at a concentrated defense are made, with various tribes coming together to form massive warbands, but the air superiority of Dragonfire and high quality Gragir-Forged weapons and armor of the Azkhal lay waste to these armies. The Kipii are forced to fight a slow retreat year after year, harassing where they can but abandoning island after island to the Azkhal advance.

While brutal, this advance is slow at first. The Azkhal are limited in their ability to colonize new islands by the logistics of transporting armies and supplies via dragon. While they've amassed a sizeable force of dragons at this point, only so many people and resources can be moved at a time. The islands are large - together they make up the mass of a continent, and for now the Azkhal hold only a small corner of the sky.

On the islands they do claim, the Azkhal flourish with the glut of fresh resources and rich land provided by the crystals. They begin for the first time to put down roots and form a more stable civilization in what they see as their Promised Land. Over a number of generations, as the wars with the Kipii become less frequent, their culture shifts from warlike raiders to one of luxury, fashion and refinement. Status becomes less about military prowess and more about affluence and political standing.

While there was always a significant division in Azkhal society between Bonded Dragon Riders (Hero warrior class), normal warriors, and the servant class, these start to formalize into true Castes. The Noble Class of dragon-bonded Azkhal rule along-side the Priesthood and heads of the Military, while lesser castes are restricted to either enlisted military service or outright serfdom. The Gragir take a position as skilled craftsmen and merchants, but racially segregated and derided even by the lower castes of human Azkhal (akin to the medieval Jewish population, though even closer to slavery and even more ghetoized).

This is the world in which our narrative starts. A wealthy and stratifying Azkhal culture with a long history of warlike conquest and religious zealotry, their Gragir craftsmen thralls, and the tribal Kipii, slowly giving up ground to the gradual advance.

In more recent history, a technological revolution is underway. The Gragir's crafts have benefited from the increased luxury and stable society, and they have begun to industrialize. Shards of the crystals are harnessed to provide energy for factories, and mass production of goods is beginning, creating an economic boom. At the same time, the invention of the dirigible revolutionizes air travel. Suddenly, goods can be moved without the rate-limit of available Dragons.

An explosion of new colonization begins. The Kipii are once again sent scrambling before the fiery advance. Islands are taken and outposts set up as fast as the Gragir dirigibles can ferry in new troops and materials, and fresh luxuries are shipped back to the budding Empire. A vast trade network of airships begins to form, and the economy booms. The Azkhal Nobles are awash in luxury and opulence.

At some point, though, the Gragir start noticing just how much things have changed - and how reliant the new Azkhal society is on them. Another sort of revolution is brewing, whispered of in warehouses and on factory floors...

***

We'll break there for questions and discussion - I have a few chapters of fiction starting from that point that I'll post for review at a later date, but I'd like to take this opportunity to talk through the background.

Feel free to respond to the Questions/Prompts from the TL/DR or other discussion around any aspect of the world is welcome.
