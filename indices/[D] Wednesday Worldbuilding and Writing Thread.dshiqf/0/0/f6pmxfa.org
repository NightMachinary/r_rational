This was a fun read and I like the world as you describe it. Thank you for posting :) I don't know why but I really love the idea of the Kipii.

For the dwarf tech I am thinking something like a parachute (both personal and for downwards travelling cargo) or maybe a squirrel suit inspired by the Kipii. I think they would be able to develop hand gliders as the Gragir would be able to look at dragon wings for inspiration and from what you describe I believe they should have the material science necessary to make at least short range gliders.

Depending on how common the magic crystals are I am not sure they would have been quite so desperate for the air ships for infrastructure. By hanging a container below a crystal you have something very close to an air ship. Put the water generate by the crystal into the container to increase the Crystalships weight for descend. Once you get to the ground release the water and stock up on light goods to ascend. Edit: Just realised you need use long rope from ground to island to stop Crystalships being blown away. Not sure how this impacts feasibility.
