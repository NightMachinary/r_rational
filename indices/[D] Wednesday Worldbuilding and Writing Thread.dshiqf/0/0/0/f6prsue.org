Hi, thanks! I really appreciate the feedback. =) I like the Kipii too, they were actually the genesis of much of the setting - my wife requested a cute animal faction, sugar gliders got into the mix, and then the whole game took to the sky just to suit them. =)

Good thought on parachutes both for transport and delivery systems for cargo. Amazon prime with para-dropped supply crates? =D Short-range gliders would also probably be useful in certain situations. Your comment made me look into the history of gliders, as I had no concept of how recently they had been invented. According to wikipedia, the Chinese had big kites that could carry a person as early as the 6th century ad! Though it looks like it took until the 1800s and better understanding of aerodynamics in general before fully functional gliders were in operation.

For some reason the image of a stocky Dwarf engineer in a glider seems really funny to me. XD I could actually see these becomming a major passtime or sport among Azkhal nobels, though. Sure, they have dragons, but the novelty of Kite-Racing seems like the exact sort of thing rich courtiers would fawn over. I definitely think I could include some of this for flavor.

Per Crystal abundance: while the massive crystals that hold up the land are embedded inside every island, functional shards are pretty rare and expensive. Only in the last generation or so have they begun to actively try to mine or harvest larger shards to use as power sources for their factories. There's some trickiness with getting a hold of and handling shards, as if you lose track of them they might just float away into the sky never to be seen. Additionally, they are radioactive when not shielded by many meters of stone and dirt. Safe mining of crystals is a fairly recent innovation, and acquiring one big enough to lift a large amount of cargo would be possible only for the superrich among the Lords.

Most major cities now have at least one large crystal (lets say an octahedron 5-6 meters tall) that is secured in their factory district and used to generate power. Smaller shards (from a few centimeters to a half meter) can probably be acquired by an enterprising and wealthy trader as novelties or for private use.

I think it's likely airships are exactly as you describe - aerodynamic structures outfitted with closed containers of crystal shards or dust to provide some stable level of lift. The main innovations that made them viable recently are safe mining of these materials, a better understanding of aerodynamic design, and the creation of powered turbines and propellers. Propellers shift what were formerly just clever floating platforms to navigable and speedy ships. Perhaps there were even some earlier models that functioned off kites/sails, but were beholden to trade winds. Cool idea!

Your idea to use the water as ballast is smart, I'll definitely be working that in.

Thanks for the input this is really getting me thinking =)
