Assuming the kipii have night vision similar to that of sugar gliders, they could serve as messengers for a dwarven rebellion. Able to travel between islands under cover of night, they could smuggle intelligence, weapons, and possibly even dwarves throughout the empire, enabling the kind of coordination necessary to disrupt the entire society. They have ample reason to work together and their abilities complement each other, so this partnership has a shot of actually working.
