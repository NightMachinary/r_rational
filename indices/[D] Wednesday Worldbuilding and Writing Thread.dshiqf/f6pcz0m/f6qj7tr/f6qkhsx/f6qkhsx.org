Neat idea! I like the concept of nocturnal Kipii spies, smugglers, and assassins. It could be tricky for them to move around during the day since they will be pretty recognizable as inhuman, but slipping around on cloudy, dark nights would totally be feasible. I'd have to think some about how first contact would be made. There's not a lot of traffic between the societies, so it would probably need to be individuals on the outskirts. Maybe someone testing a new glider/airship that becomes stranded, and manages to befriend some Kipii?

I can see a whole weird romeo/juliet story unfolding =)
