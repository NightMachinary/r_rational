If you can't control what grows on the islands, I think their peace time use would be as pastures for raising animals that can eat whatever the crystals can grow. Depending on how large you're envisioning these islands, there wouldn't be any natural predators, there's no need to keep the animals contained, and it would be really difficult to steal the animals. Disease would also be minimized because the contact with other herds would be small. Then the ranchers could drop down whatever they want to sell with parachutes, and use dragons or whatever to shuttle people and needed equipment up and down the island.

If the crystals grow vegetation year round, you don't even really care about seasons for raising livestock, which would cause a lot of knock-on effects like societies around the islands having reliable food for the winter.

Wood would be a major export as well, if trees grow at absurd rates.

Smaller islands would be invaluable as castles, due to the difficulty in attacking them from below, and the ease of dropping rocks on anyone on the ground. Plus, going under a castle's walls couldn't happen without it being super obvious. Watchtowers built on islands would be tremendously useful as well.

If dirgibles can replace dragons for moving things around, dragons would probably go the way of the horse after the invention of cars. Dragons of any significant size would eat a lot, and dragons are typically carnivores, so would be really expensive to keep around if they aren't economically useful. Rich people might keep them around for things like racing, being guards, the medieval equivalent of a private jet, etc. but they would be on the decline. I don't think you would have significant diversity in dragon sizes due to artificial selection, because it would take a long time to yield results, and would be expensive in the mean time. You could maybe breed lessened aggression into them though, but this would depend on the time scales of dragons maturing. In the early era, acquiring islands and thus good land for raising livestock would significantly boost the ability to feed dragons for military use.

Windmills on the islands makes a lot of sense, because there's more wind at higher altitudes. You could also have water mills fed by the water falling from the islands. The huge amounts of animal dung would provide an enormous amount of fertilizer, which means you could grow a lot of wheat, to then grind into flour with the wind and water mills.
