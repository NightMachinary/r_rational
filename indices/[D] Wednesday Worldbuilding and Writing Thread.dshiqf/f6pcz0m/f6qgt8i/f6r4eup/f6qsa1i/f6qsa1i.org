It seems like some/most societies would quickly develop stratification of law, i.e. having different standards of evidence, punishments, etc. for the same crime. If you know that someone will primarily/only respond to punishment, then you're best off ensuring that their version of the justice system will punish them, ideally with better enforcement schemes that will actually catch them. Similarly, profiling by what the spell says (and coding/cataloging everyone for easy reference) makes a lot of sense.

It's not clear to me whether the White would accept such a scheme though, as it seems like a clear violation of what we'd call 'universal rights'.

Whether you'd actually be able to breed a certain color depends on whether or not it's genetic, which ... I guess is the author's call, but probably isn't what I would do unless I was making a very specific sort of commentary/analysis.
