Guaranteed that people will be getting tested as a pre-employment evaluation. It's going to be ugly:

- White: Unreliable, might break the rules if the rules are creating an unfair situation (which they almost always will). Might escalate problems by trying to form a union, making complaints with OSHA or the Department of Labor, or going to the news. Avoid hiring.

- Blue: Ideal for hiring. Make sure the rules are clearly laid out for them and they can do anything.

- Green: Okay for hiring, but keep them in positions where they can't make secret deals, fudge statistics, or bully their coworkers to handle some of their work to make themselves look better. Best usage is to put them alone in a room with supplies and have them make things (which undergo quality control testing later) so you can be sure that their success or failure will be entirely on their own shoulders.

- Yellow: Reasonable choice as a CEO or senior manager, but needs careful supervision. They will do things that make people hate them if it brings in a lot of money, as long as they get a share of it. Just be wary that they don't harm the company for their own interests. Can also do well as a salesperson or marketer if they're getting a commission.

- Red: Risky in most positions. Can't be assigned important tasks. Best fit is in supervised manual labor.

- Black: Risky to have anything to do with these guys. Avoid hiring and make sure your security knows what they look like.

Now you have a society where black and white are all unemployed. Interesting times lie ahead.
