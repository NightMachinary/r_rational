For elves, the cultural selective pressure would have to be waiting until you're fairly old to have kids, and then having a /ton/ of kids to make up for the slowed annual fertility rates and to ensure that at least some of the kids live long enough /and stay fertile long enough/. Suppose the elves started out having kids after reaching 30 years old, and then increased that by six months with roughly every generation. After 200,000 years of that, they'd be having their first kids after reaching 448 years old. At that point, to maintain reasonable population growth rates, they'd probably need to be having close to 100 kids after they legally come of age. Forcing people to wait this long will also be really tricky, so I imagine the elves would probably have to have three different types of strictly segregated territories - one for women of childbearing age who are still legally considered 'underage' (even if they're 400 years old), one for men of childbearing age who are legally underage, and one for both men and women who are either a) legally of age to have children, or b) still young enough to be below childbearing age.

I know the number of children seems weird, but elves are going to need to have a ton of children for three reasons. First, their children need to survive hundreds of years before they'd be allowed to have children of their own, and when you factor in war, disease (especially age-related ones like cancer), predators, and random accidents, the odds of a child living long enough to reproduce seems low. Still, those children who /do/ survive are going to be some tough MFers.

Aside from death, they'll also need to remain fertile that whole time. For elven women, they're going to have to stave off menopause and stay impressively healthy to be able to have a large number of children when they're already a few hundred years old. It seems unlikely that many women will actually survive and remain fertile for so long, so elven mothers are likely to be rare.

Lastly, mere fertility when they come of age can't be the only selective pressure if we're also trying to achieve changes in body morphology. It's cruel, but some men and women who manage to (or would have managed to) remain fertile at 400+ years old may nonetheless die childless because of their appearance. It seems likely that the elves may be perfectionists, so most likely ugly men and women will find it impossible to find a mate, and ugly 'children' (even if they're hundreds of years old) may be placed into circumstances that increase their odds of dying before they'd be legally allowed to have children, like being drafted into the elven military. The elves will have a very bizarre culture.
