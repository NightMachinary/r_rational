For orcs, the cultural selective pressure would likely just be surviving frequent fights. If the orcs have tons of children and most of them die in fighting, the survivors are going to be the strongest, most agile, toughest, and most intimidating of the bunch.

The orcs probably would not evolve well in a desert. If you want green skin, good vision in the dark, and lots of kids for rapid evolutionary selection, your best bet would be to have the orcs be hunter-gatherers in the jungle. As long as there's tons of food in the form of nuts, fruits, and roots, the orcs shouldn't have too much difficulty raising a ton of kids. The kids who see best in the dim light of the jungle, and who blend in the best (with a kind of olive skin tone and dark hair) are going to have an upper hand in the constant fights.

The tusks (or oversized incisors) would be rather unusual. I imagine that would evolve if the orcs went for a long time without using tools or weapons. Under those circumstances, having big sharp teeth to deliver a deadly bite would be a huge advantage. After tool use is developed, the tusk look would have to stick around due to being intimidating or being sexually attractive.

Overall, the orcs don't need to be too weird of a society. They're essentially just extra violent jungle-dwelling hunter-gatherers.
