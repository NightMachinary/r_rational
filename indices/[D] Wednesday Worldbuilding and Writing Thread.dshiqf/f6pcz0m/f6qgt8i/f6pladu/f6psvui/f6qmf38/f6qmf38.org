So, basically you're trying to find out what factors might cause rapid genetic drift. The glaciers/ice age approach you describe would probably work to separate the populations, and population separation is obviously a requirement for making drift possible in the first place.

Beyond that, you'll get the fastest genetic drift if you have:

- A slight increase in mutation rates (potentially due to radiation, chemicals, magic, or viruses)

- Short generational cycles (high birth rates with first children being born at the earliest opportunity)

- Steep selective pressure, largely based upon body morphology rather than anything else

That last part is crucial. Much of human evolution since the development of agriculture has been the development of resistance to common pathogens that have become increasingly prevalent in large civilizations. Body morphology is obviously different between us and our ancestors 10,000 years ago, but our resistance to diseases is a much more significant difference, as we saw when European settlers came to the Americas with measles, smallpox, tuberculosis, influenza, etc.

While our selective pressures did not push us towards radical changes in body morphology, the selective pressures that we've induced in domesticated animals have resulted in some very obvious changes. For example, dogs have only been domesticated for about 15,000 years. In that time span, we've managed to breed chihuahuas, blood hounds, huskies, pugs, poodles, and German shepherds. Of course, it should be noted that dogs can have much shorter generational cycles, since they can reach sexual maturity at anywhere between six months to two years old, and on top that they'll give birth to an entire litter, averaging at six puppies, typically within about two months of becoming pregnant.

Due to slower generational cycles, humans would take a longer time to achieve that same amount of difference, but 200,000 years should be enough time to get humans, dwarves, elves and orcs all evolving from a common ancestor with appropriate selective pressures.

Those selective pressures will typically need to be cultural, but it will still be tricky, especially for elves. Since these are likely to be long, I'll break them up into followup posts.
