multiworlds immortality theory

when an event happens, we have two possible outcomes. you survived, or you died. because you are still alive, you are the result of every 'survived' combined to reach this point. some you never noticed, others you can remember as a close call. some choose between suicide, or continuing on.

you are immortal. specifically, the version of you that continues to live. but eventually, technology improves. it improves enough to keep increasing your chance for survival just enough. or they freeze you to restore at some point in the future, if no possible future would otherwise allow for your survival.

now, the universe YOU survive in is not the same universe as someone else survives in. but you are schrodingers immortal, staying alive despite the growing number of universes where you are actually dead. because for the you that can observe, you observe that you woke up in the morning, and then survived another day. no nuclear war, that was in the other timeline. you are just lucky enough to always be the version that survived.
