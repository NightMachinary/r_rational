Help me out here.

I was thinking about Eliezer Yudkowsky and HP:MoR the other day and I had this vague impression about them. I'm going to try putting it into words, and I'd appreciate if anyone can help me figure out what I mean.

I feel like Eliezer Yudkowsky and MoR have this unique property, that I would call *incompressibility*, for lack of a better word. That property would be: they are not perfect, and someone can do better than them, but the only way to do better than them is to be more complex... or more smart, in some abstract sense.

I'm really not sure how to put it. Basically, you can criticize MoR, but the only criticism that is valid is criticism that has /more thought/ put into it than MoR itself? No, that doesn't sound right; you can put less though, but focus it more.

A counter-example to that property would be a car without wheels. It can be an item of tremendous complexity, with immense thought put into it, but you only need non-immense thought to realize that the car won't be able to function very well.

I guess a similar concept would be Pareto efficiency, but that's not it either.
