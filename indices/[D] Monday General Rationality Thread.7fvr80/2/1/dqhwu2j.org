  I feel like Eliezer Yudkowsky and MoR have this unique property, that I would call *incompressibility*, for lack of a better word. That property would be: they are not perfect, and someone can do better than them, but the only way to do better than them is to be more complex... or more smart, in some abstract sense.

Hmmmm. I'm going to disagree.

It is an excellent story, and it is going to be very very hard to improve, yes. But... there are flaws, which I feel can be fixed /without/ going more complex.

The most glaring of these is where [[#s][spoiler]]

It's minor, I'll admit, but I feel that a proper explanation of that would result in a better story - and without increasing complexity.

In other words, I think it is possible to do better while being only /equally/ smart, not /more/ smart.
