I'm not sure what you mean, but I have a few guesses from my own experience with HPMOR:

1) You could be talking about how there is no low-hanging fruit when it comes to quality. HPMOR has so much thought and detail put into it that there is no part of it which can be easily improved. Any improvements would require an author who is just as good or better at writing and explaining rationality concepts as Eliezer.

2) Another thing you might be getting at is how every single bit of the story is essential. Remove any chapter and there will be holes in the plot. It's like how every word written is a crucial hint which are only obvious in hindsight. If someone tried to write the exact same story but shorter, they would find it very difficult. An accurate summary is very difficult (fortunately a good summary doesn't really need to convey everything that happened in HPMOR) and even readers who are given spoilers will still end up surprised. You can't describe the story very well without just telling the story itself.

PS Sorry if #2 is too much word vomit, I'm about to go to sleep and just wrote down everything I could think of.
