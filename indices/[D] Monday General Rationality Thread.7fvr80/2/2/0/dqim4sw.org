  Another thing you might be getting at is how every single bit of the story is essential. Remove any chapter and there will be holes in the plot. It's like how every word written is a crucial hint which are only obvious in hindsight. If someone tried to write the exact same story but shorter, they would find it very difficult.

I think we may be over-glorifying HPMOR a bit here. No matter how much you like it, it's reasonable to admit that (a) it has (at least a few) flaws, and (b) it has (at least a little) unnecessary cruft.

Removing parts of the story may result in a /less enjoyable/ story for you, but there are certainly small parts here and there which are not "crucial hints", and which wouldn't leave "holes in the plot" if removed. Eliezer even talks in his notes about how he thought parts of the story were awkward, or didn't like certain parts.

I can't speak for him, but I wouldn't be surprised if there were parts he would remove/change, if he were to conduct a thorough edit of the work (similar to what Wildbow's been doing with Worm1)
