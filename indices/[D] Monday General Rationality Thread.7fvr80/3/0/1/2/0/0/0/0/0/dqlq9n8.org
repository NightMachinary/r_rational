Okay, so. What do I mean by "comparable ranking in your particular preference ordering."

Consider the sum total impacts your existence will have on the universe. Now consider how "much" these impacts "make the world a better place."

I want to specify that I am thinking of "impact" and "make the world a better place" in the /most comprehensive sense possible/.

You having a pleasant, fleeting thought which is forgotten and never again thought, never committed to paper, entirely and wholly ephemeral; that thought makes the world a better place --- just a little. That you have the hopes and dreams you have and exercise your personal freedom and that you feel the way you feel, that is a net good on the universe.

Donating to charities alleviates some of the worlds suffering, fighting for a political cause you believe in, etc.

Hugging your mom/dad/next of kin as a show of affection makes the world a better place, saying a kind word to a service worker, posting a kitten picture on the net, etc.

Now imagine that you were replaced by an identical transporter-clone who proceeded to have impacts on the universe and "made the world a better place" more or less just as much.

There would be somebody to have the thoughts and experiences you would have, give or take; feel in the same ways and with the same intensities, like the same things, dream the same dreams, more or less.

There would be somebody to donate to the charities you care about, around as much as you would. There would be somebody to fight for the political causes you care about, around as much as you do.

There would be someone to hug your next of kin, someone to say kind words to service workers (and roughly the same words too,) and someone to curate internet cat videos just as much as you.

In essence, /your comprehensive gestalt behavior/ would be preserved in the universe. No actor can do that. No AI can do that without simulating something that is /consciously/ you.

ETA: The fake-clone being "better" than you would not have a "comparable footprint" it would have an entirely different one.
