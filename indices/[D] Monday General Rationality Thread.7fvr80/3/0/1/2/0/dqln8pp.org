Yes, of course. The fidelity of the process need to be unimpeachable. Would it suffice to see a --- say --- 10000 person double blind study of the long-term effects confirming that there is nothing to be afraid of? You've taken drugs with horrible side effects that have been less rigorously studied.

Also, the transporter would be the final end for you, maybe, but I don't think your next of kin would care. Nor would the charities you habitually donate to, or all the causes you care about. You would still leave just as large a footprint on reality, transported or not.
