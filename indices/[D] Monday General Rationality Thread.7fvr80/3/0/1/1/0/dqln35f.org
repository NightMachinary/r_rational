  Of course none of this means I would suffer an identity crisis if I found out I was transported, since while I feel bad the other version of me I'm more concerned with making sure nobody tries to transport me.

And that's the crux of my post, really. People experience identity crises when they have an emotional reason to, and from the perspective of the clone, there is no reason.

So, how much money would you want me to pay your ‘clone' before you'd let yourself be transported? Remember: your friends and family will still have ‘you' alive, all the causes you care about will be furthered by ‘you' and in addition ‘you' will have a lot of money to help with. A million? A billion? What's the price of your conviction that transportation is death?

I'd pay money to be transported, mind. I see it as just that: transportation. A really fast, really advanced car.
