  And that's the crux of my post, really. People experience identity crises when they have an emotional reason to, and from the perspective of the clone, there is no reason.

I mean while I might not be particularly distraught, other people of my position might reasonably be rather affected by the death of their doppelganger.\\
Plus if they were transported against there will then the fear from that is going to carry over into the clone.

  So, how much money would you want me to pay your ‘clone' before you'd let yourself be transported? Remember: your friends and family will still have ‘you' alive, all the causes you care about will be furthered by ‘you' and in addition ‘you' will have a lot of money to help with. A million? A billion? What's the price of your conviction that transportation is death?

I think perhaps you underestimate the degree to which I actually believe being transported is death. So no there's basically no threat or bribe that would get me to enter a transporter because I don't really have anything in the world I value more than my own life. The only possible way I'd get into a transporter is if the alternative is a fate worse than death (in which case I might just try to kill myself so as not to likely screw over my clone, since in a scenario where i'm being transported against my will my clone is probably not in for a great fate upon creation).
