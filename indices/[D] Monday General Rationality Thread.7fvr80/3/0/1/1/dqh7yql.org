  The second one throws a spanner in the works w.r.t. the gestalt information hypothesis, namely that everything that makes you you is the information contained in your brain (hard to argue with) and the fact that there is no such thing as distinguishable atoms (EY argued at length for this in the infamously technically flawed QM sequence.) If you have a problem with a process so minimally disruptive as perfect replication of what can only be a sub-microsecond-long snapshot of your physiology, then I can only imagine the moral horror you must suffer from, say, general anesthesia, traumatic amputation and replacement by prosthetic limb, domoic acid intoxication, or cybernetic memory manipulation.

As someone who does actually hold to physical continuity (well continuity of the physical process that is your mind) determining your identity (for the sort of identity that predicts experience) none of your objections here are actually an issue. I think a lot of the reason for that is that if you care about continous mental process then you don't actually care about specific atoms, nor do you actually consider "you" to be the information stored in your brain, instead you're the process or a subset of it.

As for sleep I simply don't think you actually cease having experiences during any portion of it. After all I and many people don't feel as though they simply lost time when they woke up, they get a sense of time having passed in relation to how long they've been out. In addition no matter when I'm woken up I always vaguely remember being woken up /from/ something even if it was extremely simple in terms of complexity.

Still there's at least some doubt that things like anesthesia (that are from what I remember like suddenly being thrown forward in time to the point you wake up), could actually be death. Though it seems just as likely that you simply don't remember those sorts of experiences.

Of course none of this means I would suffer an identity crisis if I found out I was transported, since while I feel bad the other version of me I'm more concerned with making sure nobody tries to transport /me/.
