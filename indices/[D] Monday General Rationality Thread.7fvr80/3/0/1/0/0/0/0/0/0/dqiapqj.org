  I guess you could argue that a transporter clone could receive a preexistent soul that had not yet been born, but Mormonism puts a lot of weight on the importance of being born with a more or less blank slate and it would be really messy, theologically.

Well... pretty much your only options are 'your soul' or 'another soul' or 'no soul', so...

I guess all of them have theological implications, really.
