I think that you're giving people a little too much credit. There was a period in my life during which I seriously entertained the possibility that, while there was a Me with an immortal soul that would survive death, the Me that I experienced saying "I" was /not/ the ensouled-Me, and I entertained this possibility because of a combination of theology and scientific studies that I won't get into.

Additionally, my position was that souls were basically just a medium to record on, so there would be no subjective experience to differentiate soulless and ensouled people. If the playing of a symphony is the subjective experience of life, then the symphony plays out the same whether or not anyone is recording it.

  then I can only imagine the moral horror you must suffer from, say, general anesthesia, traumatic amputation and replacement by prosthetic limb, domoic acid intoxication, or cybernetic memory manipulation.

These are all things that some people can be horrified by, as a result of holding consistent philosophical positions. I might not hold any of those positions, just as I don't believe in a soul anymore, but they can be held. There's actually this story idea that I'm toying with to explore the position that "you" die every time you fall asleep, which I may not agree with but think is interesting and worth exploring anyway.

  Imagine for a moment that someone puts you under general anesthesia and when you wake up a very credible-looking person informs you that your entire body has been broken down and built up again, atom-by-atom. What is different about this thought experiment is that that is a lie: you were put under and woken up normally. However, everyone you meet for the rest of your life will insist that you were indeed transported.

  You are, in this hypothetical, still you, 100%. No transporter clone shenanigans. Yet, all the data you have access to suggests otherwise.

If I were a person who believed that (1) souls existed, (2) souls are indivisible, (3) souls cannot be duplicated or combined, and (4) God wouldn't have re-sleeved my soul after the death of my first body, then yeah, I would believe that I was soulless. I might not /feel/ that way, but feelings are bunk in the face of cold logic. >:P

(Again, I don't endorse that thinking. I'm just arguing that it isn't impossible, or even implausible, to think in these ways, because I know or have been people who think in these or similar ways.)
