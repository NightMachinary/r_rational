I would recommend trying compassion/metta meditation a couple of times and seeing if you feel something more intense then. I'm a pretty emotionally stable person but I can get pretty happy with metta meditation if I put the time in. Worth trying out, IMO.

I have definitely had periods of very calm, emotionally stable, mostly neutral mood, which is good in some ways but a little frustrating in other ways because I do wish I had stronger feelings for people/stuff sometimes. Metta meditation seems to open me up to that a good bit.
