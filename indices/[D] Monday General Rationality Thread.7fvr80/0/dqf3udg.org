(Headspace stuff, including an attempt to figure out how normal this is or isn't, because maybe other people are just describing the same stuff but in different terms)

Sometimes I think that I'm rarely happy, and the best that I usually get is "alright, or not bad."

Other times, I think that I'm overthinking it all and that this is just how everyone normally is.

The impression that I get regarding how life is /supposed/ to work: If happiness is graded from -10 to 10, a normal person ought to experience -10 about as often as 10, 5 about as often as 5, and so on, and that if this isn't true then something abnormal is going on. I'm not entirely confident that this is actually true but that's a large part of why I'm making this post, to compare experiences and try to figure out what's actually going on with other people.

My best experiences are when I'm in a flow state, but subjectively that feels less "How other people seem to describe happiness" and more "Loss of sense of self."

Does any of this sound familiar to anyone else?
