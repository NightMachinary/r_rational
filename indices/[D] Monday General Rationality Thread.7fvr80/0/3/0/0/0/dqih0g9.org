To be clear, I don't know if it's a smaller range in an absolute sense, since there's no way to compare; I mean the range of an average day compared to the range of my most extreme experiences. It could mean either that I almost never get very far from neutral, or that I occasionally get farther from neutral than you ever have, and the part of the scale I normally live at seems small in comparison; either one would be interesting.
