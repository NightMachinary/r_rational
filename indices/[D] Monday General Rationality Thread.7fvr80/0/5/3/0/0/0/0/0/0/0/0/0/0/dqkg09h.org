  Firstly is that the amount of valence from looking at something with "beauty" can't just be non-zero it has to meet some higher valence threshold than that.

Alright, that's fair. In order to count as 'beautiful' it has to meet a minimum standard, a minimum amount of beauty.

#+begin_quote
  Secondly and perhaps more importantly is that beauty only refers to /specific types of positive valence responses./
#+end_quote

Looking at your examples, it looks almost as if you think 'beauty' can only refer to more highbrow entertainment?

If so, then I would like to point out that that is a purely social construct.
