Okay, so, in order to be beautiful:

- The sensory input must reach a minimum level or 'enjoyable'.
- It must inspire an emotion approximately analogous to (but not necessarily equal to) quiet enjoyment

Assuming that this minimum threshold is not set unreasonably high, I suggest that the existence of beauty in the world by this definition is trivially true.
