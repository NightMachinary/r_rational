Well while I can't (or don't want to put in the significant effort to) pin down the exact boundaries of beauty there's some things you could probably say about it.

Firstly is that the amount of valence from looking at something with "beauty" can't /just/ be non-zero it has to meet some higher valence threshold than that. So something just being slightly nice to look at wouldn't be sufficient here.\\
Secondly and perhaps more importantly is that beauty only refers to /specific types of positive valence responses/. So for instance most people would feel a bit weird about seriously saying a really good looking piece of food is beautiful (well they might want to be deliberately hyperbolic) unless it was say arranged in a sort of artistic way and didn't derive most of it's aesthetic value from looking tasty.\\
Similarly and more extremely videos of earwax removal and zit popping can be somewhat satisfying to watch despite also being gross, but of course nearly nobody would ever call that beautiful.
