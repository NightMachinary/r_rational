  Assuming that this minimum threshold is not set unreasonably high, I suggest that the existence of beauty in the world by this definition is trivially true.

Sure that beauty /exists/ is trivially true but that wasn't what the comment said. It was talking about the /world/ being beautiful and whether the world is /as a whole/ beautiful is something that would rather less straightforward to assess and probably doesn't even have a definitive answer by nearly any metric.

It's sort of like the difference between the world being good and the world /containing/ good. Where the latter would be true if there is anything good anywhere in existence regardless of how horrible it is as a whole.
