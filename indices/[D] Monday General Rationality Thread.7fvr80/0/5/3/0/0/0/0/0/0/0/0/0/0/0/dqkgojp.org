I think you're getting the causation the wrong way around. Types of entertainment that feel intuitively slightly distasteful or otherwise don't really match a particular kind of aesthetic sense end up getting viewed as more high class for a number of potential reason. However I think you would be wrong to think /just/ having something become high class would be enough to make people think it's beautiful.

You're fundamentally missing that there is a /distinctive feeling/ associated with the word here that people are referring to, not just the fact it's sufficiently positive valence. As for the specifics of that feeling it might be literally indescribable in the sense of trying to describe vision to the congenitally blind and of course I would be particularly poorly suited to describe it since I get the impression most people get this feeling much more strongly than i'm capable of experiencing.
