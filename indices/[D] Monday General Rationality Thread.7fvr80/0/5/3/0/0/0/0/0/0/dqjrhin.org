  While that definition works it kind of doesn't really seem like what was implied by your original comment (since it would translate to "there are things that are nice to look at in the world" which is a rather weak and trivial claim).

[[/raritywut][]] I believe you now have an inkling of why I found it so surprising that someone could imply that the world is /not/ beautiful.

  It also obviously says nothing about the quality of the valence induced by looking at something other than it's positive.

[[/pinkiepout][]] Yes... I could find a reasonable zero point for a scale of beauty, but I couldn't think up a reasonable way to measure the magnitude except comparatively. It's easy enough to see that this is more or less beautiful than that, but how do you measure /twice/ as beautiful?

  So for all those reason it's not a great approximation for standard usages of beauty.
