That's the thing, though. My concept of beauty pretty much /is/ 'pleasant to observe'. (With the proviso that in some cases, i.e. a beautiful piece of music, said observation is done with a sense other than sight). There's some poorly defined threshold value above which an object can be called 'beautiful' and below which it cannot.

I am /very/ uncertain what you mean by the word 'beauty'. Could you please try to explain it without using the word 'beauty'?
