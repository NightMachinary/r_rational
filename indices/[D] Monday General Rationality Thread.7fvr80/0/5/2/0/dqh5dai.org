  It seems to me that what these people are doing and what you are doing isn't that different. They are comparing reality to their concepts of the "ideal self" and the "ideal life", it falls short and as a result, they are unhappy. Similarly, you seem to be comparing reality to your concept of the "ideal world" and of course you get the same results.

"Ideals" are like a list of quest objectives you want to complete. In that sense, yes, I do have an ideal world that I want to complete, just like some people have ideal selves and ideal lives. But, at the risk of sounding like a giant ass, their objectives seem so utterly frivolous compared to mine (x.x). Like I said earlier, discovering the meaning of life isn't going to give you a +10 int boost or an immunity to hunger. So aiming for those quest objectives is simply increasing the difficulty without really changing the rewards. My ideals are generally along the lines of reducing pain and suffering, which are kinda important since enough pain and suffering DOES give you -10 int: you can't exactly think straight when you're being tortured (by disease/poverty/villains/hunger/whatever). Not to mention the various other horrible penalties.

  Probably acceptance here is the hardest part but the mindset to aim for might be something like "it sucks, but it's fine because that's what it is, no point in wishing it were different (as it is not)." It is still possible to accept it as the current state of affairs and then try to make it better, of course.

It is kinda hard to do both. Typically if you want to avoid wishing for things to be better, you should avoid thinking about how things could be better. But if you don't think about how things could be better, how would you try to make things better :x? You wouldn't even know what direction "better" is towards, since you don't think about it. Yet if you do think about it, wishing for it becomes nigh inevitable.
