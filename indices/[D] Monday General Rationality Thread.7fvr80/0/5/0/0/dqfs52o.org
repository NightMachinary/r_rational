Though there are biological components, it can't be purely biological, otherwise you wouldn't be able to change your happiness by thinking stuff, which you clearly can. Read a funny joke, your happiness spikes (temporarily). I suppose it is possible for someone to continue feeling blessed and blissful even as the world falls into ruins around them, but I have yet to meet one.

As for similar views, if you are referring the views expressed in that comic, they are rather different from my views. Humanity isn't basically good or evil. They are far, far worse than that. They are basically [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar][knight templars]]. If you ask around, most people have their own ideas of what morality is, of what good and evil is, of what is right and wrong, yet they don't agree with one another. Clearly, among all of these contradictory versions of morality, at most one is right. So the odds of any one person's idea of morality being correct is horribly horribly small. Yet rather than doubting their own ability to comprehend morality, plenty of them just dig their heels into their specific beliefs and demonize the disagreers. They aren't basically good or evil, they are evil people who think they are good, which is far worse.

An evil person can at least be stopped (relatively) easily: they are either impulsive evil, in which case they are ineffective and easy to deal with, or long-term evil, in which case you can control them with incentives and carefully constructed social systems that make it easier for them to achieve their goals by acting good rather than evil at all times. And either way, if an evil person dies, that's it, they're gone, problem solved (unless you reunite in some afterlife or something).

A knight templar never stops. As far as he is concerned, he is the force of good, and no sacrifice is too great for his cause. Threaten them with imprisonment or penalties for his acts of aggression, and that just adds more fuel for his belief that you are an evil that needs to be purged at any cost. Offer rewards to correct his behavior, and he just brushes off the "temptation" and continues his crusade. You can't even kill a knight templar, because then he becomes a martyr and inspires countless more to follow in his footsteps of knight templar-hood. And because they are knight templars, they often act like good people, which (a) camoflages them, and (b) gives them tons of support to commit more evils.

Want proof? Look at human history. The signs of knight templars are everywhere, banding together to form witch hunts, persecuting the different, waging bloody holy wars and conducting inquisitions against those they deem evil, all in the name of good. Why? Because natural selections wills it. Knight templars produce more progeny than either good or evil. While good people have to work hard to produce their own wealth and court their spouses, knight templars get to deem large groups of people as evil, then proceed to rob them, enslave them, and even rape them, allowing them to gain tons more wealth and children than good people. Then, while evil people would selfishly hoard the wealth and abuse their children, knight templars would be nice to their friends and families, those of the same country or race or religion, boosting their well-being far better than evil people would and hence allowing their children to produce more grandchildren.
