Note: Since this may be a point of confusion, I'll clarify what I mean by knight templar. A knight templar doesn't have to go all RPG warrior murder spree with a sword, or go on a religious crusade, it just has to do two things:

- Perform acts of evil (like hurting innocents) while believing it is morally good or even morally required for it to do so.
- Continue sticking to those beliefs even when confronted.

Also, I have a general "things suck a lot more than cynics think they suck" type of cynicism. :(

  Maybe I live in a sheltered bubble of non crusade-ness, but I really don't see that. Like, among the people I live with and work with and talk to, I see a distinct lack of bloodthirsty monsters who crave nothing more than the destruction of all outgroups until nothing remains. Maybe they're just better at hiding than I am at finding them? Or maybe I'm one of them and I haven't noticed.

That's what I mean when I say they are camouflaged. Most of the time, knight templars are perfectly good people. Upstanding members of the community even. But put them near the people they deem as evil, and their actions change. For example, slave owners can be perfectly nice to their friends and families, while seeing nothing morally wrong with whipping disobedient slaves to death, and would gladly help their friends put down any rebellious slaves while thinking it is the right thing to do. For another example, an abusive husband could be a perfectly respectable businessman in public, even donating vast sums of money in public, while still beating up his wife and kids at home, and be all knight templar about it claiming that it is only right for the husband to properly discipline them.

I mean, just look at all the incidents of racism or sexism today. Or people who are homophobic or against specific religions. Most of them, I suspect, are knight templars. They don't see their actions as wrong, and can be perfectly nice and friendly while surrounded by members of their in-group. Even when you tell them their actions are immoral they just don't agree, and continue to take shots at minorities because they think it is just to do so. Or that they are morally obligated or commanded by god to hurt minorities.

Plenty of people just don't see their own actions as wrong in any way, even as they take steps to make themselves rich while screwing over tons of people, or make judgments on who to hire/fire, who to vote for, who to marry, who to suspect of criminal activity, etc. based on corrupt or discriminatory practices, or spread horrible unverified rumors about other people that could cause them a lifetime of harassment and isolation, or even when they directly hurt people they "think" are guilty as some kind of vigilante justice. And when you try to confront them about their wrongdoings, like telling them to stop spreading rumors, you could very well get deemed evil by association, for if you are defending people they think are evil, then surely you're evil as well. At which point they may see no problem with making attacks on you, since you are an evil that deserves it.

  Seriously though, social arguments from natural selection explain way too much; you can support any pet theory that way.

Perhaps. I can't rule out that I might have missed something that causes good people to be naturally selected for instead of knight templars. But history seems to agree with this hypothesis.

Knight templars can and usually are great parents, that's the whole point. They are good to their in-group, which typically includes their families. Who they feed and cloth using wealth derived from the suffering of others. From the lands stolen by war and deliberate spreading of plagues. From the backs of slaves and serfs.

I suspect that war with a strong country is bad for your country, but war with weaker countries is great. But then I'm not really good with economics, so I'm not really sure on this one.

  good people make more stable societies than thinly-veiled sociopaths.
#+end_quote

Historically, you are just wrong on this one. I mean, I wish that was true, but it just isn't. Throughout the millenniums of human history, most of the famous societies that lasted thousands of years /are/ formed by *horrible horrible* people. Slavery has been around all the way back to even ancient Egyptian times. War and conquest has been lauded as great acts of honor and glory by countries all over the globe all the way up until the 1900s, with conquerers rampaging across the land, looting and pillaging and raping and enslaving, being praised as heroes. Monarchies, where a single often horrible king has full dictatorial powers to do whatever he wishes, has been more or less the only form of government since the dawn of civilization. They aren't sociopaths, they are just knight templars: people who are convinced that they are good even as they commit all kinds of heinous crimes against humanity.

If good people truly made better societies, you would expect them to form a long lasting civilization, and their evil neighbors to just self-implode from their evil practices, or weaken into non-existence over time. Or you would expect that good people would cooperate with each other better, and thus form strategic defensive alliances with superior technological and economic prosperity allowing them to hold their more evil neighbors at bay until they crumble from within. But that just isn't what happened. Historically, the people who prospered and spread across the lands have always been the knight templars, the people who saw nothing wrong with, and often even felt morally obligated to conquer other countries, loot their wealth, enslave their population, etc. etc.

Personally, I subscribe to the "(almost) everyone is a knight templar or evil, (almost) everything is broken, but (almost) everyone behaves normal in public" theory.
