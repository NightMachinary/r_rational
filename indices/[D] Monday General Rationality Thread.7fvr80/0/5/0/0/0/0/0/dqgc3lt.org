To be honest, I'm not sure how meaningful your idea of a knight templar is. Basically, a knight templar as you describe it:

- Does things you don't like (i.e. morally evil) while thinking that these things are actually good.
- Keeps doing those things even when you argue with them.

As far as I can tell, you're basically dividing the world up into Evil People, Good People, and Seemingly Good People Who Reveal Their Rottenness By Not Following My Values All The Time.

This seems like a framing issue, though?

Just as accurately, but more healthily, I think we could divide the world into Evil People, Good People, and Some More Good People Who Just Have Some Mistaken Beliefs And (Like Basically All People) Have Some Trouble With Changing Their Beliefs On A Dime.

Like, this isn't some complex issue that you have to come up with a special label for. Most people are basically good, most people have mistaken views about the world, and most people are bad at changing their minds unless you approach the discussion in a particular way.

You can even say "The world sucks because of [people in this group]," but describing rather than labeling them has the handy benefit of showing that this is a solvable problem.

You're a knight templar. So am I, for that matter. I certainly have at least one moral position that I would consider abhorrent if only I were wiser, and it'd be hell and a handful to argue me out of it under most circumstances. In other words, there's just evil people and knight templars, no good people among them, and there probably aren't any evil people either, just more knight templars and maybe some broken people.

I'll leave the historical stuff alone, because I really ought to be studying and not redditing. >.>
