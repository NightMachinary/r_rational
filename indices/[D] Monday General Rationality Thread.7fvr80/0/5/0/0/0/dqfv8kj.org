... Okay, that's a more specific set of beliefs than I was expecting. I was thinking more of a general "things suck and people suck" type of cynicism.

  A knight templar never stops. As far as he is concerned, he is the force of good, and no sacrifice is too great for his cause. Threaten them with imprisonment or penalties for his acts of aggression, and that just adds more fuel for his belief that you are an evil that needs to be purged at any cost.

Maybe I live in a sheltered bubble of non crusade-ness, but I really don't see that. Like, among the people I live with and work with and talk to, I see a distinct lack of bloodthirsty monsters who crave nothing more than the destruction of all outgroups until nothing remains. Maybe they're just better at hiding than I am at finding them? Or maybe I'm one of them and I haven't noticed.

  Why? Because natural selections wills it. Knight templars produce more progeny than either good or evil.

Yeah, but good people, evil people and knight templars alike produce less progeny than stupid people, so we're safe. (well, except for climate change)

Seriously though, social arguments from natural selection explain way too much; you can support any pet theory that way. In practice, most babies in the world are born of married parents, not Red Army rapists, war is profitable to no-one except a minority of politicians and weapon traders, good people make more stable societies than thinly-veiled sociopaths.

Personally, I subscribe to the "(almost) nobody is evil, (almost) everything is broken" theory.

  Though there are biological components, it can't be purely biological, otherwise you wouldn't be able to change your happiness by thinking stuff, which you clearly can. Read a funny joke, your happiness spikes (temporarily).

The point being, thoughts can provoke happiness spikes, but average happiness might be purely biological.
