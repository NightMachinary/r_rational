  Sometimes I think that I'm rarely happy, and the best that I usually get is "alright, or not bad."

This might be a definition thing. I spend a lot of time in a state of "alright, or not bad" or minor contentment; but I consider this to be a state of happiness. True, it's not "ecstatic", and it's somewhere on the low end of happiness... but I nonetheless consider it happiness.
