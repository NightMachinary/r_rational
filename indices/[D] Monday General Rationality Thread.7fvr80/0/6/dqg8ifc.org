This idea that we're supposed to be as happy as we're unhappy seems very strange to me. I'm trying to optimize for happiness here and the goal is to go between 0 and 10 and basically never be in the negatives for longer than a few minutes. Perhaps that counts as abnormal but still, why do you think it is supposed to be balanced?
