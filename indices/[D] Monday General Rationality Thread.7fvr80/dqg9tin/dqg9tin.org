I just had a revelation.

The whole debacle about the Star Trek transporter problem is actually down to a failure to consider [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing][Level 1+ intelligent characters.]]

For a Transporter clone to have a Tomato In The Mirror moment, would be tantamount to Thorin throwing down the key. Because if you lived in a world where you had been 'recreated' or 'transported' you would do a mental inventory using your introspective empathy and conclude you were not a 'meaningless copy of a dead guy, and not the real thing.' Much like what informs you /right now/ that you are indeed the genuine article.
