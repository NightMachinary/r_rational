Yep! It's usually called Pre-Earth Life or Preexistence.

I guess you could argue that a transporter clone could receive a preexistent soul that had not yet been born, but Mormonism puts a lot of weight on the importance of being born with a more or less blank slate and it would be really messy, theologically. At the very least, you would probably have to be re-baptized (or just baptized, since the point is that this soul has never been baptized, because it has never had a body before).

You would also still expect to meet copies of yourself in Heaven (unless you just ignored anything complicated/weird about your religion's beliefs, which I have to admit Mormons have been doing increasingly often over the past few generations).
