The first listed example is where I disagree. While it would certainly present a philosophical quandary, no sane human being would conclude "woe is me, I am without a soul" because we already know that only certain kinds of brain damage do that. A non-brain-damaged clone would feel just as 'ensouled' as the original, and ultimately people who believe in the existence of souls in the first place are prone to put a lot of stock in emotional introspection.

The second one throws a spanner in the works w.r.t. the gestalt information hypothesis, namely that everything that makes you /you/ is the information contained in your brain (hard to argue with) and the fact that there is no such thing as distinguishable atoms (EY argued at length for this in the infamously technically flawed QM sequence.) If you have a problem with a process so minimally disruptive as perfect replication of what can only be a sub-microsecond-long snapshot of your physiology, then I can only imagine the moral horror you must suffer from, say, general anesthesia, traumatic amputation and replacement by prosthetic limb, domoic acid intoxication, or cybernetic memory manipulation.

The third one is epistemologically correct. There are no clones, there are two originals. Trippy! But then so is the fact that almost everyone was once pushed naked and screaming through someone's birth canal.

Thought experiment:

Imagine for a moment that someone puts you under general anesthesia and when you wake up a very credible-looking person informs you that your entire body has been broken down and built up again, atom-by-atom. What is different about this thought experiment is that that is a lie: you were put under and woken up normally. However, everyone you meet for the rest of your life will insist that you were indeed transported.

You are, in this hypothetical, still you, 100%. No transporter clone shenanigans. Yet, all the data you have access to suggests otherwise.

Do you in this particular instance conclude that you are a 'soulless' clone and that the real you is dead?
