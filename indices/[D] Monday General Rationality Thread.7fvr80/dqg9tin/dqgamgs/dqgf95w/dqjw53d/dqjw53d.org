My view is that I am a (bio)chemical reaction that is sometimes aware of itself. That reaction is still continuous through sleep, general anesthesia and even a deep coma.

So a transporter would be the final end for me, and construct a new instance of me at the destination. In the fake transportation scenario I would be upset that there was a murder, but would still consider myself me (I do not believe in souls).

Although I would be very worried that the rebuilding process was flawed in some way, and possibly have mental issues trying to examine my own internal state for flaws (real or imagined).

And I would be /extremely/ pissed that it was done without my consent.
