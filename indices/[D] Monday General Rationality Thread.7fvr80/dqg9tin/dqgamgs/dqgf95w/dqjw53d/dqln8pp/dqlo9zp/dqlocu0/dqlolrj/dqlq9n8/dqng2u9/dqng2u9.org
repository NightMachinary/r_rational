I think I understand your argument better now, although I don't really define myself as my net impact on the universe.

#+begin_quote
  Donating to charities alleviates some of the worlds suffering, fighting for a political cause you believe in, etc.

  Hugging your mom/dad/next of kin as a show of affection makes the world a better place, saying a kind word to a service worker, posting a kitten picture on the net, etc.

These are not things I associate with my existance (I would still be me if I was imprisoned and prevented from hugging my mom, donating to charities and posting cat pictures), and are certainly things that can be done by a sufficiently convincing actor.

  You having a pleasant, fleeting thought which is forgotten and never again thought, never committed to paper, entirely and wholly ephemeral [...] That you have the hopes and dreams you have and exercise your personal freedom and that you feel the way you feel [...]

This is more relevant, but I feel we use different definitions of "you".

I am a chemical process. Another chemical process, albeit identical, is /another instance of me/. Unless there is a sudden reveal that /surprise!/ the religions were right - there is a soul and it can jump between bodies and other shenanigans.

My objection becomes more clear if you use a non-destructive scan in the teleporter scenario. Once the instance at the destination has been verified, you drag the original out to the back yard (begging and screaming) and shoot them.

The shorter you wait, and the more humane you make the execution, the closer to Star Trek we get. But it is still the termination of a perfectly viable instance of a person.

I see no reason to stop experiencing things, so that another instance of me can experience things.
