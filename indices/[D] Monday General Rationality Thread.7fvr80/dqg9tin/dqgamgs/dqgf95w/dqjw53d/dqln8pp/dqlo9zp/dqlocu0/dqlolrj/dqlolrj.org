I'm unfamiliar with the terminology you use.

In my example, the imposter is /sufficiently/ skilled (human or AI or whatever) to convince people I know that I am still alive (even if they may comment on my poor memory or tease me for some changes in taste, opinions, etc, they would still be convinced the impersonator to be me).

The key here is that it could be someone that is definitely /not me/, even an AI with no real self awareness, and it would be possible to leave the same "footprint" (or a better one, "I" could be awesome and make the lives of my friends much better!).

Still not relevant for terminating an instance of me.
