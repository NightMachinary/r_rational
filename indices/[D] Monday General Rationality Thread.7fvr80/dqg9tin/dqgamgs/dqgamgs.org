That rests on the assumption that the Transporter clone doesn't have particular theological or philosophical beliefs that would contradict the idea that you are the genuine article. For example:

- Souls exist, the only version of me with a soul (i.e. the original me) is dead, and I am a soulless version of the person who died. If souls have anything to do with the afterlife, as we might reasonably surmise, then I (the clone) will not have an afterlife, because I have no soul to outlive this body of mine, while the original me is in Heaven (or Hell, maybe...).
- What matters to my sense of identity is physical continuity: not that all of the planks in my personal Ship of Theseus have been there the whole time, but that there has always been a more-or-less complete ship the whole time. Going through the transporter deconstructs the ship, however, creating a moment when there is no ship, and the ship that appears later has a different line of continuity.
- I can accept that the version of me that is created by the transporter is the genuine article, but if we could just set up the transporter to create a version of me at my destination before the departing version is destroyed (or, perhaps, create two versions of me at my destination), we would see that there are actually multiple instances of me in existence, albeit not at the same time (unless we run this thought experiment for real). In other words, while I might be me, so was the original me, so there's a me that was alive and is now dead, and this is kind of weird for me to think about.

(The third one is the closest to my actual position on the matter, but I've been suicidal often enough that the idea that I'm killing myself with the transporter would probably be a relief at times, and if I had easy access to one then I might use it more often than actually required).
