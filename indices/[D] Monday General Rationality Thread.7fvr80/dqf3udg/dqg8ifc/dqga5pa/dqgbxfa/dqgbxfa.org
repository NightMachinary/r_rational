I agree that the usual intensity of highs and lows appears to be the same. It seems to be more general than that, applicable to all emotions, and there is quite a lot of variability in this emotional intensity between people. Of course, someone can be happy much more often than he is sad and vice versa but comparing the two for that person, their intensity seems to be similar.
