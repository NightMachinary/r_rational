I can't easily measure on a -10 to 10 scale of human experiences because I'm not sure what other people experience, but I can comparing my happiness levels at different times. Of course, this is all subject to the inaccuracy of memory.

At a wild (yet specific) guess, if a -10 is the worst /I've/ ever felt, and +10 is defined as being as good as -10 is bad, then I guess I've never passed +8. I exceed 3 maybe three of four times a month, now, and go below -3 about half as often. I don't go past 0.3 either way on most days, I'd say. If my memory is even vaguely reliable, though, this has varied a lot over time!: During the best part of my life, the extremes were pretty similar to now, but ordinary was closer to +0.6. During the worst part of my life, I spend some time below -3 more days than not. The average over my whole life is maybe +0.1 and the average in the last year close to +0.5.

This seems like a very small range compared to [[/u/eaturbrainz][u/eaturbrainz]], which is interesting, but I'm not quite sure what to make of it.

Edit: I don't know if it's a smaller range in an absolute sense, since there's no way to compare; I mean the range of an average day compared to the range of my most extreme experiences.
