I believe this is closely tied to how emotional you are in general. The more so, the more dramatic are the sadness/happiness oscillations. As somebody who spends about 98% of the time somewhere between 'mild annoyance' and 'mild amusement/contentment' I hestiate to describe myself as 'truly happy', but likewise I am certainly not upset/sad/depressed either. Most things that would upset/cheer up a more emotional person are just kind of 'eeh, whatever', and more dramatic stuff is muted.

No idea what 'loss of sense of self' is.
