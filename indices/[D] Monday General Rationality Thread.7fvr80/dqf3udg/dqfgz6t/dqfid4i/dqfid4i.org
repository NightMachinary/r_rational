  No idea what 'loss of sense of self' is.
#+end_quote

What I'm meaning is that there's no self-reflection or self-consciousness or, um, sense of "I." There's a loss of sense of time. "Being in the zone" is another (possibly insufficient) term for it.

There's just doing/experiencing what I'm doing/experiencing (usually, writing, but also sometimes gaming), and when I look back on the experience it's usually hard to say that there was any real emotional content to my experiences. It's what I would expect meditation to be like, but I haven't meditated so I'm just going off of what other people say about meditation.
