Let's suppose that the average person only experiences happiness within the range -10 to 10, where having more than 10 requires you to be drugged, and having less than -10 requires you to be actually under torture.

Then I would say that having more than 5 happiness requires you to be delusional. To have the kind of mindset that thinks the world is beautiful, that society is just, or that a wise benevolent omnipotent being is watching over us. Because that's the kind of thinking you need in order to feel things like "true friendship", "true love", "true happiness", and "spiritual fulfillment", whatever the hell those are.

Personally, I fluctuate between -1 and 3 in my daily life. 3 is really my maximum because I never forget that my state of happiness is an artificial construct that I keep up to avoid the health issues associated with depression. I reach that level by being so engrossed in a story or video game that I temporarily forget about the cruel reality I live in.

Whenever I drop the pretense and think about reality, about how natural selection is a nigh inescapable law of logic that is trying and succeeding at killing us all in exchange for more progeny, about how sheer random chance can and eventually will ruin absolutely anyone for no reason at all, about how any powerful being watching over us is clearly horribly incompetent or malicious, about how most of the sentient beings in this world are so delusional that they will pursue strange concepts of happiness even at the cost of screwing over the rest of us, and about how even being depressed about it will hurt my health cause natural selection thinks unhappy people aren't fucking enough to be worth keeping alive, I sit pretty firmly at about -7 to -5. Which is definitely not healthy and so I quickly put back up my bubble of denial.

On a happier note, I have never had issues about "loss of sense of self". The concept of some kind of "ideal self", like notions of "I'm supposed to do this with my life", or "this is what god designed for me", or "this is the meaning of my life" are essentially the delusions of delusional people who are so happy that they are inventing problems for themselves. Like when you beat a video game and then decide to try for a high score or a no-damage run or to complete every single achievement. You are artificially increasing the difficulty so you can find more challenge. But seeing as we live in a world where there are already countless life-threatening problems, why would you want to increase the difficulty more by insisting on completing the optional quests like finding out your "true self" or your "meaning of existence"? And those optional quests don't even have good rewards. It's not like finding out the meaning of life gives you +10 int or makes you immune to hunger.
