  ...I sit pretty firmly at about -7 to -5. Which is definitely not healthy and so I quickly put back up my bubble of denial.

  The concept of some kind of "ideal self", like notions of "I'm supposed to do this with my life", or "this is what god designed for me", or "this is the meaning of my life" are essentially the delusions of delusional people who are so happy that they are inventing problems for themselves.

It seems to me that what these people are doing and what you are doing isn't that different. They are comparing reality to their concepts of the "ideal self" and the "ideal life", it falls short and as a result, they are unhappy. Similarly, you seem to be comparing reality to your concept of the "ideal world" and of course you get the same results.

I don't think denial will lead to anything good here, it is nothing more than a temporary solution to the problem. Trying to change your view of the world also isn't likely to work because even though your model seems to be quite more pessimistic than mine, there definitely are problems in the world and it will always fall short of the "ideal world" that you want it to be.

It seems to me that the real problem in all cases above is the comparison itself, the expectation or hope for something to be better than it actually is. We can also go one level deeper and try to eliminate the "goodness/badness" judgement itself but this seems really hard to do and not such a good idea, these are useful.

I have only my own experience to base this on, so you might need some other approach but perhaps it might be helpful anyway. What works for me is to fix my expectations to my model of reality, which includes acceptance (or you would wish it were better => sadness). The other thing is to get rid of the standards that "should" be reached, just take the model as the baseline from which things can only get better (because if they get worse, the baseline gets updated and you're back to neutral/fine). In practice this leads to something like this - notice something good => happiness because good things are nice; notice something bad => neutral because it was as expected ("well, that's just how things are"). Probably acceptance here is the hardest part but the mindset to aim for might be something like "it sucks, but it's fine because that's what it is, no point in wishing it were different (as it is not)." It is still possible to accept it as the current state of affairs and then try to make it better, of course.
