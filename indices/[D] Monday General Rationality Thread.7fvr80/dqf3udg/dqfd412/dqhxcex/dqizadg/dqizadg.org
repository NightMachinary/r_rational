People's ability to aesthetically enjoy things varies more than you think.\\
For instance I've seen countless rainbows, sunsets, etc which were quite impressive by the standards of others when it comes to such things.\\
However I've never found any of those things to be more than just slightly neat looking, and basically never worth going outside to look at.

I suspect that if someone doesn't remember seeing a sunset it's probably because they didn't find them in any way impressive thus why they didn't remember them.
