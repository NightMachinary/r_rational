Hmmm. I think I see what you mean.

I find a lot of beauty in nebulae and stars, which make up the majority of the universe, so I think I could make a good argument that there is more beauty than non-beauty in the universe - but that's very different than arguing that the amount of beauty that a given person might run into in their entire life is a net positive, which it may very well not be (there's a lot of ugliness on Earth, too).
