[[/twiponder][]] A valid point. Then let me define 'beauty'.

'Beauty' is a measure of how pleasant it is to observe something. If a person has the option between observing (a) and (b), then the one that he would most like to observe (out of that set) is the more beautiful (to that person). So it's a scale, not a binary on/off state.

For the sake of having a defined zero point for the scale, I would also define 'zero beauty' as 'no sensory input at all'. (It is therefore possible to have negative beauty; this is assigned to anything that the person does not want to see).
