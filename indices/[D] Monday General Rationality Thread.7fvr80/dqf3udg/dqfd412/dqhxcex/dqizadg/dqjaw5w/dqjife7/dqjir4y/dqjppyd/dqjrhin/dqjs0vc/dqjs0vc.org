I mean it may be difficult to pin down every abstract concept, but that doesn't make it sensible to simply substitute in a definition which is extremely simple but doesn't actually capture most people's intuitions of that topic. You're just subtracting information in favor of only retaining the information which has no ambiguity.

Your original comment also doesn't make sense in this context because the OP was /clearly/ not referring to the trivial and weak form of beauty you're defining.
