While that definition works it kind of doesn't really seem like what was implied by your original comment (since it would translate to "there are things that are nice to look at in the world" which is a rather weak and trivial claim).

It also obviously says nothing about the quality of the valence induced by looking at something other than it's positive.\\
So for all those reason it's not a great approximation for standard usages of beauty.
