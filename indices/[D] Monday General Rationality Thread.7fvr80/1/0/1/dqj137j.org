Not going to lie, this just feels too good to be true (also pings some of my internal "the establishment is lying to you!" flags that tend to accompany contrarians/oddballs/etc who aren't actually /right/).

I /can/ confirm lasik took me from like a -8 prescription to 20/10 vision, but I also know it wont last as I age. If this can help stave off some of the effects of aging now that I'm in my 40s, I'd be happy to try it out - let me know if it works for you?
