Huh, this seems interesting. I've been considering lasik, but I know it doesn't work long term. Even if this only reduced my prescription, instead of eliminating it, it would be well worth it. Can you link me something that supports the usage of anticorrective lenses? I checked the article linked by gbear05, but would rather not rely on one source.

Also, instead of using anticorrective lenses, would it be possible to just not use my glasses while at the computer, while being just close enough to the screen to be able to read the text, while far enough away for it to be significantly blurry?
