Think of books in terms of their emotional 'payoff'. What's the emotional highlight that you're going to remember in 10 years?

Jim Butcher's Deadbeat is a "stand up and cheer" adventure story. I think there was a mystery plot. The world building is OK. But you read the book for the epic moment where [[#s][deadbeat spoiler]].

Heinlein's Stranger in a Strange Land is an "idea" sci-fi story. The characters do things. But, the point of the book is seeing where Heinlein goes with his conceit.

A romance novel might be about that moment where the male lead realizes he's utterly devoted the the female lead. A horror story might be about capturing a feeling of creeping-dread that will stick with you long after you put it down.

HPMoR's payoff was that it made me notice things. The plot was OK. The dialogue was often bad. The impact was reading a story where the characters thought like actual people. And, by extension, realizing how many stories relied on contrivance and stupidity to drive their plots.

That feeling of reading worlds with actually-intelligent characters is the thing that makes me read rational fiction.

Books written around a "payoff" need to nail their 1 outstanding aspect. The rest of the writing can be anywhere from good to merely serviceable. I think this is why the books seems "incompressible".

If you change the core bit, you're changing the heart of the book. Everything else is polish, since it's not why you were reading the book in the first place.
