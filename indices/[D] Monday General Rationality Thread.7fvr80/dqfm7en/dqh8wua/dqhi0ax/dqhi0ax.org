I... don't think so? You're definitely getting somewhere, and I think "not-stupid" is a good term for the concept I'm trying to outline, but there are thousands of ways to be engaged with reality, some of which can be knocked down with a lesser amount of reality.

I was thinking about it, and it's more like... being level-N complete? Like, you're level-1 complete if you've considered all reasonable level-1 arguments, and you can only be "outmatched" by a level-2 argument or higher. That doesn't mean the person making the argument needs to be level-2 or higher; but the argument needs to be.

Something like that, but less RPG-ish.
