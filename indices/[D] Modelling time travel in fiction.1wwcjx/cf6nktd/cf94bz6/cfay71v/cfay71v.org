Nah. We /know/ the universe has some randomness built in at the quantum level. We just also know that our cognitive processes are largely built out of much higher-level interactions where true quantum-level randomness almost definitely plays no part.

Which means that our descendents could possibly make fun of us for /not having had as much free will as them/, because /they've/ got /real/ randomness built into the part of their minds that's supposed to be random.
