  The *Novikov self-consistency principle*, also known as the *Novikov self-consistency conjecture*, is a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle][principle]] developed by Russian physicist [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igor_Dmitriyevich_Novikov][Igor Dmitriyevich Novikov]] in the mid-1980s to solve the problem of [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox][paradoxes]] in [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_travel][time travel]], which is theoretically permitted in certain solutions of [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity][general relativity]] (solutions containing what are known as [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_timelike_curve][closed timelike curves]]). Stated simply, the Novikov consistency principle asserts that if an event exists that would give rise to a paradox, or to any "change" to the past whatsoever, then the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability][probability]] of that event is zero. In short, it says that it is impossible to create [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_paradox][time paradoxes]].
