I really don't like fixed time travel. It might make sense on the face of it, but it quickly becomes the case that any time travel in the universe would have to be iniated/designed by the universe.

And it almost completely breaks as soon as you remember the universe is made of atoms not even getting to the quantum. To even concieve that all the atoms would somehow perfectly return to the exact poisition and speed so they can complete a stable loop is just so absurd. Also it requires the universe has no random elements or free will.
