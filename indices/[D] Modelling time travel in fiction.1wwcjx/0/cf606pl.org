I love time travel with a burning passion, and this is one of my favorite bits of summation.

The biggest thing that I can add here is that the "Single Sensitive History" and "Multiple Sensitive History" have one big distinction between them - if you're in the Single Sensitive History universe, you can never see the time machine work unless you're inside it. Single Sensitive History also seems like it can get trapped in a loop pretty easily - if the universe gets stuck in a self-consistent loop, it just keeps rewriting itself.

I also think that short-shrift is given to the BTTF model, which you can make much more consistent than it is in the movie. When someone goes backwards in time, the changes propagate forward at /n/ seconds per second. If the rate is two seconds per second, after I go backwards in time two minutes, you would have one minute to do whatever you wanted before you were overwritten. This is the form used in [[http://www.achrongame.com/site/][the RTS game Achron]]. Of course, you'd have to change a lot of BTTF if you wanted to make this work - the fading pictures thing wouldn't really work, you'd have to do a dramatic countdown instead.

Also, one of my favorite time travel possibilities is having the universe /look/ like one model of time travel while /being/ a different model of time travel. Terminator uses Fixed History, while Terminator 2 uses Sensitive History (or multiple timelines if you don't trust what the characters say), and I've always thought that was more of a feature than a bug.
