[[http://qntm.org/streetmentioner][His article on using the English language to describe time travel is also worth reading]].

I once outlined a story about a student who through absurd chance accidentally invents a time-travel device that fits in a backpack. It takes an eight foot sphere backwards or forwards in time (but not space, relative to the earth) according to the commands issued via smartphone. However, it cannot go back before it was invented and going forwards is ludicrously dangerous because you don't know what's going on at your destination.

However, this story was a Single Loop (sort of) which leads to dozens upon dozens of instances of the protagonist, antagonist, and various other characters all running around and trying to solve the chaos over the course of a single weekend. It was the sort of story where the protagonist forms a squad of himself to carry out tasks. From the outside it looks lik the task happened only once, while to him he experienced it X times, as a different instance each time.
