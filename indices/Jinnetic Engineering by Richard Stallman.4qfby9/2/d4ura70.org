  your wish is supposed to be selfish, so that the aftermath can prove how foolish you were. Where would we jinns be, granting wise and noble wishes

I was a little disappointed; this premise was set up to clearly show that this was an evil genie and the main character would need to be clever to get around the downsides, yet that just got dropped. There are any number of ways this could have backfired, yet everything worked out perfectly with little effort.
