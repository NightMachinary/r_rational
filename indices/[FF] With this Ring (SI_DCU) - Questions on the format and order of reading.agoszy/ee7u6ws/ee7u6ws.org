[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-story-only.25076/][The Story Only Archive]] has the entire thing in one thread without other people's posts interfering with the reading experience. You can just read that entire thread and be up to date - the author updates story-only and main threads simultaneously.

The threads with discussion in them have exactly the same story content but also people discussing every update; this discussion can be interesting at times but is definitely not required to understand the story, and most people will read the story-only portion and then join the the thread discussing the recent updates. The threads run into number-of-post-per-thread limits for the server occasionally, so they're actually spread over ... thirteen threads, right now. If you want to read all of those long threads full of comments, you can. But again it's completely unnecessary.

The current [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-thread-thirteen.49418/][thread full of comments]] also has a table of contents and a FAQ. The FAQ is probably good for new readers to check out. In particular, /the bit about a secondary 'renegade' AU storyline delineated by red-text time in the start of a section/ is good to know about.
