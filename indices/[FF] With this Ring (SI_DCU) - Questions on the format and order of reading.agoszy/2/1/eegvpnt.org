Yeah, I don't think that there's any easy way to get a full word count. SpaceBattles doesn't seem to do word counts at all. I've come across an ebook generator that would work on Sufficient Velocity, but it relied on threadmarks, so it couldn't download the whole Story Only thread. There have been estimates of the total word count, but I don't know if there's an authoritative count for the SB portion.
