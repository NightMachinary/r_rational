This is the beginning of the story-only thread that Zoat updates every day. It has links to the discussion threads at the bottom in his signature if you're logged into the site.

It can be a little confusing because sometimes Zoat jumps around but paying attention to the color of the timestamps is a good indicator for whats going on. The story splits between paragon!paul and renegade!paul (who refers to himself by another name). Occasionally alternate versions and perspective come into the story but reading the posts in order is the best way to follow it.

To explain the discrepancy, Zoat began writing this story on SpaceBattles until the new Star Wars movies came out. The mods there declared no spoilers for SW anywhere on the site and Zoat made a post that passingly mentioned the Millennium Falcon in it. He was then arbitrarily banned for a day, told them to eat shit and took his story over to SV instead, where he currently updates it once a day.
