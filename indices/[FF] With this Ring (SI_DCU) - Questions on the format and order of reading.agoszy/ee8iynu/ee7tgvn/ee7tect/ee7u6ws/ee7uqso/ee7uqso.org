I've dipped into the comment threads, and there's some additional contextual information (e.g. why there will never be a plot line in the Teen Titans Go! or Titans universe), so if you have a /lot/ of free time, you might want to find Thread 1 and go from there, for the full experience.

That said, I have been following the Story Only thread almost exclusively, and if there's information I've missed out on by not reading the Comment threads, the work doesn't suffer for its omission.
