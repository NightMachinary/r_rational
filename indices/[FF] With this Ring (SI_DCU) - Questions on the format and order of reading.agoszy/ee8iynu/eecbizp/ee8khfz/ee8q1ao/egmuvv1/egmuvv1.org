If you are using chrome, then you can find all the text on a page that's red by right clicking the page, selecting "Inspect" and searching "color: red". As the Renegade parts begin with the usual (date, time) headings colored red, that should work for finding all of them on a page. If you want a faster search, then after story details diverge, you can use keywords based on the differences >! !> like Father Box, Boom Tube, Grayven, Darkseid, Apokolips, which start working before page 16 (according to the URLS) .<! !<

Additionally, it's possible that when it got moved to a new site, the 2 stories didn't get bundled together. (As I read it through, I tried to keep track of the Renegade parts, but I haven't finished reading the whole thing yet, so that list is incomplete.)
