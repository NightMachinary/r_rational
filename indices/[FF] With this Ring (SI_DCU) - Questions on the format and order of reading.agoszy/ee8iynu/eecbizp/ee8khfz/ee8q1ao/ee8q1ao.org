Just FYI, the Renegade part really depends upon you knowing the events that happened in the other timeline, as he'll assume you have the information when he's coming at a similar scenario from a different perspective. I feel like you won't really get the full gist or experience without it.

And honestly, one of my favorite scenes, where he dresses down the Justice League for their incompetence by ripping apart each superhero's method of doing things (like why doesn't Superman carry a radiations shield any of the green lanterns could have made from him easily, or Wonder woman for her impractical armor, etc) is on the regular timeline.
