It's nonobvious but fairly straightforward. To read only the renegade sections of wtr, do the following.

Go to the [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-thread-thirteen.49418/][main discussion page]].

Scroll down to the boxes labelled "Spoiler: Episode number, Title". Click these to expand a list of posts for that episode. They don't actually contain spoilers; Zoat is just using the feature for formatting.

Some posts will be labelled "(supplementary, Renegade option.)" Those are what you're looking for.

If an episode is entirely focused around the renegade, then instead there will be posts labelled "(supplementary, SI option)". In that case, you want to read every other post within that episode.
