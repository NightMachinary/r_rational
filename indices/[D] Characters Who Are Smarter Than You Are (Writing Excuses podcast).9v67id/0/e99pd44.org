  So, Max Gladstone and I have co-written a novella that is coming out in probably... I think it's... Probably, I think it's July 2019. It's a book of two dueling time traveling super spies. One written by Max and one written by me. I have a number of insecurities in this regard because, first of all, I mean, they're time traveling super spies, they have all of time and space at their disposal, they are the best there... They are the best there are at what they do. But Wolverine quote, "And what they do is not very nice." Etc. So, they're brilliant, and they're constantly outsmarting each other and one upping each other. I am not a time traveling superspy.

Wow, I've had the same premise in the back of my head for years, but I could never think of an interesting story to tell or coherent way to synch the timelines such that neither side of the conflict got immediately wiped from existence; I'll certainly be looking at this.
