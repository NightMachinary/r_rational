I think a well-hidden dead man's switch in the past set to cause catastrophic consequences were it to go untriggered would suffice to ensure neither side was wiped from the timeline. However, it'd have to be a "natural" deadman's switch, so that its creation wouldn't be butterflied away by whatever event undoes the existence of the rival agency. It's difficult to imagine how an equilibrium like that could come into existence, how either agency would stumble on some deviation from the original timeline they'd consider mission critical to maintain, that'd simultaneously be secret from their opposition, that wouldn't incidentally be destroyed by all the other mucking about they're doing in times predating that point.

Another possibility is to make them sister splinters of the same original agency, such that changes to one's origins destabilize the others', although this obviously has holes. Similarly, each side has moles in the other's agency, then whenever one group is wiped out a remnant of the other would always be able to rebuild the opposition. But that's highly unstable. Figuring out how to make the deadman's switch work seems like the most promising avenue.

There's also the problem that two people traveling in time "simultaneously" makes very little sense. One of them has to trump the other. That it's much less clear how to begin getting a handle on. You could perhaps do an endless back-and-forth, but I think it'd seem contrived.
