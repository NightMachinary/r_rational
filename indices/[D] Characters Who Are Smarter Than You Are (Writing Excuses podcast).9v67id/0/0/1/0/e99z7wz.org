Maybe something along the lines of the time travel isn't controlled by the protagonist/antagonist, but instead by the politics of whatever agency they work for? Although a smart agent should, in theory, also be able to influence that...

Maybe a time-travel agency which has taken its own existence outside the 'core' timeline (if such a thing could be said to exist), so it can't be retroactively interfered with because the events leading up to its creation no longer exist anyway?
