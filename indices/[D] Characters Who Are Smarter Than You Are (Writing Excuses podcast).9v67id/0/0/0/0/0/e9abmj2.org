Yeah, it's hard but not impossible to have multiple time-travelling agents in the same story.

One example which handles this well is HPMoR, in which nothing (not even information) can time-travel more than six hours into the past, and trying to take too much advantage of time travel tends to lead to trouble ("DO NOT MESS WITH TIME").

Another example that's well-handled is the time travel arc in PS238 - there's actually multiple time travel arcs, with the same events seen from the perspective of first the protagonist, then (not in the same order) by a time-travelling antagonist, and both of them make perfect sense from their character's personal points of view (and also, they most certainly are not the same person).
