Ah, but the thing is, the information I am exchanging with the future time traveller did not originate in my future.

Let's consider a concrete example. I wish to travel from 12:00 noon to 06:00 in the morning, the full six hours.

At 17:00 that evening, a time traveller travels back to 11:00 - again, the full six hours - and walks past me in the corridor. The left side of my body is very slightly warmed by his body heat.

Now, if I go back to 06:00, then the information that can be extracted from an incredibly close reading of my body heat is "someone walked past the left side of me" (and possibly some features about that person). This incident happened at 11:00; thus, the information only travelled back in time five hours, and has not gone back in time more than the six-hour limit.

That's the First Scenario. Let's consider also the Second Scenario. The only difference is that, in the Second Scenario, when the time traveller walks past me he states (in a loud, clear voice) the result of a horse race that finished at 15:00. Since I now have information on an event that happened at 15:00, I cannot travel back in time to before 09:00.
