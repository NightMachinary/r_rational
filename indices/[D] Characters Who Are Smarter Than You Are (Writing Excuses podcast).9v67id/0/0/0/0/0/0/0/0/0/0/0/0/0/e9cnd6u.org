Hmmm. I see your point. But there is a fairly straightforward way to patch this plot hole.

/Fidelus/ is canon to Harry Potter - a spell that causes a secret to be magically bound, and in such a way that it /cannot/ be revealed except by the conscious, deliberate choice of one person (the Secret Keeper).

So, perhaps the time-travel spell has a built-in /Fidelus/ - the time traveller /cannot/ reveal information about the future except by means of conscious, deliberate choice. (This spell would probably change the time traveller's skin temperature to equal to the average temperature of the room he appeared in, plus a random low-amplitude white noise, or something similar to that).
