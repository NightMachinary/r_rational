I don't think you are getting the general point, which is that the way physics works you can infer things about the second time traveler just by passing by him. There is no "decision that wasn't influenced by the future of the second time traveler" as that is human talk. The second you two exchange photons of any sort you have exchanged information. It's done. Getting some useful human level decisions out of that information is a separate unrelated matter. If no information could ever travel back in time, then the second a time traveler pops up in your light cone maximum amount of time turning you could do would get sharply reduced, because the second they pop up in your light cone you have exchanged information.
