  You pass by a fireplace that another time traveler lit up, left half of your body heats up a bit, then one minute later you go back in time.

You are carrying with you the information that a fire was lit a few minutes before you left. That information did not travel back in time to get to you - the time traveller lit the fire in your present, thus no information is moving back in time more than six hours even if you rewind the full six hours.

Now, that assumes that the future time traveller's decision to light that fire wasn't influenced by anything in your future. If the other time traveller's decision to light the fire was made (say) one hour after your time, then the presence of the fire indicates some information originating from one hour in your future. In this case, you can travel back through time no more than five hours, maximum, because you are carrying with you information from one hour in your future.
