Come on, this isn't a patch, this simply shifts the problem over to the fidelius spell. It's still somehow this complicated decision algorithm that decides what to reveal and what not to based on what someone else could perceive and deduce. There is no way to patch this without just biting the bullet and saying "yeah magic tries to guess how good other people are at guessing what happens in the future based on this physical information", certainly no simple patch that would just introduce a simple physical law that would handle everything.
