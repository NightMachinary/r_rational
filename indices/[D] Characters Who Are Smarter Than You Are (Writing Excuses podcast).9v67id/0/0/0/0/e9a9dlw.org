True. It's a half-expected plot twist in this day and age; it'd have to be done really well and/or maybe have an additional twist in there somewhere. Maybe the antagonist isn't actually a single future self, but two (or even three) possible selves, fighting to gain control of which of them the current protagonist will become.
