Seems like the easiest start would be for neither protagonist to know who the other is. The first one would be going about their life, using their powers successfully, when one day events that they're rehearsed in a loop failed to work, because the loop changed. This alerts them both that there's another traveller, but any attempts they make to find each other alter events, which makes it impossible to plan a trap for the other.

The really smart stuff would come out of solving that seemingly-impossible situation.
