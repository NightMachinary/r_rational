  used up all the vampire pushing energy!"

Just because there's an energy source doesn't mean it's feasibly exhaustible. Despite all the things that have been dropped over the years, gravity still works on Earth. If the energy source is the vampires, then it's not going to run out. If the energy source is a deity, then it may last as long as they're around (or care).

  Can the star of david repel vampires too?

That varies from story to story. I've seen one answer that explicitly with 'If the vampire is jewish. Crosses only work on christian vampires. If a vampire loses faith, /nothing/ works.'

An author could also say 'it works with any religion!', or any suitably large religion because they've got enough worshippers that they have the power to help them out, or 'it works if the person holding the symbol believes'.
