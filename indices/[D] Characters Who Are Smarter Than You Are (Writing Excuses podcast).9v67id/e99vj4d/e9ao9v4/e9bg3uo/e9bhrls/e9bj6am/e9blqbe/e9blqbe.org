Well, point is that show could have easilly had a different moral of "if %relatable thing% happens, then deal with it directly". I haven't watched it, but take that immortal vampire stalker thing. Suppose she only found out he was stalking her after he was doing that for a couple months (making the setup relatively relatable), but when she did, she immediately set up traps against him. Would be a much more uplifting moral imo.
