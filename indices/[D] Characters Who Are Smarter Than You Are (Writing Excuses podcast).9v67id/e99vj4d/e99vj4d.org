It's also important to recognize when you /shouldn't/ have smart characters. I binged watched the first 3 seasons of Buffy, and the thing that constantly stood out in my mind (aside from "Willow and Oz are such a cute couple!") was how dumb everyone was. At one point we learn Evil Angel has been sneaking into Buffy's room at night and drawing her, as part of an evil taunting thing. To which my response was "Wait, /what/? Buffy has known a centuries old monster has been out to kill her personally for months now, and she is just now thinking about home security? Are you SERIOUS!?".

But the thing is the point of the show is to be a metaphor for normal teenage girl problems, and Evil Angel is a metaphor for a stalker ex boyfriend. So Buffy being smart and placing garlic in her window, or making all her friends carry crosses and holy water on them at all times, would 100% stop Evil Angel from doing anything. But that breaks the metaphor, because real teenage girls don't have stalker ex-boyfriend garlic they can hang in their window and they don't have Holy Crosses of Ex-Boyfriend Repellent they can hand out to their friends. So for the sake of the story, she must be an idiot to make her relatable.

I feel like all but the most locked down magic systems operate on this principle too, of placing drama over intelligence. It's simply too hard to prevent loopholes creeping into your magic system, and eventually you have to just have to introduce an arbitrary line in the sand to avoid your universe becoming ridiculous. For example in True Blood, when a vampire is uninvited from a house a force slowly pushes them to the nearest exit. No big deal you think? Nope, that's infinite energy and reactionless drives right there. Eventually an author just has to throw up his hands and say "Screw it, for the sake of preserving the relatability of this universe you cannot build a space house rocket ship using vampires as the fuel. In-universe logic be damned, this is the line we cannot cross".

Rationalist fiction is unique in placing in-universe logic ahead of real world drama, but it's sometimes useful to remember that it's not the only choice we can make.
