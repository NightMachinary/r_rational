  For example in True Blood, when a vampire is uninvited from a house a force slowly pushes them to the nearest exit.

Which kind of makes me wonder why no-one dealing with vampires has rigged up a house where there's only one exit, made of solid iron, and it can be partially closed until it's about one foot across. Uninvite one or more vampires from /that/ place and there's some squelching and screaming going to be happening.
