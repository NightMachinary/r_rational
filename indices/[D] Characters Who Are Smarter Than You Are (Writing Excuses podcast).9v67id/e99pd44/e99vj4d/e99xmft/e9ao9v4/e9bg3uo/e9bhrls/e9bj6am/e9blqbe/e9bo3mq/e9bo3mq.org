  Suppose she only found out he was stalking her after he was doing that for a couple months (making the setup relatively relatable), but when she did, she immediately set up traps against him. Would be a much more uplifting moral imo.

There's a strong political element to the idea of people taking up weapons to defend themselves. In Canada it's straight up illegal for anyone to carry /any/ kind of weapon for self defense, even pepper spray. You have to pretend you're carrying the spray for "bear protection" (The most dangerous kind of bear walks on two legs, so not entirely a lie?) or you'll get slapped with criminal charges. So the show might also not want to have Buffy defeat Angel through the use of weapons because it offends their politics that teenage girls might be trying to do the real life equivalent (e.g. get a gun).

Personally I definitely would've enjoyed the show more if Buffy was a rationalist and just started carrying a Glock full of wooden bullets. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayoR0jF0vuY][Buffy drops the karate gimmicks and just lays out a mofo]]

You need to watch it /right now/. It is a seminal piece of television that still mostly holds up to this very day. Tv tropes itself began as an attempt to catalogue all the tropes Buffy subverted and played with - only later did it evolve into covering all shows, and eventually all media.
