How exactly would that work. You pass by a fireplace that another time traveler lit up, left half of your body heats up a bit, then one minute later you go back in time. Does time turner cool your body down? To what temperature? Heat gets distributed through your whole body, it's not just some dust on the surface you can pick up and throw away, it's velocities of molecules in your body. In that minute they had enough time to do a billion billion collisions which would have gone differently if the photons didn't carry all that extra energy in. What position and velocities does the time turner roll them back to?

Your body had to work a bit less hard at heating you up in that minute, and therefore spent a bit less ATP or whatever cells use for pure heat production. Does the extra unspent ATP get teleported out? Which molecules and how would it decide which ones to leave and which ones to keep?

Say you passing by that fireplace caused you to remember the time when you were listening to grandma stories about fireplaces as a kid. Does timeturner edit your memory so you aren't thinking about that when you go back in time? If so, what are you thinking about?

Hell, people can read minds here. Do you forget the fact that there was any fireplace there at all? Otherwise, someone could read your mind and thus see the fireplace and thus be capable of receiving some kind of signal from the second time traveler.

In general, if you try to make a semblance of sanity of this, you'd have to conclude that when you timeturn, timeturner, like, loads up the entire state of the universe X hours back, finds all time travelers within that state, somehow...deletes them and anything they did without actually deleting them or the things they did, simulates that state /forwards/ up until the moment where you'd have gone back in time, and then copies the state your body is in at that moment and sends /that/ back in time...

...which rather obviously would violate continuity of thought in all sorts of ways, and doesn't seem to happen.

Or you could claim magic makes guesses about what people would be able to tell from the state of the person being sent back in time and screws with that, at which point we are back to my theory.
