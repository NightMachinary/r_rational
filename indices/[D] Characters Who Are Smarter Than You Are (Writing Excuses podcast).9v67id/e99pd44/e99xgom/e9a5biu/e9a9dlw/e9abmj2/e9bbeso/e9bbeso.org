  in which nothing (not even information) can time-travel more than six hours into the past

It's weird and kinda inconsistent. It can but it also can't. If it was a hard limit, then there could be only one time traveler in the world at any given time. If there were at least two and they, say, passed by one another on the street without talking, their bodies would surely exchange all sort of information - infrared photons, dust, particles of skin and hair if they bumped into one another, various chemicals one of them exhaled and another one inhaled, gravitational waves, etc, etc, etc. A sufficiently good analyzer then could deduce the fact of their meeting (and the state either of them was in during the meeting) just by observing one of them, which could allow them to receive information from further ahead than 6 hours.

What actually seems to be happening is that only information that someone consciously tries to use can't travel into the past. So that whole stuff about hair being exchanged would lead to a paradox if and only if there is a DNA analyzer nearby that intends to check one of them for hair and use that information to deduce information from 6+ hours into the future. Which, fair enough, a lot of magic seems consciousness - focused, maybe magic is a grumpy GM that slaps down any mage that tries to go above 6 the hour limit. But that's not, in principle, an inherent limit of the laws, it seems.
