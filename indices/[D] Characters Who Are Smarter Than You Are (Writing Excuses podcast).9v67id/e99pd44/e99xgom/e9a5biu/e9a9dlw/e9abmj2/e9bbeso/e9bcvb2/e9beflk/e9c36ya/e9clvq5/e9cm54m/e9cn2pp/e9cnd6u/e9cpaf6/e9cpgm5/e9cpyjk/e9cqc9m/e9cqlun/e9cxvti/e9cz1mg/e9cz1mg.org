  "An immensely complex spell involving the magical concealment of a secret inside a single, living soul. The information is hidden inside the chosen person, or Secret-Keeper, and is henceforth impossible to find --- unless, of course, the Secret-Keeper chooses to divulge it. As long as the Secret-Keeper refused to speak, You-Know-Who could search the village where Lily and James were staying for years and never find them, not even if he had his nose pressed against their sitting room window!"

  Despite watching the gap between numbers 11 and 13 when on the lookout for Harry, the house remained invisible to [the death eaters] until Yaxley grabbed onto Hermione Granger's arm while she, Harry, and Ron Weasley Disapparated away from the Ministry of Magic to 12 Grimmauld Place, where they had been hiding.

So it's clearly hidden even if you know exactly where it by all rights should be. In the movies there is a scene where house 12 kinda slides out of a pocket dimension between houses 11 and 13 pushing them aside when it's Revealed to the people. Only reason they even know where to find the house (between 11 and 13) is that it was known to people before where Black's manor was.
