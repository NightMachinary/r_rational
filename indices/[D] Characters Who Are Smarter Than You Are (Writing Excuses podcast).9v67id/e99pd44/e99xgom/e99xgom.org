Yup. Time travel is difficult. You have to have a setup where a smart, ruthless character couldn't simply jump back in time as far as possible and control everything which happened subsequently, or jump back in time and tinker with their opponent's time travel gear/ability from the start, or erase their opponent from history, or jump back to /themselves/ and give themselves ALL the advantages from the start (or do it sneakily if there are fixed loops or paradoxes).

The whole thing has to be solid in four dimensions and logical from the viewpoint of each character at any given moment in their personal timeline. It's not easy to come up with a scenario which supports that, unless you have restrictions like "the time machine only works when it's convenient to the plot".
