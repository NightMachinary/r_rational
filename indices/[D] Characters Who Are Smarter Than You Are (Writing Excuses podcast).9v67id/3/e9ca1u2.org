  It took me a few days to figure that out. She does it in seconds. I'm very proud of it.

I think this is another big thing about writing intelligent characters - you have all the time in the world to think of solutions and logical processes, and then you can write that out as happening in seconds/minutes. As well as the fact that, as the author, you already likely know what's going on everywhere, or at least have a good idea, so you already know what kind of conclusions you want your character to reach.
