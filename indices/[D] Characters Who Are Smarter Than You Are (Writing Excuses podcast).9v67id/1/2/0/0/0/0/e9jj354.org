  There isn't any way to salvage this thing. Either this setting is insanely goofy, or you just put your foot down and say "No, I decide it arbitrarily does not work like that. End of story. Flying box vampires do not exist in my universe."

I have a tendency to reject arguments of the form 'there is no way' in the absence of a compelling reason to believe 'it is impossible to come up with a way'. (For example, there can be no perpetual motion machines because 'one of the laws of thermodynamics says it's impossible'.)
