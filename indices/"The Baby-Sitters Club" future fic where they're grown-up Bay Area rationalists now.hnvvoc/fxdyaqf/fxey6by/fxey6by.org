So we've got rational fics of Baby-Sitter's Club and Animorphs, which of K. A. Applegate's series should get rational fanfics next?

Everworld is already a heavily rational take on being dropped into another world and/or mythology being real. It's either aged very well or very badly, as the real big baddie are a traitor in the party and neo-Nazis with guns. It also has characters struggling with their perception of reality.

Remnants is a horror story of a spaceship full of refugees who leave the Earth just Bef its destruction by meteor, and wake up millennia later on a spaceship that their own ship was picked up by, and find themselves mutating over time and contending with the other inhabitants of that ship.
