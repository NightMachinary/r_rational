In one of the ghostwritten books, Visser Three is hit by a de-aging ray and they have to raise him.

It's an adorable story, and a lot of fanfic will come of it, but by and large the readership will agree that it just doesn't make any more sense than the Helmacron Tournament Arc, and few people will view it as canon.
