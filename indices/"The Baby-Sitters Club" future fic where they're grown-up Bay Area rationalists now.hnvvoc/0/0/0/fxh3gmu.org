  uber for babysitting? What could possibly go wrong
#+end_quote

That's the problem, I was sitting on this for about six months because I didn't have any sort of plot in mind. Just like, "Stacey is a biohacker", "Dawn is working in clean meat", "Mary Anne is a computer programmer" (a bit of a stretch but it kinda works).

So I guess at best I'll write a vignette about each of them and call it a day. At worst... just Kristy and Mary Anne.

Because yeah, really not inspired to write a story about how a startup gets its wings, as much as I'd like a rat!BSC to happen.
