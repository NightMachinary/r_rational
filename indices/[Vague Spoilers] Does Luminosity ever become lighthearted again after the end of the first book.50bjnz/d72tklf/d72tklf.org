I just wanted to say, I completely understand your reaction. Luminosity was the first story I ever stopped reading because things got dark... And I've read a lot of dark things. I didn't swear off it or anything, I just decided to take a break to process what had happened. One day I'll do a writeup of how amazing that ending was, and why it punched so much harder for me than so many other stories.

But for now I'll say that things don't ever get that bad again, and while it doesn't quite turn into a lighthearted romp, the ending of Radiance is... A bit too much in the opposite direction from the first, to be honest. Hard to explain without spoilers, but I can elaborate if you want. In any case, I think you'll be okay, and should enjoy it :)
