As Alicorn says, /Effulgence/ is Earthfic and then it's suddenly really, really not. If you've gotten to wishcoins or Milliways and you're not entertained yet, deciding it's not your thing and moving on is totally fair (you can skim through most everything before wishcoins if it's boring you). Alternatively, you can try the Animorphs or Shell Bell arcs, which are both fun.

If you want something a bit faster paced, [[http://unprophesied-of-ages.dreamwidth.org/495.html?style=site][this]] might be for you (crossover between /Mistborn/ and Alicorn's Fairyland; one of Alicorn's most popular non-/Effulgence/ glowfics).

Be warned: like Fugu said, glowfic has some rather strange conventions. Ridiculous bullshit magic is a staple of the genre, although Magic A is essentially always Magic A. On the other hand, the ridiculous bullshit can often be totally /awesome/, though I wouldn't like to spoil why.
