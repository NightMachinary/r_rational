/Radiance/ has a higher dark-to-light ratio than /Luminosity/.

Alternative option: /Effulgence/ is super happy and fun for the vast majority of the time (except when it's horrifying and the universe becomes positively hellish, but that's only <5% of time), and it always rebounds and ascends to higher fun levels.

It can also totally be read without reading /Radiance/, which is what I did.
