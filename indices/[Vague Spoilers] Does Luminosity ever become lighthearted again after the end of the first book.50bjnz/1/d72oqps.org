I think /Radiance/ definitely is more light-hearted and enjoyable than the later portions of /Luminosity/. /Radiance/ deals much more with interesting vampire powers than with werewolves and drama, IIRC. I've read /Radiance/ at least twice, and /Luminosity/ only about 1.5 times.

I've read neither book in months (years?), though, so I may be misremembering.
