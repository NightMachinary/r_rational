The tooth kick isn't /that/ hard. Maybe you need to increase the bone strength of your jaw. Do some weight bearing exercises. Take some calcium supplements.

I mean look at me, my jaw is chiseled. When I want something lighthearted I pick up some WH40K and start rereading Elfen Lied. /I eat The Broadcast for breakfast/.

Seriously though, different preferences for different people sure, but I feel that there's a lot of great culture you'll miss out on if you can't ever bring yourself to read the dark stuff.

As for luminosity/radiance, there is sunlight (and sparkly vampires) at the end of the tunnel. But the ride there won't be a particularly happy one.
