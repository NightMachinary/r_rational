Agreed, The Broadcast wasn't even remotely affecting, for me. As I [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4pdzqr/unsong_interlude_%D7%99_the_broadcast/d4kfcrw][mentioned in that chapter's discussion]], torturing billions of faceless, nameless people (even if you describe their faces, even if you tell me their names) for eternity is just statistics.

Now, making me care about a character first, knowing them for chapters and chapters, empathizing with them, THEN having them get tortured or mindraped or killed... that'll put a dent in my armor, sure enough. When [[/u/scottalexander]] sends someone we know and like to hell, that's when the gloves will really come off.

But like [[/u/gabbalis]] said, different preferences for different people. Personally, I wouldn't even consider Warhammer 40k remotely "dark," for the aforementioned reason: it's too absurdly over the top and impersonal in its horror and cartoonish levels of gore. But the ending to Luminosity? That emanated Despair, with a capital D.
