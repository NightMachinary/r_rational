To me, "toughen up and get used to gruesome stories. You're missing out on some great literature" is about as useful advice as "listen, if you can't just learn French so you can read Camus and Voltaire in the original language, you're missing out." like yes, you're technically right, but the reward just doesn't measure up to the task.
