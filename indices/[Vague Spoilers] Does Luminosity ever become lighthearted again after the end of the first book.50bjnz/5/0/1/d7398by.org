Actually living in North Korea.

Seriously though, stuff like Elfen Lied did make me cry the first time, but through a process similar to Borg Adaptation my feels gain total immunity after a couple hits from any given form of attack. Which is a shame, because I enjoy the feeling of Sorrow in the same way horror movie and haunted house fanatics enjoy Terror.
