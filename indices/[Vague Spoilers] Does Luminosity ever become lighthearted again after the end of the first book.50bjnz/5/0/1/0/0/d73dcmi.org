Taylor lives in a hopeless setting, yet just barely succeeds by the skin of her teeth again and again. It's tons of fun, but it just leads to mounting hope in the face of despair. Which... isn't a recipe for sorrow.

If you write it in the reverse, and you write it well, then you have mounting despair in the face of hope. And that's a good recipe for sorrow. You know what? I think I have a perfect, succinct, well known example. The song Pompeii by Bastille perfectly contrasts hope and hopelessness in a way that consistently triggers the feeling for me. If you feel like spending 40 hours of your life playing through one of my favorite point and click adventure series instead, the Deponia series also has that sort of structure.

I do appreciate Worm's Slaughterhouse 9. It's similar to Broadcast in that they both give a wholehearted try at fleshing out the concept of evil into the most debaucherously twisted form the author can manage. Masterfully blending psychological horror, body horror, classic fears of pain and death: In short, I appreciate them in an artistic sense. Like looking at the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_Devouring_His_Son][painting of Saturn devouring his son]].
