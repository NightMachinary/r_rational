Yep. When I saw someone complain about Worm being grimdark after I read it, I had to mentally pause and think "Huh... I guess it is. But it never felt that way to me while reading it."

Because of Taylor. Tell the story of Worm with anyone else as the main protagonist, and it's just oozing with despair and crapsack world. But Taylor was relentlessly focused and rational and pragmatic. Before long it became clear that she would never give up, never, no matter how stacked the odds. That she would always fight, and try to pull victory from the jaws of defeat. Even after failing to save everyone, she would give it her best, and sometimes succeed. And I believed in her.

And, for the most part, that kept the darkness at bay.
