I agree that the rapefest is utterly tasteless.

However, I did quite enjoy the rest of the story. No, the protagonist is not HPMOR-style brilliant, but the story is still a decent deconstruction of all the usual fantasy stories. It is kind of nice to read a story for once where adventurers act more like a SWAT team and less like muscle brains.

I also liked the little details like the kid swinging his sword around too much so the others can't help him, and getting it stuck against the cave wall. That sort of thing makes the story feel much more realistic/rational.
