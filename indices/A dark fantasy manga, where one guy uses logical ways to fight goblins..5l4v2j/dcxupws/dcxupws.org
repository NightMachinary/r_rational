Pretty sure the manga is an adaptation of a light novel and that there's an english TL of it. Haven't read either, but if it's just gratuitous visual depictions that would bother someone, I'd suggest looking into the LN as a possible alternative. Prose is also a much better medium for conveying thoughts, plans, and inner-monologues than manga, so it may help with your second objection as well. (again, I haven't read either, so this is just a possibility).
