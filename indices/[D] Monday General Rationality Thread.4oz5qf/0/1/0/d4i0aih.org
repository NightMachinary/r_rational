/Game of Thrones//ASoIaF is light on narrative causality, and while that helped it carve itself a unique niche, it also means a lot of it is unsatisfying.

Things you /want/ to happen may be abandoned; characters you /want/ to see evolve and progress may die or face endless setbacks; virtue and cleverness may get punished by chance or inertia.

This is ultimately why I dropped the book series.
