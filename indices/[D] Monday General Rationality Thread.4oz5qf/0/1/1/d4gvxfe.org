Fine Structure is a good example of the first two, at least in regards to how much it kept me from enjoying the story. For how much rational fiction emphasizes characters not doing things just because the plot demands it, FS had a lot of people do things just because they were the kind of people who would do them. Unsong also has a problem with focusing on what happened at the expense of why it happened, but I find the subject matter interesting enough to not be bothered by it most of the time.

As for the third issue, there really isn't a better example than the final act of The Metropolitan Man. I don't want to rip into the story AGAIN, but it seriously bothered a lot of Superman fans to see him commit murder and then get murdered by Luthor. It wasn't what a lot of people wanted from a Superman story, even with Luthor as the protagonist, so they were turned off when the story defied their expectations of what would happen in a Superman story. It's the same reason so many people disliked Man of Steel.
