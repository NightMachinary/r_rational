  Oh, I fully understand why people dislike Metropolitan Man, I don't begrudge anyone that. It's one of the reasons that I'm hesitant to recommend the story to people. But I didn't do the things that I did with the story because I was trying to subvert genre expectations, I did them because I was trying to create certain unpleasant feelings - the feeling that I get when I think too deeply about the end of humanity, or the wealth of pain and cruelty in the world, or the ambiguity of good and evil. Some of my favorite books have left me in a melancholy state for days afterward. (And I'm not saying that Metropolitan Man does this perfectly, but I've gotten enough reviews to the effect of "I loved this, but I'm never going to read it again" that I think it was at least a partial success.)

I felt Superman was "allowed" to kill Calhoun because (1) he regretted it immediately afterwards (by opposition to going evil Episode-III-style) and (2) as far as I'm aware, he's a character created in the fic. If it had been Lex Luthor, or Deadshot, or the Joker, the point might have been lost, but here it feels like man Superman kills is an actual 40s mob boss: a person who lived, breathed, smoked cigars and did horrible things. Not cackle maniacally while his hostages were lowered into a vat of acid only to be saved at the last second by Batman/Superman/The Flash, but actually run a mafia with its share of beating, maiming, killing and generally hurting people. Alive, he's a reminder that there are bad, powerful people out there who hurt others; and when he dies, it shows that someone more powerful than you can hurt you if they don't care about ethics or consequences, and it's messy, and it's most definitely not a good thing.
