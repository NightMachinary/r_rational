I did not get that from this story, but now I understand why others did and why you wanted to write it. I'm happy that I have a reason to respect this story and its fans even if I don't count myself among them. As intentionally unpleasant stories go, I highly recommend The Way of Shadows and the rest of the Night Angel Trilogy that I haven't read yet but have no doubt I will love.

I would describe the book as fantasy Assassin's Creed meets Jessica Jones, with child sexual abuse. It's dark, depressing, and disturbing without ever being exploitive or unnecessarily graphic. It's everything that I think an unpleasant story should be as it forces you to confront inhumanity without giving up on humanity. And now that I think about it, it's actually pretty rational.
