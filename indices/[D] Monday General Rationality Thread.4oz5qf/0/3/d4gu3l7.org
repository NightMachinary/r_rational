I think I have a method to counter both narrative railroading and shaggy dog type anticlimatic developments.

When you plot your story, and find a point that looks like "ok, this is a plot armor at work" or "if MC came to a slightly different, but entirely possible conclusion, everything would have went another way" - assign probabilities to different outcomes and roll a dice. You can give your preferred outcome a narrative causality bonus, however, whatever the dice says, go along with it.

Perhaps the most awesome example of this style of writing I have read was in a Naruto fic "sticks and stones" XD (I can elaborate if you are familiar with the setting, or you can read it; the example is in one of the latest chapters though).
