And the pointlessness of those deaths contributes a lot to the impact of the Endbringer attack, at least for me. They are Endbringers, not plot devices to kill off characters the author doesn't like. It's painfully obvious when the author is railroading an event like that, and usually feels like a Deus ex Machina.

Of cource, like with any other writing technique, dice rolling should be done correctly. Some characters - protagonists, for example - should be granted plot armor. However, even they shouldn't be completely immune to botched rolls - perhaps something important gets taken from them, or they get blamed for a failure, etc. Plan diferent outcomes and turn them into plot hooks.
