I also loved pre-Leviathan arcs way more) But in my case it's because pre-Leviathan Worm was actually pretty light. Some of the DC comics, for example, are way darker, while still not being considered grimdark. That changed after Leviathan, and only went downhill from there. I don't like grimdark.

Btw, you might like "please don't tell my parent's that I'm a supervillain" series. It's kinda like pre-Leviathan Worm, only way, way lighter) And also pretty rational.
