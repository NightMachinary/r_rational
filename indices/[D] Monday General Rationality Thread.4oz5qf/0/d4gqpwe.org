A lot of people seem to think that rational fiction must avoid narrative causality, but I think this is a bigger hurdle to overcome than people realize. Narrative causality is major part of storytelling and I've seen plenty of stories here try to avoid it in ways that hurt the story's quality such as shoehorning exposition into dialogue, denying characters agency by making events feel arbitrary, and defying the audience's expectations instead of playing to them. While there are many stories that have pulled such things off, not all stories can or should and we need to keep that in mind if we want rational fiction to catch on.

I've read EY's essay where he says a rational protagonist should be Genre Savvy enough to figure out the rules of their story, but many authors seem to have interpreted that to mean they need to deny the audience of narrative satisfaction. I say this because we want more people to read rational fiction, but people outside this community aren't going to read stories because they happen to fit the criteria of rational fiction. They're going to read them because they're good stories, so I think we should discuss how to make rational fiction more palatable and entertaining according to the standards of fiction in general. What do you think?
