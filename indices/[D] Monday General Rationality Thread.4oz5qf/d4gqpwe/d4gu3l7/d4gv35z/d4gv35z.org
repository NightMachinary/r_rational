I actually think that idea of letting probability drive the plot is exactly the problem I was talking about. You're arbitrarily deciding which direction the narrative will take without focusing on what makes for a good narrative. Wildbow once claimed to have rolled dice to decide who would die in Worm when Leviathan attacked, and I think that resulted in pointless and unsatisfying deaths of established characters. If Taylor had died without getting a proper conclusion, then I would've stopped reading right there.
