You're right about Leviathan, that arc did succeed at what it set out to do and most of the deaths didn't bother me all the much. What actually got me to stop reading was that I felt Leviathan set a new paradigm for the story that the Slaughterhouse 9 pushed even further. It started to feel more like a slasher/monster movie than a dark superhero novel, since the plot was just became about surviving attacks by horrifying monsters, and that wasn't what I wanted to read after I'd loved the pre-Leviathan arcs so much.
