Leviathan in particular was justified, I think, because Wildbow is an imaginative enough writer, with a solid enough setting, that he could have worked with almost any outcome the dice gave him. Someone asked him what would have happened if Leviathan had hit some other city and he just spat out a 10+ paragraph plot summary. He could do that because he knew his characters and his setting so well that he could sort of "DM" them through any result of the dice.
