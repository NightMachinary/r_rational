  Take the Unspoken Plan Garuntee, for example. Characters make a plan off-camera, then execute it perfectly on-camera. You can't have characters make a plan on-camera and then execute it perfectly on-camera, because you drain the tension from the story and the audience gets bored. The trope exists for a reason; if you want to not have it in your story, you need to figure out a way to keep the story entertaining.

Plans that appear to go perfectly from the outside are not necessarily going at all perfectly from the inside.
