Oh, I fully understand why people dislike /Metropolitan Man/, I don't begrudge anyone that. It's one of the reasons that I'm hesitant to recommend the story to people. But I didn't do the things that I did with the story because I was trying to subvert genre expectations, I did them because I was trying to create certain unpleasant feelings - the feeling that I get when I think too deeply about the end of humanity, or the wealth of pain and cruelty in the world, or the ambiguity of good and evil. Some of my favorite books have left me in a melancholy state for days afterward. (And I'm not saying that /Metropolitan Man/ does this perfectly, but I've gotten enough reviews to the effect of "I loved this, but I'm never going to read it again" that I think it was at least a partial success.)

If I knew of a way to do it, I would have signaled to the reader beforehand that it was going to be that kind of book, so they could have bailed out if that wasn't what they were into.

Edit: To be clear, there are /other/ reasons that people dislike it, which I'm also very familiar with, just trying to address the specific complaint about lack of catharsis/satisfaction and deviation from narrative conventions.
