This is what I loved about Metropolitan Man!

Now, I normally hate it when writers do stuff just to create unpleasant feelings, because usually it's really contrived ("Let's kill this character everyone loves just to signal to the reader that now things are getting serious!") or else it's not a story that has enough to say to justify it ("Now that the hero has slain the dragon and rescued the princess, let's have him get blinded so we can have a Lesson About Disabilities shoehorned in here")

Metropolitan Man actually had something to say, the unpleasantness was what the story was about.
