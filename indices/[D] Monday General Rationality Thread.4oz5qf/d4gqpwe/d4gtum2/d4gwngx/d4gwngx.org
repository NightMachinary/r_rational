Now I feel bad for using Metropolitan Man as an example of what not to do because that is excellent advice that I completely agree with, yet I haven't read any of your work after I didn't like your Superman fic. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/3096lk/spoilers_all_a_critical_review_of_hpmor/][Your review of HPMOR]] even did a good job of pointing out the flaws with the narrative, and I love that story.
