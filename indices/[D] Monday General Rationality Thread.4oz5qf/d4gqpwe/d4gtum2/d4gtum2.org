I agree. Tropes and genres exist as they are for reasons, and one of the biggest reasons is that authors have been trying to optimize their stories for entertainment value for thousands of years. Throwing out genre convetions without understanding their purpose is */Bad/*.

Take the Unspoken Plan Guarantee, for example. Characters make a plan off-camera, then execute it perfectly on-camera. You can't have characters make a plan on-camera and then execute it perfectly on-camera, because you drain the tension from the story and the audience gets bored. The trope exists for a reason; if you want to not have it in your story, you need to figure out a way to keep the story entertaining.

I'd really like for people to just ask themselves /why/ some convention/trope exists. /Sometimes/ it's because the author is a stupid lazy hack, but I'd argue that's the minority. Authors are trying to be entertaining; the things they do with their stories are primarily in service of entertainment (this is less true in more commercial works, e.g. Hollywood, where budget and merchandising play a larger factor). Sometimes this entertainment is shallow pandering, but you have to know which is which before you throw the baby out with the bathwater.
