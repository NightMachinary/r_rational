I've realized that only sleeping once a day has been one of the worst things for my school life and have decided to begin napping whenever i find it particularly difficult to work. This may be placebo effect, but i find that after an hour or two nap i am able to work more efficiently on school work and get better performance.

Why do you think this isn't a thing in modern society and the workforce? Taking a nap, in my opinion, has done wonders for my willingness to accomplish the tasks before me. Thoughts?
