The /riposo///siesta/ is fairly common in S. European and American countries, and broadly in warmer climates, afaik. I worked a bit in France once and they'd let us off every day after lunch for nap-time. Apparently naps are fairly standard in China, too [e.g. from [[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2869364/Asleep-job-order-boss-Chinese-factory-workers-given-half-hour-nap-lunch-breaks.html][random article]]].

The health effects of a midday nap seem to have been examined before (e.g. [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17296887][here]] and [[http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/content/29/3/429.full][here]]), though from what I can tell skimming some abstracts the results don't always point in the same direction.
