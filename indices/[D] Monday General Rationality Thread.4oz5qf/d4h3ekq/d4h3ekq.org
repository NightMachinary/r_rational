I was recently reading one of the codex alera books, which, for the most part had been fairly consistent in their worldbuilding. In previous books, it was a major plot point that people acquired their furies (elementals based around the Wu Xing elements(+ air)) Most people have one or two weak ones, and one of the major features of the nobility are their powerful furies (which, I should mention, are not rare). Then, someone mentions that it is not only possible, but common for furies to be passed from one person to another.

Its not that I don't expect people to specialize, but to ignore low-hanging fruit to the point that a member of the elite secret police has only one fury is just SOD-breaking.
