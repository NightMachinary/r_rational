(dunno if this should go here or in the OT-thread. I can delete and repost if necessary)

Is anyone here familiar with fitting multivariate hierarchical generalized linear mixture models? Specifically, I'm looking for something that'll let me have vectors of outcomes realized from, say, some combination of non-independent zero-inflated Poisson processes (or a similar enough model, or something more appropriate). I'd also like for it to be able to both accommodate measurement uncertainty and impute missing data with respect to discrete variables (both outcomes and predictors).
