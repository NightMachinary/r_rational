Finally got around to reading this chapter. Incidentally, it isn't listed in the Glimwarden Index page (./glimwarden/).

Melanie ran out of horse meat soup unexpectedly, which indicates that either her impromptu lie in chapter 5 about the history of the soup was successful (and thus that the stories she tells are useful despite her misgivings) or that Sander and Philip apparently enjoying it was enough for word of mouth to spread. Or, conceivably, that people just wanted a piece of some of the last horses of Light's hollow.

I think her arc will involve becoming very good at crafting stories. Philip is persuasive and Sander is knowledgeable, but Melanie will be the one to capture hearts and minds. Give them a narrative to believe in and you can sway a whole town.

  There were signatures that frightened her, ones that almost always belonged to villains in the stories that described them: mind control, mind reading, or the ability to reach into a person's head and change their emotions around.

Potential hint about the future of her arc or that of one of the main trio.

  “The reaction to the failure isn't actually about stopping the failure from happening,” said Melanie. Low expectations of the world were almost always justified. She noticed Phiip looking at her more intently than she really liked.

Well that's going to make Philip very interested indeed. He doesn't seem to really understand people's deeper motivations at all, and may latch onto her as a candidate for shoring up the holes in his knowledge.
