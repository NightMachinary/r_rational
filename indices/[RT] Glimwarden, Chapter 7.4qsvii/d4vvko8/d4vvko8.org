Great chapter. I notice that Philip left the skipped 15 minutes out of his story. Combined with the bit about clearing the vomit from Sander's airway (a detail nobody could or would challenge), he's managed to make his contribution seem pretty heroic.

I can see these three making it through Glimwarden as best friends and fierce allies... with nobody but Sander experiencing any actual fondness or enjoyment of the others' company.
