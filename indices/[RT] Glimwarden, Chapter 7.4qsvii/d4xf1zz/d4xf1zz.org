Hey I just devoured the series up to this point and felt like sharing my thoughts.

I'm sure other people have mentioned it but I'm getting a RWBY vibe, and I mean that in the best way possible. RWBY has, until recently, a too light tone for how dreary that universe is. Your tale does a better job, in my opinion, of accurately describing the grim (heh) situation humanity is in struggling against a terrifying and inevitable foe.

Your world building is quite interesting so far, with a /ton/ of potential, and your characterization is strong - which was my main complaint with limelight. That's not to say those characters were done badly, but I already find myself more attached to glimwarden's POV characters than any of the people from limelight.

Anyway, I just wanted to drop by to say "heck yes" and that I'm looking forward to new chapters.
