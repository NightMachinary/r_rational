Well, I'm in a much better mood now than I was before I started reading. Random thoughts:

- Colsum is a super interesting character. He gave me a Jaimie Lannister-ish vibe of "Do what is of most interest to me, unless doing the right thing is easier, or when I'm bored". And he seems to really enjoy playing the town's arch-villain.

- Melanie exhibits surprising depth. I like that she starts second-guessing herself and actually thinks about what Colsum said about her being spiteful.

- "You see, everything you did from that point on was motivated by your pure, undiluted spite." "No, I was actually motivated by several different mostly non-dramatic things. Sorry, turns out I'm a multi-dimensional character." "Oh. Never mind then."

- "So you see, I'm not a villain at all! I mean, it's not /my fault/ I'm making you work 24/24h, every day of the week, for a dept you never actually contracted! Now feel guilty for hating me!"

- Wait, so there won't be any structural changes in the town's defense systems? No fortifications? No conscripted snipers? No mandatory training for the auxiliaries? Come on, Philip, it's your time to shine!

- I'm hesitantly shipping Philip and Melanie from now on. Um. If that's alright.

- Melanie seems pretty good at noticing people's body language. Not sure how it plays into her character, but it's definitely there.

- "The Mender and the Builder where brothers who lived together in harmony for eons. Then one of them asked the other, hey, have you ever thought to compare the characteristic that defines my entire life to the very similar characteristic that defines your life?" "No! What a novel idea! Let's fight to the death!" Sounds legit.

- I didn't think about it last time, but how did Philip learn to put an unconscious person in recovery position? Somehow I don't think he has any experience caring for people in ethylic coma, so I guess he has first aid training?
