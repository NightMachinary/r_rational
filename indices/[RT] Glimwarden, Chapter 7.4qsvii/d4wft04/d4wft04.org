I'm going to go ahead and guess that the lantern failure was sabotage, not accident. Whether it's Colsum or someone else, the timing is too convenient (it happens shortly after the competition is announced, there just happens to be a nearby new, extra-strong Darkling, and the lantern comes back on /right after/ the competition is thinned out - auxiliaries - and new spots are made available - 4 dead glimwardens?)

Also, Colsum already has at least one Glimwarden who he's working with to some extent, calling it now. Might not be a close relationship, but some sort of trade of information, even if it's just minor, is probably happening. He just strikes me as that sort of person, especially after talking to Melanie. It's unlikely that he told her the whole truth, and slightly less unlikely that he didn't lie at least once.
