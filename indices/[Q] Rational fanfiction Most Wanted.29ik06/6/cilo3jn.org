Merlin. Holy fuck, it's about a guy with magic powers who lives at the royal court and directly interacts with the crown prince on a regular basis--there's so much potential for munchkinry and world optimization, but the characters are all idiots. Examples of idiocy: Merlin can cast a sleep spell, but still relies on force-blasting people into walls in combat; Merlin can heal the sick, but usually doesn't because it's not his "destiny;" Merlin does a thing that directly and predictably results in the deaths of hundreds of innocents because "he promised." I want to see the guy use canonical spells to break the planet in a good way.
