I've been talking about rationalist!Animorphs for quite some time now. I've had a bunch of notes written about it that I could use to post a [BST] thread here, but I lost them all when my hard-drive crashed. I haven't had the mental energy to type them up again, but I think it's an idea that has a lot of potential.

The main problem is that I haven't been able to come up with a sufficiently satisfying ending.
