Bit late to the party, but I just had a /startling/ realization about what'd make a great fic that's not very obvious until you see it: [[http://www.egscomics.com/newreaders.php]]

Main characters already includes ones doing science to magic, and one slightly superhumanly intelligent one that's surprisingly well depicted given there are no other hints of the author knowing about LW or the like. Also, the magic system is quite different from many of the ones that's been tried so far.
