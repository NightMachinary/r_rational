I read pact so far. When I read that part I was really happy because someone was finally doing it but that didn't really pan out. I love pact but it isn't what I am describing. Even the cleverest so far are pushovers to a degree. Everyone seems to be able to take down everyone else with enough luck and fudging. I do really enjoy pact though.

To me, any individual monster battle should be an incredibly grueling thing, especially if the monster is 500 years old. Anyone who can take out double digits worth of monsters would have to be practically inhumanly clever about it. I would go into it in specific detail and give examples but I don't want to tempt myself to write it while I am working two and a half jobs and doing law school.
