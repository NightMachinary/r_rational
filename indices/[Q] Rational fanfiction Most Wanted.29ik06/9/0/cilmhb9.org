I know Worm is considered something of an superhuman story with a strong rational streak, and in that vein you might consider [[http://pactwebserial.wordpress.com/][Pact]] something worthwhile. The characters at least talked about supernatural creatures that still were around and what that said about these creatures. If they haven't been bound yet, if they are around, they /need/ to have some quality that prevented previous practitioners (monster hunters, so to speak) from tackling them successfully.
