Not technically fanfic, but Larry Correia's [[http://www.baenebooks.com/chapters/1439132852/1439132852___1.htm][Monster Hunters]] series mostly qualifies. The monsters stay secret because large human conspiracies ensure that for somewhat sensible reasons. Those who are in the know fight very sensibly.

I say not technically fanfic because Correia said once that he started writing it by taking a generic one-survivor horror movie and asking "what next?".
