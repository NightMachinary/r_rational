In an episode later on the kill the owner of Moljnir and then leave the hammer there. Half the show they are looking for slightly stronger weapons, then the FUCKING THROW AWAY MOLJNIR. REALLY? I lost all faith. This show was about mortals fighting tooth and nail to survive. And they threw away Thor's hammer.
