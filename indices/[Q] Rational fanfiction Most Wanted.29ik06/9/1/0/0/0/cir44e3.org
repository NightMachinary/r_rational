Thank you for following up. I actually was planning the holy water in the water supply and portable salt lines too, which is funny. On the other hand, my focus wasn't as much on the combat and was more on the aspect of large organized groups of malevolent beings existing and preying on humans, yet we don't know about it. I have a pretty good system for why this would be completely under the radar, and yet the hunters can still track down monsters that I really want to use.

The problem is that I am much better with plots, intrigue, and gimmicks than I am with dialogue and humor. I know adding that would take me ages so what I really need is someone capable of actually writing human beings and being reliable with a schedule. If I had that I would write this, and it would be epic.

The thing I liked from this post- Mary survives instead of John. Oooooh I want to steal this so badly! I have been stuck on what would cause the divergence but I don't want to be an idea thief. Oh well.
