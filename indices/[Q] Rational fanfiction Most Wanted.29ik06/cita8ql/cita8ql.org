I'd like to see a rational take on the Inheritance Cycle. Basically, dragons are thought to have been all but exterminated, until the boy Eragon finds a dragon egg. When it hatches, Eragon unlocks latent magical abilities and gains a psychic link to the dragon, which has human level intelligence and memories passed down from ancestors.

The real exploitable part though is the magic system. Basically, as long as you know the ancient language of magic, you pretty much just describe what you'd like to happen and it happens. Magic works as intended by the caster, so for example a skilled magician saying the word "water" can mean anything from "move this water" to "freeze this water" or even "create a hovering ball of water over my hand by collecting the moisture from the atmosphere". I'd like to see a rational take on that, especially exploring what would happen if both the protagonists and antagonist were straight up /smarter/ about it.
