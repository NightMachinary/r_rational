Percy Jackson has so much untapped potential, in terms of the humanist philosophy.

There's an actual GOD OF DEATH, for starters, ruling over an afterlife where only a few people get to enjoy anything close to life and the rest are just trapped either in torture or meaninglessness forever.

To say nothing of how immature and stupid the rest of the gods can be. Somebody's going to have to put them in their rightful place, in the end.
