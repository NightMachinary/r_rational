This gives me a wonderful idea for a story; a slightly below average human paper-clipper. So he goes to city council meetings and argues in favor of the school district buying more paper clips, and in general just goes about maximizing paper clips in all the ways you would if you just didn't have the intelligence to start buying up factories.

Oh, or maybe /Flowers for Algernon/ but with paperclips so you could see the progression.
