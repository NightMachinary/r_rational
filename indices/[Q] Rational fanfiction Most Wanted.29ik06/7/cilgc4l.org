*Game Theory of Thrones.* For the obvious route to a HPEV/Bella-style protagonist, have Jon head off to become a Maester instead of joining the Night's Watch. After focusing on Jon for a while, switch over to Dany's story, which has proceeded in the background as per canon right up until the flames, and then is derailed heavily once the dragons start whispering in her ear.

Have dragons be dangerous not because they're big and breathe fire but because they're /smart/ and naturally evil - they were the true power behind the Valyrian Freehold (and later the Targaryen throne) and the "Doom of Valyria" was actually a deliberate last-ditch attempt to wipe them out. Make the Maester's Conspiracy a more explicit plot point (you've already got Jon in place to hear about it). You'd probably have to have some handwaved reason why dragons that are just hatched are /already/ dangerous - maybe there's some sort of Qwisatz Haderach-style Lamarckian inheritance of gained knowledge, so they start out knowing everything that their parents did at the point of conception, as well as everything /their/ parents did up to /their/ conception, etc.
