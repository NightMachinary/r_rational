  Rational Supernatural Fic anon sends the following message:

  (Sorry if you get this twice; connection is being glitchy.)

  Rational!SPN thus far consists of the following plot shreds:

  1) Mary does some properly clever thing (IDEAS NEEDED) and survives instead of John. If Sam ever winds up at Stanford, Jess also survives and turns hunter. (I have an image of Sam descending into Hell to rescue Dean, as per the original s3 plan, with Jess by his side.)

  2) Uriel lets Lilith out and then teams up with her, forming a plan with all sorts of genuinely-threatening-villain cleverness. (MORE IDEAS NEEDED) There might be time-travel angelzapping so one of them, or Ruby or possibly Meg, can keep an eye on the Winchesters. (I also have an image of bb!Sam with a pet hellhound.)

  3) Sam trains in his powers, possibly going a little demonic in the process. (Fantasy transhumanism, fuck yeah!) There's also Man of Letters training in the SPNverse magical arts (YET MORE IDEAS NEEDED), because in hindsight there's no way a bunch of clever/rational hunters wouldn't investigate Henry.

  4) Dean is also awesome, though I've somehow not mentioned him. He's probably better at the lateral-thinking rational-exploitation-of-magic stuff than Sam is. (STILL OTHER IDEAS NEEDED)

  Fly, my pretty Ozy-and-followers! Fly, and hopefully return with useful stuff!
