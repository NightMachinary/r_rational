I am a bit curious to see a rational supernatural or another rational "monster hunting in modern times" style fanfic. I would want to know how they survive in modern times undetected. My answer would be that anything that survived that long was either ridiculously clever, literally no one lived to tell the tale, or a reality warper. The only response is truly brilliant monster hunting where each fight is against something that has been dealing with monster hunters for centuries and yet is still here, or its ancestors have, or it is so stealthy that finding it is an epic effort in itself. I might be writing this. No promises as my time constraints are high and it isn't the most helpful use of my time.
