I've been thinking about how you'd do Superman as a rationalist for awhile now. I think you'd almost have to do it with him as Superboy, having recently come into his powers. Then the plot would follow him as he discovers what he's capable of and comes into his own as a different kind of hero. The big problem with Superman in general is that he's ridiculously powerful, and if you have him as a protagonist it's hard to give him some credible threat. (For a while I was planning to launch into something like that as soon as Metropolitan Man was finished as a sort of counterpoint to it, but I could never get the plotting right.)
