I /personally/ don't mind spoilers too much, so I didn't feel like I missed much when I read Permutation City /after/ I'd read the Finale. Especially because the Finale doesn't really spoil all that much of the book, without having the frame of reference for it I didn't really understand the spoilers until the book was almost over. But that may be because my memory sucks :P

I dunno about the /other/ book Yudkowsky uses, I haven't read that one, but I don't expect they're super spoilers either. Still, read at your risk!

And as for the fiction thing, the basic idea is that Occam's Razor would lead one to expect that there's a threshold in rule complexity after which, if you find yourself living in an universe where rules are more complex than it, probably most of your measure comes from a simulation in another, simpler universe.
