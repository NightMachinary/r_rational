  but that doesn't make it all that different from, say, the world of Harry Potter.

The world of Harry Potter is even /more obviously/ fictional than the Buffyverse.

  Could you explain to me how exactly a character from the Buffyverse would realize that they are fictional?

Yeah I can but not right now because I'm in a hurry. However, there are more-or-less decent explanations of that on Yudkowsky's fic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5389450/1/The-Finale-of-the-Ultimate-Meta-Mega-Crossover][The Finale of the Ultimate Meta Mega Crossover]] and in one other fic that has the reasoning more explicitly laid out except it'd be /very spoilerish/ for me to say which fic it is so that leaves me in a bit of a pickle. I'm going to say which one it is under a spoiler tag below, if you're too curious to care about the spoilers of an unknown fic.

I should be back here in some 6h or so, and if you're still curious about the steps of reasoning I'll explain them when I do.
