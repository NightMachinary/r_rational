Could you explain to me how exactly a character from the Buffyverse would realize that they are fictional? I'm struggling a bit with how that could ever be possible short of the creator breaking the fourth wall. As for mental processes being basic in that world... I'm not quite sure where you are getting that. It is shown that brain damage has an effect on the behavior of the afflicted. Furthermore vampires retain their pre-conversion memories and the greatest part of their personality. The only difference is that their 'soul' is replaced by a 'demon'. But what does that mean? The effects of having a soul as shown in the series seem to be restricted to maintaining inhibitions and enabling moral reasoning, without forcing the host into any particular morality or behavior. That seems to me more like a symbiotic relationship with some sort of spirit, like we have with the bacteria in our gut, than anything resembling the common understanding of the soul as the core of our being, whatever the hell that might mean. So yes, spirits and gods and so on exist in the Buffyverse, but that doesn't make it all that different from, say, the world of Harry Potter. And to me the characters in the former are just as moronic as those in the latter. For example: There are almost immortal demons whose blood has incredible healing powers as well as being the only known cure for vampirism AND NO ONE CARES. Call me evil, but I would summon or lure in as many of those things as possible, string them up and harvest their ever-replenishing blood. For starters. Damn, that world is just begging to be broken by a munchkin...
