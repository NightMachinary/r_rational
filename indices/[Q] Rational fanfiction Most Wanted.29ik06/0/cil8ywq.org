I'd really like to see Star Wars done properly, with an explanation of what the Force really is, and eventually its exploitation. I have no real interest in writing it myself, but the Thrawn trilogy opened up my eyes to what the setting could be like in the hands of someone who takes the time to think, and I'd like more of that.
