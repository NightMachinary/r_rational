Hmm... that actually sounds like a really interesting rabbit hole to go down. How /does/ a post-scarcity communistic society /actually work/? And I mean /actually work/, optimizing for making it work as shown in the show rather than waving your hands and saying, "Well it actually doesn't work so they have a very capitalist/proprietarian system and futarchy instead like Good Rationalists Who Read Robin Hanson!"

On slightly further thought, I support this project very wholeheartedly, on grounds that making people believe in futuristic communist utopias is much easier when you can point to a fleshed-out thought-experiment and intuition pump in how one /really, actually works/.

Here's a start to get people thinking: after a severely damaging war caused by biologically-focused initial forays into transhumanism, first contact with the Vulcans was made. They showed humanity how to build FAI. FAI thus worked, and the associated kinds of "godvomit"-level technology thus worked, but [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/xb/free_to_optimize/][the AI decided to take a hands-off approach]]. Keeping society running thus remains a /human/ problem, and the story explores the human solution space for that problem.
