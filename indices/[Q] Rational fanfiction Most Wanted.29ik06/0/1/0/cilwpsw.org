  the canonical explanation of midichlorians/microorganisms in Phantom Menace is completely missing the point of what made the original trilogy's depiction of the force cool. Making everything more rational and understandable (like in Phantom Menace) and less mystical gibberish (like in the films that weren't terrible) seems like a bad decision.

Midichlorians were a [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/ip/fake_explanations/][fake explanation]], that's why they sucked. But I agree that it'd be really difficult to come up with a simple, coherent set of rules that predicted the way the force is depicted as working in Star Wars.
