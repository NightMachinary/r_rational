John Bellairs' /The Face in the Frost/. An oldie but a goodie!

What's special about it is that it has the most magical magic system I know. There is basically no point trying to rationalize the magic system, you'd end up with a completely different setting. Instead, I'd just be interested at what intelligent characters would do in that world.
