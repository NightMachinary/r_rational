How do you think people get smart in the first place? Randomly assigning intelligence points to people without prior cause is just author inserting plot. If you have a character that makes good decisions based on forewarning or plot then all you learn is situation based knowledge, like a trivia quiz. But if you add rationality lessons and principles then you can learn methods that are applicable in more situations and are consistent with a predetermined cause.
