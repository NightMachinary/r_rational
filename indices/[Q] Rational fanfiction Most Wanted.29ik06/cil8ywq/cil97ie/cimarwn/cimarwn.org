How about a take on Star Trek where the universe-changing sci/tech discoveries every fifth episode are actually allowed to change the universe in all subsequent episodes? It's a little hard to take seriously transhumanism, post-scarcity, human replication, etc., all the way up to time travel and interacting multiverses, in the context of a serial episodic format that tries to preserve a relatively static status quo by each episode's end.
