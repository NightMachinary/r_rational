We definitely come at it from different angles, which I can understand. For me, it's a case of playing the Star Wars RPG and reading the EU novels. In the RPG especially there are strict definitions of what the mystical wizards can actually do (mostly for reasons of balance). They never really explain the how of it, but it's much better defined than in the movies, which makes it seem more "real" to me.

I think, if I were enough of a Star Wars nerd to do it, I would write a Star Wars fanfic that never gives a full and complete explanation of the Force, only defines some of its limits and offers reasonable exploitations of it based on what's shown in its various levels of canon. There are some wonderful conflicts within the Star Wars universe that I think I would like touching - the conflict between Sith and Jedi as an actual difference in values rather than just "right" and "wrong", the routine memory wipes of the pretty-much-sentient droids, the fact that the Emperor had a pretty legit reason to try to unify the galaxy (the imminent invasion by an immensely powerful alien race).

But I totally get where you're coming from, and largely agree with what makes Star Wars compelling to so many people, and why the prequels sucked.
