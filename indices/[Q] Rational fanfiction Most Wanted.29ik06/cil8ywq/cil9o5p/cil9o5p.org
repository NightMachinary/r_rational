It's rare for me to disagree with you, but...

I am familiar with very little of the EU material - mostly, I just saw the movies. From those, I wouldn't actually be super interested in the background of the Force. Pretty much everything about the films' depiction of the Force worked really well and was great when it was Yoda talking in pseudo-mystic gibberish in a swamp about it being some magical power in everything as some sort of pantheism, and the canonical explanation of midichlorians/microorganisms in Phantom Menace is completely missing the point of what made the original trilogy's depiction of the force cool. Making everything more rational and understandable (like in Phantom Menace) and less mystical gibberish (like in the films that weren't terrible) seems like a bad decision. Even if you don't go for midichlorians, I don't think anything good would be added by having the Jedi discussing what particles allow for the apparant action-at-a-distance of the Force and trying to work out if Telekinesis followed an inverse square law, or why they couldn't just use their TK to sever nerves in their opponent's spinal column and instantly incapacitate or kill them.

The setting conceits of Star wars are nonsense all the way down, and by the time you've ripped up or explained away enough of them to have something that 'made sense' you've bored the reader and discarded the vast majority of setting material. Fundamentally, Star Wars was amazing when it was essentially a fairy tale of wizard/monk/knights and princesses in space with a whole bunch of nonsensical conceits and people using laser swords because laser swords are cool, and became steadily worse when it was trying to draw the viewer to follow a complex (and nonsensical) plot about trade disputes and senatorial politics.
