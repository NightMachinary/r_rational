A couple of thoughts on the Force in Star Wars:

1. Dark side users are almost always stronger than light side users.

2. If you do not constantly control yourself and your emotions you end up on the dark side.

3. All dark side users basically end up with the same goals (conquering the universe / becoming "evil"), no matter what personality they originally had.

4. Dark side users have no concept of self-preservation beyond furthering their new goals, they literally train the person meant to kill them (their apprentice).

My conclusion: The dark side is the only side of the Force. "Light side users" are just those people mentally strong enough to tap into this power source without succumbing to its corrupting effects.
