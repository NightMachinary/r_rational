It's clear that the amount of thought Kubo has given to his world is...not very much.

If people in the afterlife live indefinitely until they're killed, and people on earth keep being born and dying, there's no reason why the afterlife portion hasn't totally outbalanced the living portion by now.

And that's putting aside the number of hollows, which, can actually be estimated into the billions if we go by Adjuchas being made up hundreds of Gillians with hundreds of regular hollows making up each Gillian.

In any case, that boy who was sealed into the Parakeet apparently came into Soul Society with the same physical age as when he died, and was able to recognize Ichigo and Co. So yes, it's only when dying in the afterlife that people lose their memories.
