No no, if you die in the afterlife you come back to the real world. That's what the shinigami are all about, "balance of souls" and stuff. There's a cycle of souls, they go from real world to soul society to real world to soul society... And it's why Quincy are /bad/ because /they/ destroy souls forever and break the balance.

  But really, the reason it's such a prime target isn't because of how good or bad their world is compared to ours. It's because a large part of the suffering in that world is caused by Soul Society's negligence, foolishness and callousness.
