As you yourself have just said, their afterlife only marginally improves things since you basically die for real if you die in the afterlife. Plus standard of living for people in the afterlife is really low.

But really, the reason it's such a prime target isn't because of how good or bad their world is compared to ours. It's because a large part of the suffering in that world is caused by Soul Society's negligence, foolishness and callousness.
