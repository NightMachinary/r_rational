Avatar: the Last Airbender would be a neat one. I know someone on this forum said they wanted to do it, but I don't know how that's going.

+I really want a Naruto fic that updates [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9311012/1/Lighting-Up-the-Dark][more frequently]] but I can't ask because I myself don't update [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9380249/1/Rationalising-Death][RD]] all that frequently x.x''+

Permutation City maybe? I mean I suppose people are already smart but there seems to be a lot of wanking around what's real and what's not and whatever and I'd love to see someone starting from the point of: "Well, Copies are real people, and every environment that's possible has some measure of existence. What now?" (And no, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5389450/1/The-Finale-of-the-Ultimate-Meta-Mega-Crossover][this]] doesn't count :P)

FACKEN HIS DARK MATERIALS goddamnit +I think I might even write that one myself *fumes*+

Puella Magi Madoka Magica? Yes? Rational Madoka anyone?

Maybe some Final Fantasy or another? I'd love to see rational FFX because I love it and it's great and it has some nice identity issues and X-risks and it could be nicely explored, but /especially/ rational FFXIII: how do you deal with alien gods that don't have your well-being as a goal (even if they're so constrained)?

Lord of the Rings, definitely.

Yeah I think I ran out.
