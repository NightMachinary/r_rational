I always thought a rational!Batman or a real rational!Superman would be neat. You're skirting about the edges of rational!Superman with The Metropolitan Man, but one where Superman is explicitly rational would also be fun - as long as some suitably exciting conflicts can be thought up.

If I have to say any one thing in particular, though, a large and well-done rational take on Star Wars is probably one of the things I'd want most. However, that entire universe makes so little sense in terms of tech capabilities possessed vs tech capabilities actually used properly, how all the tech would change society, what the hell the Force is and so on, that you really would need to do some extensive work before you could make a truly sensible world and story out of it (edit: and retain the original feel and flavor).

Incidentally, I've been procrastinating horribly about writing reviews for Metropolitan Man. I'll get around to fixing that - promise.

Edit: I see you suggested Star Wars yourself while I was writing. It must be fate.
