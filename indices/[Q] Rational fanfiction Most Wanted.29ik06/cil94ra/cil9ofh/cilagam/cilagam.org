I thought there were several variations on his power-level in canon - yours seems to be one of the higher ones, though not remotely near the ridiculous levels I've heard of (stuff like dragging planets around with ease, and chilling out inside of stars to /regenerate/). You could do a less strong interpretation or somehow contrive to debuff him, but maybe it wouldn't feel like a proper Superman then.

Alternatively, you're right, it would have to be the story of how he gets started. I can see a few ways you might go about that, but generally the conflict has to be moral in nature - as you say it's hard to establish any credible physical threats to him. Meanwhile, I think watching him tie himself up in knots and angst over things where physical power can't help would actually be interesting if done well.
