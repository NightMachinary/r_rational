As I said [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/1tftsf/can_we_have_threads_dedicated_to_brainstorming/ce7jmdf][last time,]] I really want to see Romeo and Juliet turned into an example of how to love well. (AFAICT, Shakespeare intended it as a heavy-handed warning about what /not/ to do wrt love, but no one wants to read it that way so we might as well flip it.)
