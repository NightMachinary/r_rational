I've reread the excellent fic you didn't want to spoil and have come to the conclusion that I suck at being rational :P I feel like I understand while I am reading but my brain refuses to update on the information. I thank you for the effort and offer, though. I guess it is time for me to hit lesswrong again or read the prerequisites for the Yudkowsky fic.
