A lot of the light novels that go on to become rather popular would do quite well /w a rational rewrite.

Infinite Stratos would have been interesting if it analyzed how a world dominated by females in super magic powered armor with males as second or third class citizens looked like, but it was a harem comedy.

Code Geass and/or Death Note would have been better if the author was remotely as intelligent as the lead characters, and used more brain and less ass pull.

Accel World would have been quite different if Haruyuki was a tad further along the smart protagonist line, instead of just being the bullied kid who is fawned over by half a dozen attractive women.

Highschool DxD has a rather interesting setting, but it's ruined by the lead character's obsession with boobs and his lack-a-brain perversity. You want boobs? More arachnocentauroid female monsters that shoot death beams from their nipples while trying to stab you and feed you into what was basically vagina dentata, less "and then their clothes magically exploded hahaha buy my +porn+ books."
