For Death Note, there's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9380249/1/Rationalising-Death][Rationalizing Death]].

The big problem with Geass is that any rationalist with that power wouldn't take anywhere near as long as Lelouch to actually effect a revolution, particularly with the canon revelation at the end of R2 that [[#s][CG Spoilers]] You'd need to do some de-powering or just outright have Lelouch do his thing /without/ Geass powers. If you're just after a slightly smarter story without quite as many ass-pulls, there's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6175861/1/Dauntless][Dauntless]].
