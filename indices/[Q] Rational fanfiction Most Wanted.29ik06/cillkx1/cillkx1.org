It just occurred to me that rational!Hellsing could be pretty awesome too, where Seras is a rationalist and is thrown into this whole conspiracy thing where the churches act as governments and militaries and beings like Alucard exist, and has to make sense of it all while dealing with the emotional trauma and new urges of just having been turned into a vampire.

Of course, the only change shouldn't be Seras - a bit of competence and sensibility in the rest of the universe wouldn't hurt either. Also, Hellsing is fairly short so it doesn't have to be a huge doorstopper story.
