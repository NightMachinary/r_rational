I've only watched the series once, but don't the anti-spirals repress life because of their fear that spiral energy spirals out of control and destroys everything?

If I remember correctly, at one point they almost directly imply that somehow, angular momentum increases over time when left on its own. Can you imagine how incredibly dangerous a mechanical drill-arm is in such a universe? Applied consistently though, stars could never exist in such a universe. But with just a minor correction, like saying that only one element or one specific material (artificial or natural) has this property, you can make it work.

Antispirals would be placed in the role of Mass Effect Reapers as they were intended in ME1 and ME2: not dumb life-haters like you would think at first, but custodians of the galaxy/universe which (pretty immorally) try to preserve the universe for future life. A race which has given up hope in the possibility that the crisis can be worked around, and instead prevents anyone from getting near the point of triggering it.
