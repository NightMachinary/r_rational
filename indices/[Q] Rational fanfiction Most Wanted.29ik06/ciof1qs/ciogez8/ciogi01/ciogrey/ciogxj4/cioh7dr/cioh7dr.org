Oh. Yeah indeed. Though I'm not sure that people actually keep their memories when they go from the earth to the afterlife? I mean, other than the occasional ghost in real world, everyone we're shown in the Soul Society seems to be a "native" so I kinda expected that Soul Society babies are born when reality's people die and vice-versa.

(Which does leave the unexplained growth in population on earth a mystery.)
