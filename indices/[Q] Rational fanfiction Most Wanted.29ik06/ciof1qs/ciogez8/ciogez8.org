  Most importantly, the world of Bleach is seriously messed up. It is so ridiculously and needlessly cruel...

Well it's less cruel than /ours/. At least the dead there go to an aferlife. And then if they die in the afterlife they come back.

Though of course that's just "souls" nonsense, since the identity/memories/personality /isn't/ preserved.

(That's a huge peeve of mine with reincarnation-based religions: if a person "comes back" but has no memories, nothing of that identity, then it's /not the same person!!!/)
