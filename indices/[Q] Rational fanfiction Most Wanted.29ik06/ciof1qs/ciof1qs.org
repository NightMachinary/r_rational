I really want to see a rational fanfiction of Bleach.

It's an ideal setting for such a thing. There's magic to work with that is interesting but not so easy to abuse. The characters and plot in general are so nonsensical that I'd love to see them become more intelligently reorganized.

Most importantly, the world of Bleach is seriously messed up. It is so ridiculously and needlessly cruel...and the canon characters seem to be blind to this fact or just not care. It's a world that I'd want to see a character go about trying to fix with their intelligence.
