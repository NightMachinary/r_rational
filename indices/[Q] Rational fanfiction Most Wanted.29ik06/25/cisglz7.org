The television series Charmed (about three witches in modern-day San Fran), because boy does that EVER need fixing. The guys in charge of the good guys are creepy and controlling, feel faintly misogynistic somehow, and insist on no use of powers for "personal gain". The three witches (as a result of the aforementioned?) are practically never seen practising their powers and come at every monster-of-the-week situation cold. It's a fun, relatively mindless series, but a rational rewrite would be /wonderful/.
