I've been hoping for a while now, that someone will write a rationalist Doctor Who fanfic. It will need less tweaking of the main character's personality, has many possible directions you can go in, and you can use [a steelmanned version of] the excuses as to why you can't massively exploit TIme Travel (because that would be too boring).
