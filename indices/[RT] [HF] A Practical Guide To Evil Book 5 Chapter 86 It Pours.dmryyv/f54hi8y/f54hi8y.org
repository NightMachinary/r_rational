  “The cruelty of a dilemma is not only in the choice itself; it lies also in the truth it reveals to you about yourself through the making of that choice.”

A bit of a mouthful but I liked this quote.

Something I liked less was the chapter opening on a humorous note at the expense of the tension that the previous chapter ended on. This is something I've noticed many times before (and something most web fiction authors who write humour and/or banter well do) whereby genuinely funny observations/narrations/banter are inserted in such a way that they drain the narrative of tension and change the tone out of nowhere.

Here we have the previous chapter ending with a big revelation with important ramifications, which transitions into Cat humorously remarking upon her friends taking the piss out of her, then back into Cat dealing with a gigantic and very serious issue in a matter of paragraphs...the tone is all over the place and it undercuts the importance of “oh shit Junipers arrested herself along with most of the officers” when Akua is using bathtubs to scry for the lulz and Cat spends time focusing on her friends ‘disobedience' and designing petty vengeance's.
