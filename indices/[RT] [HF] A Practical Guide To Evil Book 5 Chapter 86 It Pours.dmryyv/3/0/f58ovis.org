  I just don't care about her or frankly Praes at all at this point. It all feels like a pointless sideshow to what seems to be the "main story" - even the Black angle. I like them both (Black and Malicia) as characters, but the interesting parts of the story have moved away from them.

But that's... literally the point? That the Dead King is intentionally bringing up old or otherwise irrelevant plot threads so the plot /can't/ focus on him...
