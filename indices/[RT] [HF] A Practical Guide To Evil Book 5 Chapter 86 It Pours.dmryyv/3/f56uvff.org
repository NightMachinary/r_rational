I find myself more irritated by this new development than interested. The story's been building up the mystery and conflict around the Intercessor and Dead King as the escalation of the story and stakes. I care about finding out what the Dead King's goals are, what's going on with the Intercessor, what monumental changes are going to happen on the continent, what the ramifications of the Tyrant/Heirarch's actions are, etc.

I get that Malicia is a rational actor using all the tools available to her, but from a narrative (not in-world narrative, the actual story) perspective I just don't care about her or frankly Praes at all at this point. It all feels like a pointless sideshow to what seems to be the "main story" - even the Black angle. I like them both (Black and Malicia) as characters, but the interesting parts of the story have moved away from them. Their mysteries are laid bare, there's nothing new to learn or see.

Maybe we'll see the Praes story being tied in to the rest of what feels like the "main story". It would be great if Malicia felt like more of a partner to the Dead King rather than WW2 Italy to the Dead King's Germany.
