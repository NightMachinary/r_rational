I'm now shipping General Abigail and Anaraxes.

Not as a cute couple, happily-ever-after in love, oh no. I'm shipping them as a pair who make a horrible, awkward romance-adjacent mistake that deeply unsettles and shames them both, and which they both vow to never speak of or acknowledge again, even upon pain of death.

Following this, they will be stuck liaising repeatedly in meeting after meeting, never able to meet each others' gaze, with the fate of the world decided by their actions.
