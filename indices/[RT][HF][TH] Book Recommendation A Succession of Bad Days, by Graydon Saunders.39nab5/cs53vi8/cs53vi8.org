Seems fun.

The obviousness of some of the social stuff (that is, obvious if you've read other things running on similar tropes), is interesting because it keeps making me think of possibilities for 'rational'-izing it - like if in Twilight, rather than Edward and Bella being destined soulmates just because, what if you got to be soulmates by trying really hard to search out and build a long-lasting relationship with someone particularly compatible, and this was actually a thing that Bella and Edward did intentionally?
