The wording is loose enough that the genie is able to prioritize all acts of goodness at the exact same level (twice the maximum theoretical value of evil), and doesn't have a built-in tie-breaker.

Also, the genie has a perverse incentive to prioritize good acts that lead to the potential for more good acts in the future (saving kittens one at a time) over good acts that remove the potential for more good acts in the future (saving all kittens immediately).

The genie could even choose to prevent itself from ever doing good, if "heading towards a place where you can do good" is itself a good act; just walk to those kittens, then don't save them but walk to the next set of kittens, ad nauseum.
