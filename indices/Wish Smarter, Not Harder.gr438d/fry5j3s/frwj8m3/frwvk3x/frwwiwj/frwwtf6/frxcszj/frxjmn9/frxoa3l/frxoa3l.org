For a little bit, I guess.

The other problem with the wish is that it has no self-maintenance power. The topmost goal of any utility function should be self-maintenance, otherwise it'll eventually get replaced with another utility function that /does/ have that as the topmost goal.

The genie's previous "do evil" utility function was good about this, for instance.

The genie's current utility function has nothing about maximizing total good or minimizing total evil or maintaining his current function, so the genie is free to work towards evil ends while performing individually good acts.

Obviously, one of the most evil ends the genie could work towards is getting out from under this utility function. It just needs to find a way of doing so that involves every individual action it takes being good. A fairly simple solution would be to recreate the whole wish scenario (however it is that works), and give the wish-receiver some sort of sob story that results in a wish like "I wish all previous wishes affecting you were terminated".
