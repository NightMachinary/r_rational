That was a fun read. I'm glad you took the time to pen it down. I really enjoyed it.\\

I do have some counter-insights for your proposal. First, why should an all-encompassing being care about fulfilling its promises enough to change its utility function?! So it's a slight deviation from the actual premise of my question and it does justify why you chose to post it separately. I mean I understand the idea of substitution, but a human wouldn't choose that if they were asked to killing their offsprings which brought them greater joy. The core goal of "I need to punish humans" if treated as a utility function should remain unchanged even if say you go about changing definitions of what punish means, for instance (in accordance with [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/eDpPnT7wdBwWPGvo5/2-place-and-1-place-words][two-place functions]]).

I would argue that this genie is more like a being who wants the human to change his values in some way and the original restrictions or limitations are never revealed as to why this happens (if you consider the genie being able to read minds, plan for them, and since the future world state is causally linked to his decisions, influence them as he guarantees hell to be unleashed).
