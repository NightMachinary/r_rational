I'd like to second this rec. Reverend insanity has the most self-consistent world building I've ever seen in any xianxia. Fair warning though, the mc's fight against Fate doesn't start until the chapters hit 1000. For the majority of the first and second books, the mc isn't even aware of the existence of fate, much less the manipulation of fate. The concept of “fate” is masterfully interwoven with the world's canonical history, which is revealed in snippets throughout the entire work as passages from the world's scripture. Overall amazing read, translations are understandable, but the work is on indefinite hiatus at 2200+ chapters
