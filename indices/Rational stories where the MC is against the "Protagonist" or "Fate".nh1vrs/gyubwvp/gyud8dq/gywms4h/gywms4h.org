It's also got the standard xianxia problem of the main character has no motivations beyond the continual pursuit of power and additional lifespan, and is also basically an amoral monster (minor spoiler: Literally murders a woman who falls for him because she's inconvenient, feeds a young girl to a bear for a minor offense, etc. It's not bad, and it's definitely cleverer than comparable works like I Shall Seal the Heavens, but don't expect character development. Also the fact that all his male rivals end up either turning into woman or being revealed to have been women all along is kinda weird.
