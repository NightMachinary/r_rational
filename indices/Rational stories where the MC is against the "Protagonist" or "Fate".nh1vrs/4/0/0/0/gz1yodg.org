You're right that it's made abundantly clear from the beginning that the mc is unapologetically evil, so for potential readers, if you expect a hero turned anti(fate) hero maybe pass this one up.

I agree that the mc's reasoning behind his pursuit for eternal life is not made clear at the beginning, but over the course of all 2200+ chapters the motivations behind his actions are gradually explained. The lack of character development in the mc is made up for by the sheer complexity of the mc's initial character, which is gradually revealed in flashbacks over the course of the novel.

Additionally, there is a huge cast of supporting and secondary characters, so some of them are inevitably less well constructed than others. The minor trope of genderbending can be off putting at first, but due to the general lack of focus the novel places on romance, it doesn't really detract from the overall plot.
