[[https://archives.erfworld.com/][Erfworld]] features a protagonist who gets summoned into a fantasy wargaming world to bail a side that's down to just their capital city, having angered a bunch of other sides into trying to wipe them out.

In this story, Fate is an invisible but very active participant, using Predictamancy and Luckamancy to serve its own inscrutable ends. The characters talk and philosophize about it with a depth I haven't found anywhere else.

Fair warning: the comic was discontinued a couple of years ago. But there are six books worth of excellent storytelling. It's one of my favorite stories anywhere.
