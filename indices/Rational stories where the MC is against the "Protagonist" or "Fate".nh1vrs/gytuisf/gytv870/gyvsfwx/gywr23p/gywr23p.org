Personally, I got through the second volume. And while I enjoyed parts of it, the use of meta-narrative concepts to resolve conflict sorta turned me off.

It's clever in its own way, but sometimes feels too convenient for me. Something about a story that's too aware it's a story kind of ruins things for me. It's almost the opposite of why I read rational fiction, in the way that it relies on nonsense rules to deliver some of its biggest moments. To be fair, those nonsense rules are at least consistent and are exploited in interesting ways. But there's only so many times something silly like "The rule of threes" can come into play before it makes the world feel like a silly place to me.
