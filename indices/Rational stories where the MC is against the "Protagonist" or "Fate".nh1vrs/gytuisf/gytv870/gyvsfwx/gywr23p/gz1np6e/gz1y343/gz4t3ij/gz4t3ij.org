I mean the meta magic /is/ a part of the reality. In Mistborn, you eat mercury and get powers. In APGTE, you lose twice and win once. It's cause and effect, this thing happened so this other thing must happen. It works like how gravity works in our world.

I can understand it turning you off though, it's a difficult concept to properly pull off without coming off as too smart for its own good. And it certainly toes the line between cheeky and irritating. It's an overall great novel though and the other meta magics aren't nearly as forward as winning after losing twice if that's what turned you off from the novel.
