In [[https://glowfic.com/posts/3866?view=flat][/Team Tyler's Van/]]...

Well. In another universe, one with magic, the protagonist would have starred in /Luminosity/. In this story, Tyler's van slips on the ice in Forks High parking lot and there's nobody to rescue her. Instead of dying though, she finds herself as the Summoned Hero in a world where everyone knows that means she's responsible for fighting the Demon Lord.

She would really rather not.

Her companion would, in a universe with different magic, have been raised by a biochemist and star in another famous work of rationalist fiction. His magical school nonetheless features a remarkably confusing headmistress and an incredibly competent professor/mentor.

(Sadly unfinished, but it's by the original authors and fun while it lasts. Content warning: glowfic)
