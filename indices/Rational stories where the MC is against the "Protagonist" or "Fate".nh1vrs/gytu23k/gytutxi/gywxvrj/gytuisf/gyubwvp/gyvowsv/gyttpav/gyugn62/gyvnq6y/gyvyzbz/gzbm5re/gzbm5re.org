Never Die Twice. [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/32067/never-die-twice]] It is kinda dreary though, from the blurb it might seem like a comedy but it's not. I think it's a deconstruction of a number of mistakes even rationalist stories often make. People don't forget what others have done, people question whether a given means was really the only way to achieve a certain end or merely the most convenient. Morality does not adhere to what side you're on, often bad people work in the name of good causes and good people do good in the name of flawed ones. I think it's a good idea to read it.
