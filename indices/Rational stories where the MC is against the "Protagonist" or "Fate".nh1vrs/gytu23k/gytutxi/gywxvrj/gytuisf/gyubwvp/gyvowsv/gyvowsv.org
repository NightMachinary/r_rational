I don't know if this really counts, but in the Discworld book Nightwatch is basically an inversion of Les Miserables. But it changed the characters enough that if you weren't familiar with Les Miserables, it wouldn't feel like any sort of inversion. If anything, Les Miserables is an inversion by having a non-corrupt police officer as the villain and a criminal as the hero.
