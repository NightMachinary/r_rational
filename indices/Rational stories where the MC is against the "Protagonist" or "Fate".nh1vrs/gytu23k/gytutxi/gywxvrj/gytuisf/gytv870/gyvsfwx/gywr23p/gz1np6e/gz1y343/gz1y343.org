Yeah, that's fair and i see where you're coming from. It just requires greater suspension of disbelief for me when the magic is meta-narrative based.

I think it's because of the complexity of an idea like "the rule of threes". Whith something like Mistborn you can write metals granting supet powers off as some weird property of their reality. Once you get pass the initial silliness, it's almost like science the way each metal interacts with the world.

The rule of threes is more messy. Because you can't really treat it like a science. It's not direct cause and effect. It's more like some invisible hand is guiding events to reach certain outcomes. And in order for those outcomes to consistently stay the same, That invisible hand must be constantly working in ways unseen.

It makes the magic feel more like another character, rather than a natural process that exists in the world. And i think i wouldn't mind this if the character's thoughts, motivations, and limitations were explored in greater detail, but (at least in the first two volumes) that character is ill defined, despite how important they are to the events that unfold.

It's almost a litteral Deus ex Macina (sorry for spelling. On mobile). Though it's better than that, because at least the characters are aware of it, and deliberately exploit it.
