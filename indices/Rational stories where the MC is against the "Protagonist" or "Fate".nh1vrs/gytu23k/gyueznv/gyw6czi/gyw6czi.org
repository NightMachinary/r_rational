My problem with this story(at 1.29) is how pathetically small scale/time he is being the chosen hero of one of the worlds largest pantheons. As a hero he was growing steadily in personal strength and power which I loved and then it suddenly pivoted to base building/micro management. I don't mind the base building but all of the things he is implementing or doing will never affect him in a global scale(debatably). Basically feels like a filler arc.
