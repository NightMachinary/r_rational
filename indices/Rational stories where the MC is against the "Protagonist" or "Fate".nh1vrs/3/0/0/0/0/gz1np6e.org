Eh, to me all magic systems are arbitrary and fairly silly to begin with. I enjoy reading about them so it's fine, but I fail to see any significant difference between "this character can bend reality because they lost twice earlier" and "this character can bend reality because they drank mercury earlier." Mistborn is loved by many for a reason, but you have to admit that the premise of eating a bunch of metals, some of which are toxic, to gain magical powers is pretty silly.

Read (or drop) whatever you like for whatever reason you like obviously, but for me as long as it's consistent and engaging I'll roll with it.
