The author did it for thematic reasons, probably. Japanese genre and Japanese tropes, so that's why also Japanese MCs.

But yeah, I have to agree that the MC just doesn't feel Japanese /at all/, even taking his background into account. And the story would work just fine with a teenage American weeb vs a jaded millennial barista.

But it's a minor quibble.
