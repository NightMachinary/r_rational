For my purposes it's things that have been used as letters in various scripts. Currently I'm mostly using curved versions of Celtic runes, all constrained by being a single piece. But I think in the general case I would prefer to know what's true for any drawable figure. Figuring out whether any given set of glyphs follows my rules is probably NP-hard, but I'm not sure that precludes the creation of general rules.

I sort of doubt that there's any mathematical literature on the subject, mostly because there's a combination of having no practical application and a fairly niche field.
