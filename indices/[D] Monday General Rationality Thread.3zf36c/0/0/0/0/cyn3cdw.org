I don't think it's quite that hard. You just want to rigorously define and study a subset of 2D shapes. For your set of Celtic runes, it would be expensive to identify all of the combinations (basically n choose 3, where n is the number of discrete runes in the alphabet) but you could /probably/ do it in finite time. The problem lies in identifying what are the geometric properties of the glyphs that allow them to be represented together in that way.
