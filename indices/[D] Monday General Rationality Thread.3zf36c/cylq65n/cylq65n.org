Remember the site Polyhistor Academy is on? I rather like the way they do the quest by committee thing there, so I started up my own quest today. So... [[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-city-of-ruin.2806/][Blatant self promotion.]] The site unfortunately requires an account to view threads, but it's worth it just for Polyhistor.

My quest takes place in the same world as the book I'm writing, and starts where it starts. I do expect it to go off the rails immediately, so it may end very differently than I intend for the book. However, it'll also be useful to me for seeing how other people think characters should react if dumped into that scenario. If you also like the way they do 'quests' there, feel free to join in and try to munchkin things. Character generation for the PC is up and running, but so far no one character design is very far ahead, so you may be able to change the base character as well.

Edit: They seem to be going for a background in forgery.
