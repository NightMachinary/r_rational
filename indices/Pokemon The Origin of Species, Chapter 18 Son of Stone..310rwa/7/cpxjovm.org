Hey everyone, welcome back! Sorry for the deadline update, I've been spending some time this month going back and doing some significant edits to chapter one, which has not been updated to reflect them yet. I'll be sure to let you know when it's finished, for those of you interested in going back and reading a (hopefully) spruced up and more compelling first chapter!

Additionally, this one was going to be longer, but I decided to cut a portion of it near the end for not being up to my standards. Hopefully I'll have time to work at it soon and maybe edit it back in: it's nothing immediately plot relevant, so isn't important for the immediate future, and again, I'll be sure to inform in a later update if I get around to adding it in.

As usual, I'll go through this one multiple times for minor edits and tweaks at various points tomorrow and the day after, so all feedback welcome!
