Worry not when it comes to tone; I may be unusual in this but I think I prefer "abrasively direct" over "refuses to say what they mean for fear of someone taking offence".

Occasionally I've seen authors, being perhaps not entirely confident in their own grammatical abilities, make changes on the assurances of readers that they're fixing a problem; just wanted to provide a counterpoint to say that it wasn't necessarily an error.

It wasn't a point I was trying to make at the time, but on reflection I think I do prefer the way it was originally written. "Scratch" vs "scratching" is a small difference, but the latter has just a slightly greater sense of it being an ongoing condition, rather than something that happens as a single event.
