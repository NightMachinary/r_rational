I apologize in advance if I've worded this aggressively. The intention of this comment is to better understand what position you are taking here; but I have a bad habit of being abrasively direct.

I don't understand the point you're trying to make.

I felt that the the original muddied my understanding of the tense; so I made a suggestion. It's DSE's decision whether or not to change what he wrote based on the opinion of some guy on the internet, and he's clearly a capable writer. If both compositions are equal, why not leave it to him to make a decision?

I can understand if you think the way it was written originally is clearer or more pleasant; but that doesn't seem to be what you're saying.
