Nice chapter. Was interesting to see the viewpoint of a Gym Leader in this world, as well as the creation myths each town may have as legends, not to mention what might be the commonly accepted one in the region overall. I really liked how you portrayed Brock's Onix - a great sense of age and power could be felt as you described it.
