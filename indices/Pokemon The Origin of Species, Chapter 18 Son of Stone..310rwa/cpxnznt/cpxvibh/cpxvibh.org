Thanks, I've always wanted to mess with the idea that each region only has the legends about pokemon we as gamers already know about, or that all legends would only be the one-of-a-kind type of species rather than special "normal" ones. Some games played with the idea a bit, especially the Red Gyarados at Lake Rage, and I always thought it made the world feel more immersive :) Glad you liked it!
