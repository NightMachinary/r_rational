Take RPGs that were popular five-ten years ago, such as Runescape, World of Warcraft, etc. These are probably the RPGs that now-authors grew up on. These games have skills with independent EXP (Fishing, Cooking, Skinning, Firemaking, ...). As for "Grinding single actions is boring".. yes! These games were essentially you just clicking in one fixed pattern for a month to get max level. In one single skill. I don't know what was so appealing about that, but it was.

As for Dungeon Core stories, I believe they (including DKA) are based on the video game "Dungeon Keeper"; you can find let's plays on YouTube for this game, it helps visualize what's going on in the stories.
