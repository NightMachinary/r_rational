Do a thing to unlock a skill: I'm sure I've seen this before but I can't find any specific versions. A real game's implementation would be either something you actually have already, hidden, at level 0 (you don't discover unarmed until you attack something without a weapon), or something with a quest/npc trigger (talk to sage to learn magic).

Skills have independent xp: This was really common in early WRPGs, like Ultima Online.

Passive skill leveling: Here's one in [[https://www.uoforum.com/wiki/index.php/Meditation][Ultima Online]]. In roguelikes, I think Dungeon Crawl: Stone Soup has had this at some point, but it sounds like something the devteam would have removed by now.

Do a rare feat to get a title: [[https://irowiki.org/wiki/Achievement_System][Ragnarok Online]] gives you stats for achievements.

Class evolution: This is much more popular in eastern games. [[https://irowiki.org/wiki/Classes][Ragnarok Online did it]]. It was a plot point in the very first Final Fantasy, so it's been around ages.
