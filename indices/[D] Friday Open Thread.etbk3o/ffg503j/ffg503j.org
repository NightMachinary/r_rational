Is the standard litRPG ruleset based on any actual video game? Some very common rules are rare to non-existent in the video games I know, but I don't play Asian MMOs...

I'm thinking of

- do a thing for the first time to unlock a skill (seems difficult to implement when players' interactions with the world have to go through a UI you can't experiment with; plus internet guides would spoil everything)

- skills have independent XP; use a skill repeatedly to level it up (The Elder Scrolls games do this but few others. Grinding single actions is boring, often even more so to litRPG characters. Making a lot of litRPG all about patience and willpower, which is a weird trope for a videogame adaptation when you think about it)

- passive skills like damage reduction or extra mana recovery that level when you take damage / recover mana (literally never seen this)

- do a rare feat to acquire a "title", which has a mechanical effect but you only have one active at a time (I've sometimes seen achievements with mechanical effects but it's unusual and always just permanent)

- class evolution, with prerequisites for the best ones (on tabletop, 4th edition D&D does this, but it wasn't very influential; also 3rd edition prestige classes and their videogame adaptations kinda)

Relatedly, is the "dungeon core" concept entirely derived from Dungeon Keeper? Is it all because of Dungeon Keeper Ami or were there other forerunners?

It too seems to have accrued lots of idiosyncratic rules, like "unlock a thing the first time you encounter it" (resulting in many nature-themed starts). Or "bait adventurers then kill them to gain mana", when in Dungeon Keeper you're self-sufficient and have a purely hostile relationship with the outside world. (Also cores are tiny stone spheres now?)
