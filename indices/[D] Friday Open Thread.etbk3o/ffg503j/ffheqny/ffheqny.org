World of Warcraft and Ultima Online had skills with independent XP, and those are two of the biggest and historically important MMOs. (A bunch of those skills were removed from World of Warcraft with Cataclysm, but I believe are still there for "profession" skills.) Everquest might also have been an example, but I never played that. There are also some tabletop games that do this, with the first that comes to mind being one of the editions of Call of Cthulhu (I'd have to check my bookshelves).

Class evolution /probably/ comes from D&D, but I think another point of comparison might be the talent trees from World of Warcraft which allow specialization, or how the job system sometimes works in the Final Fantasy games (which I would argue are one of the biggest non-MMO influences on litRPGs).
