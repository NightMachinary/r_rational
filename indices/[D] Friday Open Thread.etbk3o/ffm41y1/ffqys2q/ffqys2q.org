Typically when people say they are fans of Transformers from a narrative perspective, they're talking about the original television series. I'm not trying to gatekeep you here, but the movies typically lose out compared to the cartoons when it comes to worldbuilding. I haven't seen Bumblebee, so I couldn't tell you if it's true for that one as well. What matters is that the type of person invested enough to read Transformers fanfiction is going to be going in expecting something resembling the cartoons. I'm not saying to watch all of them, but maybe get a beta reader who has? Someone to bounce ideas off of, so you don't accidentally reinvent something the shows did better.

As for rational fiction, the only requirement that /really/ matters is that the characters work in honest pursuit of their goals. I give very few shits about how good the plot is - all I care about is whether or not the characters are avoiding obvious self-sabotage.
