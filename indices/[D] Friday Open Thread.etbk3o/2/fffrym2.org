Do you ever have an idea for a possible invention/scientific discovery/whatever that you think is genius and unprecedented and later find out that already exists? Or worse, you already definitely knew about it and somehow forgot about it?

Isn't that the fucking worst?!

When it pops up in your mind you think it's an ex nihilo product of your marvelous intellect, but it's actually just an undigested thought turd floating to the surface of your subconcious. Ex excreto? Ex creto?

Anyway, I ask because I'm currently in the "is this a genuinely promising and original idea I've come up with, or is this just another subconcious floater?" phase, and it is a phase which I'm so burn out on that I often just dismiss most ideas before even looking into it properly. I sometimes ask myself how many ideas with potential I thoughtlessly dismissed, and while I know that statistically the answer is probably none, you can't really know for sure, can you?

As I've grown older I've come to realize just how important dogged perseverance and especially mental resiliency towards failure is for being a successful outlier in highly competitive/saturated fields such such as art, sports, science, technology, etc.

Humans are naturally risk averse, they tend to play not to lose rather than to win. Why are we risk averse? Two factors I think, the first being that risk as we've known it for most of human existence has led to death, or painful injury and then to certain death. The second is that we're social creatures and our social status is highly important to our mental well-being. Being less risk averse than normal can be a major advantage in non-lethal pursuits such as these. The distance from median to the dirt is much less than median to the sky, after all, and it's not like the floor is that bad (if you have an adequate support structure to fall back on).

In fact, they say that narcissists/psychopaths tend to be inordinately represented among successful outliers, and besides the lack of empathy(a huge advantage in many fields, I'm sure), the ability to have a stable and lofty self-image regardless of failures and negative social pressure is probably immense.

Er... I've gone a bit far afield from the original topic(cryto-plagirism, was it?) and my lunch time is over. Teach your kids mental resiliency and perseverance by letting them(encouraging them!) to fail, it will be invaluable. I wish I had some of that growing up.

Thank you for coming to my TED talk.
