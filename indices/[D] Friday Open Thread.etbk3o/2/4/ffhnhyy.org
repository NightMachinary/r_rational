Yep.

Wait, what do you mean, /worst/?

It means you've got a great idea that'll really make things better and, instead of having to go to all the trouble of making it work yourself, you can take the shortcut of just going out and buying it. Or, alternatively, of first working hard to earn money and /then/ going out and buying it.

Unless it turns out to be something you can't afford, where's the downside?
