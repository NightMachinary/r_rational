Thank you so much! I'll keep in mind that the average Transformers fans watch the cartoons instead of the movies. I'll probably read the wiki for Transformers so that I understand the source material better and have a grasp on more characters. And I was always planning to avoid relying on main characters mistakes for the plot, so I'm glad that's all I'll need to write rational fiction. Thanks again!
