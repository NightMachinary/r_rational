Big thank you to everyone who helped come up with weird planet ideas for Space Trains last week! I've decided to [[http://noisyowl.com/spacetrains/spacetrains.html][share the in-progress version of it]] with this community. Warnings: Doesn't work well on mobile yet, even worse "One more turn" symptoms than Civ.

Currently trying to figure out what I want the endgame to be. Priorities are replayability, distinction between runs, stories worth sharing, and ending on a high note. I'm increasingly thinking I want to add a third tier of resources, but that just postpones the endgame question rather than answering it.

Edit: I got enough feedback on how confusing it is below, so a quick tutorial:

Click a planet to select a project. Projects are listed as "list, of, requirements => thing it produces." Each time you meet a new batch of requirements, the planet's range (rail hops) increases by one. Most projects start with range one, but a few need to have their first requirement met first. Factory planets are not natural, you'll have to industrialize/mechanize to get them.
