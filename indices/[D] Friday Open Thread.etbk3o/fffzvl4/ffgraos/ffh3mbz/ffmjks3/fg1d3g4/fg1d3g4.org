I really like it! It has been a few days since I first checked it out and I am still going back. On my first play through I was confused and didn't get any upgrades for planets, but on my last play through I managed to cascade upgrades for many of my inner planets! The cascade stopped once my inner planets needed wafers and spaceships and I couldn't figure out how to create the needed resources.

It would be nice to have a "Discovered tech tree" or some view showing which planets can produce which resources and what upgrades they would require.
