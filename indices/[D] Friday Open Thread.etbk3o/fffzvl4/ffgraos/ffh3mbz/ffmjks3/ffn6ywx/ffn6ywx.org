  This game is amazing, and my first playthrough not knowing how things worked was still really fun. I think that is more important than having a tutorial that doesn't let you get into the meat of the game or enjoy it for a long time as has become really common.

Thanks! That's great to hear. I still think it could do a better job of explaining itself, but I want to avoid resorting to tutorial text for a while still. It's not like anyone actually reads it anyway.

  Right now, if I understand all the mechanics, there is no reward/incentive for super-funding/supplying your planets

Did you get your planets upgraded to produce the second set of resources? I think I'm going to expand to a third, so there's some upwards motion there.

  Currently trying to figure out what I want the endgame to be.

I actually think I solved this. I uploaded a version with an endgame late last night! You can find your choice of two endgames at the end of the tech tree. I'll add a third one eventually.

I like all your endgame ideas too, kind of reminds me of FTL. Mixing in some losing events would be interesting. Maybe as a hard mode.
