Well. All of it was confusing.

The game opens by showing you a bunch of planets. When you click one, a menu opens, full of a bunch of symbols, words and colors, none of which have any real explanation.

It's not hard to figure out that you can use this to assign a planet to a task, and that some resources on some planets will help other planets out.

Where this gets weird, is when you assign a planet to something, and it makes stuff without the required resources.

Like, opening a game of it now, I have the option to make a hive world. Based off the symbols I'm seeing, it looks like it will convert 3 food and one stack of cube things into a person.

Then, I can make a farm world next to that, which seems to say that it will take three people and a tentacle to produce a food.

But the moment I build both worlds, they start sending resources to each other. Despite neither of them seeming to have the required materials.

Not only does it seem like they should not have any food or people at all yet, because none have been made, they sure as heck don't have any cube things or tentacles.

So, I don't really understand how the supply chain works, but more than that, I don't even know how to get some materials.

Like, robots and wrenches, seem to be things that I only very rarely get the chance to make. I /think/ that maybe it like, requires me to have a mining planet set up nearby to even show the option? Or something?

Oh, and it looks like some resources are kept track of in the bottom right corner? The science one I understand, but why do I need to know my total population? What does production do? What is a "turn"?

Okay, just tested it, looks like "turn" means "how many times I've assigned a planet to something". Seems like some weird terminology.

My guess is that having these stats higher unlocks things? But science is the only one that says how much I need for the next unlock.

And all of this is made worse when you realize that not only does there not seem to be any way (that I have found) to reassign a planet, but also that you are working with a finite number of planets. Many times now, I seem to have been locked out of further progression because I have tons of planets that can't get the resources they need, and I can't assign any more planets.
