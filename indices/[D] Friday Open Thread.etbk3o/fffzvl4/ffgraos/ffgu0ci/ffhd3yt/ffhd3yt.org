First I'd like to say that the game is very fun and surprisingly addictive. I like the problem solving aspect and the way it encourages planning ahead.

Feedback:

My experience was that puzzling out the mechanics took me multiple tries of restarting the game, each time fooling around more to discover what the icons represented.

It took some experimentation to figure out that:

- The resource icons to the left of the arrows represented /requirements/, while icons on the right represented /rewards/.

- After I realized that, it took me a while longer to figure out that the number of resource icons in the reward section represented /how far/ each resource can travel rather than /how many/ of each resource is rewarded.

- The grey colors of the Robots and Technology resource icons were close enough to the grey 'resource not available' color that I was often confused about whether I had enough of those resources.

- When the science 'choice of reward' popup appears it would be nice if I could minimize it to review the mix of available planets/resource/upgrade requirements before deciding. That way I could make a more informed decision about strategy.
