Identifying cryptomnesia is obnoxious since it steals my pride at having discovered some solution myself, but if I've converged on an idea that others also have I'm often quite pleased, since they'll have implemented it where I likely would not. And it tells me I'm thinking of the right things, if their idea was praised however many years or decades back!
