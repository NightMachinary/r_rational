I'm thinking about writing a Transformers rational fic, but I need to know a few things first!

First, how much of the original source material do I need to have seen first? I've only seen the Bumblebee movie with my family, and I haven't seen the original cartoons. (But I may see the other live action Transformers movies because of this!) Will calling my story 'massively AU' be okay with unaware Transformers fans?

Second, are there any requirements before I can call my story rational fiction? I plan to put an emphasis on characters thinking their actions through and the worldbuilding being realistic (to an extent). But I'm not aiming to teach about rationality because I want to focus on Transformers and the story. Should my story just be called 'rational-inspired'?

Thanks for reading my questions! When I saw the Bumblebee movie, the concept totally captured my imagination and I couldn't stop thinking about how the story could be improved. I really want to share my ideas in a way that is entertaining to others and is personally satisfying to myself as well. I really appreciate any advice given to me so that I can write my story!ðŸ˜Š
