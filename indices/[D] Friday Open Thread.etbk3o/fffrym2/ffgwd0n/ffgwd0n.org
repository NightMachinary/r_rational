My take: ideas are worthless, everyone has them, and usually they underestimate how similar they are.

Real creative power comes from seeing people do something the wrong way over and over again, until you start developing a mental model of what they should be doing instead, which eventually crystallizes into a systematized theory of how to best do the thing.
