Neat, thanks for the detailed feedback! I have some ideas how to improve it from there.

The left side of a planet's project is the list of things it needs to upgrade. Commas between upgrades. Each time it upgrades, it increases the range it can send its resource by one. Most projects start with the ability to send things one hop along the graph.

The industrialize / mechanize projects convert planets into factory planets, which make several of the resources.

Most of the stats in the lower right don't do anything except change the music (game's not done yo). I'll hide them until they're more relevant.
