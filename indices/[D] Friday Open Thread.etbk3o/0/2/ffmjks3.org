This game is amazing, and my first playthrough not knowing how things worked was still really fun. I think that is more important than having a tutorial that doesn't let you get into the meat of the game or enjoy it for a long time as has become really common.

Right now, /if/ I understand all the mechanics, there is no reward/incentive for super-funding/supplying your planets (aside from increased rail-travel for their outputs, which just allows further increase to various planets inputs). One way to go with an end-game would be for the total economic output of the system to be tracked by some ancillary resource ( a distinct currency, or "victory points", or something) which interacts with the rest of the game via distinct mechanics. Maybe total output at various levels earns vicotry points, and 10 victory points is a win, with lower turn-numbers being a measure of how good a run one has. Or maybe the game plays until you're out of valid moves, and a good run is one in which relatively many "victory points" have been earned.

Or maybe the currency allows development of planets/technologies/something else(?) along a parallel or orthogonal line from the rest of the game, and this secondary system must be built up in opposition to a developing "losing event': for instance, perhaps a black hole is growing at the center of the galaxy and you need to develop enough X(t) or Y(t) or Z(t) by turn t in order to stop galactic implosion; or the same but with a star about to go quasar; or similar, but with an invading alien fleet (perhaps enough "food crystal" development allows a diplomatic solution or enough "robotic super solider" allows a military victory); or all 3 + more of these with a random and initially unknown selection of a "losing event" each game which must be discovered mid-game and overcome in the late game.
