That's a damn good prototype.

The 3 turns delays for industrialisation/terraforming/etc. is annoying, because I have to find something else to do (possibly in a distant part of the map) and then forget what my plans were.

Not sure what the endgame should be either. Right now, because every planet only gets activated 2 or 3 times, you gradually paint yourself into a corner, which is interesting as a puzzle but kind of frustrating and anticlimactic as a game.

For research choices it's pretty hard to tell which ones will be any good to you. It doesn't help that you can't check your planets while you choose (and in the early game most planets are hidden anyway).
