Interesting. For me the topic of interspecies relationships has always seemed off. Yea, okay, if all the alies look hot by human standards with big tits and dicks, but that's more like a racial thing, as 99% of aliens in SF are humanoid colored humans with minor cosmetic differences. But how many people do you see around shouting "damn, this goat is hot, would like to tap that" or "I hope to have babies with a shark"? That is interspecies for me.
