  Um, no. Homosexuality is alive and well in the rest of the animal kingdom as well. It has nothing to do with "cultures."

Animals also hump sticks and different species, lets not confuse human terms.

  Can you imagine romantic relationship with an alien from "Arrival"?

  Absolutely.
#+end_quote

Yeah, my bad for asking "can you imagine".

My point is that sexual and romatic relationship is biological, not intelectual. And biology dictates reproduction. Any kind of relationship with those kind of aliens can be mearly friendship or a strange "fetish".

Evolution "likes" different things to see what works what doesnt so we get all sorts of sexualities, but in the end is still biological and human species survived for a reason, its because we are sexually attraced to those we can reproduce with.

​

Quote what is a species: A *biological species* is a group of organisms that can reproduce with one another in nature and produce fertile offspring

So vulcans, kriptonians and asari are not different species so the authors question was wrong.

Honestly, i dont understand why so many negative reactions to my post. Its not like i touched some SJW subject.
