You didn't “just” mention that. You made multiple other claims as well.

And, again, your insistence that OP is wrong for referring to them as different species is, itself, incorrect.

Your first statement right out the gate was mere pedantry, and the worst kind of pedant is the pedant who isn't even correct. /Canis lupus/ and /Canis latrans/ are separate species, and yet they produce fertile offspring together. You are wrong. End of story.
