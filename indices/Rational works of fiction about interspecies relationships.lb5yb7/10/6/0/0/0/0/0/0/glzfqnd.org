Yes, tehnicaly i was wrong. They are different species. Realisticaly i was not wrong, since they represent different cultures and fake ears are just to keep our intrest. All those examples OP are inter cultural relationships in its core, not interspecies. Also, since all those aliens reproduce just fine with humans, they would be different subspecies at best if they all evolved on earth.

There is a reason there are no mainstream romantic stories with aliens from "arrival" or the like. Attraction and therefore romatic relationship is biological in its core and unless you have specific rare fetish you wont be attraced to them.
