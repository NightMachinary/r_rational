  Quote what is a species: A biological species is a group of organisms that can reproduce with one another in nature and produce fertile offspring
#+end_quote

That's one definition of “species,” and it's no more objectively correct than any other definition, because it's a label intended to assist categorization. There is no such actual thing as a “species,” in the same way that there is no such actual thing as “France.”

  Honestly, i dont understand why so many negative reactions to my post. Its not like i touched some SJW subject.

For all that this subreddit is not necessarily an LW auxiliary and non-rationalists can and do enjoy ratfic, the community here is still strongly influenced by the sub's origins, and you're making some /massive/ errors, on the level of thinking that the Earth is flat, or that paper money has intrinsic value.
