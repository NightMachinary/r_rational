Amount of missunderstanding is astounding.

ROMANTIC relationships are evolutionary traits. They are there so we have sex and reproduce (and raise offspring in stable enviroment), which is evolutionary purpouse of human beings. There are "fetishes" that makes individual attraced to different species but that is rare and unhealthy behavior.

Homosexuality got adopted by evolution because of cultures living and working together so they serve an evolutionary purpose. Vulkans did not evolve with us, so noone outside spefic "fetish" would be sexually attraced to them except if they looked like humans.

If you can reproduce without problem with an alien, then they are same species as us, as biology dictates, so NONE of the examples you mentioned are cross species sexual relationships. Can you imagine romantic relationship with an alien from "Arrival"? Or bugs from "Starship troopers" ?
