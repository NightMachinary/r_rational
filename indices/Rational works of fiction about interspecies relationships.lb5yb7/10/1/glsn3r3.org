Why are you kinkshaming? The only thing wrong with having sex with other species that one can't reproduce with is that we don't have any non-human species on this planet that can communicate clear consent while also not rousing strong suspicions of unethical manipulation.

That you and I find the very idea disgusting doesn't make any difference, ethically speaking.

And your "obvious exception" is special pleading. There's nothing making "same species" relevant just on its own.
