Perdido Street Station dips into forbidden man-bug romance. I don't recall how seriously it takes the cultural divisions other than the forbidden love angle, and a girl with a bug head, as it has been a long time since I read it. It isn't /particularly/ rational, except insofar as China Mi√©ville generally tries to make characters live with consequences of their actions.
