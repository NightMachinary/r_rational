Second for Homestuck, it was the first thing to come to mind on this topic. Although big disclaimer in it being a sprawling clusterfuck of a story that's hard to actually get into on account of both how dense it is, and how long the "introduction" segment is. Like it took me something like 3 or 4 attempts to push past enough of it to get to where it actually hits its stride when I read it the first time (followed by me spending weeks catching up to date with literal years of backlog). I'd make a joke here about prepping for a Homestuck read like a World of Warcraft player prepping for an expansion launch, cooked dishes ready, water bottles on hand, well rested, weekend stretching ahead of you, etc. But that would have a little bit of truth to it tbh

Also, tangent, but the majority of other sci-fi and fantasy media focusing on only couples in interspecies relationships, rather than a huge range of other possible relationship structures, some of which humans already do in polyamorous relationships and the like, always struck me as underwhelming. Like I understand writing relationship structure alongside an interspecies relationship is an exponential increase in workload, but at the same time, why can't Mass Effect let me romance all of the hot aliens at once?
