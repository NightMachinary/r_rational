Okay there are two flaws with your logic. One:

#+begin_quote
  Vulcans, kriptonians, and asari are not different species.
#+end_quote

That is the most vague and weirdest statement I have heard on this post. Of course they are different species! And whats more you are arguing that humans are only able to reproduce with these species because

#+begin_quote
  "aliens" are just different cultures from earth.
#+end_quote

That makes no sense at all! With the exception of Star Trek, there is no evidence whatsoever that humans are biologically related to kryptonians or asari.
