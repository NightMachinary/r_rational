Octavia Butler's [[https://www.amazon.com/Dawn-Xenogenesis-Trilogy-Book-1-ebook/dp/B008HALOEQ/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=octavia+butler+dawn&qid=1612314893&sr=8-1][Dawn]] fits the bill pretty well, though it's not purely a relationship story.

edit: minor spoilers for story (nothing past chapter 2): it has an explanation for why the fuck an alien species would want to mate (or even be able to mate) with a different alien species, but isn't a deconstruction of the trope.

I will also link [[https://www.xenothesis.com/][The Xenothesis podcast]] which is similar in format to We Want Worm, We Want MoR, and We Want MoR Superman but with Dawn instead of Worm, Methods of Rationality, or Metropolitan Man.
