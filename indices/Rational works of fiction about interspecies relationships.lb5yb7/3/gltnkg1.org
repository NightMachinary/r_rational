You might check out Axiom's End by Lindsey Ellis. The human and alien kinda end up in the relationship by accident and are now trying to navigate through it. Plus it's really smart and set in 90s nostalgia.

As an older throwback, the Freedom trilogy by Anne McCaffrey does this, navigating the needs of a colony vs. the relationship vs. the distrust for the alien since he's part of the race that enslaved everyone.
