Maybe "The madness season" By C.S. Freedman; it's very far from hard science. And it might be argued as alien vampire relationships. Downside a lot of the premises of the story are goddess of everything else views on evolution. Upside you have some clever resolutions to conflicts. The evil empire is made of a species of sapient man sized space ant colonies, only the colony and breeding royalty are sentient, and consciously selects for evolutionary potential , that ganked the elder race's stuff !

Edit: Someday I will get spoiler tags right on the first try: today is not that day, jam tomorrow.
