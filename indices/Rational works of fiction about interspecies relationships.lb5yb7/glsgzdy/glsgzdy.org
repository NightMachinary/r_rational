None of those you mentioned is different species since all of them can reproduce with each other.

Relationships are about sex and sex is about children. We are not sexualy attracted to species we cannot reproduce with. Of course, there are always "fetishes" or what you might call them but but they are not and cannot be healthy.

Homosexuals are obviusly exception, but it is still same species only mixed genders.
