  Relationships are about sex and sex is about children.

Not necessarily. Asexual doesn't mean aromantic -- asexual people can be perfectly happy in a sustained relationship.

Also, relationships aren't based totally off sex. A lot of people happen to find their partners attractive on an emotional level. Crazy, I know.

Also also, it feels like this statement is implying that relationships that don't produce children are somehow immoral. I hope I don't have to point out that that's flatly untrue.
