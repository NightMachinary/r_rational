Honestly, author made mention of coupling of people from different cultures, but basicaly human and asked about "inter species relationship". I just mentioned that his examples are same species, not different and that the struggles if biological are minor and most problems come from culture differences. All of those fictions he mentioned do not even atempt to disguse that their "aliens" are just different cultures from earth.
