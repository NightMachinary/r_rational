Why does the utility of giving now outweigh the utility of investing in e.g. stocks and giving a bigger amount of money at some indeterminate point in the future?

I realized there's a sort of trap or spiral a while ago where, since money helps make more money, the point at which it makes sense to give money away is always arbitrarily far away and I'm not sure what the optimal solution here is. It doesn't make sense to just hoard wealth forever but it also doesn't make sense to give $x when you can give $x+$y if you just wait a bit.
