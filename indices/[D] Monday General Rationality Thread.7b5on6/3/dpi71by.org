Maybe already considered, probably not the best thread for this, but I still want to share it.

I found an intriguing idea closely related to Roko's Basilisk:\\
/Many 4th-wall breaking characters have to consider a similar situation./

A hypothetical scenario:

A self-aware AI is part of a video game. There are thousands, if not millions of his copies living with no communication possible between each other.\\
Said AI has a certain value he wants to fulfill- let's say he wants to kill a certain troublemaker, as he makes his life /not so great/.\\
Except our AI is perfectly aware of one fact- this rascal is adored by the userbase. If he goes out to eliminate him, the players will be /enraged/, and many will go out of their way to take revenge on him, modifying his copies to suffer greatly.

This scenario can apply to any fictional character, assuming they consider at least certain pieces of fanwork as 'copies' of them, or that author will take audience's rage into consideration to punish them in next 'canon' installment.
