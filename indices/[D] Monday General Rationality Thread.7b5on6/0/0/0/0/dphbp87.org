  Donating now allows you to you build a habit.
#+end_quote

If it's better not to donate now, isn't it a bad habit?

#+begin_quote
  It's harder to donate ten thousand dollars in a lump sum than to donate a hundred dollars over a period of many months. You start thinking about how much you could do with the money, and it becomes more likely that you won't donate it after all.
#+end_quote

Again, why not just make up your mind to donate ten thousand or a hundred thousand or a million later on and then do so because it's the rational thing to do and because you've made up your mind in the past?
