An endowment is supposed to pay for a thing, not be a nest-egg for the trustees (who usually receive a small sum from the endowment for their work in managing it). For instance, it might pay for a professorship. In this case, the endowment needs to pay out a salary. Whatever is left from the interest can be re-invested.

From the wikipedia article:

  At universities, typically 4--6% of the endowment's assets are spent every year to fund operations or capital spending. Any excess earnings are typically reinvested to augment the endowment and to compensate for inflation and recessions in future years. This spending figure represents the proportion that historically could be spent without diminishing the principal amount of the endowment fund.
