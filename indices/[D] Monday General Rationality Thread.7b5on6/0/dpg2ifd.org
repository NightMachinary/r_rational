Inspired by an old article by Eliezer, I will start giving small amounts of money every couple month to effective causes.

This is to avoid a common trap for aspiring earning-to-give-people - it prevents getting into a "I will always give later" mindset, and lets one get used to selecting and re-evaluating to specific charities.
