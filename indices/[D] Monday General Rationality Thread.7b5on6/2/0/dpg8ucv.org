I started studying nutrition part-time on the side because I was getting a bit stuck in a rut with my job (traffic engineer) and was realising that nutrition was a passion of mine, and I highly recommend it. I started by just doing one of a local university's online-only classes in my spare time (took a day off work to attend the exam and that was it) and now am studying at a 50% load by taking one day a week during teaching weeks to study.

If your job and the relevant course would allow I'd highly recommend you start your studies or artistic pursuit as soon as you can, because you'll know right away whether you enjoy it, and otherwise you might never get started. Take night classes in creative writing at a local community college, jump in on the NaNoWriMo support groups that litter the internet this month, etc.
