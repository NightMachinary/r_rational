My apartment is super clean right now. Like, I vacuumed my dryer's dust filter level clean (Would recommend, it's surprisingly effective, assuming you're like me and your dryer was built 30 years ago and has a leaky filter spilling dust into the cavity behind it). It's pretty wonderful. Got a new mattress pad yesterday, and its been amazing, I feel so much more energetic and less sore than I was yesterday.

At a bit of a crossroads with what I want to do with my life. My current job in tech consulting is dull, but pays well. Considering going back to grad school for either something in biomedical engineering or robotics in the moderately near (2-3 year) future. That or making an actual effort to break into something more artistic (Game development, web serial writing, etc). Gotta say though, watching my bank account grow rapidly definitely helps with feeling slightly directionless in life, regardless of what I decide to do next, I'll have plenty of capital as a safety net.
