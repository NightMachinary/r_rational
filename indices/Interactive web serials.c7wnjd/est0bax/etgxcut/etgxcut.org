  I imagine 90% of people are choosing one option imagining one thing in their head

Quests shouldn't just offer a "pick A or B or C" without some ability to post clarifications, ask the author what they mean, suggest alternatives, and otherwise comment. That way, people can give examples of what they have in mind.

And a good quest author won't necessarily use exact vote counts to decide what to do next, they'll give more weight to suggestions that include rationale and sound sensible.

  I was thinking more like a murder mystery where after being shown all the evidence the audience gets a change to try and figure out who did it.

  Or maybe after a fight with a super powered villain who's power isn't quite clear you try to figure it out. This also has clear consequences. If you think they can walk through walls but actually they can teleport, then in the next chapter when the villain kicks your ass you know it's your fault.

So, less of a quest, more of a puzzle for the audience to figure out?

I can imagine a story like that, but that would require much more clever puzzles than I've seen in most stories, and good ways to deal with failure. Quests tend to gain readers based on the responsiveness and creativity of the quest author. Most choose-your-own-adventure books have a lot of bad endings and very few good ones. Good quests don't have only one right answer, they have many, and the author won't know all of them in advance.
