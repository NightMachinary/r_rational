I've played this for a while:

[[https://storium.com/]]

It's an interesting sort of LitRPG, multiple players just sort of take turns writing small sections of the story, using cards to play as their guide. I only tried one match which unfortunately died out due to one key player just disappearing (and another one was an idiot who couldn't write for shit and had zero self-awareness whatsoever, so he kept derailing everything else the others did). But in that game I played the basic plot was that of a human sacrifice murder mystery, HP Lovecraft meets Agatha Christie. Played with a good pace and with good writers though it ought to be pretty fun.
