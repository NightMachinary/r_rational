Hmm yes, like quests. But also not like quests.

I started reading wildbow's Department Sixty Four, and it gives me the same feeling Choose your own Adventure books did. It feels like there are no right answers. You don't have a good enough grasp on the consequences of your choice to make it meaningful. And I imagine 90% of people are choosing one option imagining one thing in their head but really wildbow meant something else.

Like [X] discipline the employee who spoke out of turn.

Could mean a stern talking to, or a one week stay in solitary.

​

HPMoR's ending was close to what I was thinking, but I read it after it ended and couldn't make myself stop at a cliffhanger :)

​

I was thinking more like a murder mystery where after being shown all the evidence the audience gets a change to try and figure out who did it.

That sort of question has a clear right answer. You know exactly what it means to guess one name over another.

​

Or maybe after a fight with a super powered villain who's power isn't quite clear you try to figure it out. This also has clear consequences. If you think they can walk through walls but actually they can teleport, then in the next chapter when the villain kicks your ass you know it's your fault.

​

Maybe someone can recommend a quest that's similar to what I was looking for? or gives choices that are more clear cut.
