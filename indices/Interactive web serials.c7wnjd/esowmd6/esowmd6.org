[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/marked-for-death-a-rational-naruto-quest.24481/][Marked for Death]] is a quest written by me and [[/u/Velorien]] that has been updating twice a week for 3.5 years now. After each chapter, the readers vote for what the protagonist should do next. The game is ultimately based off the Naruto anime, but has been /heavily/ modified in order to rationalize the setting. Still, if you think that magical ninja kung-fu punch wizards attempting to uplift a deathworld sounds like fun then you should definitely stop by.
