The insane part is, a huge amount of software isn't even being delivered anymore -- the build artifact is generating a view with an attached API.

I imagine they'll see this as a way to keep the World Wide Web together on a planetary scale. If people can't download or make copies of software you can't let the network break. But it kills it when you have interplanetary scales. No one would wait eight years for the next web page to load.
