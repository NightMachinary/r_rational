OK, let me try to be more specific.

There are a bunch of things you might do with a copy of some software:

- Sell your only copy.
- Make a new copy and sell that.
- Modify your only copy.
- Modify a new copy and give that away.
- Modify a new copy and sell that.
- Develop a new piece of software based on it.
- Run it.
- etc

Copyright law says you're not allowed to do some of those things without permission. If you don't have a license, you can only do a few (useful) things, like run the software, delete it, write a review of it.

The GPL is a license in the same way that licenses for /any other sort of media/ work. It gives you permission to do things that are otherwise illegal. You can still do all the things you could have done without the GPL, plus some things from the "reserved rights" list, like making and distributing copies.

EULAs are the opposite of that. They try to take away your right to do things that you would already be allowed to do if there was no "license" at all. They might say you aren't allowed to run the software under some conditions, or that you can't write reviews of the software.

As a general rule, I either decline or amend EULAs. There's rarely anything in them that I want or need, in exchange for all the restrictions.
