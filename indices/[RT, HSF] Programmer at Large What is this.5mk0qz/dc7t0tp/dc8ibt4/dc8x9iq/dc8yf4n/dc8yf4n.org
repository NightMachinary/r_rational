I will grant that the description somewhat obscures the distinction between contract and IP law, but:

- I don't think the latter can reasonably exist without the former, so the statement is still correct as written.
- When you can give me an accurate description of the legal nuances of the code of Hammurabi (I'd pick something earlier, but we don't /have/ any records from anything that is as far before the present as the present is before this story) I might agree that this is a reasonable thing to be upset by.

Nevertheless, the fundamental point remains correct even without clearing up that distinction: Software is not being exchanged, only a license to use that software in a particular way. What rights that license grants you may have defaults that are set by IP law, but that is essentially irrelevant to the explanation when what requires explaining is the very concept of software licenses.
