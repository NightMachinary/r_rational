  Software is not being exchanged, only a license to use that software in a particular way.

No. No No No. I understand why a lot of companies spend a lot of money convincing you that this is true; that's part of the unwritten "answer" in the original story here. But it's not. Not in the US, not in any of Europe afaik, nor anywhere else on Earth that I've heard of. A copy of the software is definitely being exchanged, and you can use that copy without needing a license.

The *huge* distinction is between licenses that give you permission to do things that are otherwise illegal, and licenses that try to restrict you from doing things that are otherwise legal.
