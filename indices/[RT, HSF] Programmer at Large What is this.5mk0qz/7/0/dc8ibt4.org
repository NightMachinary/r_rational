  That's not the kind of license that the GPL is, at all.

Yes it is? The GPL is a license to use the software in a particular way. That includes a great deal of leeway - modifying, redistribution, etc. - but it isn't total - you can't distribute build artifacts on their own, you can't remove the license, etc.

It doesn't restrict what you do when you /run/ the software much (barely at all really), but that's not what the sentence says.

Granted you usually don't /sell/ it, but there's nothing stopping you from doing so (and elaborating in story would open a whole extra can of worms).

  It's almost the exact opposite of that, and the kind of license described here is mostly not a real thing.
#+end_quote

This claim seems to ignore the existence of, like, basically all software, but in particular the fact that basically all proprietary software comes with an EULA.
