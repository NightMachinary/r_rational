  "wiki" has been struggling with is what seems odd

Ah, you're thinking of wiki as an AI (This is a problem the crew sometimes have too). It's not. It's literally a wiki, albeit a rather more advanced one than we're used to - it's a bunch of hand-written answers, a giant pile of heuristics, and a lot of manually tuned decision trees that have built up over the (many) years. The natural language interface is pretty good, and the depth and breadth of knowledge that you get with this level of brute force is huge, but there are still gaps in its knowledge that it has no inferential ability to close.

The reason the answer doesn't exist isn't because wiki struggles to provide it. It's because nobody has written it. And the reason nobody has written it is that the study of the ethnography of software licenses is really niche. Most social science practiced shipboard is either about shipboard societies or is concerned with very specific questions of trade. Nobody tries to sell software licenses to interstellar traders twice, so the issue doesn't come up much.
