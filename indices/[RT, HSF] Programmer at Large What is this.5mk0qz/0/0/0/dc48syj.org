A thing worth noting is that this is not, despite appearances, an author tract. The protagonist is not "correct", he's just from a different culture with different priorities and assumptions.

Amongst those priorities is that the software ecosystem he lives in runs a slower than light interstellar trading ship. From their perspective, software that you can't modify long after the civilization that produced it has died or passed out of easy communication range is a death trap and is to be avoided at all cost.
