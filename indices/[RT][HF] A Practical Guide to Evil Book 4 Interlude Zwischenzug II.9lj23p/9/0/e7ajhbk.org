Thief has been incredibly suspicious of Hakram since that time he threatened to snap her neck if she ever turned on Cat, and her self-worth has taken a beating in the last few books because she hasn't ever had a real solo victory like any of the other Woe. The two issues kind of fed into each other now that Vivienne is stuck with Hakram and basically no one else to talk to, so Hakram decided to kill two birds with one stone by unequivocally demonstrating that he both values Thief and that she can trust him by chopping his (living) hand off.
