The Cursed became The Captain, which really doesn't sound like a transitional name reaching a final state. I can't remember specifics, but I feel like at least one other such transition has shown up. I can't think of any instances of names being just lost, but my memory is certainly not infallible. Thus I strongly suspect Thief is transitioning due to having a new Role.
