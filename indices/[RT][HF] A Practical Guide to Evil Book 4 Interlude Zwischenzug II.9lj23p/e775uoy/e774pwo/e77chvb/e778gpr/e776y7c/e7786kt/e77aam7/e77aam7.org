Is it that easy to get a new Name? Maybe I need to reread the archives, but I think we've mostly only heard about name changes in regards to transitional Names to their final state. Squire, Apprentice, etc. And all the shit that's going on with Cat, of course, but as always she's a special case, and Squire was a transitional Name anyways.

I didn't get the impression that most Named ever got the opportunity to get new names. You either have it 'til you die, or the necessary conditions that made you eligible end, making you no longer eligible and it's just gone.

But maybe I've been thinking about it wrong?
