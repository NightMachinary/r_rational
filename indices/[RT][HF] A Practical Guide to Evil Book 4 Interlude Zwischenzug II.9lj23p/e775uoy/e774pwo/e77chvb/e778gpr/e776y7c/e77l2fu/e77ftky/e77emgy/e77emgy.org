I am having a tough time with this one. (Edit: I know very well what the author intended. It just isnt setup as a tradition of orcs orvthe Praesi, nor is it something hakram explained ahead of time. He just did it and apparently expects her to figure it out and somehow be soothed)

If I am suffering from PTSD (from being lit up by mages) and am afraid that someone is a violent psychopath, having them randomly cut off their own hand in front of me would not make me less afraid.

It would trigger my PTSD, scare me even more, and result in both horrible nightmares and an intense belief that it is only a matter of time until the individual snapped the rest of the way. Violently.

Also, telling me that I am only worth a hand feels insulting. More like a taunt than anything else.
