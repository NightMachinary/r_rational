Jesus Christ, Hakram.

So now I'm wondering if the last line of the previous chapter--"In the game, as in all things, it was always better to be the betrayer than the betrayed"--was not a statement of intent, but a description of the main obstacle to the trust he seeks? Like in the Prisoner's Dilemma, when the risks of cooperation are too high, betrayal is incentivized--and by offering what he seems to believe is tangible evidence of his precommitment to cooperate, he changes the incentive structure to make trusting him rational, so that he and Vivienne can cooperate and avoid the real-world analogue to his game's "Callow takes all" outcome? I don't know. I think Hakram's a few steps ahead of me.
