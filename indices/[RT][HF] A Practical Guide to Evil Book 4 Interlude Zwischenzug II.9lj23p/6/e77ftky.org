  “And yet you fought by the side of a man touched by the Choir of Compassion,” the orc said.

I hate to say that Vivienne's paranoia is catching, but Willy was a part of Contrition, not Compassion. AFAIK, there's no such choir, so Hakram was either lying here for reasons I can't suss out, or EE made a typo. That's a pretty big typo to make, though...

In her boots, I'd hear this and immediately think Harkram was gaslighting her.

Edit: just saw another poster mentioned the maybe-typo. Oops!
