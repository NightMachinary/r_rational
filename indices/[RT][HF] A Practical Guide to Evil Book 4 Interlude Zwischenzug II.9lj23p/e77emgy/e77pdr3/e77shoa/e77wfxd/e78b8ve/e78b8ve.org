Thats just it, there was no bargain.

Imagine you are talking to someone you are worried is unstable and violent. They let you know they know you are worried, then they break their nose on the table, getting blood everywhere, and tell you that you are worth losing their nose over.

1) the person never expresses you breaking your nose will help them feel better 2) you never ask if breaking your nose will make them feel better 3) there is no tradition of breaking your nose as a form of apology

So in-story, we have the believed-to-be-violently-unstable-orc just doing the thing and assuming it will help. no discussion about it, just did it. Then he tosses out that she is worth it. We the reader know what he means, but I am not at all convinced she would based on the words used.

Yes, it is made clear to the reader what he hopes to gain by cutting off his hand, but there is no buy-in from her. Meanwhile violently and unpredictably cutting off his hand does nothing to help the perception that he is violent and unpredictable.
