  "He's threatened to kill me, and I'm actually pretty afraid of him. A little paranoia would be understandable."
#+end_quote

Paranoia is suspicion without justification. It's understandable, here, but not /reasonable/. She's been loyal and useful in Cat's service, and she has no rational reason to expect Hakram to take issue with her.

  He's effectively running Callow, and yet his main motivation is not the interests of Callow. Conflicts of interest may well arise. They may have arisen already. Is it really that hard to understand not trusting someone with powerful incentives orthogonal to the goals they're supposed to achieve?
#+end_quote

She's noted that he has never taken the opportunity to build the support he'd need to publicly run Callow, so it's hard to buy the misuse of power angle. And orcs having basic rights isn't orthogonal to Callow's well-being unless you're a racist (which she clearly is).

Edit: I re-read the passage, and she fears he'll manipulate Cat into a war for orcish independence, which /would/ be orthogonal to Callow's interests. She just happens to be overlooking that Callow is basically already at war with Praes, things will probably escalate, and orcish allies could only help Callow.

  He's talked about helping an ingroup, which doesn't necessarily relate to willingness to help an outgroup, especially at high cost. I mean, look at Juniper - the whole reason she doesn't trust Vivienne is becuase Juniper believes that ingroup loyalty is the sole valid basis for ethics, and that higher loyalty to principles is wrong.

The problem isn't whether Hakram is demonstrably altruistic, the problem is that Vivienne think's he's incapable of understanding altruism altogether, and attributes that inability to a fundamental character flaw. Hakram asked why she supported the Liesse Accords, not because he couldn't imagine altruism as the motive, but because there were other possibilities. He tried to understand her, and she turned it into an insult.

  She thought that Hakram would get off with a slap on the wrist if he killed her. She would know that that isn't true if she realized that she was still a valuable part of the Woe
#+end_quote

That doesn't really work, considering the political ramifications would be bigger than a slap on the wrist (no matter how forgiving Cat might be), but you worded that in a way that made me realize the better way to arrange Hakram's epiphany. Here's the relevant passage:

#+begin_quote
  “Your life is in no danger,” Deadhand calmly said.

  She laughed, right in his face.

  “Is that so?” she mocked. “Why, because Catherine would be cross if you killed me? It would pass. She needs you too badly, and you'll be able to tell her you tried before I so regrettably forced your hand.”

  “Your murder would be seen as a greenskin coup, regardless of context,” Adjutant said. “So if you cannot believe in my own intentions, at least believe in the practicalities involved.”

  “Spot on, Deadhand,” she snarled. “There's nothing quite as reassuring as hearing one's death would be politically inconvenient.”

  “So that's the kernel,” the orc said, sounding surprised. “You do not believe you have worth.”
#+end_quote

It would make more sense to cut out the political bit altogether:

#+begin_quote
  “Your life is in no danger,” Deadhand calmly said.

  She laughed, right in his face.

  “Is that so?” she mocked. “Why, because Catherine would be cross if you killed me? It would pass. She needs you too badly, and you'll be able to tell her you tried before I so regrettably forced your hand.”

  “So that's the kernel,” the orc said, sounding surprised. “You do not believe you have worth.”
#+end_quote

Vivienne states the view that her murder wouldn't be punished, Hakram sees she undervalues herself.

(As a strategic asset, of course. She's still a worthless human being.)
