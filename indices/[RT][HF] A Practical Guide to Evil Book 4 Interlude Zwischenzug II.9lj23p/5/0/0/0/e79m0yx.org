Bear in mind that her Name and the Role it plays are classically very paranoid, especially when Thief is played as an Evil role. It's likely true that she's heavily pressured into being paranoid in the same way that Diabolist was heavily pressured into monologueing, in addition to both already naturally fitting those roles heavily.
