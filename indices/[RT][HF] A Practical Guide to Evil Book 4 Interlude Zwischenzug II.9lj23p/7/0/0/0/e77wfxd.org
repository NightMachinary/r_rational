It's not about loyalty. It's about value.

Thief has questionable loyalty, true, but this all comes from her perceived lack of worth. That perceived lack is making the possibility of the Woe losing her (either her name or by betrayal or just parting away).

Hakram cut off his arm in a "bargain" - his arm, in exchange for /her/. And afterwards, he states that it was worth it - she is far more worth to him and the Woe than his hand is.

Her disloyalty and paranoia and thoughts of betrayal are only symptoms of her supposed lack of worth. Hakram went after the root of the problem, by making it clear to her that she is easily worth losing an arm.
