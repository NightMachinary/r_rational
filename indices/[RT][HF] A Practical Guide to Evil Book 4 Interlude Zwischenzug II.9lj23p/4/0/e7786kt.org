She hasn't been doing that much thieving recently - is it possible she's transitioning between Names? She seems to be filling the Role of Spymistress or Chancellor for Cat these days. We saw Masego change from Apprentice to Hierophant on screen, which was very flashy, but it makes some sense to me that Named could also have more subtle transitions over a longer period.

I do think it's more likely that she's just losing her Role, given the physical changes. Maybe she'll lose her Name entirely, then gain another?
