The Aspect 'failing to bloom' feels important. In conjunction with the recent comment upon Vivienne's physical appearance not being set (hair still growing) unlike other named it seems like the grasp on her Name is...weakening? Perhaps failing to fulfill or lean into her Role to such an extent has caused it.

The main argument against this is that Hakram seemed to know that Thief would be unable to Hide, otherwise that whole gambit at the end would not have worked. I believe Hakram has a third aspect slot open but I don't recall any dialogue from him that sounded like a trigger for some kind of new nullifying aspect.
