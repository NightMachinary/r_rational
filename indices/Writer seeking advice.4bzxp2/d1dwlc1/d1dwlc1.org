I volunteer as tribute. No, seriously, I'm willing to beta. I unfortunately can't guarantee that I'll do it long term, and I'm a relatively slow responder (up to a week) but I like to think that I'm fairly thorough. If you're interested, PM me.

The last story I beta'd on was this one: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7768113/1/Inexorable-Tidings]]

Although it died.
