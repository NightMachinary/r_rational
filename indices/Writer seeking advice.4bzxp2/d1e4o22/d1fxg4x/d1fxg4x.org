To add to this, Archive of Our Own has substantial audiences, but I say "audiences" in the plural because it depends a lot on fandom.

Naruto looks to have half as many works as Homestuck, which means that it probably has a decent audience. Even if you don't post it on ao3 first, you should do that at some point because of the tagging system. If you add the "rational" tag to your work, then it'll be found by anyone who's looking for rationalfic.
