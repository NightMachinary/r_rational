It was actually very challenging to write, aesthetically. The content was fairly straightforward: it's a chapter that's been rattling around in my head for over a year (as impatient as any reader is to see more of the story, believe me when I say that I'm at least as impatient to write it!), so I already knew most of the points I wanted to hit on, though a few new ones popped up while writing, as they always do. But the choices of how to convey his psychic abilities and developing mind were harder than I originally thought.

I also was caught up a bit on the technical side of writing: using a first-person perspective without using "I" or "me" for half the chapter was pretty challenging, and I spent quite a lot of time editing to make it all work reasonably well. Glad to hear I succeeded at least somewhat :)
