I was so confused with the first few paragraphs. And then the line 'who am I' came along and that was my first clue as to the direction this chapter was going.

All in all its a fascinating chapter. The progression mewtwos thoughts is actually pretty logical in leading up to how he turns against humans (assuming your going that way).

Curious as to why Alakazam was dumbed down so much? It's said to have an IQ of 5000 if I remember correctly, and I understand that would be hard to fit in with a realistic world, but a 3 year olds mind seems a bit too dumb for the smartest Pokemon.

Great chapter and loving this fic. Keep up the excellent work
