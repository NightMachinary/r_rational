I only have a question? From a rational point of view, I don't quite understand why Red hasn't devoted more time to exploring/developing his psychic powers. The emotional drawbacks seem severe, but psychic powers seem like an incredible tool for understanding Pokemon (which is Red's main goal), especially after the release of this new chapter (for example, maybe being in the mind of a Spinirak when it uses its dark attack could help Red determine how that attack works?) . So why isn't Red/ is Red going to push his psychic powers? He could be the first psychic professor! Maybe what the world needs to withstand Mewtwo is for a psychic professor to study it.
