Hey all, welcome back! Big announcement to make: after lots of suggestions and feedback, I've finally made a Patreon. If you want to check it out and contribute some sandwich money to show your appreciation, feel free to check it out [[https://www.patreon.com/daystareld?ty=h][here.]] Becoming a patron gives access to info about all the other writing and projects that I plan to put up at my website soon. I've also begun putting up posts to answer questions other patrons ask, and have blog and info posts there, like a team roster for Red, Blue and Leaf, which will be updated monthly!

Thanks in advance for any patronage, but more importantly, for your fandom. It's been over two years since I started writing this story, and I'm as glad as anyone to still be at it. Consider the patreon my commitment to continue for many more to come. I write the stories I write for me, but the hours of editing and research and fact checking to make sure I write the best quality I can, that's for all of you awesome guys and gals.

As always, any feedback is welcome, whether on the story or the patreon. Enjoy!
