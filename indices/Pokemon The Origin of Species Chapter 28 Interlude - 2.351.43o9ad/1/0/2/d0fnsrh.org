I think it's Magcargo with the skin temperature of 18,000 degrees F, but I agree, it's pretty ridiculous. How can we live with something almost twice as hot the sun? Edit: I normally prefer the games to the anime, but it has come in contact with many other pokemon in the anime. I think the others would have noticed if something /that/ hot hit 'em.
