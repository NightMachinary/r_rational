Thank you, I'm glad you're enjoying it!

The internet abounds with comics making fun of how ridiculous pokedex entries are, like machamp punching a thousand times in two second, or slugma's skin being 18,000 degrees F (!!!). The best explanation for it that I've heard is that it's literally written by (particularly dumb) children who just kind of write in whatever they think makes sense, since pokedex are open wiki-like tools :) In my world pokemon are all roughly animal intelligence, because the games for the most part show no indication of them being sapient, so pokemon like alakazam, which are considered the smartest, are about as smart as our smartest non-human mammals, chimps.
