Heh. The terminal illness idea is one I haven't considered, since Healing Pulse is the only pokemon move that lets them intentionally heal something other than themselves and it's not a move Mewtwo can learn. They have no reason to know that of course, but if he can't heal himself they're probably less likely to think he can heal someone else. Still, it's an interesting idea, especially since the security risk is self-contained: if he can't fix them, they'll be dead soon anyway!
