Thank you!

  Seems stupid they've run no experiments trying to get Mewtwo to heal itself or other humans. Seems like too big of an upside not to try.

I'm going to edit in some info that explains this a bit more: the gist is that Mewtwo has been studying his own biology through the researchers and testing his powers to see if he can fix what's wrong with him, but so far has had no success. He thinks that it's because all the machinery and environment is interfering, but Giovanni thinks letting him out to try is too big a risk, both for himself and for others.
