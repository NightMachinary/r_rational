Simply put: don't offer fanfiction for money. Don't offer anything fanfiction related for money, if you want to be super safe.

I got a lot of great suggestions for Patreon rewards that I wish I could do, like letting a patron suggest a pokemon and I write a short scientific paper on them. But it brushes way too close for comfort, so my patreon is very explicitly about supporting /all/ of my artistic efforts, and rewarding with all of them. If people come there for the pokemon, great, but it's not the focus of the patreon.

That's also why the donation schedule is monthly. I happen to publish a pokemon chapter monthly anyway, so that works out nicely, but if that ever changes I'll still be doing the monthly donations, because having the payments coupled to putting out fanfiction is risky.
