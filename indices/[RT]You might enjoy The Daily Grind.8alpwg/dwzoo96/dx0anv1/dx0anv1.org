That would be a nice twist for a portal fantasy fic.

"And just as he was about to save the kingdom, a squad of soldiers with assault rifles, body armor and faceless helmets stormed the throne room, shooting everyone with tranquilizer darts.

John S.I. Worldsaver raised his sword high, activating its impenetrable forcefield, and making himself impervious to all physical attack. One of the goons turned towards him, and pressed his helmet's earpiece.

"Interest target Bravo located", the soldier said. Another soldier slid a small metal object towards John that bumped harmlessly against his forcefield. In the confusion, it took John a few seconds to realize that the shape was that of a smoke grenade. Gaz flowed out of the grenade, filling John's lungs before he could think to hold his breath.

As he slipped into unconsciousness, John dimly heard a voice, sounding like it was light-years away:

"Target is contained."
