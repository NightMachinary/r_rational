I support this recommendation. Characters' reasoning makes sense, they methodically investigate the anomaly they're presented with, exploit it in a variety of ways, come up with new approaches and ways to make life easier for themselves, and otherwise act intelligently.

One of the negatives is a somewhat slow/purposeless plot. I don't think it would be much of a spoiler to say that by chapter 37, there's still no more concrete goal than "make profit, try to figure out what the dungeon is". They /are/ greatly interested in both, and with latest plot developments it may speed up, but the large-scale plot is a bit... loose.

The exploration and the anomaly are quite entertaining, though. The author [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/836g9f/oc_the_last_nights_of_castle_verdant/dvffp92/][wrote several sci-fi stories for r/HFY]], by the way, so I'm looking forward to the anomaly's inevitable explanation.
