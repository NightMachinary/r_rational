Boxes and barrels aren't the kind of place that most people would think you would store valuables -- they're for bulky stuff of mundane utility.

People who think at level 2, but who think that everyone else only thinks at level 1, would therefore think of this as a good hiding place -- after all, who would look there? Everyone else would think it's just going to be fish, or meat, or fur, or salt, or water, or something else ordinary. A thief might come into your home and ransack places that look like you might store valuables, but they'd leave your pantry alone.

Of course, anyone who thinks at level 3 would then realize that this is therefore an OBVIOUS hiding place... but level 3 thinking requires more intelligence than a "normal" person would generally employ.

EDIT: Of course, it's entirely possible that you occasionally will have people operating at level 4 -- they hide their REAL valuables elsewhere, and the token valuables in the boxes/barrels are a decoy to make a level 3 thief think they've found their haul (making the thief think the victim is operating at level 2) and leave.
