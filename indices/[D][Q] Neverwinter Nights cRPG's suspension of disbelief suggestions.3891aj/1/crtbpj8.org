Assuming you're playing NWN1, I'd recommend Shadows of Undrentide instead of the original campaign if you want to roleplay. SoU is just significantly better about stuff like this. Random containers near people don't usually have incredibly valuable stuff in them, but instead things that are useful for crafting. Also, breaking into places/chests turns your character more and more chaotic. HotU is likewise better about this, but mostly due to the setting it's in. Both SoU and HotU are superior in other ways to the original campaign, in my opinion.

In the OC, I'd just go with the explanation that your character is particularly skilled at scrounging things and/or takes a lot of time for each container that isn't shown due to the gameplay timescale. The valuable items are /there/, they just take a lot of effort to find. Or something.
