I am tempted to imagine that people in NWN were actually /constantly/ taking advantage of the items-appearing-in-containers, but the boxes keep refilling soon after, and it went on for such a long while (read: years), that a law was created that forbode great majority of people from selling all those summoned-items, because this would take away the profit from the rightful creators, and make them land on the streets, homeless, which will subsequently ruin the economy. (According to my poor understanding of it... or let's say that NWN's economy indeed is /that/ shabby.)

But what makes the Player Character so special that he can sell randomly-found stuff..? >.> ...He doesn't have any reputation at the beginning of the game.
