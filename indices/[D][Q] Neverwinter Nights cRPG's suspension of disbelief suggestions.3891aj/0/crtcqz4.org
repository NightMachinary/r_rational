In Fantasy World, the possessions of the dead exist in a kind of legal and social limbo. For the most part, the law considers such possessions to be the property of whoever happens to claim them, though a huge mess of laws and precedents give conflicting rights to family members, lords, and debt holders. In the present, however, most of that's ignored, since to actually claim the property of a dead person has become a significant taboo. This is due both to a fear of insulting family members or stealing from lords, and due to a widespread belief that the possessions of the dead are cursed to bring bad fortune to whoever claims them.

As a result, when someone dies, their belongings are often left to rot in boxes in tombs, alleyways or out in the woods, most likely legally available to anyone, but unclaimed due to superstitions and sensibilities.

Enter the Hero. While an ordinary traveler or beggar would be shunned if seen rifling through the abandoned possessions of those killed in last month's monster attack, it's well known that the Hero wiped out those very monsters single-handedly, and anyway, those boxes were really starting to clutter up the street. Thus, the Hero provides an additional service: taking any potential curses on themselves, and charging headfirst though the tangled morass of legality and convention to bring valuable items back into useful circulation.
