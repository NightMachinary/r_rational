The NWN universe has an anti-entropic cosmological constant that leads to continuous creation of organized matter via Nixborn's Thaumaturgical Hypostases. Handwave handwave handwave obviously means it can be controlled by fairly low level mages who increase the local creation flux inside a box to the point where desirable objects show up inside it. However, handwave handwave means the creation of objects follows a probability distribution that means a lot of them don't materialize where they want, but show up in enclosed spaces around where the mage is working, leading to the random appearance of valuables in otherwise empty barrels and boxes in cities.
