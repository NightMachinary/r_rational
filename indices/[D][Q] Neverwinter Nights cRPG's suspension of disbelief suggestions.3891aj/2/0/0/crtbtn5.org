Those are the most horrifying monopoly laws I've heard of. It is like putting a copyright on wild berries, making it illegal for anyone to pick them so that domesticated berry farmers get to sell more. I hope we never get /that/ far. At least at this point the only abundant resources that are artificially made illegal still need to actually be created by humans. Imagine having to enforce copyright online in a world where songs and movies just spontaneously appear within random empty folders on computers worldwide.
