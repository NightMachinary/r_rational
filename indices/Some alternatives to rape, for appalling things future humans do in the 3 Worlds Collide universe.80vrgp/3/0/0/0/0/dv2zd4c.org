here I thought I was being original but I suppose "no such thing as a parenting license" actually gets brought up a lot

the main thing that this change does but that might escape notice is that it shifts the blame from something we're unused to dealing with (unrestrained liberalism will inevitably lead to a world of people marrying cows!) to something that seems pretty familiar ground (curse you despotic government for imposing your moral values upon us!) so it's not ideal

it would be best to have the future be too permissive for our tastes since the idea the audience for these stories would be less prepared for but I can't think of anything suitably punchy without going too far
