Yeah. It's like, I know the narrative intent is to replicate the kind of discomfort someone from the past would feel about present-day social norms. But we're primed to think of more recent social developments as improvements--like, "we were wrong before, but now we've figured out that it's okay to XYZ." So when a story proposes a future that isn't explicitly dystopian, and an abhorrent (to us) social change is described as following that same "we were wrong but now we know" pattern, it /feels/ like it's saying that social progress will inevitably lead to socially acceptable rape because rape is actually totally fine. And I'm hesitant to recommend a work of fiction to someone if I know I'm going to have to awkwardly explain that the author doesn't /really/ support rape, I promise, yes I know how it sounds but /actually.../
