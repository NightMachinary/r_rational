precisely. It annoyed me enough I actually do want to write an alternative to share with people (and did a draft last year.) I might actually take another stab using the "parenting" idea. I could envision a future society outlawing private parenting, as it could lead to non-egalitarian results and be construed as child abuse. it's also similar to the baby-eater situation. the problem is it removes some of the cultural attachment to children which is leveraged in the story.
