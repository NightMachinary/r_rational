These are things real people already are fine with. Especially the author of 3WC. Polyamory and the rational community in the Bay area have large overlap from what I've heard.

And being gay /really/ isn't something shocking anymore. In Iceland there was a lesbian prime minister while the Vice Chancellor of Germany between 2009 and 2011 was gay while ruling in tandem with Merkel's conservative party. Doesn't really scream 'morally unfathomable' to the author's readership when it should be expected almost common place in a generation or two.

  The Impossible Possible World has teleporters which work by scanning the subject, re-constructing him at the intended destination using a high-tech matter-energy beam, and finally burning the original subject alive.

Star Trek already does that. How many people are horrified by Star Trek?

  Once, there was magic, but a government decided to eliminate all magical items, places, and people because magic was just too big of a threat to humanity.
#+end_quote

That has nothing to do with morality, nor is it shocking since we have no context of what has been lost. Either the newly discovered magic /was/ that dangerous, in which case it is sad but completely understandable and agreeable, or it could have been made safe, in which case that's just dumb.

  Robot slaves

Makes the whole point of wanting to save baby eater children moot. Why care about the welfare of completely alien but sentient creatures if we don't care about our own homegrown sentient aliens?

  Human slaves, who are later mind-wiped of their misery in slavery and given freedom again, which makes it okay.
#+end_quote

This may be a decent one.

  It's okay to rape... we've all been genetically engineered not to care.
#+end_quote

Makes the whole crisis of the Super Happy Fun people moot. The whole point is that humans are horrified by them because they engineered away their capacity for pain and discomfort. You're proposing that humans could have done the same, in which case why be bothered that some superior aliens already went a bit further?

  Sex robots (because sex robots are actually happening and I think it's a bit disgusting, but it seems like people are going to get used to them.)
#+end_quote

Sentient? If no, what's the problem? If yes, do they enjoy the task they were given and do they get the right to self-determination within the frame of their artificial value system? If yes, what's the problem. If no, see my point regarding robot slaves.
