I believe Kim Stanley Robinson did that schtick first with "Think like a Dinosaur".

More recently a book I won't name because I can't dis-recommend it enough had a schtick that the whole world teleport network ran like that /and somehow it was still a secret/. I gave up partway through because everyone was juggling deluxe gold plated idiot balls.

If I got my hands on a device that duplicated me, I could think of way more interesting uses than faking a teleporter.

For duplicative teleportation where you don't kill the original: /Rogue Moon/ (Budrys, 1960) /The Saga of Cuckoo/ (Pohl/Williamson 1975), "A Just Peace" (Vinge, 1971). Interestingly, in all of these the duplicate at the far end is considered expendable.
