I haven't read that yet, but let me make some suggestions. None of that seems all that bad.

What about kidnapping someone and using their body as an incubator to grow spare organs?

Brain to brain data transfer so you can grab somebody, steal all their memories, wipe them clean, and steal all their liquid possessions.

Transferring minds into other bodies custom built for the purpose seems like it could be horribly abused. Build something with the intent that the person suffer, and put them in it. Like a body that has a strong imbalance which gives it a near irresistable urge to commit autocannibalism. Give their body to your girlfriend and fuck in front of them. (This one is just body horror+rape but i couldn't help adding it in.)

Incorporating still living people into your furniture.

That's all I have right now. Hope you like the extras.
