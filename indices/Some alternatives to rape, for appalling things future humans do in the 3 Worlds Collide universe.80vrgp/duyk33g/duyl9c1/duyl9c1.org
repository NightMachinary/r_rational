Really, I don't think anyone would care that much. In principle, sure, people think that you should be able to have an abortion at any time throughout the pregnancy. In (this alternative) reality, only the people who want to get pregnant will and they won't need to get abortions. It's essentially a nonissue and it's hardly jarring.

It's also not a very good one because this applies to a society that many people today are familiar with (pre-1960s US, some other countries), while Yudkowsky was looking for something that no country ever has legalized or found acceptable.
