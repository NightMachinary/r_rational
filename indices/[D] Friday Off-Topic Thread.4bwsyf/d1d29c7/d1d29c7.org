/What are your favorite blatantly-agenda-pushing books?/

I've enjoyed reading many propaganda pieces. /[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/662][Atlas Shrugged]]/ (objectivism) and /[[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/140][The Jungle]]/ (socialism) are two of my favorite stories (I've read the latter on four separate occasions, IIRC), and I also greatly enjoyed /[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2122][The Fountainhead]]/ (objectivism), /[[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1164][The Iron Heel]]/ (socialism), /[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29966][The Shape of Things to Come]]/ (socialism), /[[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/271][Black Beauty]]/ (animal rights), and (of course) /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108][HPMoR]]/ (rationality). I just finished reading /[[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16470][The Profits of Religion]]/ (socialism), and liked it a fair amount.\\
(I probably should get around to looking up some fun religious or reactionary texts...)

On a related note, Project Gutenberg has [[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5050][a nice archive]] of past State of the Union Addresses made by Presidents of the United States. They're surprisingly interesting to read. For example, at the close of 1859, Buchanan spoke, not only about slavery (including [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostend_Manifesto][the possible purchase of Cuba from Spain]]), but also on a possible military restoration of order to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reform_War][chaotic Mexico]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Tientsin][an Opium War treaty with China]], among other items. Likewise, Theodore Roosevelt's first address in 1901 started with a panegyric to his [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_William_McKinley][assassinated]] predecessor and an assertion that "anarchistic speeches, writings, and meetings are essentially seditious and treasonable", before moving on to discussion of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Theodore_Roosevelt#Trust_busting][trust-busting]] and how immigration standards should be tightened (including a reinstatement of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Exclusion_Act][the Chinese Exclusion Act]]) to keep out people "below a certain standard of economic fitness to enter our industrial field as competitors with American labor"--i.e., willing to work for too-low wages.

Also, a lot of the older language takes two or three attempts for a modern reader to understand! A mind-melting sample from Washington:

#+begin_quote
  Gentlemen of the House of Representatives: I saw with peculiar pleasure at the close of the last session the resolution entered into by you expressive of your opinion that an adequate provision for the support of the public credit is a matter of high importance to the national honor and prosperity.

4chan's new board "/his/" ("History & Humanities") has developed a GUTBUSTINGLY-funny new meme: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire#Name][Voltaire]]posting. I dare ANYONE not to chuckle AT LEAST while reading [[http://i.imgur.com/ay4E4ep.png][this example]]!!\\
