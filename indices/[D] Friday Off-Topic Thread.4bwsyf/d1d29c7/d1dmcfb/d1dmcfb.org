/Starship Troopers/, recommended if you want to pass the ideological Turing test for military authoritarianism (or if you just want good military scifi).

(I have not watched the much more popular movie it inspired. I'm told it's a parody/criticism of that ideology, which honestly doesn't sit well with me even though I don't share it. "We'll take the good bits of your work and use them to write propaganda against your ideals.")
