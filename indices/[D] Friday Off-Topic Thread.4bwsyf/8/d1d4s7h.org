It was very gratifying that so many people from here played through my [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4augy6/c_i_finished_making_that_cyoa/][MYC/CYOA]], and I thank you for it. Some of the feedback made me rethink a few details about the book world and not just the MYC. It was also a big relief that [[/r/rational]], for all that half the characters were geared toward world domination, did not on a cursory readthrough identify (what was meant to be) the most cheatingly broken power combination. Since the books will dole out the mechanics of magic much more slowly and interspersed with misinformation than the MYC, I take that as a good sign that one of the central mysteries of the books will not be /too/ obvious.
