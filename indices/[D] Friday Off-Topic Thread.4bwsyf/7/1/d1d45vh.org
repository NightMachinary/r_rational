I found The Fountainhead very enjoyable and pretty seductive back in college. I made several facebook posts that in hindsight are slightly cringeworthy. It also made me read Atlas Shrugged, which swung me back further left than I started to being a left edge social democrat. I strongly recommend people read them in that order, since Atlas Shrugged is very easy to put down if you didn't just finish the much more reasonable sounding The Fountainhead.
