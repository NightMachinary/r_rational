Nah. Anyone sacrificed to the tower is sacrificed after the full ensemble of Black master mind readers have had their turn with them, and time magic is employed to make sure they can be killed for as long as possible during the fast ascent to 'maximum power'.

I realize that every single power can be analyzed more fully than the description provided in the MYC, but on the whole more info is provided there than for any power shown in the book world. As with HPMOR, I'm sure all the main points will be speculated upon for the book world (If I can gather the readers), but my 'bragging' is really just relief that it's not /too/ obvious. The first book is about non-magicians finding Evil Hogwartz/Moria capitol. The second is Harry Potter & Company exploring Moria & Hitler Socrates Dystopia and finding the Tower. Book three is largely written and is about the rest of the (Dark age) world realizing someone found future tech. Books 4-9 is Wheel of Timey. Book 10 will be my own, probably inferior, Silmarillion & Memory of Light meltdown + hopefully rationalist apocalypse.
