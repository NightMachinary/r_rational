Question to all you writers:

How do you /do/ it? Not the writing process, but the actual act of putting your work up on the internet for everyone to see? I guess this also applies to anyone who puts anything they made up.

I recently put up around 8k of "fanfiction" for an internet forum quest I'm part of. My hands were shaking when I hit the submit buttom. Would they like it? Would they hate it? Why? Which parts? Were the parts I liked the good or bad ones? Should I have proofread it more? What if the only comment I get on it is a request for a spellcheck?

Sometimes I wonder why I even put myself through this. Then I remember my previous fanfic, only 4k words, that got around 50 likes (which isn't bad for that forum). Honestly, that one was trash, and I wish I could delete it, but I feel like I would be disappointing everyone who liked it.

Also the fact that we get inquest bonuses for each omake we do.
