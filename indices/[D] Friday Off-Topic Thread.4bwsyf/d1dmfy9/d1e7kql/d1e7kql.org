I write when the ideas flow. You do need some thick skin, in particular just accept that most people won't comment and may not even thumb up /like the work. Most reviews are "I liked the first X chapters but this detail was stupid."

The tension is that if you feed off the good reviews the bad ones will stick in your craw.

Still, I recommend you just do it and see if you like it.

Even if I never write again, the knowledge that I cranked out a long story in a short time (even if I accept all the criticism ) is nice.
