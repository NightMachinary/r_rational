Well it started out because I was having fun writing things, and if I'm going to have fun writing things, I might as well also enjoy having the largely positive experience of internet feedback. I'm always up for a good debate, and having a dedicated readerbase to have that debate with is quite nice. Also, if I write something and keep it to myself, then that's one person who has had a positive experience. If I write something and post it then that's (by my current best estimation) a few thousand people having a positive experience, which is better.

Also I get to roll around on a big pile of likes and follows like some kind of literary dragon. As things progress though I'm starting to have expectations of myself, which is leading to a reduction in writing quantity and a reduction in growth of quality. If only they were so easy to banish.
