While I admit my judgment may be influenced by my salt at having my ship sunk, there were some things that left me feeling unsatisfied. Honestly it wasn't that troublesome, I definitely gave it a 9 because the animation, music and characterization was top notch.

They have no evidence that [[#s][BokuMachiEp12]]. He got political power to influence the court and would be out in the street in a few days.

Then there's the fact Satoru's mother [[#s][BokuMachi12]]. Rationally I would try to avoid that even if only to repay having someone take care of a comatose me for so long.

Finally, what about all those people that were to be killed in the original timeline and that weren't saved because [[#s][BokuMachi12]]? Or he never experienced Revival during those 15 years in the original timeline?

And what the heck is Revival and the thread seeing thing? Why only they have them and does anyone else possess that ability?

Well at least he seems satisfied, but I wish those things were addressed.
