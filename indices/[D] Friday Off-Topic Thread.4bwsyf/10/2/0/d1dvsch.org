Definitely. I mean the series did suffer at the end (rumors are the author got tired and didn't know how to end it) but it has some really nice soundtracks, interesting characters and a nice plot at least up to episode 10.

It was really fun while it was airing because every week you'd end up with a cliffhanger and have some time to come with hypotheses on what would happen. I have yet to try watching it all at once and see if there's a difference but overall it was really nice.

Some criticism goes towards it being a bad mystery show although the author himself said its a "human drama with mystery elements" rather than a full mystery show.
