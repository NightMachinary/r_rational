If you like XKCD What If, or SlateStarCodex, there's a good chance you'll like [[http://waitbutwhy.com/][Wait But Why]] which is sort of in-between. The articles are usually longer than What If (though there are some short ones) and often about more serious topics, but still in a friendly and accessible tone.
