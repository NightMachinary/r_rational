Actually, I just realized another good (if not necessarily canon-supported) reason he wouldn't go back-- Given that the loop is 15 years, that's a fairly large amount of time for a potential x-risk to happen, like nuclear war. Even if the risk is low, from a total utility perspective it's best if he just leaves the timeline alone, especially considering that going back in time always has some sort of cost.
