Although the range of the changes he made were relatively low, mostly impacting his community and friends. And honestly if he requires another shock to go back, I think I'd be tempted to go back and stay there while taking advantage of over 15 years of experience.

Heck he could become rich and get to enjoy his childhood as many times as he wanted. The main problem I see is that, it would be too tempting to keep doing it over and over.

Was thinking of a possible fic where he attempts it but as he gets used to seeing dangerous situations he ends up requiring stronger and bigger dangers/shocks to travel.
