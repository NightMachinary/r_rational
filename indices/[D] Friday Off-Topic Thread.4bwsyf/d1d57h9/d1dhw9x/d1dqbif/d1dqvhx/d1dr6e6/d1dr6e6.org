I expected him to reveal the other cellphone afterwards, but the fact it wasn't addressed bothered me. I mean due to how common it is in real life for politicians to get scott free I just can't picture him staying in jail for long if at all.

And the thing is that if one had the power to go back in time like that, I think the rational thing to do would be to experiment on how to trigger at will and improve control over it. Of course the story would be over too fast if he could go back everytime he wanted but I think a rational protagonist would try to experiment with it to avoid being sent to some undesirable timeline or to have a convenient escape route in case he failed. Not to mention he could profit immensely from it, just research the lottery numbers and go back or learn many abilities in a lifetime by repeatedly reliving your life and keeping the memories.

Maybe he could trigger it by exposing himself to stressful situations which wouldn't be that hard given how much trouble the killer was giving him. The trick would be to do so without being caught, perhaps under controlled variables.

I mean he could have had his cake (stopping the killer) and eat it too (live those 15 years in a more fulfilling way) which for someone that did so much to save lives, I think he deserved that bit of selfishness. He got close to the "being a superhero" sucks message in that trying to save others will [[#s][Spoilers]].
