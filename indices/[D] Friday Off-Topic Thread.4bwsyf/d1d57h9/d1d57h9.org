Pretty tiring week. Got disappointed with the ending of Boku dake ga inai machi / Erased which I had recommended on this sub. I'm thinking of what decisions the protagonist could have done to turn it into a rational fic.

Also think about what would be a good condition to stop traveling back. I'm thinking that if I had Revival I would try to trigger it consciously but end up traveling back again and again trying to get even better outcomes. I'm not sure at which point it would stop being a blessing and turn into a curse ala Groundhog Day.

On a professional note, I'm stuck on how to encode data on a spiking neural network. I understand that they're encoded by the time of spike but still I'm not sure how to decide what's the time window to evaluate or if its continuous. There isn't much about spiking neurons from what I've seen. My current goal is to model a simple AND gate using integrate and fire.

Also had fun with the Tay bot. Made one for myself and currently learning NLP to try and improve upon its responses. That and the A Third Option fic will probably take some time until I make my research on the material.

Also see a lot of good fics posted in here but find it difficult to browse them. Are they being indexed or posted in some other rational site? And any good rational fantasy fics you would recommend?
