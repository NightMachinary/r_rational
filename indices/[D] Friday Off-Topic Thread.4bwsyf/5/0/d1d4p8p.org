  Why don't any Naruto stories include (or even mention in passing) the characters actual strength training?

Probably a combination of three things:

1. The kind of people who write fanfiction aren't the kind of people who tend to be athletes, so they don't know about these types of strength training.
2. Strength training is a lot less interesting to write (and read) about than kewl jutsu and sparring.
3. Ninja Magic.
