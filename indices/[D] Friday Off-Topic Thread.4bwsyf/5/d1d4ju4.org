Why don't any Naruto stories include (or even mention in passing) the characters actual strength training?

Ever since starting working out and reading about how humans get stronger, it's been bothering me that all of the physical training described is basically just running and basic exercises. Any ninja village should generally be producing Olympian-level gymnasts. They should train like our own gymnasts, in addition to all the other ninja skills, not do push ups, pull ups, and sit ups for their whole lives.

*TL;DR: All ninjas should train like Gai and Lee to be any stronger than the general population, but no one does.*
