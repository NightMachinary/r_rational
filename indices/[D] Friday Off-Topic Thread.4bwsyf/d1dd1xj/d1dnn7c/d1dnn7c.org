Are you sure that this is true? Depending on your age, job, lifestyle, or some other factors, it might be that you've started reading more books over the last five or so years. When someone starts reading more books, certain types of previously unnoticed books turn out to be more common than you thought and only when you search for the books does the actual quantity becomes obvious.

It might also be because of books like the /Hunger Games/ and other writers are futilely trying to cash in on the popularity.
