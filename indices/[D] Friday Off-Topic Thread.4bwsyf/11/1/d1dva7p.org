For me, personally, I find the feedback (mostly in review form on FF.net or comment replies on reddit) to be sort of like cocaine. After any new post/chapter, I'll almost obsessively check said sites and my email for comments and drink in any and all feedback like a hit of the good old nose candy.

In hindsight, that seems completely unhealthy. Don't be like me. -_-

In all seriousness, it's just part of the fun. You have to enjoy writing at least a bit JUST for writing's sake, but putting your work out there and hearing what people think about it adds a whole new dimension to it all, and it helps you improve as a writer. As an example of something I learned via feedback from the public, I overuse commas. Like by a ridiculous amount. But it's something I never really noticed while writing or proof reading. But, now that I've had it pointed out to me, I take steps to avoid it.

So yea, idk. I think it's sort of nerve wracking to put yourself out there, but the rewards seem to be worth it generally. (Although, obviously, YMMV depending on a variety of factors such as your target audience, the fandom/genre you're writing in, etc.)
