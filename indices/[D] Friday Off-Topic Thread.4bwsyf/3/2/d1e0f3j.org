Spoilers for the entire movie.

The characters were dumb, the plot was dumb, and the choices for what to include and what to exclude were dumb.

Batman is "the greatest detective in the world" and he didn't do a database/google search for "White Portuguese" when he hears it? (Also, he just does a search for that text string, instead of a white person from Portugal when he gets the files.) Also, encryption doesn't work like that. He would be lucky to get 1% of the way to cracking commercial grade encryption in a year, never mind breaking it overnight. Also, also, what was with that bug thing? Was it just jam-packed with micro-SD cards, so that he copied /all/ of lexcorp's files onto it? Lastly, the random prophetic dreams were dumb, both that they existed in the movie, and that he completely believed them with no more evidence. Wait, one more: He put the spear far away from the prepared fight zone, and /luckily/ the fight ended up there just at the right dramatic moment.

Superman was dumb. After the massacre at the start, he never told anyone that he didn't do it, and that they were killed by bullets. He didn't stick around after the senate explosion to clear his name either. When Lex tried to force him to kill Batman, he decided to recruit him instead (which is good). The first thing he did upon /meeting/ Batman is shove him across the roof, and he didn't even mention any plan to recruit Batman to him until he was almost dead.

Wonder Woman shouldn't have been in the movie, she was completely pointless. STEALING A COMPUTER FILE DOES NOT DELETE IT! Why didn't /she/ use the spear, instead of the person it was specifically designed to kill?
