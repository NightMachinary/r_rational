Spoilers.

I got pretty drunk with some friends and watched it. I liked it. Even when severely drunk though, it wasn't very well thought out. In particular, there is a scene at the end when B&S realize they shouldn't be fighting, and it's the most cringey thing in years. The movie literally ends happily because their mothers have the same name.
