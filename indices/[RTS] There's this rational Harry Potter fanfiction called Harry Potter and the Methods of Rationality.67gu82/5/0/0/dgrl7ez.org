Not to mention that Harry is a flawed narrator. We see (the vast majority of) the story through his eyes, of course he always seems obviously right.

I agree that EY is much more self aware than his fictional harry. Its not a blind self-insert, though it might seem that way for those not willing to take a proper look and to just slam a popular rational story with anything that will stick
