I think EY is a bit more self aware than you give him credit for, he's stated multiple times that Harry is based on a younger vesion of himself who was more arrogant and made more mistakes. (The biggest is a spoiler but will be familiar to anyone who has read it)

I think it isn't always obvious because the bits where Harry is proven wrong aren't really highlighted and mainly take place in the background. E.g. its implied that the political system is more complicated than he thinks, but its never explicitly said out loud. It might have been good to add a scene where an adult character says to him "yes we've thought of arbitrage, but that would wreck the economy and make our existence obvious to muggles. So its forbidden under the terms of the 1400 goblin treaty"
