I suppose you could add that. I mean, the parent poster did /say words to that effect/.

(Though, often, vitriol is /random/---people, especially teenagers (I don't know if said poster is one) will sometimes just cast hate at random targets, just like they'll sometimes cast interest at random targets, in order to find and test-join the groups that agree with those statements, to further see whether they like being a member of said groups. They'll then then retroactively use their judgement of the value of the group membership to inform whether they should be smug, or ashamed, about what they said previously; and therefore, whether it was "true" or not.)

---But, that aside: the comment could be what I talked about [[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14185853][in this post]]: an attempt to start an argument for the fun of it. (Not for the /reaction/; rather, for the same reason people join debate teams.)
