  I'm not sure if you genuinely disagree with that or if you're playing devil's advocate

Neither, really; I'm just trying to offer possible motivations (from an anthropological standpoint) for observed behavior that's quite hard to see a logical motivation for.

Honestly, it probably is "bad for the community"; though I don't feel much concern for that---not so much because I don't like this community, but because this sort of thing is just, a bit, "how people are", and so communities need to deal with some amount of that. Even a zero-tolerance policy for this sort of thing doesn't help much, because it's a constant stream of /new/ people that do it, and they mostly just do it for a little while, grow up, and then regret their previous behavior.

It's like three-year-olds drawing on the walls at a daycare. Disciplining them doesn't help much; time does; but then, next year, there are new three-year-olds. It's an "eh, whaddyagunnado" thing. You sand off the walls, repaint, and move on.
