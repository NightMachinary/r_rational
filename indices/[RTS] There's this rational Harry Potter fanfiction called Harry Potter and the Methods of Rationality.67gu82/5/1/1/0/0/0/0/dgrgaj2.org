I mean, yeah, I'm pretty sure we're both getting at the same thing. I just happen to think that sort of thing is... well, not very good for the community; I'm not sure if you genuinely disagree with that or if you're playing devil's advocate. I mean, there's absolutely nothing wrong with starting a debate for the heck of it; in fact, if you really were playing devil's advocate just now, you just demonstrated a fine way to do so. I remain unconvinced, however, that there is any use whatsoever for the name-calling (other than the "uncharitable" reasons I originally cited).
