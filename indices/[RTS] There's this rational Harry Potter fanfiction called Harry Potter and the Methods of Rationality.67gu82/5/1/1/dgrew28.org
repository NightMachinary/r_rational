I mean, look, not to start an argument here, but you're kind of strawmanning here, like, a lot. I'm not going to address what you said head-on, except to note that when your characterization of your opponent reads like

#+begin_quote
  Harry talks down to everyone and they go along with it because when God-Emperor Hariezer speaks, the sheep listen.
#+end_quote

either your criticism is accurate, in which case your opponent would have to be a literal drooling moron, or you're deliberately leaving out nuances in an attempt to mischaracterize them/make them sound stupid/inflame other people. Guess which possibility is the more likely one? (Hint: it's not the one that relies on assuming your opponent is a total drooling moron.)

Like, at this point I really have to ask: why did you write this comment? If it was to convince people who like HPMoR that they're wrong to do so, then (1) that's pretty misguided, IMO, and (2) the wording and tone you used pretty much guarantee that that's not going to happen. If it was to make an anti-recommendation against HPMoR to people who haven't read it yet, then I think you picked the wrong subreddit to comment on. But to be honest, I don't think it's either of those two reasons. I think you posted a comment lambasting HPMoR because [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/gw/politics_is_the_mindkiller/][it's fun to make fun of people/things you don't like]], because you wanted to score Internet points, and (if I were being uncharitable) because you wanted to get a reaction out of people.

Is this unfair? Is this unreasonable? Maybe so. But unfair or not, everything I've written here has been an honest explication of my thoughts. I'm sorry if I sounded a bit short with you in this comment, but quite frankly, if you refer to the main character of HPMoR as "God-Emperor Hariezer", you have no grounds to complain about the tone of someone else's reply.

P.S. Note that at no point have I actually tried to defend HPMoR. I haven't done so partially because (1) I don't have the time and (2) I don't think it's particularly in need of defending, but mostly because (3) I dislike the implied contextualization, in which HPMoR fans (who I imagine constitute /a substantial majority of this subreddit/) are immediately treated as the defendants to your prosecutor, just because you wrote a comment criticizing HPMoR. I can think of no other community in which the /default response to someone coming in and blatantly strawmanning your positions/ is to treat their points as if they were somehow salient enough to be worth arguing against, and yet this appears to be exactly what happens here every single damn time somebody criticizes something we like. (Remember that SV thread about "Why rational fiction is inherently problematic" that basically blew up both there and on Reddit, people?) This is a bad thing, I don't like it, and I'm tired of it happening.
