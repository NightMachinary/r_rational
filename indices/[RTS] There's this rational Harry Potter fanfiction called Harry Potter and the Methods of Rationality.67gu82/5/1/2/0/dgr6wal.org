That's what's so funny to me! He writes at length about things like how rationality is badly represented in stories, then turns around and commits a lot of the same mistakes.

How likely is it /really/ that some poor wizard family wouldn't have figured out the Gringotts arbitrage trick? Mr. Weasley, with his muggle fascination? Fred or George? If breaking the wizarding economy completely really is /that easy/, I simply cannot believe the Weasleys would stay poor. If EY thinks they would, that means they exist in the story not to pursue their own goals, but to be part of the "stupid, backwards wizarding world" backdrop that EY so desperately wants to set up.

And this is a common thing. EY goes on many, many rants (even IN MoR) about how important and hard it is to admit you're totally and entirely wrong - and yet, Hariezer himself never has to do this. He talks about how cheap it is to have "smart" characters recite long lists of facts or numbers, and yet Hariezer's primary method of communication is long-winded rants full of jargon which often have inaccurate details, and are sometimes flat-out wrong (see the physics rant from chapter 2).

I mean, I /like/ the advice EY has blogged about. I think most of it is good if you're trying to write an intelligent story for a nerd audience. That's why I wish he'd used it in MoR.
