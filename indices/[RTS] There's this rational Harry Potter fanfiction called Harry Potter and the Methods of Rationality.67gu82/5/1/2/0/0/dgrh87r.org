  How likely is it really that some poor wizard family wouldn't have figured out the Gringotts arbitrage trick?
#+end_quote

Really unlikely. However, spoiler alert:

Harry notices late in the story that Voldemort fails to imagine /nice/ ways of accomplishing his goals. It's a cognitive blind spot.

Harry has some of those, too. One of them is that, having noticed that his situation is unusual (being a scientific wizard), he tends to believe that he is /the first/ to be in this situation; that he always gets first mover advantages. He persists in acting this way even after being given the diary of Roger Bacon, a scientific wizard who lived hundreds of years ago.

(Entry 1723 in Bacon's diary: "Tried the arbitrage thing. Goblins showed up with glowing knives. Won't be doing that again.")

The story doesn't support the idea that Harry actually /does/ always get first mover advantages. He pretty much gets /one/: partial Transfiguration. But it very much supports the idea that Harry /erroneously believes/ that he will always get them.

(Entry 413 in Bacon's diary: "DO NOT MESS WITH TIME.")

And Harry is /incurious/ about his forebears. He makes no attempt to read Bacon's diary.
