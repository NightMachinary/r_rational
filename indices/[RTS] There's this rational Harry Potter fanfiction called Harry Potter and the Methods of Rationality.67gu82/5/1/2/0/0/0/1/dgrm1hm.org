Yeah that one really bothered me. I was down with Harry being super special awesome and figuring out Partial Transmutation because of his superior understanding of quantum physics and how that would be a unique skill among wizards. I wasn't down with Harry just being such a magically good person that he had a better patronus and yada yada - that's where it jumped the shark for me.
