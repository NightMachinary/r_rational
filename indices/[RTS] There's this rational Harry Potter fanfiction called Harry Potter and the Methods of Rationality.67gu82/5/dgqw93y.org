The biggest gripe I have with that fanfiction is that Harry, every other character, and by extension Yudkowsky himself, seem to fetishize being analytically clever, to the extent that it stunts what should be normal social skills. As one person commented online a while ago, conversations between Quirrel/Malfoy/Potter tend to take the form:

#+begin_quote
  “Here is an awesome manipulation I'm using against you”

  “My, that is an effective manipulation. You are a dangerous man”

  “I know, but I also know that you are only flattering me as an attempt to manipulate me.”

  “My, what an effective use of Bayesian evidence that is!”
#+end_quote

That whole "which level are you playing at" nonsense is another example of what I'm talking about.\\
Normal people don't worry about stuff like that, trusting their fast-response social intuition instead of using their slow-response intellect to try to rationally figure out if another person is telling the truth (which isn't any more likely to be correct, and may even be worse, due to fast-response working so well with subconscious indicators).

Additionally, Harry doesn't seem to ascribe any personhood to people who aren't as smart as he is, dividing the world into PCs and NPCs, and saying things like he doesn't see any reason for Weasley to exist.
