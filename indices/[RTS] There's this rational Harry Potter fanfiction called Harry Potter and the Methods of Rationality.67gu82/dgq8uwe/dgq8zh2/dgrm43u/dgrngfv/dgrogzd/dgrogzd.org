I don't think you should feel stupid. Especially don't let the rational people on this subreddit convince you that you're unintelligent because you were ignorant.

Instead, let this be a lesson that if you plan to post to any forum that you should check the stickies at the top and the sidebar of any subreddit. Don't post to a community of people and tell them the basics of what they already know. ;)
