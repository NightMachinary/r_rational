Yeah, this isn't something to feel stupid for. Reddit just has serious trust issues, and this is pretty much the funniest possible story you could recommend to this community. It looked dubious to most people whether you were making an ironic joke, considering your comments on how perfectly this story fit the sub. But it does seem like it was legit, and it was just an innocent misunderstanding, and is exactly as funny as I hoped it was.

Seriously man, I mean you were spot on about how much it fit this place. Chewing you out for not doing enough research beforehand is silly. Glad you enjoyed that story though.
