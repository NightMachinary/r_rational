Am I the only one who doesn't feel this way? I mean, I believe I am smarter now (21) than I was as a teenager, but I wouldn't have anything against having a conversation with my past self. In fact, I think it would have been pretty interesting.

I hope this isn't an indication that I haven't improved myself. I don't think that's it. But I really don't feel like I was doing that badly a few years back. 16 years is a perfectly respectable age. In the age of Vikings, you went out to sea and battle once you were 15, and were then considered a man.
