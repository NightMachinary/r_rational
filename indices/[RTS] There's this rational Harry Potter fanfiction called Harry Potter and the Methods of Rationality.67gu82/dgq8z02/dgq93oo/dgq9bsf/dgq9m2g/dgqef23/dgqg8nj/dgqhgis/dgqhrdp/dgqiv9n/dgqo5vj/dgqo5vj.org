While both OP and I have been to [[/r/teenagers]], and [[/r/exmuslim]], it does actually suggest that we're the same person, oddly enough. This is actually pretty eery, if I do say so myself. Our ages are different, although that doesn't really prove squat because if I, indeed, was his alt, I could have lied about 'my' age.

I've been on this thread for a while since the original post made me cry tears of mirth. The OP also seemed painfully unaware, which made it all the more funny. Also, RES shows when new comments are added to a thread, so whenever there's a new one, I just check back in.

I guess the reason we write similarly is because of our browsing habits...? I mean, if we're influenced by the same things, then it could impact our writing style.

Then again, ye olde Occam's razor does dictate that your theory is right, as it carries fewer assumptions, as mine is just 'we're not the same person, it's all a coincidence'.

Huh, I really don't know how to argue about this. I'm starting to doubt myself.
