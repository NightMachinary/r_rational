I've met 16 year olds who don't play at headstrong, fronting, throwing opinions around, who understand that other people know things they don't. They won't necessarily seem like massive idiots to their future selves, even though they'll be just as ignorant as anyone else at that age, they're better at living with it.

You might have been one of those.
