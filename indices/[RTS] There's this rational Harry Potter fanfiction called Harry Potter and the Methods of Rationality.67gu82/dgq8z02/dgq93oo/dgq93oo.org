...are you serious?

In my defence, I really wasn't aware of that. I've just been lurking for about a few weeks, reading some of the material here (Unsong, Guide to practical evil, Heroes save the world).

No, but seriously, that is actually a pretty huge coincidence. Then again, there's no such thing as coincidences (Cue x-files theme)
