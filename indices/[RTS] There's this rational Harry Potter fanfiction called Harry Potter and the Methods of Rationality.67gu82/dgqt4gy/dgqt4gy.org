As you have been repeatedly informed, yes. We know of it XD.

The funny thing is that the Harry Potter fanfic community really dislikes it. Well, some of them like it, but there seems to be this resentment against HPMoR since it gets recommended so often in that subreddit, and the people there generally doesn't like it. They have some genuine and well placed criticism, some of which I agree with, and some of which I don't.

One of the criticism includes scientific mistakes or misinformation with different facts, which I tend to agree with (Although there's not just mistakes either of course). But the fic isn't really for science, it is for rationality and philosophy, and the scientific principles are still true. So I would still defend it.

I think it's a great piece of fiction, but it's not really a Harry Potter story. It's much more independent than most fanfics, and that's probably one of the reasons why [[/r/harrypotterfanfiction]] doesn't like it.
