Except the story never really calls him out as being wrong. The characters sometimes disagree with him, but they're ultimately portrayed as being in the wrong.

Harry lost his time-turner because he was abusing it. Later on he gets it back because he could have averted a tragedy if only he'd had it, and he verbally browbeats an authority figure into giving it back to him.

Harry sneaks gold into his pouch, something that was against the established limits, then it turns out that McGonagall should have let him do so all along.

McGonagall starts out as a strict authoritarian, but by the end of the story she learns her lesson and goes along with the corrections Harry gives her in front of the entire school.

Harry ignores the rules against experimenting with transfiguration to no negative repercussions except Hermione chewing him out, which he doesn't really take to heart, and he's ultimately justified in doing so because he learned partial transfiguration out of the deal.
