You're cherry picking. Harry loses his first battle because he doesn't trust his soldiers. Harry escalated the bullying because he doesn't trust Dumbledore being wiser than him. Harry ignores the evil stuff Quirrel does because he's lonely. Harry gets Dumbledore locked in the mirror because he thinks he can outsmart everyone.

The list of failures in HPMOR is something I've literally never seen anyone get right. It always reminds me that I need to get going on a reread where I document them all :P
