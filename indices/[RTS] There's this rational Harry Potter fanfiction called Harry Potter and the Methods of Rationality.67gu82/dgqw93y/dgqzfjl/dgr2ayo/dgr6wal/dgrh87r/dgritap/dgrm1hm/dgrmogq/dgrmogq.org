Not only that, but... I think Wertifloke in "The Waves Arisen" summmarizes it best while describing rinnegan:

  “Yeah, but come on, a single skill which is supposed to grant perfect chakra control, and the ability to read minds, and to resurrect the dead and to summon giant fighting centipedes? That doesn't even sound like a real technique. It sounds like a list of cool powers written down by a nine year old with no idea of, like, balance, or consistency.”

Yeah, but, come on, a single spell which is supposed to destroy otherwise indestructible wraiths, and the ability to pass secure messages, and the ability to find a person you know, and the ability to detect other patronuses, and the ability to ressurect dead while nothing else can, and can be used by an 11-year-old, and can be independently discovered by an 11-year old, and doesn't require much sacrifices?
