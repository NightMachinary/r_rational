I've always found it funny how much I like some of the fiction linked in this sub, given how much I can't stand MoR.

I think the /main/ thing wrong with it is that the author is utterly convinced that everyone else is irredeemably stupid and incapable of having ideas of their own. The way he writes the "banking" system as something a fifth grader could get rich off of, and the law system as this weird Dark Ages formal aristocracy, and so on - it reeks of having zero faith in anyone else /even to act in their own self-interest/.

(This comes out in the LW Sequences as well. There's some good stuff in there - I use the blegg/rube thingy about categories a lot - but it's not easy to wade through the condescension.)

It seems like so many of the problems in the story stem from that everyone-is-sheep mentality. He diverges from canon willy-nilly because the canon isn't rational and has no value. Harry talks down to everyone and they go along with it because when God-Emperor Hariezer speaks, the sheep listen. Everyone's decisions revolve around Harry - taken to ridiculous extremes in that chapter where he successfully(!) intimidates Snape for asking him a few questions.

Like, it's a mostly-shallow nerd fantasy along the lines of Ender's Game, and I don't begrudge people for liking it (I used to like those stories myself!), but the insistence that it's so much /more/ than a shallow nerd-fantasy is annoying.
