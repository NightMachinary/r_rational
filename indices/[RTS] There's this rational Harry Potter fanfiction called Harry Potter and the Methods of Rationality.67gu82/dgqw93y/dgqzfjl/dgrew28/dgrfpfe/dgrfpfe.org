  I think you posted a comment lambasting HPMoR because it's fun to make fun of people/things you don't like, because you wanted to score Internet points, and (if I were being uncharitable) because you wanted to get a reaction out of people.

And the charitable way to rephrase /that/ is "because you want to find, and socialize with, others who have similar dislikes to your own."

Personally, I've never found that picking friends by what they /dislike/ makes for a very good filter, but some people do it.
