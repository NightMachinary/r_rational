Slightly tangential thought, but: let's talk about the lightsaber metagame.

There's no reason why a Jedi should ever get into close personal range with an opponent. With the ability to telekinetically control light objects faraway from his body just by using the Force, a Jedi could just as easily throw his lightsaber at the enemy and then telekinetically manipulate it without the risk of getting near an opponent's lightsaber. For personal safety, they could carry a parrying dagger or shield gauntlets or something, to catch the ones that get through.

Of course, every Jedi will realize this as soon as they put a bit of actual thought into combat. The result is a first-level metagame where the Jedi are merely throwing lightsabers at each other, like telekinetically controlled javelins.

At this point, we realize some things. Firstly, that every lightsaber has a weak-point; the hilt. One strike to the hilt will completely disable a lightsaber, and once your opponent's lightsabers are all disabled, they're comparatively helpless. This leads the throwing-lightsaber metagame into more of a controlled-drones metagame, almost like what you'd see in Gundam; lots of drones flying around, being controlled by a central unit, trying to shoot down (or cut down, in this case) the opponent's controlled drones before they destroy yours.

At this point, the metagame will have been developed such that two primary factors determine victory. First, the Jedi with the longest range of effective control has a distinct strategic advantage, being able to force battles while the shorter-ranged Jedi is forced to constantly press the attack or be utterly annihilated at the far ends of his enemy's lightsaber swarm. Secondly, a Jedi that can effectively multitask has a massive tactical advantage; in a full-on lightsaber dogfight, the guy who can control ten lightsabers is probably going to mince the guy whose mind is only expansive enough to control four.

Another interesting development is the fact that there's no good reason to keep a lightsaber on, unless you're confident you'll hit something or you desperately need to block. This is because in all other cases you're basically just holding out a big stick that the opponent can knock around, and thus control your movements. Thus, the vast majority of the time, the lightsabers of the Jedi will be deactivated, only being turned on from a distance when the Jedi is going for a kill. Just as one fires a gun in controlled, targeted bursts instead of just holding down the trigger and hoping that the bullet stream hits something as you wave it around, so too will lightsabers be used in controlled, targeted strikes instead of just always being on and presenting a large profile for your opponent to knock around.

At this point, one begins to question the utility of the universal 'long rod' shape of the lightsaber's plasma emission. While the sword-like shape is undoubtedly optimized for cutting at a range, one can't help but imagine developments of the lightsaber metagame where novel shapes get involved. How about shield-shaped lightsaber emissions, designed not to cut an enemy sword but rather to block their incoming targeted strikes? What about khopesh-shaped lightsabers, shaped like crescent scythes, which arc around shields to destroy their projectors? What about mixing in blasters with lightsabers, controlling a mix of them to cover all ranges?

Thus concludes my analysis of rational lightsaber combat. One can hardly call it lightsaber combat anymore; the metagame is starting to behave more like a real-life RTS than anything else. After all, you've got different units which are strong or weak against one another based on design and the long-range control by an overseer responsible for micromanaging every single unit at once. Centralized control units, directing lots of expendable weapons platforms against each other in long-ranged dogfights, trying to gain a material advantage so they can take out the opposing control unit.

(I've been informed by friends that it'd probably be impractical to try and maintain control of multiple weapons through pure Force telekinesis like that, but I'll admit that I'm partial to the mental image of a Jedi surrounded by a swarm of lightsabers orbiting the man in a defensive cloud. Other than that, I think most of these ideas still apply.)
