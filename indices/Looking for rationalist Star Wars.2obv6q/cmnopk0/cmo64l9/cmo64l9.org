  Another interesting development is the fact that there's no good reason to keep a lightsaber on, unless you're confident you'll hit something or you desperately need to block. [...]

This is actually canon - or EU canon, at any rate, which is no long actually canon. There's a lightsaber form called [[http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Tr%C3%A0kata][Tr√†kata]] which does exactly what you say. It's understandably difficult though.

Controlling dozens of objects with telekinesis isn't feasible with Force powers, and it's implied that even with a single lightsaber you're giving up a lot of control for the distance and sweeping motions. That's why that move is almost always used against non-Jedi. That's about what you'd expect, too. I mean, if you imagine two Jedi with lightsabers, with one using his through telekinesis a few feet in front of him, and the other with a lightsaber in his hands, you wouldn't expect the one with a lightsaber in his hands to lose, would you? Also, Sith (and Dark Jedi) have force lightning, which makes drones (probably lightsabers that aren't held) seem like a bad idea. It's /cool/, in the sense that I would like to see it, but it's not really feasible from a reading Star Wars canon.
