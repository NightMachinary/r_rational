Nope, doesn't exist (so far as I know). See threads [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2mmyoo/any_good_star_wars_rational_fics_i_need_to_get/][here]] or [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2b0img/star_wars_rational_take/][here]] for more discussion, but unless someone has written one in the meantime it just doesn't exist.
