I don't have quite what you are looking for, but [[http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/10/most-citizens-of-the-star-wars-galaxy-are-probably-totally-illiterate][here]] is a piece arguing that most residents of /Star Wars/ are illiterate. You might find it thought-provoking.

I also recall seeing a fan-theory that the details of AI in Star Wars is lost technology, and that all the droids basically function by taking the same initial (perhaps a bit less than human equivalent?) mind, hooking its limited inputs and outputs up to the various motors and sensors and such, and raising and training it for the desired skills and mindset, basically save-scumming if it doesn't turn out how they'd like, then copying the resulting mind state to others of the model. This would probably go a long way to explain why the droids aren't drastically more effective. I can't seem to find this, though.
