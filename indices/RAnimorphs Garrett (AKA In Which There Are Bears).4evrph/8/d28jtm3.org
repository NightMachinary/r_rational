well i wrote a few paragraphs about how much I enjoyed binging this story up until now and how great it is but /bloody Reddit/ doesn't do the ancient obvious thing of preventing you from accidentally reloading (with a dialog), or saving your content. Fuck.

it's great. HPMOR + Egan + super-rationalization of canon that's so good it's now /true/ to me, and good characters. yay.

Daaarn reddit.

keep up that great work.
