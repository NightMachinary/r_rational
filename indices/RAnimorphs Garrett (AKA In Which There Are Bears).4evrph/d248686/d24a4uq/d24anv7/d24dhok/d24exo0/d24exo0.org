It's really REALLY vaguely described so it might be something else but marco uses a morph that can crush a human's skull with it's talons. That runs, has a long tail and feathers.

There is also during the big montage time skip thing that suggests that cassie came up with 'something' that lets people have taloned clawed hands of some kind.

But it's not described as a hork-bajir initially and I'm pretty sure that's not what marco was morphed as because that would have been a lot bigger.

So it's not certain it's dinosaurs, but Cassie appears to have some kind of none-standard animal morph creation ability.
