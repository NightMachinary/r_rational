Sure, but knowing that there are say, ancestral traits in chickens to make a T-rex is not the ONLY things available.

if Cassie + morphing power has enough info processing/capability to intuit a DINOSAUR out of a chicken and she is able to intuit hybridization / evolution backtracking by having samples from multiple extant species to reach into the past and resurrect extinct common ancestors.

And they can manage to acquire things like TARDIGRADES.

There is a really good case presented here that cassie with a little more mastery of her powers could probably explore the entire space of ancestral animal life.

Possibly even the entire space of ancestral LIFE ON EARTH.

It won't get us any species that have NO living descendants, but seriously. R!Cassie has access to a number of morphs that staggers the mind.
