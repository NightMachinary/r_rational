So earlier I got the impression that cassie figured out how to 'construct' hybrid morphs. Or do something to the DNA of base morphs.

And they used this to get 'dinosaurs' or something every similar.

Does anyone else think Cassie needs to get a hold of some databases on what the taxonomy of various animals are/what gene flipping options there are in various ancestral genes?
