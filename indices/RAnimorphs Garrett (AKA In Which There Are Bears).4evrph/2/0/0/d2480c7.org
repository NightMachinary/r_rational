Most recent to Ch 16, because I don't want to dig back further :P

- Absolute stickler for rules. Ponders on rules-that-aren't-meant-to-be-followed and doesn't understand why this is the case. Keeps following the rules (name yourself, over) even though no one else is.

- Incredibly detail fixated. Someone owes Tobias a dollar. The volume of the sphere. The temp of the explosion. Differentiates thought speak based on inflection.

- Difficulty with social norms and eye contact:

  “Let it go,” Garrett advised in a soft murmur. “Words don't ever make sense.”

  “The interference!” Garrett blurted out, cutting the alien off mid-sentence.

  It wasn't the first time that the others had expressed reservations about the strange little orphan kid. The subject had come up twice since Tobias left, exacerbated by the fact that---in the older boy's absence---Garrett had spent almost all of his time with Ax. Marco and Rachel and Cassie had seen little of his competence, and a lot of his awkward, antisocial weirdness. It took energy to deal with him, especially as the days dragged on and the little valley felt smaller and smaller---energy that was in short supply, given the stress we were already under.

  Pulling his shirt down, he fixed his gaze somewhere in the vicinity of my left nostril, his arms held rigidly by his sides.

- Possible stimming/self-soothing behavior:

#+begin_quote
  We all turned to look at him, and he visibly blanched, dropping his eyes to the dirt and pulling up the neck of his shirt to cover his mouth.

  I would deal with it later, along with Ax's alien dogma and Tobias's continued skepticism and Marco's increasing irritability and Cassie's quiet despair and Garrett's /weird tics/ (emphasis mine)
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  Garrett didn't look up, didn't speak---just sat there with his shirt pulled up around his mouth, staring resolutely at my shoes. But he nodded.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  I nodded. “Fine. Garrett, you're not acting like you can handle this.”

  “Because I won't look you in the eye.”

  “And because you've got the shirt over your mouth. And because you're curled up in a little ball. And there's that sound you make when we're not looking. This is pretty much the worst I've ever seen you, as far as---that stuff---is concerned. And Tobias isn't here to---”

  Eventually, I got my breathing back under control and was able to open my eyes. Garrett was half a dozen yards away, curled up into a ball, his shirt fully obscuring his face and ooze and slime drenching his clothes.
