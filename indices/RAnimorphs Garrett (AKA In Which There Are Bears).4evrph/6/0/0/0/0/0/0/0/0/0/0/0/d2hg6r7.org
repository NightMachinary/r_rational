ETA = deliberately wrong. It hurts every time I type it.

It's correct that you don't get the Yeerk. Tidwell just knew his Yeerk's name, because Yeerks often communicate directly/verbally with their hosts.

Morph interference => When you morph into a creature, its brain grows with artificial Yeerk tissue, largely generated from the creature's own genome to avoid autoimmune problems. That tissue responds to Z-space signals from the morpher.

If I acquire /from Cassie-in-a-morph/, then when I turn into that animal, the brain I'm controlling will also have the Cassie-flavored Yeerk tissue (because it would've been picked up in the acquiring scan). So the brain will respond to /both/ my signals /and/ Cassie's signals (if Cassie is also nearby and in morph). Mine will dominate, but hers will be enough to cause interference and spasms.

Re: natural form ... yes. There are other ways to make your natural form be smaller, too (some more unpleasant than others).

Can't teleport through Z-space, unfortunately. You stash your body in a pocket dimension, and it's not really accessible by anybody else. There are a lot of Z-spaces, in this sense---if you think of it as a dimension, there are a lot of different places to stash something "up high."
