That is still rather significant, does she have access to the symbiotic flora/fauna of a morph? Are these included in a given acquiring event? Prior to cassie's power reveal I presumed that the morphs were pretty consistently an atomic scan of the 'recognized living/vital' tissues of a body.

But being able to tweak a body template's genes, evaluate if it's viably alive and then letting it be created is still pretty potent. It suggests that she might actually be able to do aging/regression extrapolation at the least.

Which if you crossed that with say, turning off the growth hormone shut off genes means Cassie can probably 'gigantify' any animal she wants that won't die under its own weight.

Or tweak it so it grows smaller. Or is younger.

Of if they get a particular species of aphid have a morph that is born pregnant and or some kind of other weird biology.

Cassie is very very very potent and we haven't even gotten into the fun stuff, like making a morph of some one that has an injured or diseased organ that grows a secondary in a skin sack on the outside for easy removal.
