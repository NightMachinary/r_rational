considering you can recover the anatomical trait for things like teeth in a chicken and that trait has been more or less gone for 60 some million years. There is a lot that can be recovered.

However it does depend on how she goes about doing it, is she able to cross traits from morphs? or is it just 'noodling around in the same genome/epigenome/organism'?
