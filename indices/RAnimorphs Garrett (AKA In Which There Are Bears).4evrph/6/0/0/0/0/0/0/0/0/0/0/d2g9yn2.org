I'm loving Rational Animorphs! I just caught up after being a few chapters behind. Super psyched my prediction about weaponized thought-speak was true. I liked Garrett's different thought-style. Not as exotic as Aximili's but still interestingly characterized.

A subtler mistake on an earlier chapter: ETA = estimated time of arrival (like "four-o-clock" or "tomorrow"), ETE = estimated time en route (like "five minutes" or "a day"). Possibly intentional if the character who said it (Jake I think) doesn't know this. Basically everyone gets it wrong so it's believable.

Am I correct in understanding that if you morph a controller you only get the host, not the yeerk in the host? If so, how did they get the yeerk's name? Did the human just know it?

I'd appreciate it if you refresh my memory on the morph interference copy thing. I'm still a bit confused.

If the morphing time limit is based on your natural form then if somehow you could cheat yourself into having a small animal be your "natural" form then you could stay morphed much longer. I think that's impossible though, unless natural form = brain in a life-support jar / stasis field or something, which requires tech they very much do not have. If they ever do manage to morph a yeerk in a way that transfers their memories to the morphed form then that would allow a very small natural form.

I liked pushing objects and people and even morphed allies into z-space as a strategy. Can you teleport objects through Z-space by sharing morphs?
