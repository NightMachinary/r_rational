Opening another thread here to discuss the system that we've seen so far.

The game encourages specialization. For example, EPs get a double hit from a player's Prime Element. Due to the way EP recovery works, this amounts to an extra 1 EP recovered every hour, when compared to other elements.

- Some skills are also restricted to a Prime element. If a group of players want that skill, they must include someone with the right Prime.

- Helping other players with their injuries enables the First Aid I skill and awards NPs.

- Honoring a fallen ally results in 1 NP (it isn't clear if this is a one time bonus).

While the Tutorial Guide offers players the option to go at it alone, the system itself seems to heavily favor team play.

It seems that gathering food for others does not generate NPs, however, making this task suboptimal for personal growth, and therefore undesirable.

It may be that there's a different intended method for acquiring food.

Maybe Nathan should try planting some nuts, yams, or such? This seems a likely equivalent Wood-themed skill to the /Ignite I/ skill Maya acquired in Ch.12. In effect, turn surplus EPs into food.
