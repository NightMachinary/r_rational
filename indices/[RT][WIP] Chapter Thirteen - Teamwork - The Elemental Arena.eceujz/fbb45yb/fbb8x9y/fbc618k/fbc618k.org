I don't think you need spoiler speculation, or things that have happened in previous chapters. It's only when discussing events of a different work that they're necessary.

Gathering food may not be optimal, but I do not think it is as burdensome as you make it out to be. Considering that neither Nathan nor Asahi received additional bonuses from their continual uses of their skills, and the general trend in what earns skills and NP, the nanites are primarily interested in novel actions and feats.

Right now, they only have discovered a few different ways to earn accolades outside of combat, as you've mentioned. Healing another, communicating across a language barrier, starting a fire, using a polearm, and making a shelter. Once everyone who can meet their requirements acquires those skills, it will be a matter of creativity to figure out what else will grant bonuses. As long as they continue to share their skill unlocks (skill hoarding will probably be how trust breaks down in the group) then people who focus on foraging won't be at a disadvantage.

Once their healer gets enough MEN to use their skill, the most interesting question will be whether skill effects stack additively, multiplicatively, or at all. The answer to this will really determine ideal builds, both individually and team-wise. Nathan briefly mentions in Ch12 that he doesn't want to waste a First Aid on Zheng when he already is buffed with it, so we can at least assume another application of the same skill only refreshes its effects, and doesn't add another instance of it.

The most idealistic interpretation would be that different skill effects stack multiplicatively. The 3x healing rate from First Aid and the 6x from Advanced Healing would become 18x healing, so over the course of its 12 hour duration a wound would heal for the equivalent of 9 days. Power Kick's 1.5x attack power and Attack Up's 1.2x would make a 1.8x bonus.

Somewhat worse would be an additive stack, where a 12 hour duration from First Aid + Advanced Healing would heal a wound for an equivalent 4.5 days, and the attack skill combo would only be a 1.7x bonus.

In the former situation, it would be better in the long-run for players with self-targeting skills to distribute their upgrades equally, double-dipping in EP for significantly more power. In the latter, there would be less incentive to do so. And in the worst case of skill with overlapping effect categories only applying the most beneficial/earliest effect, it would further cause players to specialize into their most powerful skill, since upgrading another skill with the same effect would be pointless.
