I can't believe no one has mentioned [[http://www.casualvillain.com/Unsounded/comic/ch01/ch01_01.html][Unsounded]] yet. You see that first page? THE ENTIRE COMIC IS THAT PRETTY AND IT UPDATES *THREE TIMES A WEEK*.

The artist makes great use of the medium in other ways; some panels extend far beyond normal page size, or move in subtle ways. Characters are all great, contains many fun dialogues and just read it already.
