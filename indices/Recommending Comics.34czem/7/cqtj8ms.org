[[http://itsahardlife.smackjeeves.com/comics/1214481/chapter-1-page-1-cover/][It's a Hard Life]] is a pokemon comic series that tells a story about a Nuzlocke run (basically, if a pokemon faints then it's considered dead and you can't use it again). Not rational at all, but the story is surprisingly touching and has high stakes because the pokemon can die at any time. It also makes the unusual decision of having the pokemon be able to speak, which I think works since it means the story has a pretty varied cast even though it focuses on the joourney of a single trainer. It also has more of an impact that way when one of the pokemon dies.
