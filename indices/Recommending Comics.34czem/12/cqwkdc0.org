Goblins! Goblins! Goblins!

[[http://www.goblinscomic.org/]]

and a bit of xkcd on the side.

Also I bet a lot of people would like homestuck. It's a flash-animated comic (not a cartoon it does have chapters and pages), although it is really difficult to get into because the beginning drags on for quite a while before the plot gets rolling. I lost my patience with it for a while after the plot started to drag AGAIN when the troll's adventure arc began.
