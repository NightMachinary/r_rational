I promised this to people last week. Chatoyance has a go at the trope that's prevalent throughout the Friendship is Optimal series: a bunch of religious survivalist types who make an impenetrable bunker and resist upload forever.

Of course, Chatoyance, being an excellent author, has munchkined the hell out of the bunker to make it actually seem pretty stable, so it looks like they might have a chance this time.
