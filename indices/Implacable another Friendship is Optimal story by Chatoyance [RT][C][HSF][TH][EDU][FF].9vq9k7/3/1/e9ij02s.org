  Chat's misanthropism always grates on me

I feel the same way. I have read [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/69770/friendship-is-optimal-caelum-est-conterrens][one of her FiO fics]], and while it was well written, the everpresent misanthropy made reading it a thoroughly unpleasant experience. I do not think I will ever read fiction written by her again.
