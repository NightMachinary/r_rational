Spoiler for the ending but not exactly how it happens if you're not sure you want to read it: Of course, what we end up with is CelestAI winning: as though that wouldn't happen. But her path to victory really reminds you that this is considered by many to be a horror series for a reason.

Discussion of the ending: I don't know if I saw a FiO story where CelestAI tortures humans such that "death" (by uploading) is preferable, but it was an unavoidable consequence of the premise, so I'm glad it was there. It was suitably horrific. I also like how she manipulated that guy to upload at the end with something as simple as changing the words of the immigration phrase.

The biological modifcation of the main character was interesting, but was not the most compelling part to me. Also, the humans were idiots not to think that CelestAI might fly over their walls and come up with some way to defeat their hand cranks.
