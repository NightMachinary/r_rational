Nice job!

I'd add [[http://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/82363551272/fall-of-doc-future-contents][The Fall of Doc Future]] and [[http://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/62787551366/stories][sequels]]. I found them via someone's recommendation in this sub. Good stuff.

I like the section of resources for rationalist writers---you thought of everything I was going to suggest.
