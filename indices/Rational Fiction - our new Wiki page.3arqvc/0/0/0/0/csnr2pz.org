I just ran across [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/3m/rationalist_fiction/][EY's post on rationalist fiction]] and it occurred to me that while The Fall of Doc Future is rational fiction--the author does some math, consequences are thought out, tropes are deconstructed, reconstructed, and the world is built in a more cohesive and realistic, less comic book fashion--it isn't truly /rationalist fiction/ in the sense that all the thought processes are laid bare for the reader to learn and use.

The sidebar does a good job of making this distinction.

Maybe the Wiki should be subdivided into Rational and Rationalist sections as well? The Rationalist list would likely be short, but making the distinction might be worthwhile.

Also, I've seen a lot of good rational fiction mentioned in [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/3aca6x/hi_there_hpmor_are_there_any_other_fanfics_that/][this thread]] over on [[/r/hpmor]].
