Fargo has been recommended here recently, but it's so rare for a lengthy fic to be completed (my own included) that I thought I might make another post anyway.

The story is well-written, albeit dark at times even by Madoka Magica standards. The summary is this: [Post-Rebellion] In the frostbitten American Midwest, ragged Magical Girls vie for territory to survive the unforgiving landscape. One such girl is Sloan Redfearn, who wastes away in Fargo, North Dakota, nursing a grudge and watching her hopes slowly die. But when Kyubey approaches with a unique opportunity, she becomes embroiled in a conspiracy that threatens to topple gods.
