I don't think so, but I'm not sure since I've never seen the movie. The main character, Sloan, is called Fargo by other magical girls because her territory is the city of Fargo, North Dakota and the North American magical girls apparently refer to each other by the cities they rule. But other characters who've never heard of it before do ask whether her name's a reference to the movie.
