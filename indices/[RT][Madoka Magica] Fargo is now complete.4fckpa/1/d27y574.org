Just wanted to chime in and say that this is one of the finest examples of writing on a technical level that I've seen... characters are vividly written and complex... Author is a professional writer who wrote Fargo in his/her free time.

IMO, Arc 1 is great, Arc 2 is amazing, Arc 3 is great but a tad bit scattered.
