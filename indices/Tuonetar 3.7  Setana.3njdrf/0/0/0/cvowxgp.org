It's a sort of magical post-apocalypse type world, with good world building. Reminds me of skyrim meets fallout, sort of.

There's a town full of monsters where things are incapable of changing. A crowbar will never break, a house will remain locked forever if you can't pick the lock, since you can't just break down the door. The protagonist does science to it a bit, but doesn't expect results compared because the scientific community has been trying to figure that one out for a while.

There's a cave system populated mostly by tinkers, where it's a custom to pay someone if they solve an argument with a solution that satisfies both parties.

It's pretty good world building, generally.

Mostly, it's good at reinforcing the fact that the protagonist that /works/ to get as good as they are. It describes there though processes well, generally.
