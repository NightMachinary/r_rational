Thank you so very very much for taking the time to share your thoughts.

I'll probably start messing with the cycle eventually ... I used to joke that if I didn't, at some point Marco would be like, "Hey, guys, ever notice that interesting stuff happens to us sort of---in order? I think maybe we should keep an eye on Rachel for a while..."

I'm pretty sure there are at least a dozen inconsistencies like the one you describe that I ought to clean up on a second-pass edit, but I thought you might be interested in [[http://www.cnet.com/news/this-is-what-a-star-wars-blaster-bolt-would-look-like-in-real-life/][this article]], which is kind of relevant to the bolt-suspended-in-midair question. As far as the bolts moving /during/ the frozen moment, I think you got me---I just didn't even consider that. I hastily invent that, under your interpretation [[#s][]], the freeze-frame was from a moment right at the end of whatever span of time the overclock took up, and so they were secretly getting a sneak preview of a femtosecond in the future.

As for the higher powers, I agree with your point 100%. I'm hoping to work around this inherent narrative weakness in a few ways ... by character-izing Crayak and Ellimist so they're brought more into the realm of "normal reality" and less fully outside the plot, by revealing that various events attributed to them just ... weren't (though this is a sauce to be used sparingly), by making sure they stay superfocused on butterfly effect stuff, and don't overtly intervene too often, and by making their nature and motivations extremely relevant (in specifics) in the endgame. Hopefully you guys will kick me if they start making things lame.

Thanks again (very much).
