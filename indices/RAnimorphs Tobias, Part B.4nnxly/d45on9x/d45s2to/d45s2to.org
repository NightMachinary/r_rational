In exchange for this longer comment, please do a little dance for yourself, because you're awesome, and then write more of this excellent story.

Here is what I really, /really/ like about R!Animorphs: the extent to which it gives the sense that the plot is constantly happening in the background, unseen, but with effects that may appear at any moment. I think this is largely a product of the narrative structure of iterating over all the characters. Originally I was skeptical that this structure would be coherent enough to carry the story - but so far it is working spectacularly. As soon as you really get into the story of one character, you shift to another - but the plot just keeps moving for that character anyway. The effect of this is that as I'm reading this chapter, I'm thinking: "What's going on with all the other animorphs? Are they OK? What plans are they working on? Oh no, what's Visser Three been up to this whole time?! Will he suddenly appear and wreak havoc? Oh God, I bet Visser Three anticipated this and Paul Evans and the President are both controllers infested with Yeerk special forces trained to be really good actors, everything is going to go south - no wait, that's really implausible - OR IS IT?" The story doesn't feel like a linear progression of scenes designed to advance the plot - it feels like I'm zooming in on small portions of a huge conflict with lots of things happening simultaneously. This generates an enormous amount of suspense. R!Animorphs has showed me that one of the keys to writing good rationalist fiction (or any fiction) is to construct a huge, intricate world, and then have the discipline to show almost none of it explicitly.

That being said, at some point in the future it might be wise to sometimes break the strict pattern of iterating over characters: I'm not sure how easily a plot can be forced into this sort of structure. There might be some events too important to pass over that we would miss by going to a difference character. Don't compromise the plot to stick to the pattern rigidly. But if it works, keep it up.

Also: as characters die, the chapter titles will reveal spoilers at a glance for future readers. Something to keep in mind.

As for criticisms, I don't have many about the story content or writing at this point. I really like what you're doing, and I need to see where the story is going before I have a good sense of what worked and what didn't. I could voice minor quibbles about mistakes made by the characters, but that's all part of the story anyway; characters with no flaws are boring. Sometimes I am confused by small things that appear to be inconsistent to me, but sometimes turn out to have an explanation. For example: I am confused that in the last chapter with Cassie, when they are looking at the scene in the Yeerk pool, it says

#+begin_quote
  That was the source of the two bright laser beams I had spotted earlier, /both discharges hanging halfway between the aliens and their targets./ [Emphasis mine]
#+end_quote

Now, I'm assuming that the Ellimist (or whoever that was) simulated time being frozen by plugging the Animorphs' minds into a simulation and running it really fast relative to the real world, so that only microseconds would pass in real time while the whole Yeerk pool tour was taking place. But this doesn't make sense if, as it says in the following interlude, "there could be no discrepancies between the true pool and the projection." I presume that the light beam would travel faster than the simulation could run, and so there is no way that the Animorphs could see it hanging in mid-air and have that be a true representation of reality. That's just something that bothers me, but I'm not even sure if it's a true inconsistency, and anyways it's very minor in the grand scheme of things.

I will say something, though, about the use of higher powers, including godlike beings, prophecies, and the like. This is a general comment about rationalist fiction not wholly specific to R!Animorphs. I'm not sure what most rationalist fiction is like, since I don't read most of it, but in both HPMOR and R!Animorphs there is a tendency to use higher powers to justify plot points. In HPMOR [possible spoiler alert], the plot wouldn't have been possible without lots and lots of prophecies in the background to justify why Harry didn't fail instantly against a smarter opponent. In this story, the plot wouldn't be possible without the Ellimist and Crayak in the background arranging coincidences. I worry that rationalist fiction in general is over-reliant on higher powers as plot-forcing devices. This can potentially lead to lazy writing in which too many convenient coincidences are justified by appeals to fate or the gods. (Then again, I don't know if most rationalist fiction has this problem since I don't read it).

For this reason, I probably would have left out the Ellimist and Crayak entirely if I were writing R!Animorphs - but I'm glad you didn't. You make good use of them, and they don't kill the story by being too overbearing in their interventions. Also, it's great that in this story the bad guys can benefit just as much from coincidences as the good guys - so the suspense remains.
