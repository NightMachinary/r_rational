This is probably my favourite part of all about The Reckoning. I think it's arguable that giving them each a different flavour or approach to rationality distinguishes their chapters better than their books were distinguished in canon. Canon was largely interchangable descriptions of external things happening, and when it was focused on someone's internal world it was the kinds of things they thought about (e.g. clothes, or animals, or hunting rabbits) that set them apart, not their style of thinking (with occasional exceptions). Really, I guess this is what I enjoy about rational fiction as a whole- that it's so much more thought-process-oriented than regular fiction. And The Reckoning is taking it a step further by making the characters really, really feel like different people, some of whom are suitably /other/ or /alien./
