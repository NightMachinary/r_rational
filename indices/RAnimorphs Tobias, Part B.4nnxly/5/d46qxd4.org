So let's take a look at The Reckoning vs. canon, shall we?

Chapters 1-5 are basically books 1-4, minus Tobias getting trapped in hawk morph.

Then, Visser Three says "Fuck canon", and skips us ahead about 40 books over the course of a single conversation with Alloran. The "Andalite bandits" are discovered to be humans over the course of what, three days? This is the prime escalation that sets everything up to follow.

By Chapter 17, we've almost reached the end of canon. Like Book 52, the Yeerks have escalated their attacks, except without actually revealing themselves to the world. The Animorphs attack the Yeerk pool and kill hundreds of people. Chapter 18 is Book 54; an Animorph dies in a totally stupid heroic sacrifice, but the Yeerks are wiped out.

Except it's not over. We're now on Book 55, the book that never was. The main story has completely moved past canon. Canon has already happened, and it wasn't enough to take down Visser Three, and nobody has any idea what's going to happen next, except the author.

Dis gonna be good.
