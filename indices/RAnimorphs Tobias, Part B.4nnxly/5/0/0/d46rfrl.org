You know, I'd barely even thought of that, because I was thinking to myself:

"How in the hell is one renegade Animorph going to pose as much of a threat as David did, considering how intelligent and ruthless the Reckoning group is? Plus, knowing the Reckoning, the David story has to be at least seventeen times more lethal."

Now I'm scared. After all, I said the same thing three chapters ago when I saw the aftermath of the Pool attack. "How the hell is Visser Three going to respond to THAT?"

...Yeah.
