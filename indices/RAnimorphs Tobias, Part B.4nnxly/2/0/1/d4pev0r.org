  The story doesn't feel like a linear progression of scenes designed to advance the plot - it feels like I'm zooming in on small portions of a huge conflict with lots of things happening simultaneously. This generates an enormous amount of suspense. R!Animorphs has showed me that one of the keys to writing good rationalist fiction (or any fiction) is to construct a huge, intricate world, and then have the discipline to show almost none of it explicitly.

The occasional little montages (like towards the end of Chapter 14: Jake) really strengthen this for me as well, like there's a huge world out there we're getting little glimpses of.
