Yay emoticons! Also, holy shit, it's been a year? Wow.

And yeah, I feel kind of obsessively invested in this fic. I stopped reading Animorphs around book 30 when I was a kid, and ever since I started re-reading it I've felt unsatisfied with the universe's lack of Animorphness (like what most people would feel if JK Rowling had stopped writing after The Half-Blood Prince); there are some really good fanfics out there (The Perspective, Idyllic, Sacred Host, and Home for Dinner and Week-Ends to name a few), but yours is the only one that's still updating, so here I am.

(and before anyone asks, I am not Secretly Randall Munroe; does he know about this, by the way?)
