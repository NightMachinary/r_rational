Well here we go then.

There's two things that I think are really great in The Reckoning: adherence to canon and verisimilitude.

The Reckoning does more than integrate canon elements in its universe (the way Methods of Rationality did, which is still kind of cool), it adheres to the spirit of canon. So you don't just have mind-control slugs, you have morally ambiguous yet James-Bond-henchmen-ish mind-control slugs. The Animorphs aren't just kids who gain superpowers and try to save the world, they also have bundles of issues, self doubt, and keep facing the reality that they need to keep killing a lot of innocent people if they want a chance to live. Visser 3 is arrogant and likes to gloat, Hork-Bajiir are peaceful creatures bio-engineered for gardening, the yeerk pool is suitably horrible, Ax is fascinated by vocal communication, etc. I'm not sure exactly what I mean or how to say it, but it shows a deep understanding of the quirks in Animorphs, and it means we see more than the key elements of canon, we also see the reason behind them.

The other point I like a lot is the realism of this fic. This is a story (laws of physics, omnipotent trickster gods and the odds of a species managing interstellar travel but not AI aside) I could hear about in the news or in history books. The characters making reasonable decisions is a part of it, but more than that, I think it's the characters having reasonable reactions to what they see. Reading how Jake, Marco and Tobias react to things like the yeerk pool, the gods, or the logistics of asymmetrical warfare make the story feel much more real. One of my favourite moments in the fic is when Jake enters the pool for the first time, freaks out, and at some point says "This is bad, man, Auswitch-level bad!". It's great because it gives a context to the story, it means the characters aren't unnamed kids in a unnamed town in a vague period of time (one of canon's biggest flaws, honestly), but actual children making decisions that aren't determined by any laws but what their thoughts dictate. It really brings home the whole "we don't have any safety net and there's probably a greater than 10% chance one of us screws up at some point and everyone on the planet dies" thing.

Which is actually a third thing I like in this story: literary conventions aside, the Animorphs don't know what's going to happen. I'm not sure exactly what part of the fic conveys this, but you get the sense that the Animorphs know they might die, they might all die without achieving anything because war is unfair, the Earth might be destroyed despite their efforts because they're completely outmatched, and because from their perspective this isn't a story and real life doesn't provide any protection against powerful aliens glassing your planet.

Anyway, that's it for the general themes I really like. Specifically, I also like how grown-ups aren't stupid, how yeerk henchmen sometimes show a little personality and initiative, how the kids learn to save the world thanks to wikipedia (and other 2010s references, like the mention of Jake getting a PS4 for his birthday, god that made me feel old), how each kid is smart/clever/rational in a different way, how Cassie is not automatically Lawful-Good, actually everything about Cassie and ethics, how Tobias is portrayed, how Jake deals with absolutely everything, how Rachel is becoming increasingly badass and terrifying, how Marco is clever and ruthless (and he gets it, you know?), how Garett EVERYTHING, and how nobody respects Ax because being Ax is sadness and awkwardness.

I don't like that the Chee and Ellimist+Crayak were included (they're well written, but they kind of remove some of the verisimilitude and "we're fucked if we fail" aspect of the story), that the Chee and Ellimist+Crayak were included BUT THE ISKOORT WILL NOT BE (WHYYYYY?), and oh oh did I mention that I like that Aftran is there and the references to the Chronicles and... okay, going to stop now.
