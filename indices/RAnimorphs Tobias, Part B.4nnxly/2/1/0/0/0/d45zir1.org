I did mean the actual aliens, but Garret as well. And I think it still applies with the aliens- Ax feels actually different from Visser 3 feels different from the Chee feels different from E/C (what we've had of all of them so far anyway). Though making the aliens feel different is probably less impressive than making the kids feel different from each other.
