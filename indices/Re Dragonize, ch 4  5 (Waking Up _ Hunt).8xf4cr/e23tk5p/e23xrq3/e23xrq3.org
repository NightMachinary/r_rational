Thanks! The unexpected success of the Idol Manager Kickstarter is actually one of the main reasons for the 2 month gap between chapter 3 and 4; I ended up spending way more time than expected responding to backer messages and myriad other Kickstarter-related tasks, and since Re: Dragonize is just a fun/hobby thing, it had to take a back seat. (Not that I'm complaining; having an unexpectedly large number of customers is certainly a good problem to have. And from a long-term perspective, if my goal is to have more time to spend working on fun side projects like Re: Dragonize in the future, the success of Idol Manager is definitely brings me closer to that goal.) It probably wouldn't be hyperbole to say that the Idol Manager Kickstarter (and the month that followed) was the most consistently busy two-month period I've ever had in my life, but fortunately that anomalous period is over and I should be able to update more regularly.
