Not a typo, but i felt wording was kinda out of place. Maybe i'm just crazy or this was intended.

This feels like something Fenn would say, Juniper would say or just something a human would say. If we didn't have the system rebooting and adapting to Junipers increased intelligence, i would treat that sentence as a Human=DM speaking directly to me and writing that description on the fly. Maybe i just forgot, but older descriptions of any game mechanic felt like a system describing something or\and had fantasy adventure feeling to them. This reads like a conversation between DM and a player with former saying" Are you sure you want to catch a catapult shot with you bare hands? Suit yourself".

Maybe i'm just rambling and seeing what is not or was intended as the 4th wall break between DM and Juniepr in the first place.
