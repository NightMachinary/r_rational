Remote confrontation wouldn't be consistent with my read on Fallatehr character. He is not cautious chess player, he is gambler. If he would prefer slow accumulation of advantages he would stay in prison. Fallatehr went for direct confrontation because it was fun and allow for instant gratification by taking over Juniper in one hit. Also he didnt internalize how freaking strong Juniper is. Fallather was hundreds years old elf with immense luck and experince, and Juniper was Out of Context problem for him.
