I actually understood most of that from the text; my disagreement persists despite it.

  Fallatehr's perception/read is that he has literally all of Juniper's teammates captured and at the knife, and that the result will be submission and/or breaking to the strength of coercion

Fundamentally the issue is that, if this is your expectation, immediate direct confrontation doesn't give you anything that bargaining at a distance doesn't. Fallatehr could have stolen away every companion and traded them piecemeal; not doing so implies that Juniper would be /more/ willing to submit in a short-term confrontation than over a long-term bargain from a weaker position. I don't see Amaryllis making that judgement.

This holds double given Fallatehr gained rather significant assets with, eg., the teleportation key.
