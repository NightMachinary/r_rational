I think you're overthinking this a little. Fallatehr wasn't a black ops operative or a veteran crime lord, he was a researcher-turned-prisoner. His skillset would have been better for manipulation and bond-villain style "Let us have a polite conversation about why I'm going to mind-rape you" plots, than for arranging perfect murderhobo-proof ambushes.

That's an aesthetic I really like in this story and others, actually. If you live by the sword, there's no rule that says that you'll be clever enough to anticipate all the ways to die by the sword before someone gets clever and stabs you.
