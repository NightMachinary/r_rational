It was more comprehensive in the original draft, with the various scenarios being planned for and argued about, but it felt like a lot of faff, especially because those scenarios would be revealed in 73, where there's zero tension, and I've never really found post-facto explanations to read that well.

Like, "Fallatehr was standing beneath the light specifically because that was a place that Grak had warded to protect him, in case of ambush" is all well and good, but if it's explained after the fact, and pointless to the narrative, rather than as a "turn" in the beats of the scene, what's the point? (The point is to show some cleverness, or make sure there's not a 'plot hole', but I kind of go back and forth on how much that's worth it -- I'm obviously not shy about including things because I think they're neat, even if they're not plot relevant.)

Fallatehr's perception/read is that he has literally all of Juniper's teammates captured and at the knife, and that the result will be submission and/or breaking to the strength of coercion ... but his last effort is to invoke the name of Amaryllis, and Juniper just stabs him anyway, despite this (from ch 73):

  She had been the one to explain that she meant something to Juniper, that he might be compelled to act foolishly in order to save her.

But I've always believed that you can't defend a work on the basis of something that's not actually in the text, and this is stepping somewhat beyond my normal author/reader line, so I will go slinking off into the shadows once more.
