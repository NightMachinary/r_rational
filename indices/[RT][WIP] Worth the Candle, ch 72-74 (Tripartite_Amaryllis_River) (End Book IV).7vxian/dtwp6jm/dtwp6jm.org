I worry soulfuckery will become a trap where editing and discussing the as of yet unrevealed excel sheets full of data is going to take up time from everything else that's going on (I was worried 40 skills + unknown amount of virtues was going to either lead to too much fiddling with the character sheet or basically ignoring a host of options and to be fair Joon has yet to make proper study of what blood magic was said to be able to do).
