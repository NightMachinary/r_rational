Word-choice comment--

"After five minutes had passed, I checked my skills, and saw that Bows was still down a point, and One-handed Weapons had reverted to 21, which confirmed that the times multiplied"

Each frequency is (1point)/(10min); multiplying would give 1/100, whereas adding(/'compounding'?) gives (2points)/(10min), which an interface could present either as (1point)/(5min) (this case) or 2 points lost together after 10 minutes past (not this case). (Edit: Just the times multiplying would still be 100 minutes(^{2).)}

Edit: Oh! Oh! I remember the term now! 'which confirmed that the rates stacked' ! (As how a stacking AC +1 and a stacking AC +2 give a total AC +3, but if they're non-stacking only give AC +2. Or was it -2?)
