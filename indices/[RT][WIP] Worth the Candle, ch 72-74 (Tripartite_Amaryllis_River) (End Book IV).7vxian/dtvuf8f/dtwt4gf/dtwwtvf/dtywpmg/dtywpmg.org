We're suggesting Patreon because we have a sneaky ulterior motive - we want you to keep writing! If Patreon will help sustain (or increase) your output, that's great. If subscribers would feel like a burden, none of your readers want that.

Worth the Candle has hundreds, or maybe thousands, of fans. Right now you're doing us a favor, writing a wonderful story without asking for anything in return. Your readers want to support your writing. Whatever keeps you motivated - Patreon, votes, commentary and praise, tweets - just let us know!
