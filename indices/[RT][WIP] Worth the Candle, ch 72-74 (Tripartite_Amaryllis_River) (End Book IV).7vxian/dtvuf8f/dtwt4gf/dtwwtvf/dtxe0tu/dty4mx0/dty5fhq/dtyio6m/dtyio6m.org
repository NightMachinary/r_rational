It was probably the few late chapters which I think happened at the beginningish od the Patreon. IIRC a bunch of people over on [[/r/noveltranslations]] were freaking out (myself included) hoping something bad irl hadn't happened to the author and then the next chapter got released. And again.

Makes sense though. Usually when a Patreon starts up there's a learning curve on how to use it efficiently/figuring out rewards etc, etc, and it slows down the Patreon owner having to figure it out.
