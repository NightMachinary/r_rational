I don't have a Patreon, and have been thinking about that for a while now. I /like/ not being accountable to anyone, or having a set schedule ... but there's a value to be placed on those things, and I kind of feel like I've been past the point where I rationally /should/ have set up at least a tip jar, if not a Patreon.

Beyond the implied author/reader contract that gets heightened when money is involved, a fair amount of the stuff in this story is personal, and while I've made some effort at disguising it for the eventual day that anonymity was broken, I'm not sure that I can ethically accept payment without at least some weakening of anonymity.

I'll figure something out, and probably have a decision at the start of Book V in a few days. The smart way of thinking about it is that by not accepting money, I'm basically paying money to be independent/anonymous ... and while I might be able to justify that at $20 a month, I don't think that I could reasonably go higher.
