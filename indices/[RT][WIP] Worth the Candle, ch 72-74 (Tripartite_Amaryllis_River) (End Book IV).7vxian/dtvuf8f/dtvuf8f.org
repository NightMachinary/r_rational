My apologies for how long this took, but in my defense it's 20,000 words across three chapters. I don't plan on doing that again in the future, mostly because the rereading and editing takes so long that I basically skip a day of actual writing (and this is still like 1/4th the length of a novel, so will probably have loads of errors).
