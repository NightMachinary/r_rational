I wonder how?

There are some constraints. He could teleport anywhere - so no location constraint. But he has his immediate circumstances to think about: no "fixing the world" when he has to escape very soon. He wouldn't have access to random world leaders, but he might be able to get to Bendon since it seems like the two leaders of the city don't rely on guards.

Things that might be of immediate use E.g. scheduling cavalry to come later, or gaining some special resource (that he didn't immediately use).

I would have be some way of immediate (at least value). Perhaps
