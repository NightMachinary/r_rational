I don't think +Disney is going to go make /Fallatehr: A Candle Story/ to answer our unasked questions+ there was a whole lot more going on with him as a character, but I thought he made for engaging /scenes/. Seeing how the party struggled against his threat was the point even when he wasn't nearby, and I thought it did that well.

He was a cunning negotiator with Amaryllis, odious to Fenn, and a teacher to Juniper.
