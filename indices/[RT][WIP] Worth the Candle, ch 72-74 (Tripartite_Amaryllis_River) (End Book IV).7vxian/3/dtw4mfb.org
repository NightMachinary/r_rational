That wait was the worth it! (It being the candle, I suppose).

Wow, chapter 73 threw me for a loop at first. I was thinking to myself "Wait, have we ever had a chapter without Juniper as the narrator?" and was just about at the point of being worried enough to start flipping through old chapters when I reached (((the explanation.))) It actually made me laugh with relief!

It was a good end to the book and arc, but I'm left wondering if we're done with Parsmont. It feels like the team doesn't have any reason to stay, but the introduction of the Abswifth makes me think that the Bendon has to make an appearance somehow.

So, we've now solved an issue pressuring Juniper since chapter 27 (or really, chapter 25). Whew! Feels like forever ago! What will the next plot be?

- Figure out a way to save the Six-Eyed Deer?

- Find out more about Nellan?

- Leveling montage?

- Find a more permanent base of operations?
