  Find out more about Nellan?
#+end_quote

I'd guess Nellan to be Fenn's child. I think most readers probably expect this, as it'd then be natural for her to value Nellan more than Juniper. But she showed distaste at having children since they'd be hybrids that'd be treated horribly by both elves and many humans. So if not her child who else could Nellan be? A childhood friend that she feels more loyalty towards than even Juniper?
