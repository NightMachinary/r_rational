  ears

You've got me thinking about the scars again. Ears, scars, whatever.

From chapter 25

#+begin_quote
  “The worst part was that it worked, for the space of about a week,”
#+end_quote

and

#+begin_quote
  the perfection of technique needed to do the scarring right
#+end_quote

It seems plausible that the soft cap at 20 would stop Juniper from repeating the technique himself, even if he could undo it with soul magic (also not obvious).

But maybe not. I could sort of see it going either way. Since the soul magic is still a secret I can't imagine anyone else routinely redoing the scars.
