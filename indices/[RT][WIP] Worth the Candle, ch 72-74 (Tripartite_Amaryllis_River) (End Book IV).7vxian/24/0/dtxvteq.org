Recall that only Joon gets an actual character sheet with neatly arrayed lists of values and numerics for them, and then only for his own/Companion's souls. (He had to keep looking at his own soul as a map to do anything at all with the rib donor's).

Your complaint seems to be more with the idea that soul mages can't avoid decay than that unstable edits should decay - but not only does Fallatehr say that he has made his prisonmates stable, we're also told exactly why Fallatehr would make the fewest changes possible to Grak: Amaryllis was analyzing Grak heavily and convinced that if Grak had changed she should be able to tell. By NOT changing Grak except for loyalty, that Grak was changed can be almost undetectable.
