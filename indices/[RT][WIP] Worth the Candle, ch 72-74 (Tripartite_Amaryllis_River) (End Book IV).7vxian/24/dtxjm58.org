There's something about the slow reversion/decay of Soul editing that doesn't make sense to me... I though the whole point of soul editing was to change the baseline "normal" state of the soul - which would imply that the edit now becomes the new normal.

I can rationalize it partly if some changes are in conflict with some other changes, i.e. Amarylis' value on self preservation conflicting heavily with her Fallatehr boner - but that just seems like a poor editing job that created an unstable set of values. A skilled soul mage should be able to edit multiple values into a new equilibrium that doesn't decay - say by lowering the values which conflict with the intended edits. A ham-fisted way to do it could be by creating a meta value of "values the person/state I was in before meeting Fallatehr" and set that in the heavy negatives; whereas a more subtle way to do it would be to look at existing values in the soul that conflict and lowering all of them to a certain degree until a stable equilibrium of new values emerge.

Another way to do it would be to just wholesale copy over the soul mages' existing value system - delete or set to zero every single value in the poor fucker and copy over everything since you know that is a stable equilibrium.
