We're not told much about the mechanism of the soul or soul editing except that it's simultaneously malleable and resilient. The best (imperfect) analogy I could find was [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shape-memory_alloy][shape-memory alloy]]. It doesn't make a new "normal" inasmuch as it distorts the shape, and the soul appears to have its own memory of its blueprint. Or like the immune system, any abrupt changes would be marked as abnormal and attacked.
