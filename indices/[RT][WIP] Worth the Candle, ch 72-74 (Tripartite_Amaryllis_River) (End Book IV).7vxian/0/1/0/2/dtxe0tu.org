The introduction of Patreon has slowed down every single serial I've seen except Wildbow's (Mother of Learning being the most glaring example). I think introducing /structured/ payment tends to ruin the mindset of quite a few serial writers, since then it feels like a job, as you said.

I think a tip jar is the best solution, but of course it's up to you. You can set up a company Paypal if you want to hide your identity, and I don't understand your ethical argument. You are delivering a great service anonymously so why shouldn't you get some voluntary reward in the same way? Even if you go the Patreon route, a ton of game developers there stay anonymous all throughout, in my experience.
