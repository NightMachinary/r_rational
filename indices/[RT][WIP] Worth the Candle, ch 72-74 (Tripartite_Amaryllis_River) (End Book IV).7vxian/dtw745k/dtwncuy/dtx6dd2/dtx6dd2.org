  A quest that I hadn't actually seen pop up, now marked as completed, which was something to ponder for another time.

If we imagine quests are assigned at appropriate times, this one started with the breakout, so it /probably/ wasn't missed while Juniper was in his own soul. Maybe the game just didn't want to force his decision by showing him the quest? That seems crucial.

I'm in the camp of readers who might be saps and still sort of hoped a mutual resolution was possible, but even if they could trust him, I think you're exactly right. They could never trust him to /be good/.

Probably just as well for all involved that he didn't try to enter the spire.
