I don't think a healthy working relationship was possible when Fallatehr was putting suicide switches in team mates to ensure he got his way.

If getting access to Joon was worth more to him than arbitrary numbers of lives - including his allies! - then it would never be safe to trust him. And learning soul magic without trust is, as has just been shown, very dangerous and failure-prone.
