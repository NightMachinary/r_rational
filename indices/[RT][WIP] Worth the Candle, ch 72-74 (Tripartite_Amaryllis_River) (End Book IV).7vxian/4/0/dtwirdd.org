They could have worked with him and come away richer for it, I agree. From how Fallatehr was talking to Mary it seemed like he truly did intend to learn about Jun in exchange for teaching him, after which they'd both go their separate ways.

However, a big problem (aside from Jun's entirely reasonable inability to establish trust/expose his neck) was that there was a fundamental, insurmountable wall between Jun and Fallatehr in terms of their values. Jun is a morally normal/above average individual. Fallatehr was, or at least came across to me as, a very charming/intelligent but still Mengele-esque sociopath.

Jun working with the guy in good faith would have required him to abandon certain of his core values, a big one being what he sees as his personal responsibility to not unleash evil/suffering on the world. This inclination was incompatible with letting Fallatehr continue to practice his soul magic.

IMO there was never really any other way this would have ended once Jun learned of how terrible a person Fallatehr was. Killing the guy was the the right course of action, barring a way to quarantine him or disable his soul magic. Not letting the guy gather more knowledge was also the right thing to do, because he couldn't ever have been trusted not to use it to attack Jun.

PS - Just goes to show how well the author wrote this villain, because I was also kind of rooting for him (in a visceral/knee jerk kind of way) all the way up until the end.
