I can't remember the last time I've felt such a raw sense of /fucking betrayal/, as Not-Mary turned in c72. Terrifying, breathless panic. There's really something visceral about watching loyalty being (apparently) forsaken, just like that. God. Thank fuck you revealed the ploy within the same release or... man, if it had somehow been an unresolved cliffhanger, I don't think I'd even be able to function.

And then (((this shit))) happened. I was still so shaken from the last chapter that I was sure this meant it was a post-mortem reconstruction of events.
