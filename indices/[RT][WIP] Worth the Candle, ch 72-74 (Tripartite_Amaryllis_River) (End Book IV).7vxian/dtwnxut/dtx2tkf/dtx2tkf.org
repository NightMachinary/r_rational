I think it was crucial that Fallatehr was acting on bad information: He thought that Juniper had no access to soul-magic, and so wouldn't have the additional clue that Amaryllis' soul was untampered with.

Juniper acted as he did because he realized that the impostor wasn't Amaryllis, and having been able to examine her soul shortly before had to have played a big role in that. Fallatehr may not have been particularly exposed before he approached Jun, in which case the deciding factor was Jun's fortuitous misleading of fake!Mary about regaining Essentialism.

If we accept that Fallatehr would have won had Jun not mislead fake!Mary, then his mistakes, though a bit of a gamble, don't seem so outrageous when he held the cards that he did.

Also keep in mind that Fallatehr was *fucked* from the moment he altered Amaryllis. He had no way of knowing that Jun had a perfect counter to soul magic used against Amaryllis and may not have been convinced by any lukewarm words Grak shared about Narrative, but once that bridge was crossed he needed to either kill Jun or become Jun's ally. Both of those options are only available in person.

Honestly, what Fallatehr /should/ have done is altered his values to be the perfect companion to Jun in hopes of making himself trustworthy and indispensable and maybe into a Companion, but it is hard to believe his pride would have allowed for that.
