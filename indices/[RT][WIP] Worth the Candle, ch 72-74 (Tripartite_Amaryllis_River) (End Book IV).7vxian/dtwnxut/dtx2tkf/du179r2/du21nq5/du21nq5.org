You are misunderstanding. Once Fallatehr has Amaryllis, he has a very different take on the Narrative than he got from Grak, and due to the soul link his options become closed off. The Narrative makes it clear that he cannot survive long term as Joon's enemy, and that he will almost certainly end up dead. His best hopes then are for an amicable resolution, which is exactly what he seeks in person. His last resort is to hope the Narrative does not give Joon guaranteed wins and that he can kill him, which is the path he is forced to take when negotiations fail. Unless Amaryllis is wrong (and he can see just how formidable she is) there is no middle ground. Even if Fallatehr's credence were only at 50%, that's not a risk you take with immortal life, not when he knows he has Joon beat and that they /can/ work together. Given how Joon laments that Fallatehr really seemed earnest, I think we can assume that Fallatehr's credence in Narrative, whatever it was, was sufficient.
