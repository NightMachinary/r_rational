  Also keep in mind that Fallatehr was fucked from the moment he altered Amaryllis. He had no way of knowing that Jun had a perfect counter to soul magic used against Amaryllis and may not have been convinced by any lukewarm words Grak shared about Narrative, but once that bridge was crossed he needed to either kill Jun or become Jun's ally. Both of those options are only available in person.

I don't see how Jun's soul communication stuff does all that much to help him if Fallatehr goes with long-distance bargaining; if anything it strengthens Fallatehr's hold by allowing him to prove that he is, eg., torturing his captors.
