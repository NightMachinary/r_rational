I don't think you have to be particularly smart to realise that walking up to the nigh-omnipotent stabby guy is a bad idea, especially given Amaryllis would tell you as much. I also don't think bargaining at a distance would be comparatively hard for Fallatehr, or so far afield of his personality that he shouldn't have just sucked up and done it.
