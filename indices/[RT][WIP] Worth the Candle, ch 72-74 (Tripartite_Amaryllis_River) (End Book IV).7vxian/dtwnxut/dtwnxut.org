I really enjoyed this book, and this wrap-up was excellent, though I have this nagging feeling that Fallatehr's plan was weak and if he should by all means have won if he played it straight.

If Fallatehr expected to be seen through quickly, and it seems to me that he should have, and he was actually OK with indirect forms of learning, why wouldn't he have apparated to another continent with his hostages and negotiated indirectly?

He took a huge amount of risk in order to soulfight Juniper, but then did very little to prevent the obvious countermeasure of stabbing. If you're going to sacrifice your strongest assets, eg. Amaryllis' loyalty, to engineer a face-to-face confrontation, you should have good reasons to believe that controntation is more favourable than you could have organised without the element of surprise.
