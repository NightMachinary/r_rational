The usual soft cap of 20 applies to "amateur training", which is theorized (and so far consistent with) this reading in ch 37:

#+begin_quote
  Being capped at 20 because of how I was training was shockingly bad for me. It meant that I couldn't just train up my Dodge skill against Fenn and hope that our Twinned Souls would allow her offensive power to keep pace so that she was a challenge. The word ‘amateur' implied that a professional could still help me train, while the word ‘training' implied that I could still get skills from actual combat, or maybe from other methods. I tried not to dwell on that too much, but it was bad news at a time when my morale was low.

Meaning that if you're actually /doing something/ with the skill, rather than just trying to grind it out through repetition, you can pass 20, as well as if you make the effort to seek out a good teacher who can give you better, more intensive training (though we haven't seen the teacher hypothesis tested yet).

(There are a number of tabletop games that have some mechanism like this in place, though from what I've seen it's usually just GM discretion on whether to award a player for trivial actions, because any rigid definition will immediately be gamed by the player in a way that's usually detrimental to play.)
