Makes perfect sense to me. There has to be a way to raise skills above 20 without teachers, or how did the teachers get their skill that high?

(Other solution: the world was generated with a set number of teachers of high skill, and every single person in the today's world can trace their post-20 skill levels through a lineage back to them.)
