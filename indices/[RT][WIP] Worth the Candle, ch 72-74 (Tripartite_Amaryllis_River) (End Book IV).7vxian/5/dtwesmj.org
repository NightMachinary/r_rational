The whole scenario of how Amaryllis was switched, why, and how Joon realized that the person he saw wasn't Amaryllis was really clever. When he noticed that Amaryllis wasn't using the immobility plate, I thought that she was simply waiting for Falltehr to turn his back before betraying him, but I like how it actually happened more.

I hope that Joon practices with modifying bodies on animals, because if he can get good at it he can fix any injury, or improve his body in any number of ways. At the very least he should be able to sharpen his senses, make himself more resistant to damage, and change his appearance at will. Depending on if Fenn wants to, he could shorten her ears so that she appears human, since I remember that she faces discrimination for being a half elf.
