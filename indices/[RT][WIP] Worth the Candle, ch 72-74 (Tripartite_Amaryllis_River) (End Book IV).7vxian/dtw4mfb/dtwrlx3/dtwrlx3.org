  the introduction of the Abswifth makes me think that the Bendon has to make an appearance somehow.

Or... maybe it just hangs over the story forever, this vague sense that the Narrative will make the Bendon show up eventually, and the longer it takes the bigger the event will be, but it just. doesn't. happen. and you constantly have to wonder if maybe that's next chapter...
