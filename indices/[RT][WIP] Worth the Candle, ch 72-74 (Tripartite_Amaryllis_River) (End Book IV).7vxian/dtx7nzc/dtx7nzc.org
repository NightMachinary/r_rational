Thank the Dungeon Master that this arc filled with unease and paranoia is over. Falletehr was a really scary villain and was also in the camp of "fuck I don't even know if he is one". Then the whole party had that mutual distrust that they all agreed on but really strained their sense of companionship and that stuff makes me blegh. Amaryllis shined in her chapter.
