I am glad that this arc is over. In a lot of fiction I enjoy the whole mind control element and how it impacts politics/interpersonal relationships, but Fallatehr just wasn't very engaging. I tend to like it in more emotional/character driven stories so maybe that's the issue. That isn't to say that I didn't like all the other parts of this arc. The action sequences and worldbuilding aspects were really fun.

I look forward to seeing what long term consequences this arc has. I kinda hope Fallatehr planted some 'bombs' in the Grak's and Amaryllis's souls, I can't imagine that a soul mage with centuries to hone his skills and who was one of the best soul mages in an empire with the best soul magic would limit themselves to only increasing his own value in their value systems (regarding the quality of the second empire's magic: ok, I'm not sure if this is literally true, it's just the impression I got and nobody in the story is in a really good position to check and see if the second empire had the best soul magic out there.). Regardless, I think that the soul magic will definitely have long term effects on Grak and, to a limited extent, Amaryllis. I also expect that Fallatehr managed to fuck up world politics in some (probably minor) way. Additionally, He probably had time to enthrall random people.

Moving on to a more exciting topic, Valencia. In many respects she's like a child. She's probably never before had the opportunity to make decisions and is learning how. I can't imagine that fight to the death going on right in front of her eyes helped her develop in a purely positive manner. It seems that she is in the process of developing her moral code/center. None of the other characters seem aware of this? I think mistakes will be made and I hope that they don't have disastrous consequences.

We haven't seen much about the locus/six-eyed doe yet. To be fair they haven't been part of the story for very long and haven't had much opportunity to act besides. I do worry that we are reaching the point where adding more companions just means that other companions won't be developed or their development will halt, which would be a shame. For this reason I hope that Valencia is the last member of their kharass (barring somebody like Arthur). Of course I could be underestimating cthulhuraejepson's skill, in which case I'm worrying about nothing.
