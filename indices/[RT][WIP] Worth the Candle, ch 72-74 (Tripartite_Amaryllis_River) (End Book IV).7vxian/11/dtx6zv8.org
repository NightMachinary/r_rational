The Amaryllis chapter was quite a treat. I wasn't bothered by matched punctuation of any depth in this chapter. Watson justifies the point of view, but Doyle still gets to write from a different perspective. Good fun.

Especially with lines like this. "I could save her" doesn't have the same kind of impact.

  Dungeon Master, if I must be on your railroad, let me ride the train with good humor. If I must roll the dice, let it be known that I would not object to you fudging. Place a dungeon before me, and I will delve it. Place a dragon before me, and I will slay it. I am, above all else, your player.

I like to think this wasn't license at all and she recited this to Juniper perfectly in the debrief.

  “Not sure I was supposed to rescue myself,” she said.

It is, of course, also satisfying to have her escape, but we then get the extra jab: she wonders if she was /supposed to/. I suppose that is an upper bound to how much effect this narrative talk has: not enough that she doesn't take care of herself.

A lot of serious topics in this set, but it's a resource and in turn is managed well. I can think of stories that got too serious and never let up; I wouldn't want to read sections of those again. I do not have this problem with /Worth the Candle/.

In that whole discussion I never gave myself license to think that /the odds the author reads it/ are very high. On the other hand, maybe this was already planned and all we're doing is perceiving a feature of the text. (If a mathematical proof manages to convince, to the point that the reader is anticipating the next steps of the proof during the initial read, the credit still belongs with the author, not the reader.)
