'Amaryllis' is the longest chapter to date (I think) and surprisingly it's the first time Joon-as-the-narrator breaking the fourth wall stuck out to me (triple parentheticals: "I hope you don't mind" "Okay, back to the story"). The narrator is /aware/ that he's giving the reader a narrative and in this case, an anecdotal history. But it's really the "I hope you don't mind" line that threw me off. It makes it seem like he's invested in creating a good narrative and I can't help but feel that it's a clue into the nature of the story (is the real Joon creating a fictional story within a fictional story based on a true story that involved playing out fictional stories?). Also addressed to [[/u/eaglejarl]] since I saw his comment during a re-read: it broke immersion for me as well and these were my thoughts as to /why/.

  In that whole discussion I never gave myself license to think that the odds the author reads it are very high.

I'm certain the author reads the comments and they've left traces of influence in the story in the past. Though I'm not sold that Fenn's reforming is a response to that comment. Channeling the razor, it's easier to say Fenn grew attracted to Joon-the-sap and he's been a moralizing influence ever since. The tower would have accelerated her awareness of that.
