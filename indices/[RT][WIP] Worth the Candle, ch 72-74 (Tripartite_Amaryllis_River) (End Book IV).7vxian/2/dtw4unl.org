Got to say- those chapters made me deeply uncomfortable with soul magic. More than I was already, anyway.\\
It's scary especially because it's becoming more and more likely to be /a common thing/ in the /near/ future, as technology (e.g. new drugs, magnets disabling parts of brain, greater and greater insight into human mind) and... infrastructure (everything collected on us /got/ to give an edge to a future manipulative AI or some/one/) now can already achieve a large degree of that.

  “I'm trying to find the seam of common cause,” said Amaryllis, which fell just short of being a bald-faced lie. She remembered what it had been like to think that Fallatehr was all-encompassing, and that gave her a handle on how to frame her arguments here. True manipulation might come later.

  “Fallatehr spoke of it in terms of stability,” said Amaryllis. “There's nothing grounding what Grak feels about Fallatehr, so it should evaporate more quickly, if I understand it right.”

Honestly wondering to what degree does a soul modification change a person permanently- sure, unsupported changes revert, but it's a two-way pull, and new memories aren't erasable, and those often have the emotional component.

  “No,” replied Grak without elaboration. I let him sit and massage where the ropes had been digging into him. “I was ... I had purpose.”

  “Serving Fallatehr,” I said.

  “It wasn't service,” said Grak. “It was wanting something more than myself."

Some insight into Grak's mind, which frankly makes me sad- being mind-raped making an /improvement/ in some way suggest a really bad state of mind, which I can relate to.

  “Okay,” said Valencia. Her voice was soft. She reached down and touched her dress where it had been ripped. “Are we going to be like sisters?”

It certainly doesn't help that Valencia is... her own kind of monstrous, mysterious and overpowered, and released upon world at large.\\
In fact, all of them are ridiculously overpowered, one way or another. One safety blanket are limitations of author's capability and willingness to torture our hero (or anyone, for that matter).

Let's also not forget the fact that pretty much everyone in World of Jun shares certain character traits (relatively high emotional stability, easy grasp of rationality and self-control, the clear and almost clinical manner of speech (though it's conversational still- not really a criticism, just can't find more accurate expression)), which makes the setting even more dangerous.

Enjoying it overall, though. It's high-level play all the way through, laid with munchkinry, careful deliberation and healthy paranoia. Also good characters, in case I made a different impression.

Rambling, but yeah, some thoughts.
