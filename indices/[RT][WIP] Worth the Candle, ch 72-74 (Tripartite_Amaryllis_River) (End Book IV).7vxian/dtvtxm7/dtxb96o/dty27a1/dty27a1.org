  “You're saying we kill him,” said Fenn. “Figure out a way to lure him somewhere, then slice his stupid head off.”

  */Quest Accepted: Slice His Stupid Head Off - You still have to worry about the Foreign Security Director of Anglecynn, Larkspur Prentiss. He'll have you running like rats, afraid of the light, so long as he lives. Figure out a way to lure him somewhere, then do as the quest title says./*

  I stared at that message, then blinked it away.

  “Something happen?” asked Fenn.

  “No,” I said. /Just the quest text quoting the two of you. Are these being written on the fly or are the talking points being inserted into the conversation by the Dungeon Master? Really hoping that it's the former./ “I got a quest to kill him.”
