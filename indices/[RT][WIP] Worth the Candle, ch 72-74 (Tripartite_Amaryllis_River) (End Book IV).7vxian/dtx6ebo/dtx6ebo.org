The Amaryllis chapter was an interesting deviation.

Once it was explained what was going on there was a fun little game of trying to work out what parts of the chapter were pieces that Amaryllis had told Juniper, and where the chapter was giving us Joon's opinion of her. Same thing with the actual prose itself really, some of it felt very much like Juniper, some of it was him imagining her (and some of it felt like it was straight up Amaryllis' voice).

I'm not sure I like the third-person-by-proxy-of-first-person as much as straight first or third, but it was certainly fun.
