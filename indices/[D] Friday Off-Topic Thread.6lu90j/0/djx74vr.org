You know what? I feel real good about my life right now.

My last ditch effort did pay off. I've met with the teacher overseeing our project, and it looks like it's going to make it past the documentation stage. The people who kept telling me they would have much more time to work later, while I stopped myself many times from yelling at them, do have time to work now, and are very motivated.

Also I saw people being nice and helpful to each other in the street, made faces at a kid in the RER A (a Parisian metro line), some girls said nice things to me at a restaurant, and there's plenty of negentropy left in the universe.

So, you know. Sometimes being rational works, and life doesn't suck. Tonight is "Couteaubleu is happy and motivated" night!

Edit from a few months later: actually, the project tanked at the documentation stage because nobody else put any work in it, and now I'm pursuing it alone :(
