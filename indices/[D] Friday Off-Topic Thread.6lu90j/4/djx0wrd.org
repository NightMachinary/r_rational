My only thing to say this week is that I got to the part of /Forty Milleniums of Cultivation/ with real plot. Kinda.

And yeah, that was the Supreme Emperor with the 20 Primary Sects, wasn't it? Each led by the Supreme Emperor's own soul-clone, uh-huh. And then the leader of them gets corrupted by Tenebrum d+a+emons and turns against the Emperor, huh?

That was hilarious and I was highlighting every single bit of it in my Kindle.
