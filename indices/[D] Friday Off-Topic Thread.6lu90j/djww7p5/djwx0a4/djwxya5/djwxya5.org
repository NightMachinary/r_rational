As opposed to not giving someone access to potentially lethal drugs. Some unknown percent of the time, selling results in one or more people getting hurt. Of course, the people seeking the drugs would have found some anyway, which is why I don't find that good enough to refuse to sell, but some people care more than me about the direct effects of their actions rather than the probabilistic effects.
