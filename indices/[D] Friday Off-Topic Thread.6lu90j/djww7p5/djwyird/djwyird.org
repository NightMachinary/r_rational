I'd probably get rid of it. Cocaine seems to be on the "more dangerous than it's worth" side of drugs, and who knows what addictions I might be feeding with it. Besides, what "good" am I rationalizing myself into? Probably goes to rent and a new computer. Is that worth making the problem bigger, even if only by a relatively small amount?
