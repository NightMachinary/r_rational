Wow, that's the single most evil thing I've ever read in this sub, and I'm including all kinds of evil munchkin ideas for world domination in the saturday threads.

Think of all the people who live downstream from where you threw in the *large* block of cocaine. Anyone ingesting the water from the river on a regular basis is now going to ingest your cocaine without knowing it. Depending on the specific river, you could get tons of innocent victims unknowingly overdosing on cocaine or becoming addicted to cocaine just because they drank tap water or washed their faces/hands/food in a river or ate fish caught from a river. Especially if that river feeds into a reservoir.
