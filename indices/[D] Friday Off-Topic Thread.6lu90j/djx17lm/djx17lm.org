Oh! Is anyone else going to CrossingsCon 2017 in August? I still have a week or so to figure my shit out as to whether I'm going and how to go.

It's this universe's /only/ (known) Young Wizards convention, so if you miss out, you might have to cross the paracosm or wait until next year to get another one!
