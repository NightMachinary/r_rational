[[https://youtu.be/jbDSEpIZat8][Game Maker's Toolkit is running a game jam next week]]. I'm planning on entering (probably while trying to prototype something relevant to Renegade), and at least one other person on the [[/r/rational]] Discord is running with their group.

I would be happy to take any stragglers who want some experience making a game, and I would also be happy to offer advice if you're looking to start your own group or run solo. If you've never made games but would like to, this is a great opportunity to get your feet wet. I would however advise settling on a game engine now and spending a few days getting caught up on it; it won't do to try and design and make a game in 48 hours when you've never actually touched the engine before. I can recommend Unity as a great general-purpose engine for this sort of thing, but there are myriad other options depending on your goals.
