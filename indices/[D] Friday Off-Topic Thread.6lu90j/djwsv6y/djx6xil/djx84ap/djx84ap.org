[[https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-jam][The jam's FAQ]] is (I'm told intentionally) sort of vague, but worldwide is implied, I think. Mark Brown is himself in the UK, and I'm not, so there's that at least. Since they're not starting at a universal time, I think the intent is for local groups, but piss on that.

One of the guys that might run with me is in Australia (and I'm in the US) so it's a situation we'll have to figure out regardless. It's probably against the spirit of the thing to take advantage of the wide time frame, so I would think we would need to sit down and pick a 48 hour time frame, and some of us will just not have it be 6PM-6PM local time.

I'd love to have you! These jams are always nicer in groups, I think. Just let me know; I'm entering regardless, but if there's more people in the group, I'll allocate more of my time over the weekend to it.
