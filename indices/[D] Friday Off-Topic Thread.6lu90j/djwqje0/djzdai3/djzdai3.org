One thing that might help with the time thing is skipping ahead when you're traveling. Are you going through the Viridian Forest? Well, that's a two-week trip, minus any breaks that you take to explore (and you could, conceivably, do the trip in real time, but that'd take a heck of a long time). Assuming that you are traveling a fair amount, and that travel times are long enough that they will eventually stack up to a meaningful amount, then this might be a workable balance.
