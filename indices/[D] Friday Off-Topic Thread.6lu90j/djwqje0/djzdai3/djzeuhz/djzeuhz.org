So we actually discussed a similar class of solution in Discord the other day, the idea that some actions take more or less time than the default. For instance, if we compress each day to 5 IRL minutes long, but then make it so battles take very little objective time by making time move slowly during turns, then we've done something similar to what you propose, if in reverse.

I'm not sure that there's a silver bullet, and we've been discussing just decoupling days, seasons, and years so they don't have the same relationships with one another that we do in our world (e.g. 10-15 days to a year, 30 days to a season) and then remove dialog references to all of them but one (e.g NPCs only measure things in seasons when noting the passage of time. It's rough; a day/night cycle just does not play well with years passing while letting people play without this being a full time job.
