So I think this is just a matter of perspective: as a designer, my focus is on making the core gameplay loop (the combat) focused, intuitive, and fun. Once I have done this, I create reasons for the player to go from battle to battle, which is really just the grout between the tiles as far as I'm concerned. From the /player's/ perspective, it might look like it's the other way around: they want to become Champion, which means beating Gyms, which means getting that wild Charmander to round out their team, which means fighting through hordes of hostiles while searching the proper area. But that's not how I've built the game (nor what I've focused the design on), that's just how it's interacted with. If I build a house, the first thing they see is the front door, but that's certainly not the first thing that I built or designed.

Bungie referred to the core gameplay loop of Halo as the "thirty seconds of fun". The game was at its best when you were given weapons and a group of guys to fight, maybe in a novel arrangement or composition or on interesting terrain, but when it came down to it, each well-designed encounter was probably going to produce thirty seconds of fun. The trick was then to chain as many thirty-seconds together as possible, and designing a level was just arranging opportunities for those chains, and a story was just an excuse to piece levels together.

Basically what I'm saying is that story, motives, etc are force multipliers, /not/ the actual meat of the game. Nethack is still played decades later, as is Mario, and it's not because saving the princess or retrieving the amulet of Yednor is in any way compelling or the reason players keep coming back. if I can make the moment-to-moment fights interesting and compelling enough, I won't even /need/ that other stuff...but I'm probably not that good, so it will need it regardless.
