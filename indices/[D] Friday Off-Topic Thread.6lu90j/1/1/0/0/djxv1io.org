  So my goal is to make it so that the entire rest of the game is built around making you want to go and put yourself in those pokemon fights.

Okay, this is a little abstract, but I'm not sure that's how a good gameplay loop works. The way I understand it, a gameplay loop is something like "Player has X, Player wants X+1, there are obstacles between X and X+1, Player needs to do A to beat these obstacles and get X+1".

There are gameplay loops on multiple levels. In most games, there are at least 2 or 3: the main combat gameplay loop (have enemy -> fight enemy -> enemy is beaten), the immediate quest (we need to blow up this anti-aircraft gun so our helicopter can land with reinforcements!) and the central quest (we need to defeat the main bad guy that finding allies / learning his weakness / traveling to Mordor / building the Crucible).

My point being, once the 'fight pokemons' gameplay loop is abstracted away to Win/Lose (+XP, resources spent during a fight, etc), you need to figure out what the rest of the game is about, either top down or bottom up, and what are the other loops. What does the player accomplish by beating Pokemons? The idea is, every loop is based on the loops under it for progression, and the loop above it for meaning / necessity.

I'm not saying you should start writing quests; I'm saying that before you start to write quests, you should figure out what you want from them.
