Ha, I was in the middle of typing a reply and then got distracted by reading up on Diplomacy. I'd never heard of it, but its history was quite interesting.

  Of course, RNG does have its advantages (forces you to consider risk vs reward), and the drawbacks can be compensated by diluting it, and having a lot of opportunities to come back from a bad RNG, or making matches short enough that losing one isn't a big deal.

Right. It just seems inelegant that the solution to the downsides of a mechanic is to, well, use less of the mechanic. Anything that pulls gameplay outcome away from luck and towards a system that can be learned and abused is a win in my book.

  I'd recommend making the "wilderness trips" into something that needs to be bought with actual gameplay. For instance, maybe you need regular shots of 'vaccine' to survive, otherwise you'd get sick. So regular gameplay gets you enough money to buy the shots (or even better, the shots are way too expensive for you, so you need to complete quests to get them); when you have enough, you plan your trip to the wilderness.

Yeah, at the very least you would need food and vitamins, and maybe medical supplies so that the skip isn't interrupted by a bad bruise. Having what is essentially a timeskip currency is a good train of thought, however. I don't know that it needs to be something like a specialized medicine (else why isn't the player using it during normal gameplay as well?) but there might be a good way to justify it.

  I think there shouldn't be much overlap between the pokemons you can find during time-skips, and the pokemons you can find during gameplay. Like, maybe the gameplay areas only have weak/common pokemons, and the 'deep wilderness' timeskip areas have rarer, more powerful pokemons?

Hmm. One of the things that makes time-skipping hard to swallow is that it looks like an optional feature that lets you skip the core gameplay with tradeoffs, but everything it seems to touch makes it more of a crucial, core system. Having some pokemon that you could never find by wandering normally is an example of this. If I feel the need to avoid normal gameplay to grind for a component I want to play the normal gameplay better with, it seems like something somewhere is missing the point.

#+begin_quote
  Either way, you should probably start with establishing what you want the gameplay loop to be for finding pokemons. Like, what should it be about? To be specific, what would you ideally want the player to spend their time doing between two pokemon fights?

So my goal is to make it so that the entire rest of the game is built around making you want to go and put yourself in those pokemon fights. The standard, default goal is to become Champion, so naturally players who want that will be fighting for the sake of fighting, and I won't be able to stop them from just grinding as fast as they can to the top. Other mechanics however can be more shrewd. Maybe there's rare item components that are only in area X that you're trying to search for. Maybe it's a Ranger quest to find some lost trainers to improve your standing with the Ranger organization. Maybe you're trying to map out some areas, because there are some pagodas that are rumored to be arranged in a triangle and some treasure is in the center. Maybe there's a rare (or a specific individual) pokemon that you're trying to track to return to the owner or integrate into your team. Or maybe you're doing any or all of the above just to get cash for ${thing that costs too much money}.

Timeskipping as a mechanic probably shouldn't help with hardly any of these (mapmaking being maybe an exception). If it's included, I think that it ought to perform two functions: make you slightly stronger without working for it, and advance time forward, for better or for worse.
