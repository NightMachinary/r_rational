Oh oh! Like in Diplomacy!

  Things are so chaotic with everyone and their mother trying to think One Level Higher Than Everyone Else, but unlike RNG, if you manage to hit, it's usually because you did think One Level Higher and got rewarded for it.

Of course, RNG does have its advantages (forces you to consider risk vs reward), and the drawbacks can be compensated by diluting it, and having a lot of opportunities to come back from a bad RNG, or making matches short enough that losing one isn't a big deal.

  Is playing the game “by hand” now cheapened? If I can essentially skip forward a few decades with minimal preparation, isn't that what everyone is just always going to do?

I'd recommend making the "wilderness trips" into something that needs to be bought with actual gameplay. For instance, maybe you need regular shots of 'vaccine' to survive, otherwise you'd get sick. So regular gameplay gets you enough money to buy the shots (or even better, the shots are way too expensive for you, so you need to complete quests to get them); when you have enough, you plan your trip to the wilderness.

  On the other hand, perhaps this cheapens the game and makes finding a Clefairy into either a stupendously hard meta-grind or a super-easy checklist item.

I think there shouldn't be much overlap between the pokemons you can find during time-skips, and the pokemons you can find during gameplay. Like, maybe the gameplay areas only have weak/common pokemons, and the 'deep wilderness' timeskip areas have rarer, more powerful pokemons?

I dunno. Either way, you should probably start with establishing what you want the gameplay loop to be for finding pokemons. Like, what should it be about? To be specific, what would you ideally want the player to spend their time doing between two pokemon fights?
