/Your Lie in April/ resonated with me; I grew up learning a musical instrument as well, which lead to similar conflicts as in the story.

My most major complaint is that the love interest is a [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManicPixieDreamGirl][manic pixie dream girl]] (TVTropes), so the story beats are all fairly predictable.

The characters in the story are all overwhelmed by emotion, but they're children; they're allowed to be. The story is about growing up, feeling things, childhoods (that are supposed to reflect the norm? something that people wish to be? I have no idea).

I guess you have to train yourself at understanding the feeling of love without rationalising why you would feel it yourself. Or you can try to get over the initial reaction of "these people are stupid for blindly falling in love" and chalk it under suspension of disbelief, and view the rest of the story with that prior.

I mean, the Force? Really? That gives plot-convenient powers when necessary?
