It's never been a problem for me when the story focuses on the relationship after they've already fallen in love, such as the webcomic /Love and Capes/ and I would argue /Yuri on Ice/ qualifies as well even if the context is completely different. /Toradora/ is one of the few examples where I did buy into a budding romance, but there are plenty of shows with romantic subplots where I was satisfied by the arc.

At the minimum, I usually feel happy for the characters when they get together the same way I would be happy for a friend and have frequently rooted for couples to get together when I think they'd be good for each other. It's just when romance is the main focus that I can't be certain whether it'll resonate with me, especially since I have only seen a handful of romances due to worries over whether I'll enjoy them.

The manic pixie dream girl trope doesn't bother me in this show because Kaori almost seems like a reconstruction of it. She only acted that way due to the circumstances she was in, her erratic persona was just as prone to being "tyrannical" or even somewhat self-destructive, she turns out to be internally conflicted over what she's doing, and the ending completely recontextualizes her purpose in the narrative while still holding true to the trope's nature as a force of change upon the characters.

This show may not have clicked with me as well as it did for you, but it's still a damn well made show that delivers on what it promises with a few surprises along the way. Other anime have resonated with me better: the struggle to find self confidence in /Yuri on Ice/, the fight against self-loathing and its interactions with loved ones in /The Boy and the Beast/, the difficulty of becoming a fuller person in /Gargantia on the Verderous Planet/, and the importance of holding onto hope in the face of despair in /Madoka Magica/, but /Your Lie in April/ still deserves the attention and acclaim it has received.

As for characters I've personally related to, that's pretty rare since I'm an analytical introvert who wants to be a intuitive extrovert. It's hard to find a analogue to being born without any understanding of emotions or socialization, getting called a genius by everyone but feeling like I'm struggling to live up to my own standards, battling episodes of depression and anxiety that lead to self sabotage, and desperately searching for this thing called "passion" that everyone else seems to have but I have no idea what I want so I just keep doing what others tell me.

If you've seen anything that tackles ideas like that, especially that last one, let me know. I've found kindred spirits in characters like Ender, Data, and [[https://www.reddit.com/r/PaulsWPAccount/comments/3q223j/index/][the protagonist of this harrowing story]] while making do with what I can in characters like Kousei Arima. It'd be great to find more, though it's hard since they aren't easily relatable and it's difficult to portray their feelings so people aren't clamoring for them.
