I finally looked into Lion and it looks great, but the one thing I'm worried about is that I will end up envying Rei just because he at least has shogi. Regardless of how much shogi is tied to his self-loathing, it at least gives him something to do that he can financially support himself with.

I don't think I'm over the depression I was going through back in college, but my primary concern right now is finding a job and that's been going nowhere. Rei at least has a marketable skill he can, in theory, build a fulfilling life around. I don't even have that because no one wants to hire me.

I have a B.S. in Physics and B.A. in Math, but no experience or drive to succeed that I can express in an interview. I can't move away for a job because I'm not ready to live independently and I'm afraid of writing a cover letter because talking myself up makes me anxious and I might get rejected anyway.
