I had that same experience with Rurouni Kenshin, my favorite manga which I checked out the anime for. I found the dialogue in the dub to be annoyingly slow and it seemed a bit off, so I tried it with subtitles instead. The writing flowed better and was closer to the manga, but I found it extremely distracting that Kenshin was voiced by a woman.

The best dubs I've seen are Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, Cowboy Bebop, Steins;Gate, Gargantia on the Verderous Planet, and Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid.
