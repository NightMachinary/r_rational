One of the reasons I didn't go to grad school is that I couldn't pick a field I wanted to go into because I don't know what work I enjoy doing. So far, I've only gotten callbacks from jobs that I would've qualified for if I'd never gone to college. I don't know what I'm supposed to do at this point besides keep trawling the job boards and hope I finally get lucky.
