I would like to do work that makes the world a better place, but my opportunities are limited. I'm not psychologically ready to move out of my childhood home, have no work experience in the field I have a degree in and need a monthly salary of at least $2000 in order to support myself.

That's why I've narrowed my ambition to just doing work that will make me money and even that is proving difficult to find. Temp agencies and employment counselors like it when you have a specific profession in mind and are willing to move to where the work is.
