I think SRU would still be enjoyable if you hadn't seen Avatar, though you definitely should check it out, I just think it helps if you're already invested in these characters and their chemistry with each other. I don't /love/ The Last Airbender as much as most fans seem to and I think Legend of Korra was only just okay at its best moments, but I highly recommend the first series for similar reasons as Harry Potter.

There are flaws that a critical eye will catch and the writing isn't as emotionally deep as it could be, but it's still a world you love to dive into with extremely likable characters on a fun adventure. It's not super unique, but it's relatable to a broad audience and easily consumable. As animated shows go, it doesn't hold a candle to Young Justice or Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, but it still holds a special place in my heart.
