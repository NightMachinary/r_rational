Disclaimer: I've never fully watched the show. I've seen episode 1-2 and my friend has given me a cliff notes of the rest of the series. My major problem with it (and the main reason I don't think I'll ever watch it despite how goddamn /beautiful/ the animation is) is I find the female protagonist's (the violin player) plan unbearably stupid.

Again though, massive props for the animation. A very beautifully animated anime.
