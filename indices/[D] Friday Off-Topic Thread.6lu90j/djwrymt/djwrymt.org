I'm halfway through watching /Your Lie in April/ for the first time and am frustrated with myself over it. Like /Your Name/, it's a story that despite its flaws I have gotten completely invested in the emotional journey it's taking me on thanks to stellar direction and production values, only to feel weirdly dissatisfied when it ends. I'm literally getting /the feels/ every 10 minutes and no matter how much I loved it in the moment, every episode leaves me feeling upset when it's over.

I think it's because the show is all about intangible feelings. The characters feel things they don't understand and act on them anyway, which is the whole point. Love doesn't need to be logical in order for it to be real and worth embracing, so this show celebrates the raw feelings within us all. That's a great theme to explore, but I don't like it because I find the idea that emotions aren't controlled by logic uncomfortable because I'm autistic. I've spent my whole life working to understand emotions in myself and others, so I'm prejudiced against stories that contradict that impulse.

I hate the idea that I could ever feel love for someone without knowing why, but I think it's stupid it bothers me so much I allow it to ruin stories for me that I otherwise love. I've gotten so good at understanding emotions, particularly in art, that romance anime manage to resonate with me in the way everyone told me they would, yet whenever it's over I always feel angry at it. This also happened to a lesser extent with /Toradora/ while /Yuri on Ice/ was only saved by the characters expressing themselves through ice skating.

So where am I going with overanalyzing my psychology based upon my arbitrary opinions on the niche genres of romance and anime? I have no idea. I don't know how I can let go of what's keeping me from completely falling in love with these stories and I'm certainly not willing to go the other direction and decide I don't actually like them. They do click with me and I do enjoy watching them, but I never feel satisfied when they're over. I have the dumbest first world problem here and I'm ranting about it to you guys because it don't like the paradox I'm in and want some advice on how to resolve it instead of just moving on.

EDIT: I binged the rest of the show today and the finale gave me absolutely everything I wanted without any disappointment. It was sad, but a life-affirming kind of sadness that helps you recognize all the beautiful things in life worth being happy about. The episodes leading up to it had the same problem as I did before, but I'm definitely happy I watched this show and got as much out of it as I did. Other anime have hit me harder with the characters and themes, but it's still an easy recommendation for /the feels/.
