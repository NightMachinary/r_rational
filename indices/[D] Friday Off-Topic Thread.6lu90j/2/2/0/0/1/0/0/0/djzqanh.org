I had the same sort of concerns when I first started watching anime. I only used to watch dubs on Cartoon Network and such as a kid. Subs are pretty easy to get used to. The way it usually works is you read the line on the screen and then watch the action knowing what they are saying. Like you'll read the line in half a second and the next five seconds will be them verbalizing the line you've read and internalized.

Action scenes are usually just yelling or short phrases. So there's little concern there of getting lost in the subs and missing action. It's definitely something you would need to get used to but it's a very easy skill to pick up and it will open up your anime viewing options immensely. Not to mention (in my personal opinion) Japanese voice acting is usually better. The voices often really fit their roles, with a few noted exceptions (Japanese Goku, for example, is an old lady that sounds like a child. Not the coolest thing when he's unleashing devastation!)
