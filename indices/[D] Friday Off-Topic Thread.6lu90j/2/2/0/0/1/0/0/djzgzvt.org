I'm worried that my tunnel vision will result in me looking at the subtitles instead of the actual animation. The only film I've ever watched with subtitles was the Korean thriller I Saw The Devil, which ended up working out because the dialogue was slow, sounded similar to when I read a novel, and no one ever spoke when something visually interesting was happening. I have no idea what anime would also be like that while being better than the manga.
