I enjoy my hobbies, but the main purpose of those is to alleviate boredom so none of them can be turned into a career without becoming an artist or art critic, which is work I do not believe I would enjoy doing. I don't feel a drive to do anything besides support and improve myself, but I'm progressing so slowly that I'm extremely tempted to be lazy. I only want a job because I want money.
