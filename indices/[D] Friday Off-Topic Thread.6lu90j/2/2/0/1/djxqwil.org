I think the current cultural conception of passion is extremely flawed; it encourages you to wander blindly until you find your passion, even if it takes you forever, or your passion doesn't exist.

I find it better to take something that you are interested or enjoy, and make it your passion. Set yourself a goal that will take a lifetime to complete, and precommit to achieving it. It gives direction. It's not "I love this and I want to do it forever". It's "This seems interesting. Let's get it done."
