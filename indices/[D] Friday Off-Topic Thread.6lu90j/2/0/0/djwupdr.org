I used to only like rational fiction because I could only understand stories through logic, but as my emotional intelligence has improved I have found that I do like stories that appeal to me through emotion. Even if they can be dumb or nonsensical, they still have artistic value and have enriched my life by being in it. I prefer when they're more rational, of course, but that's just a bonus on top of my emotional satisfaction.

So I don't think it's the lack of rationality that's frustrating me. I think it's just that I have a deeply engrained /need/ to understand emotions so a story that treats them as intangible and celebrates that as part of human nature is simultaneously incredibly beautiful and intrinsically uncomfortable. I should just be able to chalk it up to a "journey before destination" style of story, but I haven't been able to change how I feel.
