I am also a person who tries to live and learn vicariously through fiction since I don't interact with people as much as I would like. That's probably why I care so much about how I feel towards it and what that says about me. Thankfully, I still have people in my life that I'm very happy to have in it and I cherish my time with them.

A while back I read the first few pages of Luminosity on a whim and then put it down to find something else to read. I know I definitely didn't give it enough of a chance and have no right to complain after I had watched the first Twilight film, but it didn't catch my interest right away because Bella didn't immediately click with me.

Right now I'm reading the Avatar AU fanfic /What I Learned at SRU/ [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6ffjma/monthly_recommendation_thread/dijbsfe][(full recommendation here)]] because I find slice of life relaxing and life-affirming, though I personally think it qualifies as rational fiction thanks to how intelligent and introspective the characters are.
