It is good that you have found a greater connection to emotional stories. Frankly a good deal of my relations to meatspace humans is filtered by novels, which despite its inherent problems has worked out surprisingly well so far.

To cite a positive example, have you read Alicorn's Luminosity Sequence? (Recommendation also goes to her /Twilight/ fanfiction of the same name). It is pretty popular here so I would be surprised if you hadn't, but it provides both tools and examples of interesting emotional insight.
