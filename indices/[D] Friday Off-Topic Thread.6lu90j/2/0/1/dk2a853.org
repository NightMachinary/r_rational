A little unrelated but your post has made me realize something (about the uncuriosity).

I think that many (maybe most?) people really are fundamentally uncurious about themselves and the world, and until right now it always baffled me.

I think a lot of people who don't see themselves as 'smart' have kind of given up on thinking they're going to be able to understand things, so they don't try. I've had a lot of experiences that support this idea, but I didn't mentally put it together that way until now.
