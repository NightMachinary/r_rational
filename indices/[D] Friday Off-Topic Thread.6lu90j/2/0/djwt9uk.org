While I am skirting closer to the edge of the anime community, I have only seen ever seen /Your Name/ of the series you mentioned.

I would guess that this class of problems is common among the [[/r/rational]] community. I often cringe when consuming otherwise enjoyable media and everyone is fundamentally uncurious about themselves and the world. It seems like the majority of writers prefer vague emotional explanations because it saves both time and effort on their parts, or perhaps it appeals to certain people.

For the record, the part of /Psycho/ I enjoy the most is the psychological monologue at the end. In other words, I relate. I, however, have no advice.
