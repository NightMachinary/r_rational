I have seen it done second-hand a few times. It really is hilariously easy. You think UPS runs chem sniffers over every package they get? You think you couldn't, with a bit of forethought, cover a 5kg brick in enough obfuscation to defeat any plausible detection method? If you think about it for 5 minutes, you could probably think of even more safeguards.
