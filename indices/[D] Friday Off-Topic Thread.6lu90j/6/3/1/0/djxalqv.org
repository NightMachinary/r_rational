I thiiink you underestimate how much water moves through a river. A usual dose of cocaine is [[https://drugs-forum.com/threads/what-is-the-dose-for-pure-cocaine.91797/][50-150mg]]. A 2kg brick of cocaine is [[http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/showthread.php?t=298784]['the size of a small phonebook']], so say a 'large' block is 5kg. People drink about [[http://www.naturalhydrationcouncil.org.uk/hydration-facts/faqs-on-hydration/][2.5 litres of water a day]], so to ingest a standard 'dose' every day this 5kg would have to be dissolved in at most 2.5l * 50 mg / 5 kg = 2.5 * 1e5 = 250000 litres of water.

Moderate rivers have discharge of about [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bug_River][100m^{3/s}]] = 1e5 l / s = 144 million liters a day. A 5kg block of cocaine will just disappear in one. A very small river will have discharge of [[https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C5%82upia_(rzeka)][15.5 m^{3} /s]] (warning - polish), i.e. ~22 million liters a day. Still more than enough to make this a non-issue.

Edit: also, I'm pretty sure I'm on a list now.
