  Personally, I think I would sell it. I value my personal comfort quite highly, and a single block of cocaine isn't going to change all that much about the international drug market. Anyone who was buying on whatever site I wound up using would have just wound up buying from someone else who is probably far less scrupulous than me.

Isn't that what every single dealer thinks? "It's not bad because there worse people out there doing it too, why should they get all the money?"
