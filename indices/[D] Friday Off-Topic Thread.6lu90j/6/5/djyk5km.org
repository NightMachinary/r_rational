To be honest, the logistics of this are still much more risky than you'd think even if the cocaine is completely untraceable. Selling that much coke (You didn't give exact numbers but I'll take large block to mean size of a suitcase, which could be like 15 bricks, which is 15 kg. Prices vary but on the low end, that's $375,000) in one large drop is /hard/. Even utilizing dark net resources (which are risky in and of themselves), you'd be hard pressed to find someone who's trying to buy that much cocaine from an unknown seller. They'd probably think you were a cop. In that case? I'd just leave it alone or report it to the cops. I definitely wouldn't carry it with me.

If we took out the real world logistics of fencing that much cocaine, I would probably sell it. In a perfect world, I'd like to turn it into the cops for a reward. Even if it's 1/10 of the street price, I would be happy. But that's not really how it works. I think the most you'd get for that is a hearty handshake.

I also don't really care for the good vs bad rationalization of it. As discussed, the drug world is huge as it is. A block isn't much relatively speaking. And it's not as if the coke heads that end up using this block would be unable to procure coke elsewhere.

TL;DR: Fencing it is too hard and risky. Would sell if I had a guaranteed safe way to. In a perfect world, would call cops for smaller but still sizable reward.
