A large block of powder cocaine fell out of the sky into your hands. Momentum is conserved, and your hands are promptly crushed into a fine paste, splattered across the ground. Nobody is around to hear the loud crash. Nobody calls an ambulance. If you even survive the initial impact, you just slowly bleed to death, trapped under the large block of cocaine.

Moral of the story: Don't try to catch things falling out of the sky.

So instead, let's say that you simply discover a large block of powder cocaine, innocuously sitting in the middle of a forest. In this case, since your fingerprints are thankfully not on the block of cocaine, the best way to minimize personal risk is to simply ignore the block of cocaine. And also never go into forests in the first place, as forests are dangerous.
