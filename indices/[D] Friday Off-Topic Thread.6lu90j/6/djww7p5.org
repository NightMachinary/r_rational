Hypothetical question: Let's say a large block of powder cocaine fell out of the sky into your hands. Nobody knows you have it, nobody will come looking for it or you.

Do you sell it on something like Silkroad, rationalizing that the bad done to society by a single block of drugs will be less bad than whatever good you can accomplish with the money? Do you turn it over to the police? Something else?

Personally, I think I would sell it. I value my personal comfort quite highly, and a single block of cocaine isn't going to change all that much about the international drug market. Anyone who was buying on whatever site I wound up using would have just wound up buying from someone else who is probably far less scrupulous than me. I can understand why someone would choose not to, of course. Destroying the drugs immediately would minimize personal risk, turning it over to the police might yield some kind of legitimate reward (while carrying risk in transport to the police station). It's an interesting question, which is why I'm asking it.
