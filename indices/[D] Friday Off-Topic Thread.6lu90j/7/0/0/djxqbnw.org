We will be using C# with the Unity3D engine. You should probably take at least a glance at those before this Friday (I don't know any good tutorials off the top of my head, sadly). If nothing else we'll ensure you get a look at the process, but once I know what we're working on I'll try and make sure there's something to do at your level. What time zone are you in?
