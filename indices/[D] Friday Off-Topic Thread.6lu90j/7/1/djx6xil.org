Mh, tempting. Does it take people from all over the world? (there might be some problems with the time zones too) I absolutely hated the last Game Jam I was in (GGJ - Theme: Rituals), but I kinda want to find out how much experience / wisdom / humility I've learned in the months of school since.

Also, I keep hearing about the Renegade project and I never really talked to you, so that could be cool too.
