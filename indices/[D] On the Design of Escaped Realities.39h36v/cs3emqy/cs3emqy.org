The reversal of "escapism" is an interesting one that I think I'll need some time to process. The argument that the Amish live /further/ from reality than I do is ... I don't know. I grew up around the Amish, and the Hutterites, and was raised in a somewhat similar (if more technologically progressive) ethno-religious group. I would definitely agree that they have a more socially and physically focused reality. "More real" is much harder to pin down. I spend the majority of my waking life in front of a screen, either on the internet, writing code, or writing prose fiction. The zen state of computer programming, in all its mathematical/platonic glory, does not seem particularly real to me, in part because it's almost exclusively several layers of abstraction on top of the actual computational processes themselves. I write something like =rdrOrders.Read=, and that's an abbreviation for whole processes and meanings that I'm allowed to remain ignorant of.

I enjoyed the article, but the conclusions are so counter-intuitive that I think they might just be wrong.
