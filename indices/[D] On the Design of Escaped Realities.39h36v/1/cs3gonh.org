Interesting article with some interesting, if philosophically convoluted arguments. However, one thing really bothered me - to illustrate the point of zen-like escapism, the author decided to choose */Bejeweled/* and */Clash of Clans?/* /Really?/ He had nigh-unprecedented choice in choosing his subjective reality - or so he argued - and THAT'S what he picked?
