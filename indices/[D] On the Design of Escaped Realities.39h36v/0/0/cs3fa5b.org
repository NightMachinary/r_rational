I think it depends what level of understanding you have about the exact process mediating your experience? I always feel that computer screens are /very/ real, because I have a fairly solid understanding of what the abstractions are built out of. Of course, I also feel that trees and bricks are real, but I would certainly say that tribal rain gods are far less real than /any/ of the above-mentioned things.

It could be a matter of understanding and also /control/. Computers can be turned off, and don't demand that you think of them as comprising the overarching truth of reality. Tribal rain dances, on the other hand, /do/ claim to be the Overarching Truth of Reality, or at least to be part of it. Yet there's nothing physically going-on /underneath/ the abstraction, and the abstraction demands control over your thoughts and your life.

I'm not sure I agree with the article, but it is interesting. I think it could be right sometimes and wrong other times.
