I've been thinking a lot about immortal characters who're basically perpetual motion machines, not needing to eat, drink, or breathe to stay alive and active.

If the energy to fuel these characters is being pumped in through some parallel dimension, but only at whatever rate is required to keep them alive and as spry as a typical human, how useful could it be? How much negentropy could such an immortal produce if we handwave the requirement for an energy input and focus on an average person's energy output capabilities? Would these characters be at all useful in a Heat Death scenario?
