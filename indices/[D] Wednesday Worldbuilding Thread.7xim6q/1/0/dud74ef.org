My initial though was probably not very useful, whatever work they do would be subject to entropy, so you are only getting the output of a single human.

Further thoughts just backed that up, but I thought of more ways to squeeze energy out of a human body:

1. The obvious work and motion. Having them moving something to create stored energy.
2. Heat energy. Humans maintain a consistent body temperature to function, just draining this heat could be really effective, especially when surrounding temperatures are approaching 0 degrees kelvin.
3. Electric energy. Minor amounts of energy in electrical signals in the brain and muscles.
4. Biomass energy. Ok maybe no eating means no pooping. But if they did poop, that is a never ending supply of fuel.

Imagining a generator based around this single perpetual motion machine human is kinda entertaining.

First of all they should be in a room that is acting as a piston chamber for an engine. Right now pistons work by having the explosive heat energy from oil expand and push the piston down. Since ambient temperatures would be so low, you'd actually want to just use their ambient body heat as the "explosive". Pump in cold air have their body heat up that air and expand the piston down. Remove that air, hopefully reusing the heat energy in it. Pump in more air that is close to zero kelvin.

While they are in there generating ambient heat, you will want them in a full body suit, and their brain wired into a simulation. The simulation should be keeping them constantly active. So the more thrashing about the better. The body suit needs to harness this kinetic energy as well as the small amounts of electrical energy in the body.

Finally, depending on whether they still have to poop, a poop tube sucking out the waste and using it to power fusion generators.

Without the poop fusion generator I don't know if you are keeping more than a couple hundred people alive indefinitely. With the poop generator, maybe make it a couple thousand people. Have those couple hundred or couple thousand people generating new full immersion VR content for the immortal and you might last a while.
