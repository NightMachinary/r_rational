Some questions you should probably ask yourself:

- How could someone try to cheat?
- How could someone minmax their team?
- To what extent do student body politics affect team selection?
- Are you trying to balance in favour of versatility or specialization (either is valid, but they look very different in game-design terms.)
- What kind of tournament setup will the school has?

1. Single-elimination (and to a lesser extent double elimination) favours go-big-or-go-home strategies (banking on rolling three sixes).
2. Swiss rounds reward consistency, at the expense of flashy, risky tactics. (you want a dice that rolls 4s or 5s every time.)
3. Ladder encourages different strategies at different rankings (as the higher the ranking you are, the more predictable opponents are).
4. "Challenge" systems (i.e. you have to challenge someone to get their rank) encourage high levels of posturing and potentially collusion outside of the game, and have particularly unstable equilibrium (if you just need to take down one team, then you only need a strategy tailored to that exact team.)
