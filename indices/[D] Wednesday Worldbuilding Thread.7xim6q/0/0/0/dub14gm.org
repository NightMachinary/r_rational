Aspirate, Anvil, Juggernaut. Overload Aspirate. For six seconds I instantly regain every MP I spend. In effect, I have infinite MP (but only for six seconds).

Charge both attack and defense with vast heaps of mana. For a minute I can't Aspirate, but I don't care with how much Attack and Defense I have.

Gets even worse if a teammate /also/ overloads Aspirate, because then each of us gets double the MP... I think.
