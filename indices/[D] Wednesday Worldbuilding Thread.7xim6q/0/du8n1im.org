Still idly developing [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7vwof7/d_wednesday_worldbuilding_thread/dtw306v/][battle school thing from last time]]. I think I've hammered together the beginnings of a rule system that might produce something like a metagame, drafted using mostly undefined game mechanical terms that are mostly just quantifiers for abstract things:

** Base rules
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: base-rules
   :END:
Choose three, no more than one each group\\
Choosing two from a group is possible, but requires a five second vulnerable switch time, and is rare\\
Choosing three from a group is pretty much unheard of and considered non-strategic\\
Unless stated otherwise, overloads cost 10 MP\\
Normal MP per person is something like 100

** Intake
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: intake
   :END:
(normal is 1 MP per 30sec, forgoing intake means hoping for an early win before running dry)

1. Plains (gain 1 MP/sec)\\
   Overload: 10 MP/sec for 4sec, then none for 1 minute
2. Aspirate (gain 1 MP per 5 MP spent by you or someone else)\\
   Overload: gain 5 MP per 5 MP spent for 6sec, then none for 1 minute
3. Travel (gain 1 MP per 5 ft moved, no more than 1 MP per square until 1 minute has passed)\\
   Overload: gain from out to 15 ft

** Viewpoint
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: viewpoint
   :END:
(most often forgone, as you can't have all four)

1. Compass (see everything, read opponent choices after 30sec, -2 ATN)\\
   Overload: Flash editic memory from sensorium, then nothing for 1 minute
2. Closed Eye (intuition, all rolls +1d4)\\
   Overload: a single, surefire hit or defense, then nothing for 1 minute
3. Backbone (all abilities x1.1)\\
   Overload: all abilities x2, then nothing for 1 minute

** Defense
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: defense
   :END:
(in addition to armor, forgone in pure dodge/deflect strategies, or sometimes pure aggression)

1. Anvil (skintight shield, -MP for each hit you take regardless of power) (Block)\\
   Overload: perfect defense at no MP cost for 10sec, then nothing for 1 minute
2. Rhombus (spinnable prism shield, -MP for each hit, --MP for direct orthogonal-to-plane hits, -2 ATN for best use) (Deflect)\\
   Overload: more angles and finer (easier) control for 10sec, then nothing for 1 minute
3. Wedge (repels along a specific pre-selected axis, +deflect, +dodge, less effective with each probing hit until axis is found, then only constrains attacks) (Dodge)\\
   Overload: more extreme effect (including moving things and people) for 10sec, then nothing

** Offense
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: offense
   :END:
(varies the most, least often forgone, some token MP cost per attack)

1. Bodkin (increases MP loss when doing shield strikes)\\
   Overload: singular strike that can completely knock out a shield, then unusable for a minute
2. Needlepoint (+1d5 to attack rolls)\\
   Overload: +1d10 to attack rolls, then nothing for 1 minute
3. Maniac (reduced interval between attacks, reduced exertion from many fast attacks, -1d4 to attack rolls)\\
   Overload: barrage of attacks w/ -1d10 to attack rolls, then nothing for 1 minute
4. Juggernaut (+5 to damage if used with heavy weapon, -MP per use)\\
   Overload: attack that bypasses all shields, then nothing for 1 minute

** Swords
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: swords
   :END:
Sword for every option, can fuel up to 60 MP into that option, or up to 10 MP at less favorable rates into others (so long as you selected them)\\
Can only recharge sword if you have that option chosen

"Off" swords complement a non-chosen locus (more options, until sword runs out)\\
"On" swords complement a chosen locus (easier recharge of sword, greater depths)

--------------

I think that with metagame considerations, varied arenas, non-magical differences in fighters, and possibly some further elaboration or "deeper secrets" this would be enough to carry a 90,000 word novel that was only halfway about the fights.

I'm most curious to see what people think the metagame (or possible metagames) might look like.
