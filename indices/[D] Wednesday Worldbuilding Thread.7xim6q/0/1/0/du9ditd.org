I think that /Travel/ is probably useful if you're a nimble fighter going against someone who can't keep up with you, or whose strategy is built around hunkering down. If you're five feet away from your opponent, circling around them once would gain you somewhere between 8-10 MP, which is probably more than /Plains/ would get over the same period. (I might have to jigger the numbers a little bit, or find a non-snowy place to time myself moving in circles or doing a mock battle.)

It's also useful in certain scenarios where you're already going to be moving around anyway, especially if your opponent is forced to keep in one spot (such as if you're on offense in a capture-the-flag type scenario).

I think /Aspirate/ probably shines in group settings, yes, but it might also be useful for burst scenarios; if your strategy involves dumping a bunch of mana as quickly as possible and hoping that you win before you run out of gas, then maybe /Aspirate/ would be helpful in allowing you to recoup some MP. Seems niche though. I think under the current (loose) rules, /Maniac/ against /Anvil/ might be the fastest way for two people to blast through MP; for the /Anvil/ duelist, /Aspirate/ might mean that every five times your shield gets hit, you gain back the MP needed to allow you to get hit a sixth time, plus all the other MP that's being spent. Still seems a bit niche though.

Depending on how long a match is expected to take, and how much MP you'd use in that time, it might be that the default is that no one selects anything for Intake, since you can only have three selections out of the four groups.
