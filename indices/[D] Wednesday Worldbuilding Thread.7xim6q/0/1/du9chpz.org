A little confused about *Intake*. Is /Travel/ useful at all? How fast do people usually move in these fights? Other than that, it looks like /Plains/ would be the default choice, and /Aspirate/ would only be used in a larger match with 5+ competitors (either team, or individual). Is that about right?
