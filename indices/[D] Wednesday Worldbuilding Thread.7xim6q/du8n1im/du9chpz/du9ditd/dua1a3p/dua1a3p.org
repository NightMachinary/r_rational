The real problem with /Aspirate/ in a one-on-one battle is that you end up spending 25% as much MP as your opponent (assuming the fight goes long). Unless you're both on the aspirate plan, in which case you'll each spend 150 MP total (EDIT: 166 MP), and then you're out. (I am, of course, ignoring the effects of Overload, which can get you more MP, but doesn't seem like a reasonable trade-off.)

Then again, maybe you have confederates in the stands that are spending MP for no purpose, just to send 20% of it to you... with just three confederates, you break even, and with a fourth, you'll pull ahead of your opponent (assuming your allies are using Plains + Aspirate).

Now, if you have a partner, you might be able to munchkin Aspirate: as much MP as you can dump in six seconds, you'll end up with twice that much. If you can keep the battle going long, you'll end up with unlimited MP. It might be interesting to see two people pretending to fight, going all out against each other every minute or so, only to turn against the organizers once they've built up enough MP. Unless the 100 MP is a person's maximum, in which case disregard.
