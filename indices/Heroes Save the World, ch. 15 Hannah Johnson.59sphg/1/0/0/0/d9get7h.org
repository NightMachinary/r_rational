Those already exist. They're below the comments, though, and...apparently you didn't see them. Which means that they're not very useful, being where they are.

I'm not sure if I can fix that without switching to a different theme, but I'll take a look, and if I can't fix it then I'll have to look at alternate themes. I doubt that I'll be able to change the theme in the next month, however--at the moment, I'm also writing applications for grad school and studying for the GRE. That'll be done in a month, one way or another, and I'll make "find a new theme" one of the tasks that I complete before I find a nice corner to collapse in.
