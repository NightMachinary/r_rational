First off, thanks again for reading and for commenting. >:]

  Also, I think this story is large enough to benefit from a table of contents. Or placed more prominently should one already exist, since a cursory scan couldn't find it.

I have now created a table of contents! One of the things that I do not like about this Wordpress theme is that the pages are listed in small font at the top of the page, so people may not notice them. This is why the landing page is the "About" page, and I'm adding a mention of the table of contents (with a link of course) just below the "Start reading here" line, to make sure that people see it.

Would you mind letting me know what you think of the table of contents? There's nothing fancy, but it'd be nice to know if there's anything horrible about the way that it's formatted (maybe it's incredibly awful that the sequence titles are centered, say).
