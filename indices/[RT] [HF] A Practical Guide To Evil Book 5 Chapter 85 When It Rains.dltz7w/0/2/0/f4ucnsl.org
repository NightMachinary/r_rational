Juniper and Malicia were both in Laure(?) at the end of Book 2. It's practically guaranteed that she'd have implanted orders. Hell, she might have even done it between Books 1 and 2, when they were both in Ater. Squire, who is already known to not be terribly loyal to the Empire, is given command over a Legion? Better put in contingencies, in case she starts getting ideas.
