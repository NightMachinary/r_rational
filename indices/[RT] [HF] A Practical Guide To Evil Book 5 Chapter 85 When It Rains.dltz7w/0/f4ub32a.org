Well, looks like Malicia set off her *Rule* bombs. I'm surprised that the Army of Callow's been subverted to such an extent, though I suppose I shouldn't be. Juniper was a given, and the core of them are Praesi; there are probably spies among them too. Considering the mass confusion and conflicting orders that such an event would generate, I suppose a third of the Army's officers being under suspicion would be expected.
