"Speaking" has always seemed to me like an incredibly broken and underused ability---I guess to make sense of things I've decided to assume that Amadeus and Cat almost never use it for fear of some sort of narrative backlash, because otherwise there's no explaining their behavior. Malicia's version is of course even more absurd.
