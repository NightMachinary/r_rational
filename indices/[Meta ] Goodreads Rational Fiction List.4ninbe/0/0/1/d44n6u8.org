That's me trawling through the threads with 20+ positive votes from the subreddit, through the monthly threads and the Q2 recommendation thread, and rational reads for original written fiction. /Fargo/ is the sole exception because it's basically its own book and doing so might entice the author to add their own works to the list. I did this as original fiction isn't as exclusive as fanfiction and thus more likely to attract existing and new readers to the genre, and I expect others will recommend worthy fanfiction.
