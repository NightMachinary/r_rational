This is a repost of a previous recommendation list I made (with a few updates):

Responses in the order in which I thought of them within each category (don't take it as an order of preference or anything). Lots of fanfic in this list because it's what people tend to write. Assume they're rational unless stated otherwise.

Note that "rationalist" means "rational + demonstrates analytical techniques", so I note where that's applicable (if I remember; a lot of this is fuzzy due to sheer quantity).

Finished:

- [[https://wertifloke.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/][The Waves Arisen]], rationalist Naruto fanfiction
- [[http://hpmor.com/][Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality]] (HPMoR), rationalist Harry Potter fanfiction, possibly the ur-example of the concept of rationalist fanfiction (probably wrong about that however)
- [[http://alexanderwales.com/shadows/][Shadows of the Limelight]], original story (it's true, I do read original stories) about a world where fame literally grants superpowers (by one of this subreddit's moderators, [[/u/alexanderwales]])
- [[http://parahumans.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/][Worm]], original story about an alternate Earth where superheroes are forged from "trigger events" (moments of intense emotional or physical trauma) by [[/u/Wildbow]]
- [[https://pactwebserial.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/][Pact]], original story about modern magic users and creatures where words have power and consequences (also by Wildbow)
- The Two Year Emperor ([[http://www.mediafire.com/download/1km9vv259bd913i/The_Two_Year_Emperor_-_Eagle_Jarl.epub][epub]]), original story (kinda) about an ordinary, albeit clever man transported to a world that runs on Dungeons and Dragons rules as written by [[/u/eaglejarl]]; this one was, at one point, only available for purchase on Amazon [[http://www.amazon.com.au/The-Two-Year-Emperor-Deor-ebook/dp/B011DQOT74][here]] but was generously rereleased for free by the author
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11087425/1/Team-Anko][Team Anko]], Naruto fanfiction also by eaglejarl
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10360716/1/The-Metropolitan-Man][The Metropolitan Man]], Superman/Lex Luthor fanfiction (by alexanderwales again; the next three are all by him)
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10327510/1/A-Bluer-Shade-of-White][A Bluer Shade of White]], Frozen fanfiction (yes, it is rational)
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9915682/1/The-Last-Christmas][The Last Christmas]], Santa Claus fanfiction (ditto)
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9658524/1/Branches-on-the-Tree-of-Time][Branches on the Tree of Time]], Terminator fanfiction
- [[http://qntm.org/structure][Fine Structure]], original story about superheroes that appear yearly, doubling in power (and the damage done in their tumultuous "trigger") each time; the whole thing is so much more than just that, but I don't want to spoil it (by Sam Hughes, who wrote the next two as well)
- [[http://qntm.org/ra][Ra]], original story about magic analysed as science; again, it goes on to be much more but I don't want to spoil it
- [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/qntm-s-author-page][Sam Hughes' author page at the SCP Foundation wiki]], I recommend reading his entries from 2015 (you may want to read the [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/about-the-scp-foundation][Foundation's about page]] and some of the [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/top-rated-pages][top rated pages]] from the wiki to get a feel for the setting first if you're new to SCP)
- [[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/62074/friendship-is-optimal][Friendship is Optimal]], My Little Pony fanfiction about an AI that is definitely not horrifying, no siree, just your average friendly AI over here
- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1152749/chapters/2337442][Cenotaph]], Worm fanfiction with a small deviation from canon
- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2417525/chapters/5347754][Wake]], sequel to Cenotaph
- [[http://www.anarchyishyperbole.com/p/significant-digits.html][Significant Digits]], HPMoR metafic which is very different in character (it has a [[http://www.anarchyishyperbole.com/p/previously-on-harry-potter-and-methods.html][summary of HPMoR]] if you don't want to read it, but obviously heavily spoils the plot of that fic)

Updating often:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9794740/1/Pokemon-The-Origin-of-Species][Pokemon: The Origin of Species]], rationalist Pokemon fanfiction
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11090259/1/r-Animorphs-The-Reckoning][r Animorphs: The Reckoning]], Animorphs fanfiction by [[/u/TK17Studios]]
- [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning][Mother of Learning]], original story about a student mage caught in a time loop by [[/u/nobody103]]
- [[https://twigserial.wordpress.com/2014/12/24/taking-root-1-1/][Twig]], original story about emotionally savvy, enhanced children fighting biopunk monsters in a world where the British defeated the American colonies using biological superweapons (by Wildbow)
- [[http://unsongbook.com/][UNSONG]], the only rational kabbalah story I've ever heard of, with a pleasantly high concentration of biblical whale puns
- [[http://alexanderwales.com/glimwarden/][Glimwarden]], yet another original story by alexanderwales featuring three rational protagonists fighting against anthropomorphic EM radiation (or at least that's my guess)
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9950232/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Perfectly-Reasonable-Explanation][Hermione Granger and the Perfectly Reasonable Explanation]], a rational Harry Potter fanfic that I'm really hoping keeps up the updates (it was in a long hiatus until recently) in part because it has the perfect title for a Hermione fic

Updating rarely, possibly abandoned:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20][Harry Potter and the Natural 20]], Harry Potter/Dungeons and Dragons crossover fanfiction (protagonist is an original character and a munchkin to his core)
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10898446/1/Weaver-Nine][Weaver 9]], a Worm metafiction which swaps the role of two important characters (casting a significant villain in the role as, er, "hero")
- [[http://junctureserial.blogspot.com.au/2015/08/juncture-11.html][Juncture]], original story about all sorts of time travel tropes by [[/u/AHatfulOfBomb]] (currently on hiatus)
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9311012/1/Lighting-Up-the-Dark][Lighting Up the Dark]], Naruto fanfiction by [[/u/Velorien]]

I can go into more detail about what separates the Naruto/Harry Potter fanfictions on request. They all have their charms but differ quite a lot in theme and characterisation.

I've also probably forgotten a whole bunch of things. Apologies also if I got authors wrong or missed somebody who's active on this subreddit (I don't remember usernames for everyone who is, sadly).

There's also a lot of great one-shots on the subreddit, some in the challenge threads that get posted every two weeks.
