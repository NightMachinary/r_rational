The City of Angles & Floating Point, the Fable of the Dragon Tyrant, the Last Christmas, Friendship is Optimal, Worm, Pact, Twig, (I Don't Know Timmy, Being God is a Big Responsibility [the parenthesis are because the title has a comma in it]), Ra, Fine Structure, the Cambist and Lord Iron, The Witching Hour, Blindsight, Fleep, Dungeon Keeper Ami, Goldmage.... Those are just the stories that I have read and that are free online, as that was what I assumed you were going for. There are plenty of others, especially if you are not going for that. The Martian comes to mind. edit: I know there are other stories that I had not listed. I listed these because I was listing the ones that were actually on goodreads. And even though they were on goodreads, most were not on the list. edit: I was confused about how goodreads worked. I thought the person who created the lists added books to them. Sorry, my mistake.
