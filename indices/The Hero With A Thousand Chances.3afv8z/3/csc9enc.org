My issue with this matches Psy-Kosh's - unless there's some reason that summoning a hero is something they can only do once per cycle, or the failure of the hero immediately destroys the world, there should be more worlds where they remember heroes failing and new heroes having to be summoned than ones where the hero always succeeds.
