I really wish you guys would either:

a) Stop calling all statistics "Bayesian." They're not. The stats in the story are Frequentist, not Bayesian.

b) Stop obsessing over Bayesian statistics. It's weird. It's a methodology that mostly gets you the same results as frequentist approaches, just formatted differently. The differences in results occur in edge cases, and neither is clearly superior. You guys have some kind of "hipster statistics" movement going on.
