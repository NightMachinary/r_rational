I used to teach a psychology statistics class, part of which included a section on Bayesian statistics. Unless you're doing something really weird with the math, the differences are almost completely negligible. The main difference seems to be that frequentist approaches are old enough that there are standards for use (p-values are a common gripe for Bayesians), yet the only reason Bayesian stats don't have similar standards is that they're still relatively new.

And I work in Human Factors Psychology, so I'm not unfamiliar with computer-applied statistical modeling either. I'm... hesitant to agree with the idea that CS is special, as most machine learning algorithms I've used are based on a frequentist background.
