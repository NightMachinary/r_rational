The story sort of depends on ignorance of schizophrenia, and symptoms of psychosis and delusion. Hallucination and delusion are actually two distinct symptoms. Haldol (brand name of haloperidol) would immediately dismiss hallucinations (in this case, of the Devil), but not necessarily dismiss a delusion of being Jesus (unless maybe the dose was strong enough to put the patient to sleep.) A patient with a strong delusion of being Jesus, would probably return to this delusion, even if the Haldol temporarily straightened out his thinking. -my sources of information: My mentally ill ex-wife needed a Haldol injection on a few emergency ER occasions, and at the time I was working as a mental health worker, and dealing with my own mental health struggles. In my life I've actually been a lot closer to this situation than any of you normie motherfuckers. This scenario should have been stretched out over several episodes, where the Devil has a separate presentation or offer each time, and revisiting the "Mr. Anderson" scenario several times at different levels of convincing. Also, parallel situations where Jesus becomes violent towards the Devil, or behaves "self destructively", to give justification why as "Mr. Anderson", he would get sedated with Haldol.
