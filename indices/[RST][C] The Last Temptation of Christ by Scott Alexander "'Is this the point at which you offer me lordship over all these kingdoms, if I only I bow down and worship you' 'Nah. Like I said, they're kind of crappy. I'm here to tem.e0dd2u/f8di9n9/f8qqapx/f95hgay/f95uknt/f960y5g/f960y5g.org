I did Psych Stats in '91, before the web was widely used, so... basically I'm BSing. I thought this was pretty good attempt though. Convinced myself pretty quickly lol! Saw a biopic on Bayes recently, too, and how relatively unsung the Irish mathematician has been. So that's colored my thoughts. OK, "Stop with the Bayensian references everyone! You're doing it wrong!"
