nah it's not a weird obsession. "The medium is the message". Bayesian is key to computation, and we're communicating in hyperspace run on computers (PCs, servers and smartphones- they're all "bayesian computers") So on this platform we have a certain percentage of people who only know statistics through the lens of computer science. I myself dreaded the subject and at uni took "Statistics for Psychology", instead, which I still barely passed. So, if we were starting discussions in "meatspace", you'd be on target. As it is, all the technology from hardware, to browsers, and the rest of the internet infrastructure that comprises this web "discussion board", is built with Bayesian computing. Of course it's going to leak out in the content as well.
