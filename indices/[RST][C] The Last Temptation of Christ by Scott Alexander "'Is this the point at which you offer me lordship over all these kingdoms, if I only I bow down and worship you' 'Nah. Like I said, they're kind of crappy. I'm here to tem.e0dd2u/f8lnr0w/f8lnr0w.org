None of those 100,000 Jesi have any reason to believe that the real Jesus would be immune from this conundrum. So assuming all the Jesi are perfect Bayesian rationalists, they would all realize that the real Jesus still has to take that 1:99,999 gamble.

What matters to an individual Jesus's decision isn't "Which outcome has the best chance of being correct?", it's "What choice would the real Jesus make?"
