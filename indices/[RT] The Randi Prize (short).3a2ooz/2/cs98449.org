Having met Randi and seen a live Million Dollar Challenge, I believe your depiction of how he'd act during a test to be perfectly accurate, at least in the days when he still did them personally.

I also think that if he was a magical super villain, he'd probably act a lot like you imagined. Maybe you shouldn't answer the door for a few days, just in case.

If you'd like, I can try sending this a few people who might be able to get it to Randi directly. I think he might find it fun.
