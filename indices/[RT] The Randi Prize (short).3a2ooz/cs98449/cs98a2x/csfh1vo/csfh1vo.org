Status update:

The only person I've gotten in contact with is DJ Grothe, but I'm not really sure what the circumstances were regarding his being deposed and having Randi take over the Presidency last year. We're not exactly close so I don't know how to bring it up. I would ask Brian Dunning, but he's still unreachable.

That said, I'll save the link and if a good opportunity presents itself, I'll jump on it. :)
