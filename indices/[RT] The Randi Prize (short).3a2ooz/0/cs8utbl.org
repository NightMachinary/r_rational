Great story, loved it!

FYI, in case you're not aware, many people who have failed to collect this prize actually do claim that Randi himself is a psychic who has the ability to suppress other people's powers. For this reason, Randi has taken to not being present for the tests which are administered or even letting himself know the precise day/time they are happening, just so that people cannot make this claim :)
