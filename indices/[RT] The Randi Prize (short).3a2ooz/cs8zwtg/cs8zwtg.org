Hahah. Well at least Randi didn't murder him?

Many of my "superpowers!" fantasies involve the Randi prize. Except I usually like to keep my powers a secret, so many of my scenarios involve proving to Randi, personally, that my powers exist, and then encouraging him to just give me the million under the table, rather than have to publicly declare that he's been wrong all along and paranormal powers do exist... ah, the moral conundrums I've forced that poor man through in my fevered imaginings...
