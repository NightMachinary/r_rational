I remember reading a short story in which it is discovered that weak effects in scientific results (such as a barely statistically significant result in a study of psychic powers) actually diminish over repeated replication attempts /as a law of physics/, and even strong effects will gradually diminish over time, so that eventually even something like relativity will no longer be true.

Essentially, the universe will slowly become less scientifically describable... until, in a few hundred years, the diminishing effect itself diminishes, and the universe becomes sane again.
