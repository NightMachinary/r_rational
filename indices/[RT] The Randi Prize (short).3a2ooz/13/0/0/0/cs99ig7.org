There are [[/r/lesswrong]] and [[/r/lesswronglounge]], neither of which are terribly active. I think part of the success of this subreddit is owed to the fact that we put our focus on fiction, which is a more evergreen topic than the art of human rationality in general.

Of note, we will be starting up a Friday Off-Topic thread where you can link and discuss whatever you'd like with this community; the first test of that will be soon, and we'll see how that goes.
