The fact that we don't know if this interlude will ever be relevant again and that Grace was neither shown exploring any more but one of her powers nor having any interaction whatsoever with anyone else nor revealing any consequences to her or anyone elses life makes this chapter pretty weak. All of this makes it nigh impossible (for me at least) to become invested in Grace's story and makes me feel dissapointed at this update.

I think is was well written technically though. The issue is not that the substance is bad either, just that there is far too little of it, especially if this is supposed to be a one time only glimpse into the life of a character with no discernable effect on society.

Sorry for the negative feedback. I do enjoy your story in general even though most chapters fail to deliver a wham effect till now.
