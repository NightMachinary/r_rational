I liked the chapter, and not just because I'm an incorrigible fanboy. The change is prose style is neat, and it's got good development on how another superkid has been psychologically affected by their power and makes the most of it. Above all that, I can't remember the last time I was so engaged with a character in so few words. Here's hoping for more Grace in the future if the Indian Justice League doesn't bring about the clusterfuck before then.

New hypothesis: the powers are dualistic, each one comes with an opposite partner. Evidence: Simon sees into the future, Grace hears into the past; the new logo (which looks good btw). Confidence level: 30%.
