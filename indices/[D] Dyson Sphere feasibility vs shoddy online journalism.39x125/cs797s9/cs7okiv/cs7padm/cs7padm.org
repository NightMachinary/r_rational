  If it can pay for itself quickly, why would it take millennia to build?

Depends on the demand curve, how much of the energy goes to customers and how much gets ploughed back into production. New infrastructure is a customer, and if it's not paying as much as the paying customers, it's not going to get built.

You're falling into the supply side fallacy that's been screwing up the US economy since Reagan. I mean Walmart can afford to build a zillion more locations and staff them, but they won't, because they don't project demand. So cutting their taxes won't convince them to build more stores... they'll just bank the difference.
