Doesn't matter. As demand decreases, so does market value. The lower the market value the more you have available to invest. That makes it cheaper to create new units. So it isn't really possible for the demand to get close enough to zero to outweigh the cost of the energy needed to make new units.

The difference with Wal-marts is it costs roughly the same for each new store so new stores are unprofitable at some point when the market is saturated -- having excessive numbers of stores does not give you a resource to make a new store with.
