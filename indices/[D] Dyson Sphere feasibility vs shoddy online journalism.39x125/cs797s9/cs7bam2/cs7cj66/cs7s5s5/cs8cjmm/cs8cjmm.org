I agree with most of your comment, and would invite you to contribute to the wikibooks I have been working on:

- [[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Space_Transport_and_Engineering_Methods]]

- [[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Seed_Factories]]

Part of the reason they are hosted on that site is to make it easy to collaborate. I don't know everything. Some specific items:

  Right, my 50-year plan would involve starting with humans teleoperating all the robots

Actually, I want to start by colonizing Earth. 80% of the planet is oceans, deserts, and ice caps, and a significant part of the remainder is under-developed. Seed factories and automation can help a lot of people down here who need it. Also, for future space operations, you are going to need rocket factories and launch sites, and therefore a way to bootstrap those too.

By starting on Earth, you can develop the bootstrapping technology, and also practice remote operations in those difficult environments.

  , I'm figuring the first group of robots would only reproduce most of their mass, maybe 95%

I was part of a "Solar Power Satellite built from Lunar materials" study sponsored by the Space Studies Institute. We found that 98% of the satellite mass could be made from the Moon, with the remainder from Earth. That assumed a mature space manufacturing capability, which would be consistent with the scale of producing many large power satellites. The study was done around 1986, so it did not consider modern robotics and automation, and did not consider asteroid resources. Back then only [[http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/stats/][~ 100 Near Earth Asteroids were known]], vs 12,714 today. Statistically, the much larger population means more of them are in easy orbits. Also, ion/plasma electric propulsion was much less developed than today, and solar panels to power them were much less efficient. Since asteroid types have different compositions than the Moon, you have more opportunities to get what you need.

Early bootstrapping is a different situation than mature space industry. The question is how to get from one to the other. I assume you start with the easiest products: bulk radiation shielding for habitats, carbon and water from chondrite-type asteroids. That can be reformed to hydrocarbons & oxygen, which makes good high-thrust propellant for landing on the Moon. Water and oxygen are also needed for life support. Metallic-type asteroids can provide feed stock for any number of mechanical and pressure vessel parts. From this level you gradually increase the range of products and percentage manufactured locally.

  If you assume the operators stay on earth, the Moon has a relatively low delay time compared to Mercury (or a lot of NEAs), but it's still a half-second.

With modern video game technology, it's pretty easy to simulate time-delayed operations, and you could likely project a predictive overlay (augmented reality) over the current video. In other words, you can show a ghost image of your rover where it's going to be 1 second in the future, or whatever the operator reaction delay is. Operators in Lunar orbit or Lagrange points would have near real-time control, and these could be the same people who make maintenance trips to the surface when needed. An operator station in orbit is easier to spin up to 1 gee, and assuming they are also processing asteroid materials, or lunar materials flung into orbit, there is plenty of shielding mass available.
