  If something is truly new, then yes, go publish it somewhere and link back to it in the wikibook.

Not sure if it's truly new, but I couldn't find [[https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/User:Lsparrish/Research/Hypervelocity_Landing_Tracks][this idea]] anywhere else, so I've posted it to wikiversity. Feel free to tear it apart. :)

  If I remember right, it was mainly rare elements not found on the Moon, or difficult to make parts.

Maybe given the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KREEP][KREEP]] regions, we could extract these economically? Of course, early in the boostrapping it still makes sense that we'd want to remain focused on the heavy stuff like iron.

  Semiconductors are a poor candidate to make in space, not because of vacuum or clean room conditions, which are easy to make in space, but the very tight mechanical and thermal tolerances for the optics and masks.

I get what you are saying, but it seems like this is all essentially scale dependent. Self replicating/growing factory systems could let you get to pretty big scales in short period of time. Of course, that also lets you launch stuff from earth more easily, so maybe it doesn't have relevant economic advantages until you need more than earth based economies can comfortably produce.
