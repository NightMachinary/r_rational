  Not sure if it's truly new, but I couldn't find this idea anywhere else, so I've posted it to wikiversity. Feel free to tear it apart. :)

Off the top of my head, here are some related concepts. There may be others if I think harder:

- "Crashportation", landing on an airless body via friction, either with a runway, rail, or cloud of particles placed in your way.

- Loftstrom Loop (by Keith Lofstrom). A ribbon of steel segments which either fly a ballistic arc from the surface, or are in orbit. Vehicles accelerate by magnetic friction with the segments as they fly past.

- Magnetic friction is obviously not new, it dates back to experiments by Faraday.

  Maybe given the KREEP[2] regions, we could extract these economically?

Those regions are high in Potassium, Rare Earth Elements, and Phosphorous, hence the name. The rare elements are things like Fluorine, which is useful as a chemical reagent, and very rare on the Moon.

  Self replicating/growing factory systems could let you get to pretty big scales in short period of time.

This is true, but the world still only supports one Intel, and only three or four really big chip makers. The question is where is the crossover, given reasonably cheap launch from Earth (SpaceX with solved reusability), and the high value-to-mass ratio of electronics. You would have to use a lot of chips to save a few dollars per chip in launch cost to justify a space fab.

Don't forget that self-replicating factory systems are just as viable on Earth, and there is a bigger market down here. So you are not really competing with Intel as it is today, you are pitting your space replicating factories against Earth replicating factories.
