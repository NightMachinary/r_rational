  I consider self-replicating robots or factories to be a hard design problem. Seed factories include a human element where needed.

Right, my 50-year plan would involve starting with humans teleoperating all the robots and gradually improving the automation rate based on those experiences. I can't think of a reason it would be (much) harder than designing self-driving cars.

Also, I'm figuring the first group of robots would only reproduce most of their mass, maybe 95%, with the rest being 'vitamins' shipped up from earth. They would be based on asteroids and/or the moon, initially. If you assume the operators stay on earth, the Moon has a relatively low delay time compared to Mercury (or a lot of NEAs), but it's still a half-second. We could also arrange to do the complex manufacturing tasks in closer orbits where there's less time delay, by sending smaller chunks of matter from the Moon/NEA to rendezvous with LEO-MEO orbital stations. Even with a half-second delay, with a bit of practice you could probably walk around and do stuff.

We can also establish off-world colonies near the manufacturing (but far enough to be out of harm's way for high energy processes) as a solution to the time delay problem. This would be economic incentive for billions of people to leave the planet, even if short lived due to increasing automation (which the workers could acquire a partial ownership in).

This could start in the NEA mining stage, with fair-sized asteroids accumulating a population in caves/inflatable areas, using smaller centrifuges on the inside for day-to-day gravity (at least until we find a cure for zero-gee related health problems). As you famously noted [[http://yarchive.net/space/exotic/bubbleworld.html][a few decades ago]] this lets you build fantastically large habs. [[http://gravitationalballoon.blogspot.com/][This guy]] took the concept and ran with it, as you can design huge volumes for billions of people this way. For smaller populations, we probably don't actually need the habitats to be all that big (size of a warehouse or so is fine), so the gravitational pressure doesn't need to be huge, although the radiation shielding from living deep in the asteroid is nice.

I see the Mercury project starting on the ground with launchers and so on perhaps, but eventually it seems like the easiest way is to just focus a lot of light on Mercury until it starts spitting chunks of rock out at EV. Once you get it disassembled, it ends up an asteroid belt with about 100 times the mass of the the one we now have betwen Mars and Jupiter. The collectors themselves would remain in 0.3 AU in my version (no reason not to), possibly closer, and would be partly levitated by light pressure in order to allow their orbits to remain part of a synchronized semi-equatorial band (aligned with the equator but offset), which is far enough north or south to avoid blocking the earth. These would be managed using computers, either on-board or on control modules within a light-second, so any misalignment gets corrected quickly. Light pressure could be used to steer, in a manner similar to [[http://server-sky.com/ThinsatV4][this]], i.e. variable reflectivity towards the edge of the component.

The human settlements, along with most of the manufacturing operations, would mostly be in the artificial asteroid belt (which I'm terming the Manufacturing Belt), which would contain most of the mass of the disassembled Mercury. (These might be processed into uniform chunks as it is being disassembled.) The belt itself would be thin enough not to block a noticeable amount of light from the earth (a heck of a lot thinner than Mercury) so we don't need it to be offset like we do the collectors. I don't see the need for collectors to be very massive, mostly thin foil would be best, so we can control where they "orbit" for a fair range of latitudes. The poles would eventually get filled in with very light graphene based collectors (which might have [[http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22630235.400-spacecraft-built-from-graphene-could-run-on-nothing-but-sunlight.html][other properties]] besides light reflection that make this easier by a couple orders of magnitude).
