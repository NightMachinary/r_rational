Yeah, but if you read the Dvorsky article again he explains why a very short timeline is surprisingly reasonable. The bottom line is self replicating robots.

[[/u/danielravennest]] is currently writing a book on the most realistic short term path to making those in the very near future. My thinking is that we could probably use his approach to get started on an orbital factory array and bootstrap to a full self replicating system in a few decades.
