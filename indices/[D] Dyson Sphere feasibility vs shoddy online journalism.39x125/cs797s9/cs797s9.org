Even if it took 174 years, that's going to be a fraction of the time the project as a whole would take, and even that's not a good argument about its validity.

I would expect a classical Dyson sphere (a globe of independent habitats and manufactories orbiting the sun) to be the work of millennia... but it would pay for itself within a few production cycles because the process itself would produce valuable energy supplies, resources, and real-estate. Even if some part of the process took a long time to /complete/ that's almost irrelevant as an argument against it!

Edit: I remember the Forbes article as well, and it was so bad that it wasn't even wrong.
