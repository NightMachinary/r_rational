I picture the assembly process as launching thousands of tiled satellites designed to interlock, sending them up into GEO to begin with. Before that, mass will have been collected from elsewhere in the solar system, Mars, the asteroid belt, or Mercury, for examples, which will comprise the mass for the stream (and for the satellites, if launching the requisite material from Earth is too expensive). Whatever makes up the stream will be manufactured, then taken down to the satellites. Acquisition of resources to GEO and place of manufacture is absolutely tentative, of course. An intermediate form of alternate launch is entirely possible, even a counterbalanced space elevator.

Depending on the density of molecular oxygen, LEO with regards to the orbital ring would be anywhere from 200 km up. This would mean a circumference of at least 41,331 kilometers for the finished ring. The GEO that the satellites would initially start out at has a circumference of about 264,925 kilometers. Satellites would start out at GEO, receive the material for the mass stream, then lower their orbit in a controlled fashion, adding more momentum to the mass stream as it goes in order to remain aloft. At some point, possibly in the very beginning, they would have to connect to each other using guidewires, which would help stabilize descent and alignment, pass along information faster and more reliably than radio, and transfer power to satellites on the dark side of Earth (unless there were another mechanism, such as redirecting sunlight via laser from your Dyson swarm off reflecting satellites at Earth-Sun L4/L5 and L2, or perhaps a better battery).

Take, for example, a tiling design of 80,000 satellites, each half a kilometer long. To equalize the torque on satellites as they direct the mass stream (I'm not sure if this is actually a problem...), four streams would be necessary, though my intuition tells me that this would also quarter the required velocity for the stream, which is good. The satellites would originally be around 3.3 kilometers apart, which I'm pretty sure is doable to receive, aim, and redirect in the space of half a kilometer. They lower to LEO, interlock, and then further construction and refinement can be done on the ring in orbit to add things like pressurized oxygen, transportation, storage, housing, and of course the orbital transfer system. Elevators can be hung from the ring as soon as the momentum transfer is continuous enough to stably support them. Et voila.

I am incredibly unsure about your statement that this would be easier to make than a space elevator. All we need for a space elevator is a few more breakthroughs in materials science, launch a satellite with the elevator inside, and unwrap it at the counterweight point. Skyhook touches ground, tie the anchor, there you go.
