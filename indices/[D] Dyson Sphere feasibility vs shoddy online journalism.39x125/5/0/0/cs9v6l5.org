  the disruption of other people's businesses/stuff and the required paperwork to be allowed to do that. Those might not be total show stoppers, but worth accounting for. If you can buy land/rights in a ring around the world, this wouldn't be impossible to do

I very much doubt that any single private endeavor will suffice to build an orbital ring. The security and military risks alone... This is the kind of thing that would take a coalition of nations acting in coordination with a number of multinationals.

I do not understand your proposed mechanism for making a single track mass stream work. Are you saying this is on the ground? That's just a mass driver, and the issue is the massive loss of energy from air resistance, especially if the barrel isn't vacated, which would then kill people from the deceleration of hitting atmosphere. Mass drivers are really only suitable for freight, and using a noncontinuous mass stream is basically dumping enormous amounts of energy into accelerating the ballast, which simply makes no sense. The point of an orbital ring is that you have a railgun in LEO where atmosphere won't interfere, and that's why the energy cost for accelerating the mass stream is acceptable; it keeps it in orbit /and as a plus/ can be used for orbital transfers. Space elevators are estimated to be much more cost-effective, requiring $220/kg to GEO, while mass drivers are more like $500/kg to LEO. Consider an elevator to LEO, where a Lofstrom Loop or orbital ring is waiting, and you're probably along the lines of a fourth to a fifth of the cost of a mass driver.

As for why the costs of launch are important, well... Consider the fact that one million humans weighs about 80.7 million kilograms, and you have a cost of $40.350bn for a 1 in 73000 chance for you to ever reach low earth orbit on a mass driver. And that's with /today's/ population.
