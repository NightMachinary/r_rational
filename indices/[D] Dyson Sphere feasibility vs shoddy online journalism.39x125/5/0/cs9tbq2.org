  In conjunction with a Dyson sphere

Precursor to, perhaps. The issue of launch cost from earth fades away the more space manufacturing exists because (at the stupid limit) you can just land giant tanks of hydrogen. Also from what I've heard the energy cost isn't that much to begin with, the primary cost is that of launch vehicles (in which case landing steel asteroids or making self replicating machine shops is a cure for that, as are reusable vehicles).

One incarnation of this idea that probably deserves attention due to the sheer level of engineering detail is the [[http://launchloop.com/][Launch Loop]]. A fringe benefit of being a fellow cryonicist living in the same area of the US is that I've met [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Lofstrom][the author]] at various meetups. His other big idea, [[http://server-sky.com/][Server Sky]] might be more significant, especially in the Dyson Sphere context, since it involves using smart lightweight satellites that maintain a programmed formation with light pressure instead of orbiting in the traditional manner. If we had sats that thin at 0.3 AU, only a very small fraction of Mercury would be needed to fill out the sphere.

  Instead, launch payloads would be able to piggyback off the momentum of the mass stream and reach transfer orbit with very little energy requirements

Technically, I think the idea could work, but it runs up against some of the same problems [[/u/ArgentStonecutter]] mentioned with regards to the disruption of other people's businesses/stuff and the required paperwork to be allowed to do that. Those might not be total show stoppers, but worth accounting for. If you can buy land/rights in a ring around the world, this wouldn't be impossible to do (it amounts to producing a vacuum tube and wrapping it around the world, then running a train through it at orbital velocity).

I would consider ways to scale the concept down. The US is about 4000km in diameter, and some states such as Texas are over 1000km wide. So for example, suppose you have a pair of linear tracks 100km long (just about any state in the US could do this) and set it up to elecromagnetically transfer momentum energy back and forth between two trains running in parallel. (A possible way to get it down to one track would be to have pistons on either end that couple with the ballast magnetically at the last second and compress a pressurized volume of hydrogen gas like a spring.)

Being nothing more than long chunks of steel ballast, they could handle extreme accelerations, so the bouncing at the ends could happen at thousands of gees. The passenger train (itself in an evacuated tube, and lighter than the ballast) would electromagnetically couple with the ballast train to acquire momentum at a lower rate. So you can [[http://keisan.casio.com/exec/system/1224835316][calculate]] with a 50 gee or 500 m/s^{2} acceleration along 100 km over 20 seconds. If you want one that can get humans to orbital velocity, plug in 135 seconds and 60 m/s^{2} for acceleration for a ~546 km track.

There's also [[https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Space_Transport_and_Engineering_Methods/Guns_and_Accelerators][lots of other ways]] that could work. Note that even a modest boost can be combined with a rocket to drastically improve its fuel efficiency, since velocity is a square WRT energy.
