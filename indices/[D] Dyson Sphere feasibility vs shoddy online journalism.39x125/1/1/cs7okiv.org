If it can pay for itself quickly, why would it take millennia to build? I figure it's an exponential growth thing. Once you've got the technology you need, you send a satellite to orbit the sun, beam the energy to a receiver on Mercury, use the energy to build more satellites, and the next thing you know there's so many satellites that the new ones don't get much sunlight and now you've hit peak solar and if you want more energy you'll have to look elsewhere.

And now I want to write a story about someone about to finish a Dyson sphere and there's tons of worries about hitting peak solar and losing a bunch of jobs etc.
