  Walmart can afford to build a zillion more locations and staff them, but they won't, because they don't project demand.

IMO this is a false analogy with regards to raw resources. There's no particular finite limit to the demand for computing power, usable work energy, scientific research equipment, or travel velocity -- if you produce more of these things, you just get stuff done faster or on a bigger scale. It's not quite like putting up more Wal-Marts to compete with each other over a fixed population's buying preferences.

The demand at the margin should always tend to exceed supply, because these things create their own demand. It's more like internet bandwidth -- it sounds like you are talking about how we're going to run out of text files to send each other, without anticipating that more bandwidth is going to create more bandwidth-heavy uses, like youtube, netflix, etc.
