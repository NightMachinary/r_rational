You're saying it depends on the demand curve. But the demand curve would have to taper to essentially zero for this not to be profitable, given the rapid EROEI. Which I find pretty implausible, unless you unlock a more potent energy source that works anywhere you want (say direct matter-energy conversion). In that case, there's no real reason to have a Dyson Sphere even after thousands of years, other than as an accidental effect of people clustering together to avoid speed of light delays.
