You're right. However, if you do write this, think very hard about the math and the sheer scale of the thing. The "peak solar" aspect would only affect construction jobs, as the solar energy itself (the thing that most closely resembles oil) continues to flow (faster than ever, from the economic perspective) at the end of the project, which means the economy can still grow. You'd be transitioning from exponential growth to stable or diminishing growth. If you had a doubling time of 1 year, the whole project would be a mere 50 years or so, so the cultural aspects might be affected by that. A longer doubling time would give more time for it to become culturally entrenched though.
