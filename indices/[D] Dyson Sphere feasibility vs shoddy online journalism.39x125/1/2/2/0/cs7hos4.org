  If the goal is "building a Dyson sphere", perhaps. But that's never the goal, like the goal in the settlement of Long Island wasn't creating a bunch of skyscrapers.

Why? Because nobody has a use for a solar system scale computer / telescope / laboratory / interstellar probe launcher in the next 100 years?

  If you do have a bunch of self-replicating robots building a Dyson sphere in minimal time, that's going to mean the robots are the agency behind it, and they've gone Borg on us.

Pretty sure that doesn't logically follow, it's a generalization of just one possible situation (independent AGI with agency). If we design a bunch of self-replicating robots and tell them to build and maintain a dyson sphere, we don't have to assign them any agency or higher reasoning capacity whatsoever. The components can be created and kept in place with mechanisms not much more complicated than self-driving cars (narrow AI).
