Nobody will come at you for the first satellite, since nobody will be able to see it. By the time it becomes a problem, they'll accept something like shining lasers as a solution. Also, there's a good chance that it will be the government who does this, which makes them pretty much immune to lawyers. It's like how they can build subways without buying the rights to going under everyone's houses.

Either you have more resources than you can use, in which case you might as well build a Dyson sphere, or you don't, in which case you'll need a Dyson sphere. You might not build it as fast as possible, but if you're going to need the energy, you'll have to build it fast enough to keep up with demand.
