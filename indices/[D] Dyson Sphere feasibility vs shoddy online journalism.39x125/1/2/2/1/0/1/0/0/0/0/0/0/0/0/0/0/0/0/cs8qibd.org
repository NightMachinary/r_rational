It's not an all-or-nothing thing. You start with a satellite, then you build another. You may or may not stop at some point. If you don't, you end up with a Dyson sphere. Maybe there will be too many people complaining that I'm replacing natural sunlight with artificial cancer-causing lasers and I'll have to stop. But it's not going to be the first satellite.
