(I know Argent from another forum, by the way)

I don't know if my approach is the "most realistic", but I consider self-replicating robots or factories to be a hard design problem. Seed factories include a human element where needed. That can be hands-on work, or via remote control. They also allow for importing rare elements or hard to make parts, when that makes more sense.

The way to think about large scale projects is their "doubling time". How long does it take to double your industrial capacity? Something, among raw materials, production processes, and energy supply, will be the rate-limiting item. Without a design, I can't tell you where the choke points will be, but I'm fairly certain there will be one or more such.
