Well, honestly, I figure the real limiter on the growth of a swarm would simply be "On the margin, people would rather stay in the already existing swarm bits where there are lots of people rather than have even more energy available for personal use in a thinly peopled one". Doesn't matter how fast you /could/ build it if you don't have any use for it. Heck, by square km, I'd be unsurprised if most of a growing swarm was "Nature" preserves and similar artworks.
