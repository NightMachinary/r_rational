See, it's really a matter of demand, which is more a function of imagination, not "minimum humans absolutely need to survive and be comfortable". If you can't think of a use for it, then yeah you won't end up building it. But it's not that hard. Nature preserves are one obvious thing, but there's lots more.

Say you want to build a solar system sized telescope to scan the heavens in detail and download alien life forms from distant planets. More speculatively, resolve the dust particles 100 light-years away down to the plank length and compute your way back to a historical snapshot of the earth 200 years ago (including the brain states of all persons living at the time).

Or say you want to figure out how to make high grade femtotech using experimental data from high energy particle interactions and exotic matter. We spend billions on stuff like the LHC right now using earth's resources, but if you build the Dyson sphere first you can build a billion LHCs for a dollar.
