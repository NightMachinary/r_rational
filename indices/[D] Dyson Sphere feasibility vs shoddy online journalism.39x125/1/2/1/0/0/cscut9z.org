Not talking about minimums. Talking about diminishing returns, and the relative scales. Solar output is 3.8 x10 to the 26th power. Assume every single individual in a 12 billion population can think of a use for an average of a gigawatt of power each, continuously and the conversion efficiency is typically 30 some percent.

The installation required to harvest that would be collecting one part in a hundred million of the output of the sun.

And there are downsides to making the swarm bigger - the bigger it is, the further you are going to have to travel to interact with other people, which is most of what the economy, and the interesting parts of life consists of, which is why I'd expect the swarm to /not/ grow all that quickly. Heck, just communicating with others slows down the bigger the swarm gets, due to light-speed lag. Any and all possible uses you can think of can be met by an incomplete swarm. Biospheres to go camping in? Sure, biomes the size of earth with an average population of "5000 campers and some grad students" are invisible gnats in this context.

The only exception I can think of is the Nicoll-Dyson laser, and actually building one of those is sure and certain sure to draw hostile attention if there is anyone else in the lightcone.
