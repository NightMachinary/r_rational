  Are you saying this is on the ground?

Yes, I was thinking of an evacuated tube with a ring-shaped train of ballast inside. It could be propelled mechanically, but regular train wheels would introduce too much friction. Instead, it could float on a thin hydrogen or helium atmosphere until it gets up to speed. These have less friction capacity than regular air. Momentum could be imparted very slowly compared to a mass driver. When it reaches and begins to exceed orbital velocity, the entire ring would start to levitate and stretch outwards (at this point the top part of the tube would need to be insulated from the train instead of the bottom part; again, a thin layer of hydrogen or helium would work for that).

The main aspect of air resistance is the shock wave created in front, which creates a deceleration effect that depends on the mass of the body relative to the surface area of the nose. So rapid deceleration is not a necessary consequence as soon as you exit the evacuated tube, unless you have a very small vehicle. We are talking about a passenger train with substantial length, so it should be pretty massive compared to the nose area.

An orbital ring that starts out already orbiting is again technically possible, but you'd need to have very advanced industrial capacity in space already to do it. If you did, you'd have cheap rockets already. Landing giant tanks of hydrogen is one way to do this, but obviously we'd be more likely to do something else. A space elevator to LEO altitude is possible, provided you are willing to expend a certain amount of fuel on keeping it up.

With regards to the shorter option I described, the noncontinuous stream would be dumping energy from one high-velocity chunk of ballast to another, not losing it. It's more like a battery. The hydrogen gas spring variant would be temporarily turning it into gas pressure and heat, so it would have a certain amount of losses depending on the size and insulation factor of the gas containment vessel (which could be an underground cavern, say).

With regards to the cost, you're conflating dollars with non-dollars. Any estimates you are quoting are factoring in some particular cost as measured in dollars per joule. If you suddenly end up in a world where you can get a million times as many joules per dollar, it's suddenly a millionth of the previous cost. Not to say relative efficiency doesn't matter, but the real bottlenecks are almost certainly organizational or political rather than raw energy collection. My point was that your orbital ring seems like it takes not only a pretty significant investment in joules and industrial organizational power to put together relative to other options (perhaps it's extremely energy efficient for launch purposes once you get it going), you additionally run the risk of any one of the countries it passes over failing to cooperate. A smaller system (say one that fits in a single US state) can be done with a much lower number of parties deciding to cooperate.

Edit to add: Now that we've established that this would be built in space to begin with, it might be a lot easier to do the project in space (thousands of sections ready to assemble in LEO) and deliver it as a package deal to world leaders than it would be to build such a thing on the ground. There's not much the countries underneath can do against it unless they decide to shoot missiles or something, and it doesn't interfere with life on the ground. And you're obviously right that it's a lot easier to make than a traditionally conceived space elevator.
