In conjunction with a Dyson sphere, something to both use the energy (and a portion of the materials gained from the energy) and bootstrap cheap LEO would be to construct an orbital ring suspended via mass stream. You could hang down space elevators/skyhooks without the ridiculous length required to get a counterbalance, and people wouldn't be stuck slowly being lifted outside the Van Allen belt to be exposed to radiation. Instead, launch payloads would be able to piggyback off the momentum of the mass stream and reach transfer orbit with very little energy requirements.
