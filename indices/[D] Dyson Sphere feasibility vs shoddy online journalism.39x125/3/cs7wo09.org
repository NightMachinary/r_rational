The Dyson Sphere (swarm) is barely conceivable, but I really wish we would concentrate on the more plausible next step in space.

If we can get a permanent colony on the Moon, that would be a good start to a real presence in space. A Moon colony would help us answer a lot of very important questions about human habitation in low gravity, and large-scale long-term closed environments.

The Dyson Sphere concept just seems like pie in the sky when we don't even have one permanent colony on any other planetary or moon body.
