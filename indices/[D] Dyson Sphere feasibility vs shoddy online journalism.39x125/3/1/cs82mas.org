  really wish we would concentrate on the more plausible next step in space.

Actually I think it is likely that we can develop the resources of near-earth space entirely robotically. The only reason (other than simple curiosity/tourism) to put people in habitats is to minimize speed of light based communications delays to their work site. (Given how close the Moon is, that's really only going to matter in a critical way when we get near the Mercury-is-toast stage, and that's /only/ assuming we aren't already at the AI-is-easy stage by the time we get there.)

  A Moon colony would help us answer a lot of very important questions about human habitation in low gravity, and large-scale long-term closed environments.

Very important to /what/, exactly? A pipe dream Mars mission that does basically nothing for us besides yet more tourism? Many of the problems we're supposedly solving/learning about are just the result of insufficient equipment/energy/resources to throw at the problem. Insufficient industry, in other words. When you have a developed industry in space (where you don't need to punch through a huge atmosphere out of a huge gravity well to get from one place to another), you just build what you want. If low-gee is a problem, you make a full-gee centrifuge. If the closed environment is a problem, you make a bigger habitat. It's so much simpler.
