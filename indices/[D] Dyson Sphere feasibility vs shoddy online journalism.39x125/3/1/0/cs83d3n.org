Robotic exploitation of the moon is fine too. In fact, robotic exploitation before human habitation is probably a given. Robots to dig the first few habitats before the colonists arrive. Robots to mine, process, and stockpile the raw materials.

Perhaps I'm just old fashioned, but I have absolutely zero urge to live in a fully-artificial constructed habitat in space, under artificial gravity.

Mars could, potentially, be terraformed and even survivable to humans without suits. Sure, I won't see it in my lifetime, but I can't imagine there won't be people who want a real planet under their feet, even after real estate on Earth gets to be in rather short supply.

Manned missions or even colonization of Mars in the long run isn't a pipe dream. It is, however, ridiculous to consider it before we have a permanent human presence on the Moon.
