I don't think a Dyson swarm is something you set out to build. At some point, sending solar panels to the sun becomes a cost-effective energy source. When you run out of places to put them, you now have a Dyson swarm. There's no particular advantage to building a complete one. In fact, the energy per satellite starts going down once you get enough for them to occlude each other.

I guess it would be useful to have a full one for Nicoll-Dyson lasers. And those things are probably pretty important for near light-speed travel. Rockets get exponentially more expensive as delta-v increases, but radiation pressure just gets more efficient.
