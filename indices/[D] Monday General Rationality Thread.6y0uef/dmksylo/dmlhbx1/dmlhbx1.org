It's really nice to be able to write out a bunch of pretentious, semi-academic stuff and not have anyone go all Reviewer 2 on it. Especially because when you do go /full/ academic on it - totally documenting everything, sourcing all the claims, using field-specific precise jargon - it becomes unreadable and nobody engages.

I'm not sure how to solve this.
