I have created a probability wrapper object for sympy.

You can use it to do things like =p(0.9)+p("1/3")=. Which will produce 0.9333 or =4203359652212463/4503599627370496=, depending on what you're using it for. No floating point errors here. It's a simple little thing, but pretty handy.

I would love to at some point be able to automatically produce graphs like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_in_the_United_States#/media/File:LLNLUSEnergy2012.png][this]]. But that's a long ways off.
