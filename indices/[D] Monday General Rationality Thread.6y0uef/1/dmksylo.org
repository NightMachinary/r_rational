Question: I often see a lot of rationalists blogging on Tumblr, which based on initial impressions doesn't seem like the best place to write long, involved posts or to have long, involved conversations. Both of these things are so typical for rationalists to engage in that describing them as "typical" borders on /understatement/, and yet for some reason there are a surprising number of rationalists on Tumblr. /I notice that I am confused/; could someone tell me what's going on here?
