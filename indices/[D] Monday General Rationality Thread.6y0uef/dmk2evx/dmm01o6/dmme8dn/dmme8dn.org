First I want to say that I think every point you make is pretty valid, but I am curious about the distinction of rational and rational-lite.

I am going to start with your second bullet-point, as your first is a very general statement, that before tackling it might be beneficial to look at the others first.

2nd bullet-point - Characters having abnormal abilities doesn't stop something from being rational. Look at HPMOR, they have magic. And it is considered the epitome of rational fiction, or at least the most popular example. I feel like what you maybe are saying is that the rules for human beings are not consistent, and a world without consistent rules has a very hard time being rational?

3rd bullet-point - This is where I would say this story is rational-lite. The smartest possible decisions are, probably, not being made, and I would agree a lot of the processes are either accelerated or benefit from good luck (although good luck, I would say does not equal non-rational). I, personally, feel like a lot of the rewards take work. Now, it isn't necessarily work that has its own consequences, but it is also true that they've provided working have to happen for any reward. Nothing, so far, has just been given for free, except maybe the lighting storm. But then I have to ask, how long do you have to wait for the lighting storm for it to feel "right" to you?

I think a lot of the saving grace, in terms of rational-lite-ness, for this show comes from Senkuu being a level 1 or 2 player to Tsukasa's level 0 or 1, the fact that Senkuu makes the mistake of assuming the North Star is correct without factoring in the possible straying of its path after 3700 years, and that Chrome, despite not being as knowledgeable is treated as a valuable by Senkuu. These are all characteristics I see as pertaining to rational-lite.

Now, all of this is under the umbrella of the Shounen-ish genre, so it either suffers or benefits (depending on your perspective) from that. I think this is why, as you said, there is disproportionate strength or fighting ability, 2 dimensional characters (although we've seen some of that cleared up, I'd argue. Its just that there is not a ton of character development as the plot moves forward [Also i am not sure that 2 dimensional characters precludes from rational fiction, just probably good fiction])

Again, the purpose of this post is to enter into discussion, not necessarily to "win" the argument. I am just curious, because my take on Dr. Stone is pretty different than yours, and I also seem to have a pretty different idea of what removes the label of "rational" to a piece of fiction than you do.

Best, ian
