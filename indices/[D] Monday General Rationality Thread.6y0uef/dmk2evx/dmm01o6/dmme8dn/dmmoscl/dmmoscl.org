You raise some good points as well, and I may need to reexamine my view in light of your arguments.

However, as my first-thought response, I guess it would be more helpful to take the subreddit's rationalfic criteria, and examine them point by point?

#+begin_quote
  Nothing happens solely because 'the plot requires it'. If characters do (or don't do) something, there must be a plausible reason.
#+end_quote

I think this one is borderline for Dr Stone. Like I mentioned, a lot of rather unlikely situations (encountering a villager with a ton of rare and important minerals, a lightning storm occurring right when Senkuu is attempting to recreate electricity, etc.) basically happen just because the plot requires it. On the other hand, the characters do generally act based on plausible (or semi-plausible) motivations.

#+begin_quote
  Any factions are defined and driven into conflict by their beliefs and values, not just by being "good" or "evil".
#+end_quote

Dr Stone does a fairly good job of this - even the "evil" Tsukasa has a worldview that's realistic and understandable, even if its not relatable.

#+begin_quote
  The characters solve problems through the intelligent application of their knowledge and resources.
#+end_quote

Dr Stone /mostly/ does a good job of this (at least, Senkuu does). And like you said, the series even takes it to the next level, where characters fail to take certain scientific details into account (like the shift in North Star trajectory) in a realistic fashion, and later adjust their calculations/decisions based on those realizations.

#+begin_quote
  The fictional world has consistent rules, and sticks to them.
#+end_quote

I think this is my biggest contention with a "rational" label, and maybe where you and I disagree the most. I agree that supernatural abilities don't discount a story from being rational, but in this case, Dr Stone is pretty clearly suppose to occur in a future version of our world, with its main characters coming specifically from our world and time. IMO it's inconsistent to be so based in our world from a scientistic perspective, while having characters with unexplained supernatural strength, reflexes, or fighting ability.

--------------

All that said, maybe it's a bit pedantic of me to argue whether the series is rational (or rational-lite), when there are clearly enough elements to interest rationalfic fans regardless? I just know that the label generally gets thrown around a lot, which can detract from the meaning of the category.
