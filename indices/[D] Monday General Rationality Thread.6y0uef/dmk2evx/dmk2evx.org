Hello!

I read this recently: [[http://www.mangareader.net/dr-stone/1]] It is not yet done, but I would characterize it as "rational light"? It describes itself as sci-fi survival, but it is very much the aesthetic of a manga.

Interested in any strong reactions, although I am not sure there will be.
