Ok. Mmm, back of the book type synopsis:

Everyone gets turned to stone. Instead of following the adventures of the comedic, physically strong, sorta simple, and lovable guy who wakes up and has a romance going on, you follow the science kid who wants to save humanity by re-inventing modern technology as fast as possible.
