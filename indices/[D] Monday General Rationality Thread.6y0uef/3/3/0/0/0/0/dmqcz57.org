But the argument you're making is against having ran the "experiment" in this form in the first place - ie, that our existence is a net negative. I disagree. And even if that were the case, any worthy ML researcher would run a random hyperparameter search that necessarily includes degenerate cases to varying degrees by chance, and terminating one experiment when you discover it lead to suffering doesn't change the fact that it did. That's the deal with simulations of irreducible complexity.
