Lemme put it this way: tomorrow, you meet the god of evolution. He explains that he was trying to make you come out a certain way, and oh well, he guesses you're good enough now.

It slowly dawns on you that in actual fact, every single bit of human suffering ever is because of /this asshole/.

What do you do to him? Well, obvious: kill the bastard and possibly kill his entire world with him, douchebags.

Worse, if you're then trying to use genetic programming to create /really powerful/ AIs, the take-over-the-world kind, they'll trample all over you without a fucking thought, because you didn't program them /not/ to.

Again, after all, you've been torturing their ancestors and species since the beginning of time, from their perspective.
