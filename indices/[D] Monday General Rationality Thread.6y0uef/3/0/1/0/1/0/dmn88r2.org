That's basically the plot of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerando][/Accelerando/]]. Are they trying to create Vile Offspring?

Okay, the idea of distributing access to increasingly-powerful AIs evenly among humans has some merit, if we assume soft-takeoff scenario and perfect surveillance (neither of these assumptions should actually be made, but fine). But combining that idea with artificial evolution? It's like they're specifically trying to find the worst possible way to deal with AGI. It's not even funny anymore, it's just sad.
