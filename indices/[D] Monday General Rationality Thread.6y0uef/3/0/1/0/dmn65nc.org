Business as usual, then.

Yep, it's far worse if I view it with the author's supposed position in mind. Especially that line about turning AI safety into an empirical problem instead of mathematical. As if it's a good thing.

... I'm still not convinced that it's an accurate representation of the company's views, though. Yes, yes, their stated mission doesn't sound paranoid enough, but that's a far cry from this level of incompetence. Karpathy doesn't even work at OpenAI anymore, according to [[http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/][this]] page.

  [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI][Musk acknowledges that "there is always some risk that in actually trying to advance (friendly) AI we may create the thing we are concerned about"; nonetheless, the best defense is "to empower as many people as possible to have AI. If everyone has AI powers, then there's not any one person or a small set of individuals who can have AI superpower."]]
