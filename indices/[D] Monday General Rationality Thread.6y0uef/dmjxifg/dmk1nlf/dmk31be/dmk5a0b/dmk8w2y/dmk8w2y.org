[[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Z5LlgZ2y1Yr_u-f8iCK4RMZQBSGaA3uwMJxdQgfs3io/edit?usp=sharing][It's done:]] I've ran the query. Entertainingly enough, I at first misunderstood your "I don't have time to get running again" comment, thinking it meant that the query would be running for several days (it was over in seconds).

Interesting facts: first 100 users are now responsible for 57% of posts, but only 15% of upvotes. It counted 3455 users in all, 1700 more than at the time of your query.

(Working with Google Docs has been surprisingly unpleasant; its behaviour regarding Russian/English decimal marks is downright infuriating.)

Yes, I know the stories. Sadly, reddit isn't really good at making such history available.
