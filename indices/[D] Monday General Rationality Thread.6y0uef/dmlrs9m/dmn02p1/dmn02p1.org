I don't think it's this bad? I mean, the artificial evolution idea is omnicidally suicidal yes, but the rest is tame enough, even if generic. The author also doesn't seem to say that this is how AGI should be done, merely how it /could/ theoretically be done. The MMORPG thing is explicitly mentioned as a crazy idea/example of something unexpected.

I do disagree with the "order of promisingness" as presented, but it's nothing offensive. Did I miss something? I only skimmed it. I may lack some context regarding this OpenAI company.

... Or, wait a moment. Is that an AI research company's official stance on the problem? Iff yes, I retract my objections, and also, we are all going to die.
