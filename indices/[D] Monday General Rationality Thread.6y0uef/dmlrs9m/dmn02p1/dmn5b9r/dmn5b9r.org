Yes the other parts are tame , but the ommicidal idea is the one they seem to be most interested in, and having the artificial evolution in the presentation makes me suspect that the things that seem tame are actually worse than I initialy though , but I can't say for sure without hearing the actual talk that the presentation was made for. Regarding the context I dont know how oficial this is . And yes I probably was exaggerating a bit , the mmo part is probably just for saying something people are familiar whith and will understand even if they didn't understand the rest of the talk, I dont know who the audience is supposed to be.

/U/eaturbrainz, where did you found this , is it actually the official stance of open ai , or just some talk by someone related to them that doent necesarily reflect the wiews of the other open ai people?.
