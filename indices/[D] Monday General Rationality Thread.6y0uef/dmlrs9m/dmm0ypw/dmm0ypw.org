Statistically speaking, we're all doomed.

The incentives for creating an AGI are too high. Fame. Money. Power. Immortality. Security against other unfriendly AGIs. Every moment you wait is another moment someone is dying when they could be saved by an AGI.

Which means what we have here is a race. A race to see who makes the first AGI. A race where some people, terrified of unfriendly AGIs, will take it slow, carefully checking and rechecking code to make sure their AGIs are safe... and where other people, filled with greed/pride/confidence/altruism(?), will be rushing their code, abandoning safety measures, just doing whatever gets them done fastest. Who do you think will win this race? The odds favor the reckless here, and then in their recklessness, the AGI they unleash will probably be an unfriendly one that kills us all. Or worse, keeps us alive to torture for all eternity.
