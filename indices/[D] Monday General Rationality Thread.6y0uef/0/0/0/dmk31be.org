Interesting. How was this data gathered?

First 100 of users from this list appear to be responsible for 25732 comments and accumulating 71987 upvotes. The list covers 606 days, from January 2014 to September 2015, correct? My table covers 735 days, from September 2015 to September 2017, and lists 5407 upvotes and 19649 comments. Even taking into account the fact that my data only covers weekly threads, the first 100 really do seem responsible for relatively enormous amount of activity. =71987/113158=0.63= and =25732/40069=0.64=... They're responsible for 63% of upvotes and 64% of comments. Huh.

Sad news: My data and your data are virtually non-overlapping. Yours ends at September 2015, mine starts.

  I'd be interested to know how much of a change is due to individuals coming and going from within the community

I suppose this could be done relatively easily by going through the list of weekly threads and checking which of the first 100 users from this list commented there, but my programming skills won't be enough to do this efficiently.

*Edit:* Wait, no. Yours starts in 2009, but the activity only really begins in December 2013. Doesn't change the above much.
