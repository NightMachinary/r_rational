This was gathered from the BigQuery dataset, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3kjt60/d_friday_offtopic_thread/cuxyvle/][see this comment]]. I don't think that I have the actual query I used for this anymore, otherwise I would rerun it with updated data.

Edit: nevermind, it's [[https://www.reddit.com/r/bigquery/comments/3cej2b/17_billion_reddit_comments_loaded_on_bigquery/ct3za0t/][this query]], which I don't have time to get running again, but feel free to have at it.
