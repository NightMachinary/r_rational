Commenters are distributed along a power law, as you [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EwpYAPX9vzG-TyMDDO3tIYqEO21qsHcGvcVFS2EoA1M/edit?usp=sharing][can see here]] (though this data is old). I'd be interested to know how much of a change is due to individuals coming and going from within the community, or high-impact individuals having a lull in activity, since that seems likely to be a major driver in the change of numbers, and a very significant source of noise.
