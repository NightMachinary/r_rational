I absolutely love this series, but would certainly not classify it as rational.

** *MINOR DR STONE SPOILERS BELOW* **

- None of the characters besides Senkuu (and maybe Tsukasa) are particularly rational, and many are unrealistically two-dimensional (including Taiju, Yuzuriha, and many of the villagers).
- The characters are ostensibly "normal"/realistic, but many of the characters have superhuman abilities (e.g. Taiju's strength, Tsukasa's fighting ability)
- The problems are solved not through science, but through SCIENCE! That is, discoveries/inventions have disproportionately huge impacts, details in the creation process are discussed but glossed over or overly simplified, and rare materials or situations (like the recent lightning storm) often appear at the exact perfect time, deus ex machina style.

Again, I love Dr. Stone. But I think the series, like a lot of other fiction out there, should be enjoyed in spite of (or often /because/ of) it's irrationality; it's simply inaccurate to classify it as rational, or even "rational-lite".
