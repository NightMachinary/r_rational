  What is this city really comparatively good at, other than "cutting hard-to-cut things" and "having a short commute"?

Cooling. A series of micro-portals near something hot (like a CPU) allow it to have reasonably close contact with a far greater volume of cooled air than a non-portal-enhanced CPU; plus, some of those portals can come out in separate refrigerators, improving the cooling efficiency even further.

Also, unless there's a lightspeed delay between entering and exiting a portal, I suspect that if you really know what you're doing, you can either disprove Special Relativity or communicate acausally - though probably not very far into the past.

Delivering utilities (water, electricity, etc.) through portals allows people to avoid laying miles upon miles of cables and/or pipelines. They're probably colour-coded, as well, because you do NOT want to get the sewerage portal mixed with the water portal.
