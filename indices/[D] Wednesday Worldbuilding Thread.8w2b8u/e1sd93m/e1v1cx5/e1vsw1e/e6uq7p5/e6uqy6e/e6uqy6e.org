Yup, definitely. Set up a few tall low-pressure tubes which contain items that perpetually fall and build up velocity. Swap out the bottom portal to fire.

The other consideration I had in the last two months was that you don't want to the city to take up the entire sphere, you want it to be built just a bit (~1m) within it so that you can open up portals on the surface directly to the inside of the sphere for manufacturing efficiency.
