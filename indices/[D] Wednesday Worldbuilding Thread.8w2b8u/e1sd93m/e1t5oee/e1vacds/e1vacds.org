Riverworld! I think the only things I know about it are from the 2003 TV movie, which I would have watched in high school. Looking up the summary, I can see the similarities, which I'm not a huge fan of. Maybe I'll adjust it so that things are less nice.

I think that what I like about the idea is sort of "we have met the outside context problem, and it is us", where the world has to adapt to the surveillance possibilities of the Land of the Dead and the geopolitical reality of whatever nations exist there. It seems natural for a nation to want to be as "vertical" as possible, because lower layers present a serious security risk, as do higher layers.
