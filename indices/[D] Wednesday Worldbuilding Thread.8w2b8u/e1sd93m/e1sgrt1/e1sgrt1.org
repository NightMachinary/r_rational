Would there be any reason for people to stay alive in that case? It seems like there's no real disadvantages to dieing. Is it possible to have children if you're in the land of the dead? I'd imagine war might be a little less common because the resources are infinite /but/ getting them is a one-way ticket and it might not be as frowned upon to kill someone (more akin to exile then death). I'd think there would be little blocks of influence from each political entity, where based on their strength they have influence in layers a few back, and have influence on their layer+1.
