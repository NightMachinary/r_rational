Some random thoughts:

  If you're dead, you no longer have to breathe, eat, drink, or sleep.

You don't have to, but you can still do all of those things? Also, can people still have children in the land of the dead?

If the answer to both of those questions is yes, then I don't see why we wouldn't just abandon the land of the living all together and hang out in the Lands of the Dead forever.

As for the geopolitical landscape of the Lands of the Dead, iirc, the dead outnumber the living 14-ish to 1 in 2018 so if the story is set in the modern era the primary Land of the Dead will have significant overpopulation issues if people haven't buggered off to lower level Lands of the Dead yet.

That said, I can easily imagine a group of people with a minority culture or religion or whatever just agreeing to commit repeated mass suicide until they reach a Land of the Dead where everyone just leaves them the fuck alone (there are some interesting logistic issues here, but I think you can make that work).

If population growth is still a thing (and doesn't plateau off by virtue of everyone being immortal), there is the interesting question of who has to move to the next Land down when resources start to get depleted. I imagine this changes pretty drastically between different Lands, as the inhabitants of each Land are mostly going to consist of the the people that didn't get to stay in the Land one level up.
