one thing people have to deal with is all of humanity's worst villains, like Hitler. What does humanity do with them? Options are to imprison them (classically) or exile them to some Land of the Dead+N for some high N (but then you can't keep an eye on them). The latter might seem like a natural choice, given the setting, but it has some problems; they are basically free to communicate via Ouija board with the citizens of level N-1.

(Note that it doesn't seem to be possible to force someone to level N+2 if you're on level N if you don't have compatriots already on N+1.)

I guess another option is to launch someone you want to get rid of permanently is just to launch them into space. (Maybe this is the sort of option you might want to patch out.)

In each land, the people basically have to build up all technological infrastructure from scratch. This includes resource gathering, like mining and setting up the infrastructure to mine. And I=if you want computers, all hardware has to be re-constructed, all software has to be rewritten. If you're sending a team to colonize and prepare level N+1, the team needs to be made of explorers (I guess exploring is a bit easier, since you aren't in danger of physical harm) and experts on the tech-tree. (It helps, though, that they can squint into level N and read reference materials and such.)

While society will be able to optimize and produce an efficient build order, Land of the Dead level-0 tech will have evolved organically, much like the living world. Engineers will eventually rebuild the internet, etc. assuming politics allows. (Like, assuming Land-of-the-Dead isn't ruled by medieval kings who kill all heretics before they can accomplish anything, or something. But I don't think that's a stable equilibrium.) But the internet will probably look different and have less backwards-compatibility hacks because people will maybe know what they're doing from the beginning this time around?
