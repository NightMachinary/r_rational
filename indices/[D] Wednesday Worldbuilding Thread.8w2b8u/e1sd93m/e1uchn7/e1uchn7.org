*The Land of the Dead has better technology than the Land of the Living*

All the famous scientists and engineers who died ended up there, and quickly found themselves once more at the prime of their lives - able to continue researching interesting problems, and doing interesting things.

Some of them have found other pursuits; but enough are still interested in building up technology that the Land of the Dead has experienced continual technological growth from their work. This is /on top of/ the continual technological growth any time an engineer or scientist in the Land of the Living dies and brings the contents of his head with him. And this is before considering people like Ug the Caveman who, after several centuries of thought, managed to unify quantum physics with special relativity while Einstein was still in nappies.

It is believed that the technological curve rises up steeply as you move on down through Lands of the Dead; and there's a persistent rumour that someone several layers down managed to create an Unfriendly AI. However, no-one has any proof, or even knows on which layer this might have occurred - it might just be a rumour.

*Nostalgia is a powerful force*

People are used to the era in which they lived, and many prefer the aesthetics of their home era. Some try to recreate parts of their old lives in the Land of the Dead - there is, for example, a fairly close reproduction of the 1800's Buckingham Palace (and if you /dare/ try to install solar panels on it, then may God save you from Queen Victoria) inhabited by several generations of monarchy, who have formed a loose council and rule Dead England with firmness. (They're continually squabbling, until such time as someone suggests that maybe the Monarchs shouldn't be ruling England, at which point they all immediately suspend hostilities in order to Deal With the Impertinent Idiot).

Some people /certainly/ make the effort to recreate the social environment of their times; people dying in the greater southern Africa region either join the Great Empire of Shaka Zulu or get sent down several layers (yes, it is very much a multi-layer Empire).

(No-one quite knows what happened to Adolf Hitler, but there was a very large crowd of extremely angry Jews waiting for him when he died. Some think they tore him apart, some think they trampled him, some even suggest he managed to disguise himself as part of the crowd and slip away. If he's around, he's changed his name and probably moved to a new continent).

*Women get a poor deal*

For an amazing amount of history, women got a terribly bad deal. Many of these ancient sexist attitudes remain strong in the Land of the Dead. Racism, too, is alive and well and very strong.
