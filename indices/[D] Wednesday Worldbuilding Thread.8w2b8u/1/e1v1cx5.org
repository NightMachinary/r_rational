Let's build and exploit an exclusion zone!

Somewhere in Generic Medieval Fantasy Land there is a sphere of diameter 1 km within which it's pretty cheap (the equivalent of $30/square foot) to make a permanent two-way portal that allows travel from one region of the sphere to another. When created, portals are immediately adjacent, and must then be moved/translated/rotated to their final destination with a bit of effort. Portals cannot move through other portals. A portal can be freely toggled on and off a few times a second, and this can be used as an infinitely sharp cutting edge.

My mental model of how this goes is roughly "this is an area of vast potential economic productivity and it immediately spawns a heavily militarized walled city/manufacturing center to exploit it"

Some obvious points

- The exclusion zone gives you a fixed amount of volume to work wit, so you probably won't see many spectacular displays of open space represent huge wastes
- Portals let you break gravitational potential energy in half, so "build a waterwheel that generates arbitrary cheap power" is an obvious step, possibly using superdense fluids because of volume concerns (mercury is good for this, I think?).
- You can build deathtraps by packing a room with 1cm-spaced vertical portals that are noncontiguous - e.g. a fly who attempts to move from "the ground" to "the ceiling" will hit every intermediate point but not in ascending order. If a group of humans are in this room and the portals are deactivated, they probably do not survive their sudden non-contiguousness.
- You can tile the outside of the sphere in portals that let you redirect/ignore/no-sell incoming attacks
- You can do neat tricks with redirecting the force of an explosion in a single direction with an array of small portals surrounding the initial explosion.

Some less obvious points

- What is this city really comparatively good at, other than "cutting hard-to-cut things" and "having a short commute"?
- What does an efficient transportation network look like? I'm imagining a densely connected array of small hexagonal rooms, each of which has six portals to other hexagonal rooms or exits. There's some balancing to be done here between increasing max-flow and minimizing travel distance, but I've come up with a bitstring-based addressing system that gives approximately exponential number-of-reachable-places as a function of distance. Can we do better? Is this obviously wrong?
- What would being a civilian in this city look like?
