You can still eat and drink, if you'd like to, but there's no biological function, and no biological urge. You can't have children. (Most of the actual function of that is currently just waved away at the moment as being unimportant to what I find interesting.)

The biggest thing I'd think would stop people from the Land of the Living entering into the Land of the Dead would be the fact that you come in with nothing, and face a culture that's unlikely to be much like your own. If you asked a random sample of people if they'd like to immigrate somewhere foreign to them but with all their food, drink, and healthcare taken care of ... well, the people who said "yes" would probably be the least fortune.

All technology and infrastructure needs to be built up from scratch, but that's not so onerous as it might seem, because eliminating most of the strict needs and causes for death means that they don't /need/ as much infrastructure or technology, and the people have a lot more time to work on that sort of thing, because they're not spending their days collecting calories.
