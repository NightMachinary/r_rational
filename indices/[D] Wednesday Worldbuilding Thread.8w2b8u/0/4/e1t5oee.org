Reminds me of Riverworld.

I'd expect the population of humanity to spread out. Killing people to get rid of them is much less heinous, so the first few layers are likely controlled by groups of humans whose default behavior is to kill most people to prevent dilution of their preferred culture. Everybody you meet in the first few layers is likely to kill you on sight. The repercussions of that will likely be felt on every layer.

I can imagine alternating layers of ideologies. If you manage to purge all those who resist your political ideals on layer N (and remember, purging isn't all that evil anymore), well, N+1 is now their haven. Expect them to remember, expect them to send your adherents unlucky enough to die to the layer after theirs, and expect the cycle to repeat.

How to deal with the hated leader of the ideology that pushed you to N+1? Imprison them. Their second in command ends up in control of N+2, and imprisoned in N+3.

There may be the odd layer that isn't one of the two big ideologies, but for some reason humans like to split into one of two camps. I'd expect two to dominate in the early layers.

High layers may have advertisements for lower layers, communicated up the chain: "if you have this ideology, gather on layer m". Of course, if you die on that layer you'll probably head to m*2--the logical point to meet others of similar ideology who had accidents, just like you. The size of each subsequent layer depends on the ease of dying, and how many divisors of that layer are inhabited by ideologies. Layer 360 should be interesting.

After the first several layers, humanity is usually too thin for global or even regional politics to matter that much. Expect to find most humans between deliberately chosen layers living in small bands, just like most of humanity lived through most of its existence.

Far, far down there are people who deliberately explore, and hermits who did that for a while before giving up and waiting for new friends to come by. There may be groups of humans who all ascend to the next layer repeatedly and deliberately, on a schedule. I'd expect it to be yearly or maybe once a decade. Starting over from scratch is hard, and moving forward at a constant rate is enough to keep yourself away from most people.
