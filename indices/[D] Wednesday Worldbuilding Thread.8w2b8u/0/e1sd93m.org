When you die, you end up in the Land of the Dead, with all the other dead people, starting at the place you died (naked). The Land of the Dead is roughly like our own, but with its own continents, vegetation, animals, etc. If you're dead, you no longer have to breathe, eat, drink, or sleep. If you're past the age of 25, you revert to your physical form at 25 and no longer age. If you're younger than 25, you keep aging until 25 and then stop. You don't get diseases, and you can eventually heal back from any injury. You can get worn out, but will eventually recover your stamina. However, you /can/ still die if something sufficiently violent happens to you, in which case you go to the Land of the Dead+1.

The Land of the Dead+1 is a lot like the Land of the Dead, with all the same conditions, different geography, different plants and animals, etc. If you die, you go to the Land of the Dead+2, and from there, to the Land of the Dead+3, ad infinitum to the Land of the Dead+N.

From the Land of the Dead, it's possible to have minor interactions with the Land of the Living with sufficient will and energy spent. The Land of the Living is overlaid with the Land of the Dead, and can be sensed, vaguely, by the dead, allowing sight as though in a near-black room, and hearing as though through a muffled door. The force that the dead can apply is very minor, allowing little things like causing the flame of a candle to move without wind, shaking objects ... and interacting with a Ouija board, which opens up a line of communication with the Land of the Living.

The same rule of interaction applies between the Land of the Dead and the Land of the Dead+1, and between the Land of the Dead+N and the Land of the Dead+N+1.

Given that this applies only to humans, and that this has been the case through all human history, and the Land of the Living only discovered the rule in roughly the 1800s:

*What do you think the geopolitical landscape of the Land of the Dead looks like?*

There's still scarcity in the Land of the Dead, but the bottom rungs of Maslow's hierarchy are all taken care of. The Land of the Dead /should/ have civilization, maybe at a higher degree than the Land of the Living ... but at the same time, it's got a whole lot of people from much earlier in history.

I've been trying to tweak the parameters here to get the best interplay between Lands, and I think that some amount of resource conflict might be desirable. The starting point for this project was the image of a battalion slitting their own throats so that the Land of the Living could attempt to assert control over the Land of the Dead ... but I think the current configuration needs more work to get to a point where that's easily foreseeable as a consequence of the premise.
