We write [[https://sidewaysfiction.wordpress.com/][sideways in hyperspace]] which is written as rational space opera.

That said, we seem to have slightly different ideas of what a space opera is. When we think space opera, the region of thingspace that comes to mind includes things like Star Trek, Star Wars, Battlestar Galactica, Babylon 5, The Expanse, Andromeda, Farscape, Dark Matter, and yes, also things like Guardians of the Galaxy.

Here's what we consider the components of the space opera format:

- Large ensemble cast of characters
- Space setting
- Large scale conflicts involving whole civilizations
- "Magical" technology allows everything to happen.

If you were to move /Lord of the Rings/ into space, turn Mordor into a race of aggressive spacefaring aliens, make Frodo and Sam the captains of the Cool Starship, and Gondor into The Federation, it'd be space opera. We don't really think the seriousness or lack thereof is what determines it's 'space-opera-ness'.
