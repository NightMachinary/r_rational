Yeah, SM is pretty great in that regard. Very funny yet good worldbuilding, not to mention the big climax is coming in and it's about the Fermi Paradox.

More webcomic examples I'd point to are Freefall (it all takes place on the same planet but there is at least one alien and AI's galore - and all the characters are acting either crazy awesome or deliciously rational - sometimes both at the same time) and A Miracle of Science (somewhat similar to The Expanse setting wise with more mad science that is used in a very sensible way)
