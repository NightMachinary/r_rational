Based on this result, your device obeys Novikov and allows engineering based on "future-pruning". Once a device activation has been established, an arbitrary future event can be forced if enough care is taken to ensure that the device activation depends on it, and there is no more probable event which could cause it instead. See "Timemaster", by Robert Forward for some examples of this.
