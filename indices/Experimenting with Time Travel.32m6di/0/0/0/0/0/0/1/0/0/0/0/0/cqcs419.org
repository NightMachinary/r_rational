On heads, you hook the device up to a machine that presses the button when the light turns on. However, for the machine to detect the light flash, it must have had pressed the button somehow spontaneously (in the unrealized future). It would be a spontaneous time loop that causes itself which doesn't make sense. So the machine waits for a light flash which never occurs and never presses the button.

On tails, you hook it to a machine that presses the button randomly which already has been covered in the previous comments.

You are equally likely to get heads versus tails since you are flipping the coin before you touch the machine, or even see a light flash.
