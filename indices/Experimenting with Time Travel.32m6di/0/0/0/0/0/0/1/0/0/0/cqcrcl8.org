Yeah, basically if the most probable self-consistent timeline is one where the RNG returns 50, then the RNG will return 50. But if you force the RNG to return 50 too many times, then the timeline of 50 return multiple times doesn't become most probable timeline. That will be the one where the device breaks down, makes a mistake (glitch), or you stop the experiment for some reason.
