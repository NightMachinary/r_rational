Come to think of it I should have tried that heads thing on its own earlier.

#+begin_quote
  However, for the machine to detect the light flash, it must have had pressed the button somehow spontaneously (in the unrealized future).
#+end_quote

If what mattered was the unrealized future where the light didn't turn on, then trying to cause a paradox would just mean that the button was pressed in the unrealized future, so the light turns on now. What matters isn't the unrealized future. What matters is this one. Both the button being pressed and not being pressed are equally valid. Why would the light turning on causing the light to have turned on be a spontaneous time loop, but the light failing to turn on preventing the light from having turned on be perfectly fine?

If we ever get a way to send back more than one bit, we can play with this more. What if we have two independent boxes and hook them to the same machine that causes a paradox iff both lights are off? What if we make two possibilities consistent, and have the third possibility result in one of those two?

  You are equally likely to get heads versus tails since you are flipping the coin before you touch the machine
#+end_quote

I probably should have tested that first as well. Flip a coin, and on tails turn on the machine that causes a paradox 99% of the time. If the entire timeline is being constrained, then the coin will usually land on heads. If it's constrained starting the moment the light turns on, the coin will be fair.

Come to think of it, the light could turn on before the coin is flipped and affect the coin flip. Since it can turn on at an infinite number of times, it can basically control the coin, and we get the coin usually landing on heads. I guess if the coin usually lands on heads see if the light is turning on before the coin flip. Also, see what happens if you wait.
