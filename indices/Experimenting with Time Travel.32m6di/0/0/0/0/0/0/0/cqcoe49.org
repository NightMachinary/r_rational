Yep. Though you could always have trials happen much faster than once per second, when you control that end of the experiment as well.

In a more visceral example (a wholly unethical experiment, but a practical application), say there's a hostage crisis. You commit to activating the machine only if everyone is rescued, with no friendly casualties. Then have the DF guys wait on standby, with orders to deploy either at the last possible moment, or immediately after a flash if one happens first. As you wait, you're effectively getting lots of "free attempts", due to changes in initial conditions as seconds tick by and everyone takes (would have taken) slightly different actions as a result, and the flash tells you when the initial conditions will lead (will have led) to a perfect success. Assuming one isn't so unlikely it wouldn't come up...say if hostages had /already/ been killed, without your knowledge, making a total success impossible. You could even multiply your search space by drawing up dozens or hundreds of different mission plans, and putting them on a rotating schedule, such that the exact timing of the flash determines which plan is used (with the "judged best" plan used if time expires without a flash).

Actually, more immediately, you could draw up dozens of experimental plans for the machine, commit to activating the device only if you get a "promising" result from whatever plan is used, put /them/ on a rotation schedule and wait for a flash. That means you'll spend most of your effort on productive experiments (and also that dangerous attempts to force paradox as other people tried would have "luckily" never come up in the rotation).
