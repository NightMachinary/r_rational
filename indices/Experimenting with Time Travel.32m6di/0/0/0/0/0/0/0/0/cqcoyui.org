Actually that would fail spectacularly, because the device would only activate if everyone makes it out safely right? Then one possible resolution is that the device never activates and the DF guys rush in at the last second, there's a friendly casualty and you don't activate the device which makes this timeline the most likely one with all of the other attempted timelines go 'untested'. The timeline where the device doesn't flash at all will be checked first and as it's self-consistent, becomes the 'real' timeline.
