You seem to be trying to cause a paradox where the button-presser either pushes the button when the light is off or not when the light is off.

If the RNG is only allowed a few number of trials, about 200 or fewer, then the RNG will never show 50.

However, if it goes on for many trials where the RNG is very, very, very likely to show 50 sooner or later, then the button-presser will break down and accidentally press the button when the light is on or not when there is no light. Self-consistency is maintained no matter how improbable.
