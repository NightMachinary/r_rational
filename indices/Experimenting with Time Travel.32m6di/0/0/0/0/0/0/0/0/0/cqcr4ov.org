Well, let's break it down.

What evidence do we have for believing the machine-never-activated timeline is "checked" first? Or beyond that, that reality is determined on what is checked "first" and not "highest probability mass after paradoxes are excluded"? Seems worth testing somehow rather than just making bald assertions. :) The fall-back plan was still the best one you'd have used without the machine being involved at all, so calling it a "spectacular failure" seems inconsistent.

Though you later say "makes this timeline the most likely one", which suggests you /do/ think it works based on probability (and not order), but then don't explain why the scenario you describe is "most likely"? Which way do you think it works, and why do you think that?

If the a-priori probability of the machine being activated is low, it's possible the null-result would dominate. But if multiple "futures" are in fact "explored" via iteration, or a QM wavefunction, it's possible that the machine activation is a back-channel for collapse...suggesting that futures which include the machine being activated are more probable because they tend to collapse the wavefunction and exclude timelines where that didn't happen?

We could test that...set an arbitrarily unlikely (over some time period) RNG to trigger the machine and turn it on (the RNG, not the machine), committing to turn /off/ the RNG after some time limit if we don't see a flash. If futures with machine activation are inherently more likely, you should see the RNG triggering more often than it would otherwise. And you can gradually raise or lower the "natural" odds of the RNG triggering to establish bounds on that influence. On the other hand, if you reach even odds without seeing an effect, then the set of "possible machines" aren't collapsing wave-functions that way, and that constrains your engineering to schemes that depend on a flash having already occurred.
