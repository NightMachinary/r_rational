Where does the voltage pulse that lights the LED come from? In short, it's time to break out an oscilloscope and track what's going on inside the box.

Also, after the first day or two I would of course have started considering the ethical problems, and winning the lottery, etc. Winning the lottery (or picking stocks or whatever) is absolutely okay by me, so I'd probably try at least once. As for more complex problems, I think this will actually work out okay overall, so I'd probably back up the designs and entrust them to someone in case I go missing.
