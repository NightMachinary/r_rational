With the super-accurate clocks, orbit would also have a degree of gravitational separation.

The peak probability is a few milliseconds before the button is pressed, which can be offset via procedures that delay or lower the likelihood of the button being pressed. This can be used to affect probability a la Doc Future, by reacting to future signals with these procedures that delay and lower the likelihood of activation less a higher probability path of some desirable low-probability event. The probability of the light flashing in this case seems to be about as much as the low-probability event, though, so I'm not sure it has any actual use besides preternatural detection. This is of course subject to further experimentation and development.

What other details have we learned?
