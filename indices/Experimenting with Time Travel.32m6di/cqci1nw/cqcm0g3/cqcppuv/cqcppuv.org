A few miles won't cut it. Put two devices on opposite sides of the planet. That's about 40 light-milliseconds away. As long as you have nobody observing the device, the flashes should be happening consistently enough to make light delay effects clear. There are three results that might be expected:

1) The far box lights up just under 40 milliseconds after the button was pushed.

2) The far box lights up just over 40 milliseconds before the button was pushed.

3) The far box lights up a few milliseconds before the button was pushed under some reference frame.

4) Something unexpected happens.

If 3 happens, and it's possible that the reference frame is the boxes, it would be best to check that. There doesn't seem to be a cheap way to do it though. Even sending one of the boxes into a low Earth orbit would only add a half a nanosecond delay. Also, trying to abuse faster-than-light information transfer to act as a time machine is pretty pointless when it was a time machine to begin with.
