If it's a sufficiently large black hole, the tidal forces are negligible at the Schwarzschild radius.

Pressing the button inside the black hole shouldn't be anything odd, since light is perfectly capable of entering a black hole. The interesting thing would be pressing the button on the one outside the black hole. In this case the light would turn on before the device enters the black hole, regardless of how long you wait.
