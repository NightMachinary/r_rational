This is a slightly complex question for me to answer since there are multiple things I have to answer. They are very nice ideas to test and I'm jealous that I never thought of them! Let me know if I miss something.

First the team work on constructing multiple devices before daring to take apart the original device. The team successfully builds multiple devices, but it turns out that if any single device's button is pressed, then *all* devices' lights will light up (but not necessarily all at the same time). The team attempts to bring the (currently only) two devices very far apart spatially to see if distance might have an effect. It doesn't appear any effect, other than a very small tendency for a longer time span between light flash to button press, in the few miles the team tries.

Waiting for a light to flash, disabling the device, and then re-enabling it, and pressing the button works to allow the light to flash before the device was disabled. But if the device will be disabled permanently, before the button is pressed, then the light won't flash. Since any device can cause other devices to flash, then any one device can be disabled while another device's button is pressed to send a signal in time to the currently disabled device when that device wasn't disabled.

This is meant to work in the sense that the device can detect any signal sent back in time which is the same type of signal sent by any possible device.

It appears as if the signal can be sent arbitrarily far enough back in time by any device. For example, the team disables the device for 24 hours after the light flashed and then re-enabled it to press the button. However, if the device is disabled for more than two days, then something will happen to restart the production of devices such as someone getting impatient to run a new experiment or a device is accidentally re-enabled. It takes you swearing everyone to wait for a week before something unusual happens. After three days, a stranger from a different department stops by and saw the device. As someone who loves to do some engineering, he decided to take a look and see if he could fix it anyway (you put up a notice telling everyone to NOT fix the device) and managed to do so and pressed the button. Similar events occur around the three to four day mark.

You decide to try locking all disabled devices in a safe-deposit box and wait a full week. The bank returns the devices in five days after there was an earthquake breaking the bank's vaults. Multiple workers ended up in a hospital and two people died. You decide to re-enable the device and press the button and resolve to not try that again without a better understanding of how the device works.
