Your alarm security idea seems interesting so the team runs an experiment where one person (who doesn't know anything about the time machine) tries to break into the lab at a random time over the next two weeks.

1) The thief trips the alarm (in the yet unrealized future) and you get alerted. You wait for the thief, catch him (with him collecting the payment as part of his agreement to try), and manually pressing the button, or the alarm yourself, to ensure self-consistency.

2) The thief doesn't set-off the alarm (in the yet unrealized future) and you don't get alerted. Thief escapes scot-free and collects bonus for succeeding.

Over multiple experiments, you decide to compare frequency of success versus failure and compare it to how well the alarm system does without the advantage of the time machine. It turns out that the alarm is equally statistically likely to go off for both cases, albeit with the guard being more likely to catch the thief if the alarm+device goes off. This means that if the thief is capable of slipping past security without setting off the alarms, then the device won't go off and the timeline proceeds without the device going off.

In other words, the device is only checking ahead if the button will be pressed, not multiple possible timelines where if the thief is caught in any one of them to force the device into flashing.

It's certainly helpful if the thief is likely to trip the alarm, but it won't make the alarm any more effective in catching the thief in the first place.

For your randomized experiment, I already talked about something similar in response to fljared's comment [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/32m6di/experimenting_with_time_travel/cqcjilp][here]] and I know you've already read it with your comment "A log-normal distribution?" so I don't understand what you are trying to do/test differently.
