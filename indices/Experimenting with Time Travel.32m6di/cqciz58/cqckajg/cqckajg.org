I will assume that you run this experiment multiple times. The following two cases will occur.

1) If you and your fellow teammates promise beforehand to not touch the device after a light will flash, then light will not flash.

2) If after a light flashes and no one has touched the button yet, then people decide to run the earlier experiment and promise to not touch the device. For the entire day, no one touches the device and when it's time to lock up and go home for the night, you set up a camera to film the device overnight. The following day, the team watches the recording. It turns out that a pile of books left next to the device fell over and hit the button. Over multiple reruns, it turns out that either someone will accidentally touch the button (they forgot, tripped, or got impatient and wanted to run their own experiment), or something else will occur to bump the button (falling book, bird flies into the lab, jostled and banged device next to the wall, or something will happen). If the light flashed, the */button will be pressed/*.
