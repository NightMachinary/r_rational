Now that I know what happens if I try to force inconsistency, how about if I try to force consistency? I flip a coin. On heads, I hook the box up to a machine that presses the button when the light turns on. On tails, I leave it or hook it to a machine that presses it randomly or something. How frequently does the coin land on heads?
