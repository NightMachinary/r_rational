Since the other commentors are apparently not being careful to not cause a paradox, fuck it, I'll have fun.

I assume that testing revealed that the data is consistent with the 2-0 hour delay being independent of whether there are other flash-press event pairs in the temporal vicinity. If not, tell me (and describe what happens differently in such situations?). If so, try to send information back further than 2 hours with the following protocol:

#+begin_example
  Lock a Class-D in the room with these instructions.
  // Except for these commented out parts.
  // Do not enforce the instructions; we want the natural safety net of the universe not being destroyed if nobody is explicitly pruning the universe in that direction - the class D inexplicably doing something else is a convenient breaking point.
  Whenever the light flashes, he is to press the button as many times as it flashed.
  When the clock in the room says he has been there x hours, he is to press the button one additional time.
  // Substitute x for 2, 4, 6, ... on successive tests.
  Ten minutes later, he is to leave the room.
#+end_example

The proceedings are to be recorded, but only to be examined 3 hours after the end. We hope that the subject acts as a relay to send the signal sent after x hours ever further back in time until the causationally last flash occurs chronologically before he entered the room. (Insert a few control runs where he is to leave after x hours without an additional press.) Millisecond-delays should just be immediately retransmitted according to the instructions. If miscounting of successive flashes causes the subject to miss a press an annoying number of times, a flash counter is to be placed in the room to help him. The researchers are to be sane and to abort the line of experiments and report back to me if the log of recordings starts to look like an SCP entry.
