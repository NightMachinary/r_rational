Every week flip a coin. If it's heads, continue as usual. If it's tails, disable the machines for a week and forbid anyone from experimenting with them. Continue until there's enough data to tell whether the coinflips were randomly distributed. (Keep in mind that there are several proposed experiments that risk creating a paradox, which could only possibly take place when the coin come up heads.)
