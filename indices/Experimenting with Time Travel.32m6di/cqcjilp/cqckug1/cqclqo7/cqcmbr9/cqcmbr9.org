I'm assuming that you try this experiment with the time encoded being when the button is pressed.

1) Unobserved, the light flash right before the button-presses like in case #1.

2) Observed, the same thing happens as in case #2 described before.

EDIT: I forgot to include some information earlier. I'm also assuming that there is no attempt to try making the information invalid, therefore there are no difficulties to press the button at the indicated times of the light. So if the team receives information that the button will be pressed at 12:00, then the you will do so at 12:00.

In addition, the ranges of time delay between light flash and button press tend to be around enough time to decode the flashes and realize that you need to press the button almost right away.
