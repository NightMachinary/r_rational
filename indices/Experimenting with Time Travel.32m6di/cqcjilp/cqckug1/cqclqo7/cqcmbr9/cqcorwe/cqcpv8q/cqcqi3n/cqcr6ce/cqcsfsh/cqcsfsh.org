To have a long tail, the second derivative of the probability distribution can't be negative, but a negative second derivative is exactly what you're describing when you say "a faster drop-off as time goes by." So you can either have a drop-off whose intensity is increasing, or you can have a long tail ("no hard limit"). If you want both, then you have to have a change in concavity, which would allow for something completely incompatible with ln(C-x) at a distance, but could appear to have a negative concavity like what you want on the order of two hours. However, saying it looks like ln(C-x) to the experimenters is not plausible, as a linear fit is much simpler with the data collected. You would also want a lower bound on the advance-time, or it would start to appear like there were no epiphenomenon.

Also note that in the OP you say it consistently activates on the order of seconds before being pressed, but with the computerized experiment it consistently activates on the order of milliseconds. Would that mean that advance-time is dependent on the last moment of activation, and not on the last moment of reception?
