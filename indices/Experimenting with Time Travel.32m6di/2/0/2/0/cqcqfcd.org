If the animal is kept from any possible interference with the device, then case #1 happens with the light flashing right before the button is pressed.

But if the animal can interfere with the device, then light flashes can occur at a wider, and more variable, time range with the animal or computer+RNG occasionally pressing the button themselves, similar to case #2.

Since the vegetative-human wouldn't ever interfere with the device, case #1 always occurs.
