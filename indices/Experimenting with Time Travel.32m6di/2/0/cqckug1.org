The following cases occur:

1) if no one is observing the device, then the light flashes right before the button is pressed. The duration of time in between light and button is constant and at a few milliseconds (basically just enough time for a human observer to notice the light clearly flashing before the button is pressed, and not so close to think they are simultaneous events).

2) If someone is observing, then the time frame becomes far more inconsistent. One flash may occur minutes before the button being pressed even as a second flash is occurring immediately before the button is being pressed. If the observer is promising to not interfere in any possible case, then case #1 occurs instead.

The maximum range is two hours and the minimum range is the same as case #1 with a few milliseconds. Statistically the minimum range occurs the most often with a drop-off to the maximum range. +The graph from the maximum to minimum vs the frequency looks like a reversed logarithmic shape. Google "ln(C-x)" for the general shape (C is any constant).+ I made an error in my conceptualization of the graph and should have said [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function#Logistic_differential_equation][logistic functions]].

The maximum of two hours is not a hard limit, but rather a 'soft' limit. It looks like the signal can be sent further, but two hours is the limit observed so far in your experiment.
