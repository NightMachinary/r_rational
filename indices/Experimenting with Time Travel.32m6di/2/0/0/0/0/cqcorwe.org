+...Reading this, the fictional physics became a lot less interesting. Observation is not dependent on conscious presence, and if you didn't mean observation as in the quantum definition, then you meant that there is a direct correlate with a conscious presence. More than that, I think it's quite possible that it would be an inconsistent system given such a condition.+
