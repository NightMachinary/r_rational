Never mind, I think you're going for the unpredictability of human behavior for some reason. I don't buy that a lack of a "promise" would affect the likelihood of an experimenter interfering in the slightest.

In any case, ln(C-x) seems very shaky. ln(C-x) does not describe a distribution with a long tail like what you posited. More to the point, to discover that the distribution is according to ln(C-x) of some parameter C, you would have to find the hard limit, at which point ln(C-x) /is/ zero for any finite C. Locally, with measurements not precise enough to determine a non-zero derivative, the graph looks like a line, and there is no sharp dropoff. Another issue is that it doesn't seem to be a probability distribution in the slightest. What do you mean by "The graph from the maximum to minimum vs the frequency"? Which is supposed to be x and which is y? What are the units of each side? How is there a long tail in the distribution when the logarithm has none?
