  Would that mean that advance-time is dependent on the last moment of activation, and not on the last moment of reception?

Your description of this experiment seems to confirm my hypothesis. Unfortunately that makes the device fairly useless, as time travel would be a monadic phenomenon, and there would only be one timewise "bit." The next thing to do would be to see if you can change the properties of the devices to tune them to different configurations and gain more timewise bits. And I don't think you said anything regarding my duration experiment, either.
