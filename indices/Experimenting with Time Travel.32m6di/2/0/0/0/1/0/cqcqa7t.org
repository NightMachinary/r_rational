If the team don't try to make the information invalid, then the light will flash right before the button is pressed. If you press the button ten times to transmit the information '12:00', then the light will flash once right before each time you press the button.

Let me put it like this, you already plan on pressing the button and no matter when you see the flashes, you plan on pressing the button. So the light will revert to the default case where the light flashes shortly before you press the button.

You can force the lights for time 4:10 to appear before the time 4:05 by first seeing 4:10 flash, and then planning on pressing the button before 4:10 comes. The light will then flash 4:05 as the earlier time you chose. But this won't occur spontaneously.
