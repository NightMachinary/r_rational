#2 should be the one to occur since the devices are constrained by how fast light travels in the time span backwards from button press of one device to the light flash of the other device. For instance, if the light of one device flashes a second before the button of the other device is pressed, then the signal has one second to travel the distance in between the devices. Therefore, on opposite sides of the planet, the devices will show at minimum the 40-millsecond difference and never anything less.

If it's possible to test it, then holding one device near a black hole will force a greater time delay to flashing the light of the second device, since the speed of light is slowed down at the edge of a black hole. Don't ask me what would happen if the button is pressed inside of a black hole, because the device would already have been smashed to bits by gravity.
