This seems directly related to the earlier thread about Primer. Is it possible to construct new devices (or disable and reenable the function of the existing device) to constrain the timespan by which a signal is sent back?

Firstly I would attempt to determine the distribution of time-distances that the signal is sent back by. If construction of new devices works, then my first step would be to build a great number of these devices and test that they functioned according to a similar phenomenon. Any differences from expectation would be noted (each device would be numbered). If new devices cannot be constructed, multiple trials would have to take place over time instead of both time and space. Devices would be enabled, observed for light pulses, then if there was a pulse (in 60s), the experimenter would disable the device without pressing the button, and if there wasn't the experimenter would then (after 60s) press the button and disable the device.

RPing scientific experimentation is a very fun idea.
