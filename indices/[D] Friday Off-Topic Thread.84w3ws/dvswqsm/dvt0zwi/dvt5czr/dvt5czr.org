Than you for your insight :] what you wrote agrees with my own understanding and cursory google scholaring, except wrt to Vit. D, where I think that 2014 paper rather suggestive. I was mostly worried about B12 deficiency insofar as family history might suggest some underlying inherited condition, but agree that the my own serum levels aren't of great concern.

Specifically though I was looking for resources that could be used to roughly identify healthy optima for all the other results (there were like 50+ of them lol). So I don't have to potter around trying to find recent cochrane reviews or meta-analyses or whatever for each.
