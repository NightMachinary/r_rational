  Finally, how do people perceive the "status play" of individuals with a doctorate introducing themselves as Dr. -Surname-" outside e.g. a medical, professorial, or otherwise professional context?

There should be a reason for using the title. If a medical doctor is signaling that he can be called upon in an emergency, then by all means, use the title. Doctor Strange was not doing that. He doesn't practice medicine, so he shouldn't call himself doctor.
