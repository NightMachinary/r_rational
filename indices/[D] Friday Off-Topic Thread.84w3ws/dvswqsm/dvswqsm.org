Grandparents celebrated their 56th anniversary this week, so I posted a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/OldSchoolCool/comments/8473rx/what_56_years_of_marriage_does_to_a_couple/][before/after picture]] of them and hot damn, reddit is full of a lot more weirdos than you'd expect just reading the undeleted comments. Also, for some reason the thread got removed for an hour+ [[https://www.reddit.com/r/OldSchoolCool/comments/8473rx/what_56_years_of_marriage_does_to_a_couple/dvo1ycp/][right as it hit the front page]], which totally killed its rising momentum, depriving me of many worthless internet points. Oh well! Amusingly this isn't the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/etu2s][first time]] grandparents have been briefly reddit popular, though this site was like 100x smaller then.

I also had a full [[https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/84c9zu/wellness_wednesday_14th_march_2018/dvpmik6/][nutrient/metabolic panel]] done, does anyone know of good resources for interpreting the results?

Finally, how do people perceive the "status play" of individuals with a doctorate introducing themselves as Dr. -Surname-" outside e.g. a medical, professorial, or otherwise professional context? I was watching [[https://youtu.be/QwievZ1Tx-8?t=122][the Avengers trailer]] from earlier today and it put me in mind of this. Personally, I've always felt it kinda lame not to introduce yourself by your given name, especially if someone has just introduced themselves to you by theirs. It seems like a move to artificially impose hierarchical structure on your interactions (comparable to those aforementioned professional relationships), to elevate yourself above your interlocutor, to brag. I think my reaction to it is in part driven by the impression that almost all the most brilliant doctorate-holders I've known are casual and modest, so to call yourself "Dr. ..." is to signal your own inability to "countersignal" in this way, and betrays a lack of confidence that one's competence can evince itself naturally. The context may change a little if you're talking to someone in their mid-teens (e.g. Peter Parker), and the may indeed be setting up a mentor-mentee relationship, but even so. I guess that hoity-toity-ness is part of Dr. Strange's character, too.
