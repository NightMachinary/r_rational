I can recommend some LitAnalysis articles on Homestuck that dig into /why/ Homestuck does stuff and in particular why the (controversial ending) went the way that it did, if you want to know if it's going to keep being your thing. Spoilers, obviously, but I don't think that Homestuck suffers much from being spoiled.
