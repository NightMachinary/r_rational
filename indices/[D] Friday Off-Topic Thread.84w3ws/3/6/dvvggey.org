I'm heading home from Open House festivities at my PhD department. I'm disappointed that one of the brightest and most ambitious prospects we had is going to torture himself for a year to please the elites across town when we have time and space for him. Other than that, I'd say we're getting two pretty good incoming lab members and one probable who's very young and needs a sense of direction.
