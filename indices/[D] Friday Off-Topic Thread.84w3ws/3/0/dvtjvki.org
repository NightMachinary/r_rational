Hope you feel better! What's going on in yours?

Currently I'm wrapping up a project for a talk at a conference next month; hoping to get the paper submitted before then too. I keep thinking of (and collaborators keep suggesting) additional analyses to perform for the simulation component, which keeps extending the completion date.

Wife's coming to visit in a few days (her lab moved and took her with it, lest she otherwise forfeit several years of PhD) and we'll be together for a few weeks, for which I'm very excited! We talk for a few hours every night and play video games and watch movies and stuff but I've still missed her deeply. Her absence has actually affected me in a chronic sense more than essentially anything else in my life, but luckily she's wrapping up over the next few months and moving back x-country in the early summer, so not long left!

Earlier today I got a response for the call for summer teaching assignments -- didn't get the course I wanted but got one I've taught [[https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/3hs0em/taught_a_course_a_few_weeks_ago_on/][a few times before]] (paleoanthro's maybe half the focus, it's an upper div class on human evolutionary biology) which'll be substantially less work since I'll only have to make fairly minor updates to lecture materials. Pay's pretty good too, at least relative to what I'm used to, around $1k/week for part-time (~20h/w) work, which's nice cos I'll be taking a hefty pay cut from when my GRF runs out this year. And it's a fun class to teach (I get a captive audience to listen to me ramble on about stuff I'm interested in, and then we all discuss it afterwards, what's not to love). Listening to music this morning I had a thought to put the following in the syllabus:

  Your final grade will be computed as a weighted average of course components. A breakdown of those components and their weights follows:

  | Weight | Component                  |
  |--------+----------------------------|
  | 10%    | luck                       |
  | 20%    | skill                      |
  | 15%    | concentrated power of will |
  | 5%     | pleasure                   |
  | 50%    | pain                       |

  In total these weights will sum to 100% reason to remember the name.

heeheehee I was giggling for much of my walk in lol
