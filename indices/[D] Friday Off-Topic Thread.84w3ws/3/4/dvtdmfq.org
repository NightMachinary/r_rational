Aw I'm sorry that's really shitty :/

Regarding my life... Not a lot going on! Work deadlines that I was aiming to finish by the end of the week look like they might go unfinished, but it's definitely giving me something to aim for for the rest of the day/probably next week too.

Also looking forward to see if anything interested gets posted on the weekly thread!

Hope the episode rolls over soon :)
