I would agree with you, but I'm starting to think that the way the human mind is built is one of the reasons people hurt each other as well as themselves. Part of my self loathing is related to my implicit bias and culturally-ingrained stereotypes that effect the way I treat other people without realizing it, so I want that removed from my brain as well so I don't commit, enable, or tolerate discriminatory and abusive behavior.

But if I value my current mental architecture so little that I think it should be changed so I think and act like a person who I consider to be more virtuous, then why should I value the less virtuous minds of anyone else more than my own? I believe that I think dehumanizing thoughts about others and hate myself for it because I believe those thoughts lead to suffering, but that could be used to justify doing the same to anyone else regardless of consent.

I'd probably be doing it for selfish reasons, “optimizing” humans my way so I feel less bad, but I'm also not sure how much empathy I can actually feel for people who've suffered in ways that I haven't so that rationalization might be the best possible way to optimize utilitarian values. Even if I could test to see if I actually cared instead of just being loyal to an ideal, would it matter if the result is reducing a form of suffering that is never morally justifiable?
