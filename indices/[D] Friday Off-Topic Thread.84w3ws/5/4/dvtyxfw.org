  Couple that with revelations about how much more suffering people are in than I ever thought possible due to the circumstances of their existence, and I find myself more inclined to think that life is pain and just want the pain to stop. So I've begun to wonder if it is a moral imperative to forcibly change humanity into something that is, by definition, not human so that people experience and cause less pain.

  Am I becoming a nihilist? Is it mentally healthy to think that the only way to stop the suffering of myself and others is by altering the human mind at a fundamental level? What does that say about my identity or my respect for the rights of others? Am I just rationalizing a scenario in which I would commit suicide and is it better to tie it to an event that may not even happen?

I'm an anti-wireheader. I view pain in the map not the territory, as a signal rather than a end in itself. You feel pain when you get hurt because it teaches getting hurt is bad and avoiding it is good. There are [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_insensitivity_to_pain][people unable to feel pain]] and they tend to do things like accidentally bite their tongue off without noticing.

I view changing your mental architecture to not feel pain or short circuiting your brain using narcotics is generally an act of changing moral values rather than maximising the ones you already have. This is not to say that pain is always perfect, sometimes our brain gives us too much pain or pain when it isn't warranted though likewise sometimes it doesn't give us enough. My point is that eliminating pain is much like an employer making a policy that employees are unable to provide criticism even if it is constructive.
