Well I don't want to be a nihilist and don't think I psychologically capable of functioning as a nihilist. Nihilism is what leads me to believe that I can't stop loathing myself unless someone invents technology that can forcibly reprogram my mind, effectively killing me and creating a new person who I think would be of greater value than myself. That is not something healthy to believe.
