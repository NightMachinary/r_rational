Scheduling with a therapist is hard so I'm going to ask for help with an existential question that's been bugging me for a while. I am not in a depressive episode or contemplating self harm, this is just what I'm thinking about because of the lingering depression in the back of my mind.

Ever since I first heard about the theory of the singularity, I always sided with Hanson over Yudowsky because I found his predictions both more plausible and more morally acceptable. Yudkowsky's preference for creating an AI that would optimize humanity never sat well with me, but now I'm worried that I've come over to his side for the wrong reasons.

When I first heard the suggestion for something as simple as banning humans from driving themselves in order to save lives, I was hardline against this because I saw it as a violation of human autonomy and the servitude role of technology. However, my depression and anxiety so often leaves me with no ability to act or think independently that I need my environment to care for me.

Couple that with revelations about how much more suffering people are in than I ever thought possible due to the circumstances of their existence, and I find myself more inclined to think that life is pain and just want the pain to stop. So I've begun to wonder if it is a moral imperative to forcibly change humanity into something that is, by definition, not human so that people experience and cause less pain.

Am I becoming a nihilist? Is it mentally healthy to think that the only way to stop the suffering of myself and others is by altering the human mind at a fundamental level? What does that say about my identity or my respect for the rights of others? Am I just rationalizing a scenario in which I would commit suicide and is it better to tie it to an event that may not even happen?

I don't think it's likely that I'll ever be in a position where I will contribute to a decision about whether to assimilate humanity into a hive mind where our psychology is altered to eliminate prejudice, abuse, discrimination, and mental illness. However, if I got the chance to change myself in that way, I would be inclined to take it due to my self loathing and I don't know if that is a reason not to do it or evidence that I should take it because of the pain my mind causes me.
