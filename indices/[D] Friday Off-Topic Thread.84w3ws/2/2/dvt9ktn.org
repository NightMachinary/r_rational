Look for programming meetups. I'm more database back-end guy myself, but we have a lot of people doing game development in the area. My local MSDN regional rep or my previous MSDN regional rep (Not sure I think he may have gone independent) has a lot of good tutorials on game design and hosts/sponsors hack-a-thons and talks focused on games

Edit: also if you want ideas and thoughts on the idea process Yandredev while having a creepy subject matter has a pretty good discussion with his fans on youtube about his creative process.
