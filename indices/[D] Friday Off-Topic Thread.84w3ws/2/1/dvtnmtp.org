I currently have collision detection problems. I don't understand how other game developers can program this to be so efficient.

I mean, look at Obliterate Everything: that's a game where you construct buildings that build ships automatically every few seconds, and the ships that are carriers spawn miniships every few seconds, and those miniships can spray bullets out like crazy. And you can have 3 players fighting each other, spamming those ships out like crazy, yet the game doesn't lag (at least, not as much as you would expect). How the heck is that possible? The game code has to somehow detect collisions between all the countless ships and bullets in real time, which is nuts.

I looked for tutorials online, and they recommended programming an invisible grid across the entire map, and recording which cell of the grid each bullet/ship is in, and only detecting collisions between bullets/ships in nearby cells. I tried that, but it's still crazy slow. Especially when the map is huge, which it is in Obliterate Everything, considering that ships and bullets can go off-map and then come back.
