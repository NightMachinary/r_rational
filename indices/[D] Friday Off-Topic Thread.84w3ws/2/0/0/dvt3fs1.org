Ugh! That sucked in college. I had a friend who was really excited about a video game idea of his, but he only knew business and nothing about programing. He wanted me (and one other guy) to make the game. He wasn't rude about it, but the problem was that I was a freshman and didn't know anything about making a video game (maybe a website or simple game of tic tac toe). It ruined the friendship when all he wanted to do was talk about the game and I didn't have the energy to learn very much about building a video game /and/ keep up with my coursework at the same time.

People, being the 'idea guy' is worthless when you are making others do everything to bring it from theory to practical.

This isn't meant as an attack at you, GaBeRockKing, by the way. It's just a chance for me to rant about slightly unrelated things.
