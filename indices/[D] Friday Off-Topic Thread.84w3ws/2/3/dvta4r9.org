Yes making games is hard , I'm incapable to sticking to a project , and can't really aim low , so I have a lot of unfinished games . Especially when something like exams happens and I get interrupted and don't really feel any motivation to return to the game . It seemed like i was going to finish my last game , since I took notes obsessively enough that I was able to return to it after a while and still know how everything worked, but still I stopped at the start of the year ,and haven't touched it since then(in fact I think it ) . The only project that seems to last for some reason is my pokemon mystery dungeon story / rpgmaker game /setting thing , maybe because doing worlbulding is addictive and it makes me want to do things whith it, but even then I still keep abandoning and starting new projects ,its just that its part of the same thing.

Maybe I should try to participate in more game jams, to force myself to finish something.
