I got drivers license exam going that i absolutely loathe doing. I am not interested in owning a car even tho i kinda see that its really useful and all but it was mainly the pressure from my family that made me go. And besides the course is really expensive here which isnt ideal when i wanted to realize some of my projects

like my and my friends smithy that we wanted to make and play in so we can make some swords, blades, armor etc. We are kinda super interesting in blacksmithing and its expensive and now i dont have any money...

school is getting really annoying when i dont really want to go there. its boring and nonsense mostly but i still need those points for being there...absolutely idiotic especially when half the teachers just go on some other things and we have reductions etc. I live outside town and coming over to school every day in WINTER is especially bothersome. On some days (like today when i had 3 lessons only 1 of which was nonsense organizational lesson with our main teacher) i am spending more time in the bus driving to the school than in the actual school. Our shitty main teacher that i hate yet again went and got us a nice practice in the lab class by doing something for a mark whithout explaining it normally first. She is such a shitty teacher its amazing really. I dont really know what she is doing at this school because its certainly not teaching. She actually hates kids and mostly tries to go on business trips away from school. I dont get it. MOst of the things we do in the lab will need to be repeated with other techears because we learn absolutely nothing from her and like atleast 75% of the things in the lab dont work. Its absolutely frustrating when you need to sit on your butt and do nothing the first hours out of the 3 of the lab we get per week. She is also really spiteful and like nobody likes her in school amongst the students and ofcourse i had to be in class that got her as our homeroom teacher...

by this time i just said "fuck it" and just focused on the subjects that actually will be on our maturity exam next year or on our job exam this year and disregarded all else. I really need to get into shape and do something positive with my life. Like holy hell and i am sitting all days on reddit or playing games when i am not in school or doing my driving course. Writing some webnovels that i have ideas for or learning programming are amongst the many projects that i prefer finding excuses no to do. The only project i am kinda doing is the wholy smithy thing but its going really slow cuz of money and how rarely i can meetup with my friend because we live on the opposites side of town and his bus drives even rarer than mine(guess having a car now would be cool huh). My life is kinda escaping from my hands i feel like. Laziness is the worst sickness i say.
