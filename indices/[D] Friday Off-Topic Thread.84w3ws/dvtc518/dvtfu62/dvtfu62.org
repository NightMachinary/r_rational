Hope your upslide continues up!

I released a blog post about [[https://digitalfellows.commons.gc.cuny.edu/2018/03/12/an-introduction-to-programming-paradigms/][programming paradigms]]. I'm going blind and my right eye is feeling pretty fucked up this week. My partner is leaving her job at the end of the month.
