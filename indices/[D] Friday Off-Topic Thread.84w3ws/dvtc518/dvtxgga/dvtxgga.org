Played some super smash bros melee for the first time in years at a local tourney yesterday; been a really fun time. Forgot how fun it is to do something you spent a lot of time working on; I'd forgotten how much I enjoyed the game. I didn't even really mind getting wrecked in matches; that's how enjoyable it's been.

What about you? What's been up?
