Well, [[https://wwyxhqc.wordpress.com/%E4%BF%AE%E7%9C%9F%E4%B8%96%E7%95%8C-world-of-cultivation/][World of Cultivation]] has finally ended, and I though I'd throw out a quick recommendation. It's nowhere near rational enough to deserve its own thread IMHO, but it does keep the xianxia's popcorn fiction feel, without being the sort of thing where, reflecting after a hundred chapters with no character development whatsoever, or xianxia protag sociopathy.

It's the story of an irreverent cultivator only in it for the money, an agricultural and technological revolution, and a war between generic xianxia humans, nature spirits with the most developed society and complex magic system, and +anthropomorphic pokemon+ beast spirits who just enjoy the thrill of combat. The cultivation systems are relatively fleshed out, the secondary characters are actually able outdo the protagonist, and are actual characters.
