I loved Chunin Exam Day for so long. It was one of my favourite fics as I read it.

By the end, I can safely say it's one of the very, /very/ few fics that I've left unhelpful, inflammatory comments on (though my youth had a good bit to do with it as well) The concept was well founded, and spawned more than one fanfiction of its own(looking at you /Time Braid/ and that Shikamaru one) and was honestly an enjoyable ride for quite a while.

Then, at some point, it became a terrible story; the bashing was completely unneeded and over the top, the harem aspects (which my young self loved at the time because 'oh, hot women that the main character gets to bang' was all the rage in my pubescent mind) were completely ridiculous, the power creep (which is honestly one of the funnest parts of groundhog day style stories in this sort of genre; it's almost the entire point of writing one) fell flat because Orochimaru somehow has counter plans on counter plans for literally anything the time looping Naruto tried to do, even though he was hundreds (possibly thousands?) of loops in, and took several opportunities to seduce (females) or torture (males) any of Orochimaru's henchmen for all of the information they had. It would've been one thing if [[#s][Spoilers for Time and Again by KyLewin]] but the story went out of its way to make it clear that Orochimaru didn't know and was just that good, despite him being thwarted by much lesser means in canon.

It became clear that the author was just trying to justify some reason for Naruto to remain in the loop, even though it was again made explicit that it was Naruto making Chuunin and not Orochimaru losing that was required for that to happen.

And just to harp on a previous point...the bashing. I'm not going to try and defend Kakashi's teaching style (which is pretty terrible, though consistent with a lot of anime sensei styles) or Sasuke's absolute prickishness but the retribution sought includes, among others, a loop in which Kakashi's dead father came back from the grave and inscribed a seal on his penis that would cause it to explode/fall off if he got an erection that wasn't caused by a woman he married to "break him of his porn addiction and loneliness" and there were several loops in which Sasuke is beaten horribly/killed/crippled for amusement and little else.

And the poop humor. God, the fucking cringy poop humor.

TL DR: I have a lot of issues with PL as a writer, and the story Chunin Exam Day in particular. Calling them masterpieces is an insult to both the words "master" and "piece" and the letters m,a,s,t,e,r,p, i and c.
