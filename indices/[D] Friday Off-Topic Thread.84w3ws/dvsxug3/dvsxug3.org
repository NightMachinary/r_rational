Have you come across any traditionally-published books that remind you of fanfiction stories?

The infamous [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/40498][/Xanth/]] series of Piers Anthony reminds me powerfully of Perfect Lionheart's masterpieces [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3929411][/Chunin Exam Day/]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4240771][/Partially Kissed Hero/]] (endless [[https://allthetropes.org/wiki/Crosses_the_Line_Twice][Crossing the Line Twice]] combined with fascinating ideas). I also was (less strongly) reminded of Esama's [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1113651][/Sisyphus/]] when I read [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15790842][/Life After Life/]] (endless time loops combined with trying too hard to sound deep instead of actually accomplishing anything cool). In both these cases, however, I vastly preferred the fanfiction stories to the original stories.
