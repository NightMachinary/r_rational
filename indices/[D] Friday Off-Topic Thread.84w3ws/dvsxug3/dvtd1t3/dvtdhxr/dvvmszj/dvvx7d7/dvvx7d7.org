How many incredibly-cool ideas were brought to light in /Chunin Exam Day/? Just off the top of my head:

#+begin_quote
  Detailed chakra-control exercises (/e. g./, for water-natured chakra: sitting on a river's surface, letting your chakra leak through the river, and feeling the river by feeling your chakra)

  Fuuinjutsu written, not with two-dimensional ink on paper, but with the three-dimensional impurities in gemstones---and in an entirely-new language

  The people of the Village Hidden in the Sand use their techniques, not only for military purposes (as ninja), but also for civilian purposes (street puppetry, using wind to sweep streets and speed up trade ships, /etc./), and they use this secondary outlet to avoid losing expertise while they're under Daimyou-imposed budget cuts that prevent them from keeping many ninja in training

  Using Tsukuyomi, not as a torture device, but as a training area akin to the Hyperbolic Time Chamber

  A suggestion that maybe lightning is, not its own chakra nature, but a mixture of fire and air chakra that has become widespread over centuries of interbreeding

/Et cetera/.

These ideas are creative and awesome. Even if Perfect Lionheart fails to actually /use/ many of them to their fullest potential, there are /zillions/ of them! Compare the similarly-cool ideas of /HPMoR/ (partial transfiguration, superpowered Patronus, "do not mess with time") or /Worm/ (using spiders, not for combat, but for a bulletproof suit; using body-hijacking, not for public impersonation, but for private selfcest; a hivemind team of capes).
