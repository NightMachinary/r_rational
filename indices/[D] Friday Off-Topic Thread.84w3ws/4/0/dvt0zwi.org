I'm a med student so I can tell you my impressions of your metabolic panel but consult your doctor since I am obviously still in training. Your B12 is fine, too low levels of B12 can cause anemia but high levels of B12 aren't harmful as far as I know. Don't worry about it too much since your body can store decades' worth of B12 so vegetarianism/veganism alone rarely cause problems unless you have some other condition or are not taking supplements for years. Your family members who have B12 deficiency despite eating meat are probably having problems with absorption or storage in their GI tract rather than not getting enough. Just keep taking supplements. Don't worry about Cl. Different sources give different normal ranges and yours is still within many normal ranges. Besides, the variation is so small and it probably changes slightly throughout your day depending on mealtimes, urination, etc. Your doctor is correct that you don't need to take Vitamin D supplements but it also doesn't hurt to take supplements. It's very difficult to take toxic doses of vitamin D unless you're taking prescription-level vitamin D every day for months.
