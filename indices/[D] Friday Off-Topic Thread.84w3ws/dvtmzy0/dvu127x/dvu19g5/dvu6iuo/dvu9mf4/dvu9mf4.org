I'm obsessed with cooking and baking. It's my birthday party tomorrow and I've basically spent the whole day baking for it! It's a brunch, so I've made a variety of muffins, two quiches - made those last night - and I will probably make some cinnamon rolls after I get home from a friend's birthday party tonight and put them in the fridge overnight to rise.

And I collect recipes and barely have time to make them all faster than I make them - but I discover some real winners in the course of events, so I'm okay with it.

Also - I only cook half the time, the other half the time my long-suffering partners have to make these sometimes elaborate meals...
