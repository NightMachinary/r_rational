Understanding the background history of big scientific and mathematical revolutions helped me to better understand the implications of certain science principles and math theorems.

For example, knowing that people used to think math (or number theory in particular) would be a way of knowing the Truth of the world helped me to better understand why Godel's theorems proving that there are statements that can't ever be proven true or false is so significant. It helped elucidate why such a theorem is so important to understand.
