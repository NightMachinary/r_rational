What weird research has come in unexpectedly handy for you? The story I'm writing uses a lot of flower symbolism, so I've become best friends with a vintage flower dictionary I found on google books.

Anyway, I was watching TV the other day and there was a plot line that involved people having affairs, and the character who was being cheated on was carrying a bouquet of yellow roses! I said to my partners: "Hey! Yellow roses mean jealousy!".

It was... cool.
