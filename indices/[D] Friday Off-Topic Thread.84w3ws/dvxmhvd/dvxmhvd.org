I'm looking for a program I used some years ago. It would give you a question with two options, e.g. "which of these two are the richest" (the options would be picked from a list of he richest people in the world) you would pick one of them, as well as how certain you were in your answer (the options were 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 and either 95 or 99%) If you answered correctly you'd get points according to how certain you were, and if you answered incorrectly you would lose points, there were a bigger penalty for answering wrong. I remember there were 0 points for answering 50%
