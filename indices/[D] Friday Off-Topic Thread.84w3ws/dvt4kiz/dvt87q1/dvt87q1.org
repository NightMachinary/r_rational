The important thing to remember here is that you are in an altered state of mind. It's much subtler than being drunk, but no less severe. Any conclusion or reasoning you make right now is almost certainly going to be influenced in a negative direction, at the very least in terms of your reaction to it. You will then remember your conclusion, but not the negatively influenced reasoning behind the conclusion.

Even if your ability to reason about these things isn't affected, as would be the case with drunkenness, your emotional reaction to them is certainly altered. This isn't productive towards helping you feel normal again. Hold off on making these type of decision and revelations, and if you feel that "focus on getting better" is too trite or unhelpful, then at least focus on gathering data that opposes your current viewpoint in a more emotionally positive direction. I would recommend reading The Better Angels of our Nature, by Steven Pinker, to counter the despair and cynicism you seem to feel towards current humanity. It's isn't a happy book, as it details a variety of horrific things that humans have done to each other. But I would argue that it's overall a positive book, which doesn't sugarcoat the backslides in moral progress, but does clearly show that upward trend.
