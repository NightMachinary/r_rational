  So I've begun to wonder if it is a moral imperative to forcibly change humanity into something that is, by definition, not human so that people experience and cause less pain.

I think anything that is forcible implies a certain degree of pain because to most humans the feeling of autonomy and freedom is a really important thing - even when it concretises in freedom and autonomy to drive themselves in some shitty corner and make their life worse. I would be wary of applying your personal experiences to everyone. You have no reason to believe that people who claim to be genuinely happy just aren't, for example.

As a general rule, I am not the sort of person who would be against transhumanism on concerns of sticking to either God's or Nature's supposed "plans" for us - those are bunk for me. But I would say that anything that changed my mind so much that it removed all potential source of pain from it would probably have effectively killed me anyway. The new entity that replaced me would be happy but why should I care? While I exist, it doesn't, and it has no rights nor is it entitled to anything. And a cure for my problems that kills me is not a cure.

That said, I also think that, luckily perhaps, we will never really get the chance or need to take a practical position on such issues during our lifetimes. At a difference with the most optimist predictions, I don't think such things can be achieved within a human life's time frame yet. For those who will be, it'll be a hard call, but I still think that a good is worth nothing if someone forces it on you. Since individual experience is fundamentally inaccessible, the only way to know what someone desires is to listen to what they say and watch what they do, and therefore individual preference trumps everything else. To come from outside and say "no, I know better than you, /this/ is what will make you happy" is nonsense to me.
