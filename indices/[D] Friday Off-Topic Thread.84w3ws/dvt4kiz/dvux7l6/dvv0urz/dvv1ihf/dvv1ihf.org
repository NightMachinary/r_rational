  I don't use drugs of any kind, I don't even drink alcohol or caffeine, because I have no interest in using something that could potentially impair my ability to think.

What about nootropics? They're poorly understood right now, but take an "ideal" nootropic that really did change how you thought, temporarily and for the better, with minimal (although not nonexistent) side effects. Would you be willing to use one, or would you still be too uncomfortable?

Myself, I don't forswear drugs, but I prefer to use them sparingly so I don't build up any sort of tolerance or dependence. I only drink coffee/energy drinks when I really need them, for example. If your exclusive motivation is just avoiding impaired thinking, I think, on a closer look, you could find a number of drugs where the cost/benefit calculus is in favour of taking the drug, even for pure utility purposes.

Similarly, I think there's a cost/benefit calculation to be made for true mind-altering drugs. How much alteration is acceptable to remove suffering? Because independent of drugs, and independent of how you define personhood, there has to be a threshold, or literally any action taken by a human would be unacceptable because we're rewiring our brains all the time.
