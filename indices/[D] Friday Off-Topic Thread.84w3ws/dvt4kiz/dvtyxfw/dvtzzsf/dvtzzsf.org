That was something I believed at one point, but then I discovered that I am a victim of emotional abuse. I have a sibling who demonstrates sights of narcissistic personality disorder and has been the explicit cause of debilitating anxiety attacks for most of my childhood. I needed a dedicated assistant at school to help me calm down.

My life is not better because I have undergone trauma, instead it inflamed to emotional issues I had due to being born with autism and likely contributed to the depression I developed later in life. That kind of pain is something no one should experience, but so many people are vulnerable to it due to circumstances they have no control over.
