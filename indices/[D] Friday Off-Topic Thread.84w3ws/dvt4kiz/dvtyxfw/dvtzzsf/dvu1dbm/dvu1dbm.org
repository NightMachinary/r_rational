Like I said it isn't perfect. Just because it is bad in some circumstances doesn't mean it is bad in all circumstances. Some people having a phobia of dogs doesn't mean people should never be afraid of dogs.

I'd heavily recommendation meditation and pink elephant exercises for learning to ignore and eliminate intrusive thoughts & mental states. I'd also recommend practising graded exposure / systemic desensitisation. Essentially you deliberately expose yourself to (weakened) triggers in a safe situation while keeping yourself calm, gradually escalating the intensity of the triggers as you become better at handling it and able to manage them. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRaeMTVGurY][This video]] gives a demonstration of the process.
