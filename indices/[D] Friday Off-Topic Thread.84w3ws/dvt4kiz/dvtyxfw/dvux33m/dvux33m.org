  I'm an anti-wireheader. I view pain in the map not the territory, as a signal rather than a end in itself. You feel pain when you get hurt because it teaches getting hurt is bad and avoiding it is good. There are people unable to feel pain and they tend to do things like accidentally bite their tongue off without noticing.

I'm a compatibilist wireheader. I don't think the human mind is a simple optimizer-- different parts of our minds want different (although not mutually incompatible) goals. So I think it's possible to both wirehead (fully satisfying the parts of your mind that wants all the tingly neurotransmitters they can get), while also working on other goals.

People always think of insensate lotus-eaters when the term "wireheading" is used, but I think it'll be more like the people who smoke weed, then clean their house-- productive and happy at the same time.
