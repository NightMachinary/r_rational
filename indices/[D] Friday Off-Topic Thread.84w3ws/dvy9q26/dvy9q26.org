The Brain Preservation Foundation has recently announced the [[http://www.brainpreservation.org/large-mammal-announcement/][successful preservation of a large mammal]] brain. This is not a revival experiment, but a preserve-and-verify-with-electron-microscope experiment similar to the [[http://www.brainpreservation.org/asc_rabbit_fulleval/][rabbit brain]] experiment that got a lot of press a couple years ago.

Now a YC startup called [[https://nectome.com][Nectome]] run by Robert McIntyre, the guy behind the rabbit brain experiment, is [[https://www.technologyreview.com/s/610456/a-startup-is-pitching-a-mind-uploading-service-that-is-100-percent-fatal/][pitching]] human preservation within the next few years, and accepting deposits for when they have the capability. Owing to the impracticality of ASC on clinically deceased patients without intact vasculature, this will be restricted to patients covered under assisted suicide laws. Apart from that, it's basically the same deal as cryonics, and no it's not really any more fatal than cryonics (apparently less, from an information theoretic standpoint -- although that's considered a bit hard to measure due to dehydration distortion in cryonics patients).

Also, relative to cryonics, Nectome also has quite a bit more mainstream cred as a research company, considering that it has won about a million dollars in [[https://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=9355699&icde=38525280][grants]] to study whole-brain connectomes, and of course there are expected positive effects of this research that apply outside the realm of brain preservation.
