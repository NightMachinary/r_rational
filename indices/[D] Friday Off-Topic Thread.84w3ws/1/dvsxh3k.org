I came across [[https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/83jdld/the_dream_of_nuclear_fusion_is_on_the_brink_of/dvint1o/][this]] super interesting comment on the state of fusion power. If you have an hour, I highly recommend [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkpqA8yG9T4][this]] talk by the leading MIT scientist.

TLDR: ITER, the 50 billion$ fusion project, is so big because its limited by last generation superconductors - magnetic field strenght of about 5 tesla. Since then, next gen superconductors have become available on Alibaba(!) and go easily up to 10 tesla and higher. The constraint is no longer field strength, but rather magnet coil structural integrity. Internal pressure at those high field strengths makes the magnets implode.

Now, fusion physics has a couple of terms in which magnetic field strength goes in as a power of 3 or even 4. Meaning with this doubling of field strength you get 8 or 16 times better performance - or you can make the reactor smaller by that much.

Very exciting stuff!
