Of course I am! I've read the first half of /Chunin Exam Day/ three times (but the second half, where [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3929411/35][the bashing of Sasuke and Kakashi starts to cross the line /thrice/]] and the boring harem shenanigans start to take over too much of the wordcount, only once) and the entirety of /Partially Kissed Hero/ three times.

I'd rate them---well, not at /five/ out of five stars, but certainly at four and a half.
