Fuck man! This is amazing! Just finished Act 1, and damn! Like, this is the best stuff I've read since Worm! My only complaint is that I got nothing done this weekend because I couldn't put this down! Keep up the good work, because when this ends I will mourn the characters.

already am the Feraligatr, and misty, and maybe Red, although I doubt you'd kill off the main character so quickly... unless Mawile's the real main character.

EDIT: Also, any estimates for when the next arc will be released?
