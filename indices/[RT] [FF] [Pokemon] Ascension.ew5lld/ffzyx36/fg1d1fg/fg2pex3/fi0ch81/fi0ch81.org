If you're okay with some constructive criticism it starts out a bit heavy on the exposition/infodumping. Obviously there's facts about the AU you want to get across early, but launching straight into a biography of professor oak is going to put some people off. Same with the dialogue with Ash and oak, a bit maid and butlery. On the positive side I like the world building itself, but I just think it could be integrated better
