  It's like arguing against creationists, except they happen to have a frightening number of seats in government

True, but tumblr style SJW apparently are common enough in academia. I haven't experienced this directly, but there was the whole Summer's controversy, then the naked man statue censorship fiasco, and, and...there was the power of institutional academia behind that stuff.

Anyway, the way I see it, "my" group, the egalitarian feminist liberals, make up the vast majority of the 1% intellectual elite that rules the world of ideas which actually make a difference to the trajectory of the future (even if they don't rule the world of raw political power or particularly influence ideas at the 50th percentile).

So I'd better be damn welcoming of intelligent criticism and hyper-vigilant for internal evil arising within my hallowed halls. That's what being a liberal is about, really. That's/why/ the world always drifts leftward.

  It's not really his fault that people like those from The Red Pill have linked to his posts in arguments to support their views: with that crowd, "missing the point" is kind of a given.

And so what if they have? Why is that a problem? Sure, they believe a lot of silly things, but are we going to begrudge them the small pieces of their worldview that /do/ have merit?

If the Red Pill folks support a correct argument, that doesn't by proxy strengthen the Red Pill's bad arguments. The Left Hand Path to winning politics is done by re-direction - don't say "the red pill is wrong", just .... feed the Red Pill's good arguments and criticize the Red Pill's bad arguments until the whole thing has transformed into something which is not really that bad. Remember, there /was/ a separatist feminist movement, and there are still trans-exclusionary feminists..."feminst" and "red pill" are just tribal banner headings. Mindkilling is when a person thinks in terms of red and blue to such an extent that a red victory, legitimately won (as is the case with Scott's correct criticisms being vaguely Red-feeling), feels like a loss.
