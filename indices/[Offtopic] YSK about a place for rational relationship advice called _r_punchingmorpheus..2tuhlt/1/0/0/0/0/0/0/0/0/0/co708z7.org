  Is there any way to distinguish lust/liking/possessiveness from capital 'L' Love? It looks to me like love can be supported with a web of friendship and trust and so on to form a strong relationship. But that doesn't sound like the love is the secret ingredient. If anything, that makes it sound like the friendship is the secret ingredient. Is the difference obvious in hindsight? Like, now that you love your current partner, you see that your last partner didn't mean anything to you, not really, not in the same way. But then, even that would sound quite suspicious to me.

Like I said, everyone means something different when they say "I love you."

Some mean "I want to be yours and you be mine forever."

Some mean "I feel happy when I'm with you and think of you and sad when you're not around."

Some mean "Don't leave me, I can't stand the thought of life without you."

Some mean "You make life worth living."

Some mean "You're the best person I've ever met."

Some mean "I accept you for who you are."

Some mean "You accept me for who I am."

Some mean "I like being around you and I find you attractive and we don't fight too much."

And that's just a sample of the people who actually mean the words, of course. Each one also means much more subtle things, like "I will support you no matter what you decide to do, so you're as happy as possible." while others mean "I will be honest with you no matter what the outcome, so you become the best version of yourself."

The best relationships I've seen are those where the two people's definitions match up as closely as possible. If one person means "I find you attractive and like spending time with you," and the other means "Please don't leave me, I need you," there may be problems down the road in terms of space and clingyness.

But if Capital L "Love" is to mean anything as a word separate from any other, in my view, it has to include this:

"I value your life and happiness /at least/ as much as my own."

This removes the romance from it, as it also extends Love to include parents and siblings and children, or even very close friends sometimes.

And ultimately, it's that Love that drives the monogamous narrative, I think. It's the Holy Grail.

Because having just one person you Love and who Loves you means your priorities are straight. For many people, how can you "Love" more than one person that much? Wouldn't you have to choose between them at some points?

That's where a lot of people get stuck, of course, because a lot of people don't value anyone's life and happiness as much as their own, let alone above their own. That doesn't make them bad people, but it does often preclude the traditional, singular, romantic Love of myth and legend.
