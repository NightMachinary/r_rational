  I just realized that romantic comedies must be even more bizarre and irritating to those like yourself than the rest of us. And rest assured, they're incredibly bizarre and irritating to the rest of us.

I haven't actually been driven to violence, but I've definitely fantasized about destroying my TV, yes.

  Honestly, that's because the vast majority of loving relationships are not "Love." They're a mix of lust/liking/possessiveness.

Is there any way to distinguish lust/liking/possessiveness from capital 'L' Love? It looks to me like love can be supported with a web of friendship and trust and so on to form a strong relationship. But that doesn't sound like the love is the secret ingredient. If anything, that makes it sound like the /friendship/ is the secret ingredient. Is the difference obvious in hindsight? Like, now that you love your current partner, you see that your last partner didn't mean anything to you, not really, not in the same way. But then, even that would sound quite suspicious to me.

I have noticed that a lot of romantic language is possessive. Your partner is yours, for you to have and to hold etc. I was kind of hoping that was just an artifact of the language, because taken literally, it's kind of slavery-ish. I mostly just try not to think about it, and give people the benefit of the doubt, but romantic jealousy just looks even more possessive. Honestly, it kind of creeps me out.

  I didn't get jealous no matter what my girlfriend did, and she took that to mean I didn't care about her. She didn't actually sleep with anyone, but she would confess to things like having sexual dreams about others, including my friends, to which I would say "That's fine. You can't control who you're attracted to, let alone who you dream about."

For what it's worth, in this aromantic's opinion, your position is the /obviously correct/ position to take.
