You're describing color to the blind here. My friends get frustrated when they say things like that, and I can only think, "Then... don't do it that way?" Clearly that's not how it works. I mean, I grew up in a culture where marriage is a thing, so I've learned all the rules that evidently are supposed to be natural, but yeah, it's all kind of silly. But even if much of it doesn't come naturally to me, I do understand trust, and empathy, and communication, and often that's enough to build some kind of framework for thinking about any kind of healthy relationship, from lovers to coworkers.
