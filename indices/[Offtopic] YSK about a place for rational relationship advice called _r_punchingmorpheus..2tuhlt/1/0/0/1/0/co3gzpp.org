Eh maybe. I'm schizoid. That comes with being asexual, aromantic, and having a poor grasp of my own emotions. It's possible I've felt something like romantic attraction before and just failed to recognize it, but I don't remember anything that would fit that. If I've had any experience with the feeling at all, it wasn't anything like what most people describe.
