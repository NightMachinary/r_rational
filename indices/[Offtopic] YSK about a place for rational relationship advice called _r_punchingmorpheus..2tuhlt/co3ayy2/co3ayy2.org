This is /fascinating/. And a bit surreal. I'm asexual, you see. I certainly know /of/ romantic and sexual relationships and gender dynamics. My friends talk about them sometimes, so I've developed enough of an abstract understanding to fake having meaningful input. But it's easy for me to forget just how big a deal this all allegedly is.

Here we have /thousands/ of people discussing thoughts and opinions and desires and worldviews and entire emotional spectra that are utterly incomprehensible to me, and its all fundamentally important to them. I've never been immersed in an environment dedicated to that.

You're all crazy. Good crazy, mostly, I guess, but crazy. I'm going to remember this the next time I read about aliens who are less alien than everyone around me.
