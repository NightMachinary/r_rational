Honestly, romance is way more bewildering to me than sexuality. Drugs make sense. But even on calm reflection, lots of people still feel quite strongly about some kind of bizarre exclusive reciprocal siblinghood/friendship-with-benefits 2.0 thing, also gender is important somehow. So even that post is alien to me.

You guys seem to pursue your weird goals reasonably and fairly, and you try to avoid hurting anyone. I know lots of young people who have been burned, but I don't know any old people who regret it. So, hey, have fun!
