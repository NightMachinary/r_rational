  You're communicating better than many. I meant it as an actual metaphor. You're describing experiences that, to the best of my knowledge, I don't have

Excellent, just making sure we're on the same general page :)

  The weird thing is that saying things like that has gotten me in trouble among more emotional company.

The "One True Love" and "Soul Mate" narratives are incredibly strong in our culture. I'd blame a mix of religion and Disney, but those things have just reinforced the ancient mores: keeping the family unit restricted and functional was reinforced by religion as a "sacred" thing, and when that started falling out of favor, Disney and romantic comedies stepped in to give the irreverent a carrot instead of a stick.

(Oh man, I just realized that romantic comedies must be even more bizarre and irritating to those like yourself than the rest of us. And rest assured, they're incredibly bizarre and irritating to the rest of us.)

  Love is said to feel like the strongest relationship in the world, but it looks like one of the weakest, and people act like it's fragile and could easily fall apart.

Honestly, that's because the vast majority of loving relationships are not "Love." They're a mix of lust/liking/possessiveness. Very few are built on a foundation of friendship first, and there are many people who stay in relationships simply because they don't want to be alone.

But because everyone has their own definition of what "I love you" means, and because "love" is the best interpretation of lust/liking/possessiveness, that's what people pattern-match their experiences to, because that's the one that puts themselves in the best light.

  Like half of my closest friends have asked me out, including one who, after a few drinks, freely admits they'd still like to meet someone "like you, but available". I'm not quite sure how I'm supposed to take that, but I've friend-loved the lot of them for like fifteen years.

If you're not looking for an exclusive friendship with the "trappings" of romance, you should take it as a compliment ;)

  My only experience with jealousy is, like, my dog responding more to someone else, and me being very slightly upset for maybe one second. Imagining love-jealous rage is like imagining bad-kerning rage.

Which definitely would be a nice thing for more people. It sucks. Romantic jealousy truly is like an acid dragon writhing in your gut. That said, I've spent so much time and effort slaying mine that I actually might have gone too far for most monogamous relationships: my last one ended in large part because I didn't get jealous no matter what my girlfriend did, and she took that to mean I didn't care about her. She didn't actually sleep with anyone, but she would confess to things like having sexual dreams about others, including my friends, to which I would say "That's fine. You can't control who you're attracted to, let alone who you dream about." So it definitely causes signalling issues to those that are interested in exlusive romance, and OKC is full of profiles who mark that "Jealousy is healthy for a relationship."

  Dating! A pox on whoever invented the thing. I have trouble even pretending to understand it. I've never been able to pin down the actual difference between dating and hanging out, aside from all parties agreeing on what word to use. But I've seen loving couples agree with me on that. The culture of romance is the most incomprehensible.

It really is to everyone. There are so many social taboos and traditions around dating, and almost everyone's self worth is on the line to some degree, that navigating without getting tender bits of one's ego blown off takes extraordinary luck or grace.
