  You're describing color to the blind here.

In that I'm successfully communicating, or not? (That expression is commonly used to mean "wasting time" or "attempting the impossible.")

#+begin_quote
  Clearly that's not how it works.

Yeah, most people can't stop themselves from wanting what they want, especially for something so deeply ingrained at a cultural level, at least. Polyamorists are rare and frowned upon, despite many of them having healthy and happy romantic lives, and culturally polygamy has a terrible image thanks to traditionally male-centric cults that practiced it.

Personally, while some part of me still feels drawn to the "special someone" perspective, I've been able to recognize the value of non-monogamy to the point of feeling open to the possibility. I've yet to meet a girl in meatspace that is too, but think I'd be as happy in either relationship type as long as the people involved are the right ones.

  But even if much of it doesn't come naturally to me, I do understand trust, and empathy, and communication, and often that's enough to build some kind of framework for thinking about any kind of healthy relationship, from lovers to coworkers.

Yeah, trust, empathy and communication go a long way in every relationship :) The peculiarities of romance only matter to others who are specifically looking for them, in which case it's no different than being friends with someone who doesn't reciprocate their romantic/sexual attraction. Since I've managed to have not one but two lifelong friendships with girls I've fallen in love with that didn't reciprocate, I can attest that it doesn't impede the friendship at all as long as the person who does feel the romantic longing is mature and secure enough not to let it.
