You're communicating better than many. I meant it as an actual metaphor. You're describing experiences that, to the best of my knowledge, I don't have, and most of my thoughts are just "Why?" with varying levels of emphasis and incredulity. That's fine, I think, just talking about our respective perspectives.

I understand some natural reluctance towards polyamory. There are historical and cultural reasons, and jealousy is a real emotion that can cause real distress^{1}, no matter how much you would prefer to feel compersion. Even if it is the obvious solution to, like, half of everyone's relationship woes. The weird thing is that saying things like that has gotten me in trouble among more emotional company.

Love is said to /feel/ like the strongest relationship in the world, but it /looks/ like one of the weakest, and people /act/ like it's fragile and could easily fall apart. Some of the less introspective people I've encountered don't just defend their relationship, they defend the /validity/ of their relationship, as if that were in doubt, as if it were all lies and the whole house of cards might fall. I'm pretty sure it's more material than that. Humans are weird. But this behavior is hardly exclusive to love.

  I've managed to have not one but two lifelong friendships with girls I've fallen in love with that didn't reciprocate, I can attest that it doesn't impede the friendship at all as long as the person who does feel the romantic longing is mature and secure enough not to let it.

Oh, tell me about it. Like half of my closest friends have asked me out^{2}, including one who, after a few drinks, freely admits they'd still like to meet someone "like you, but available". I'm not quite sure how I'm supposed to take that, but I've friend-loved the lot of them for like fifteen years.

^{1} My only experience with jealousy is, like, my dog responding more to someone else, and me being very slightly upset for maybe one second. Imagining love-jealous rage is like imagining bad-kerning rage. I can't get into that headspace. I just acknowledge that the sliding scale evidently does go high enough to cause real distress.

^{2} Dating! A pox on whoever invented the thing. I have trouble even pretending to understand it. I've never been able to pin down the actual difference between dating and hanging out, aside from all parties agreeing on what word to use. But I've seen loving couples agree with me on that. The /culture/ of romance is the /most/ incomprehensible.
