It really does sound strange and unappealing when viewed objectively :) I described it like this to someone there once when they were expressing their frustration over having trouble finding a romantic relationship:

      But I never really had to "work" to have friends, yet I don't take them for granted either. Creating and maintaining friendships throughout my life "just happened." With women, I don't know why, but it feels so much different.

    There are in fact a number of differences between romantic relationships and regular friendships that make one much harder than the other.

    For one thing, a romantic relationship is mostly exclusive. Imagine if, of all your friends, you had to choose just one of them to be your only friend, and /they/ had to choose /you/. And as long as you two are friends, you can't do certain fun things with anyone else, and if you're friends long enough, you have to move in together and merge your finances.

    Sounds kind of silly right? I mean even without the sex and physical attraction aspect, friendship would be MUCH harder if it was anywhere near as restrictive as monogomous romantic relationships. That's a large part of why the two feel so different: friends are fairly easy to acquire and maintain, because the stakes are relatively low. The stakes are very high for dating, especially dating for a serious, lasting relationship, which immediately makes it much more competitive and difficult.

It does feel great when it clicks into place. Whether it's worth the heartache and headache involved, of course, is a question that has echoed throughout human history :)
