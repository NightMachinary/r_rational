  But, I do think Scott's idea of feminism seems entirely based off of the internet and not people who live in real life.

This is my impression too, [[http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=2939][and always makes me think of this comic.]] It's mildly frustrating: he does a very good job of making me think "What?! Who the hell says shit like that?" and then immediately following it up with links to people who say shit like that.

Maybe it's because I'm not on Tumblr, but when I see arguments against people who unironically cap their sentences off with "shitlord," I just think "Yeah, those people are pretty crazy alright. Wait... are you taking them seriously? What power do they have, exactly, that makes knocking the stuffing out of their juvenile absurdity worthwhile?"

It's like arguing against creationists, except /they/ happen to have a frightening number of seats in government. When there are congressmen or governors, or hell, even people in academia, using the word "privilege" as sloppily as the people Scott so expertly dissects, then I'll start caring.

All that said, this:

  If you just look at his views and ignore which group he spends the most time criticizing, Scott is more on board with feminism's current party line than many actual self-identified feminists... If a guy like that wants to criticize feminism, I mark it as "internal self criticism" and give it three thumbs up.

Is very true. Hearing his (mostly) excellently formulated and articulated views on the issues is always worth the read. It's not really his fault that people like those from The Red Pill have linked to his posts in arguments to support their views: with that crowd, "missing the point" is kind of a given.

  Anyway, get back to pokemon dude we're all eagerly waiting :P
