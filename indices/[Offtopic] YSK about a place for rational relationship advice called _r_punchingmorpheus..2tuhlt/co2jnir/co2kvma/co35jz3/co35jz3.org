  my one issue with Slate Star Codex is that, if not for its occasional posts about "Social Justice Warriors" and their ilk, I wouldn't waste nearly as much time thinking about them, nor might they be nearly as representative of "actual feminism" or "actual social justice" as Alexander seems to treat them.

Yeah... I don't speak out against that because I feel a sort-of obligation to not complain when someone critiques views I primarily agree with and people I'm kinda-sorta part of. But, I do think Scott's idea of feminism seems entirely based off of the internet and not people who live in real life. (Or, maybe he's in a bay-area bubble such that all the bigotry he encounters is of the left wing variety, and guns-n-god conservatives are like exotic birds or foreign countries you hear about on the news or something)

Still, I consider Scott's criticisms "internal" criticisms, even though he doesn't identify as a feminist or leftist, because he's preeetty obviously on board with all core principles despite protestations to the contrary. And I am a big fan of internal criticisms. If you just look at his views and ignore which group he spends the most time criticizing, Scott is more on board with feminism's current party line than many actual self-identified feminists. He accepts gays, trans (many feminists don't even know what trans is let alone accept it), believes in equal opportunity and egalitarianism and people not being forced into anything or bullied...and that's what it's all about in my book.

If a guy like that wants to criticize feminism, I mark it as "internal self criticism" and give it three thumbs up.

Anyway, get back to pokemon dude we're all eagerly waiting :P
