Honest opinions always welcome!

If you read the sidebar of the subreddit, you'll see that it tries very hard *not* to be reactionary: the name was derived from The Red Pill's metaphor, but it was done tongue-in-cheek, and TalShar has since expressed that he wishes he'd chosen a different one.

I understand your aversion to toxoplasmic petri dishes: ironically enough, my one issue with Slate Star Codex is that, if not for its occasional posts about "Social Justice Warriors" and their ilk, I wouldn't waste nearly as much time thinking about them, nor might they be nearly as representative of "actual feminism" or "actual social justice" as Alexander seems to treat them.

But as stated, the point of [[/r/PunchingMorpheus]] is about relationship advice and discussions of dating/gender first and foremost. There are posts and discussions there where Red Pill is never brought up, and instead we try to listen and help people who have all sorts of difficulties with social dynamics or heartbreak.

My reason for posting it here is that I've often been frustrated by the lack of sane places to discuss such things, and have seen that frustration mirrored in sites like SSC and LW. For those that are looking for such a place, I thought it would be worth the slight detour to see if others can benefit from it :) I understand completely if it holds no interest to anyone here, since it's not related to the subreddit's characteristics.

(Edit: Just want to clarify that I love Slate Star Codex and respect Scott immensely: it's his blog and obviously he can write whatever he likes on it. Was just pointing out that it's hard to avoid giving something negative more presence when trying to fight its influence)
