Honest opinion?

This seems more like re-reactionary politics (reacting against reactionaries) than "rational". What is the relevance of this to people who don't care about theredpill in the first place? Isn't this basically a petri dish for [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/17/the-toxoplasma-of-rage/][toxoplasma]], which only tends to increase the net visibility of extreme views? (You know something is toxoplasma driven when you primarily hear about it from people who dislike it...)

This is not a "boo" for what the subreddit stands for. I "yay" the egalitarian side of gender politics (even if i sometimes cringe at those who yay alongside me), generally think better of you after learning you are a mod for such a subreddit, and so on. I just don't see the relevance here nor the general net benefit of cross pollination.

Remember what happened to Lesswrong after they started entertaining reactionary ideas? To entertain /either/ side of an ideological war is to invite the other side, and then everything of substance drowns in the resulting argument.

10th Law of Power: "avoid infection". I don't usually like the laws of power, but I do think they apply here.
