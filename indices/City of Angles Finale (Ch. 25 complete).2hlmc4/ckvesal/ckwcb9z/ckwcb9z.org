I don't think we actually see the eventual resolution here. I get the impression that the final epilogues are a few days afterward, and that it will probably take Lucid and friends a lot longer to get used to being a coherent triple entity. And that their priority is going to be fixing other dreams before they come back to their home (which they're all reasonably happy with as it is, even if it isn't perfect).

It reminded me somewhat of the ending of Anathem. A lot is finished, and more is going to start, but it's a place where a chapter of the main character's life was over, and everything after it, while inextricably connected, is a different story.
