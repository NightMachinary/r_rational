Edit: I feel like this first post came off a bit too critical, so let me clarify beforehand that I indeed enjoyed this story as a whole (otherwise I would hardly have made it to the last chapter!) and consider it worthy for [[/r/rational]]'s analysis and nitpicking ;). Moreover, some of the points are from prior to the most recent edit of "Exit Interview". That being said:

--------------

The last few chapters get tantalizingly close to rational and rationalist, but never quite make it.

The Angles have the perfect weapon to stop the City in their tracks. With a single Word, a small group manages to liberate the Greasemonkey without firing a shot, in an action spectacularly shown (albeit with a few uncomfortable moments toward the end) to everyone on TV. Against the ruthless enemy with superior firepower who clearly doesn't care about rules of engagement, they then proceed to... use the obvious target as a base. Seriously, did anybody /not/ see where that would lead?

At the cost of no more than printed paper, the strategy should have gone viral, not just in a single street. Instead, it was apparently defeated overnight by the threat of censorship. Riiiight.

--------------

A place that can become whatever one wants it to be sounds wonderful, very close to taking full advantage of the properties of the dream they are living in. While they were at it, they should probably have wished up an automated defense system to take some of the strain off Echo. A field wherein weaponry wouldn't work? Even some strong walls would not have exactly been out of place there, though perhaps in a more City-like form like an impenetrable glass maze. They weren't exactly constrained by real physics, after all. Maybe the aspects were still a little limited by their internal logic, but did none of the refugees have the bright idea after they'd been scared out of their homes by the Citadel?

Bedlam rightfully saw it as a travesty when the stadium and all its potentiality were destroyed, so it also puzzles me that she'd be satisfied with Peneplope's eventual resolution, which was apparently... to do nothing. Maybe "nudge" some people once in a while. That's the happy ending? Having seen the closest-thing-to-a-utopia they'd been able to create with the dream logic, and the heartbreaking loss that resulted from its destruction, I would not have been satisfied until I could recreate it for everyone.
