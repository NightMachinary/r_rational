Hi there! Thank you for reading & replying, I admit I didn't expect that! Mind you, I could not have read through the whole story without enjoying it a decent amount, so thank you for that as well.

My disappointments were from a rational/rationalist stance (not strictly a problem, many decent stories like Canon!Harry Potter aren't rational, but consider the subreddit). Naturally, someone like myself who enjoys Rational!Harry's plots to +dominate+optimize the world can't help but be slightly disappointed with Penelope having the power of a goddess and being satisfied doing little or nothing with it.

Now, perhaps I have the wrong impression, but it seems to me that the aspects /can/ duplicate the stadium event (possibly for the entire city) if they actually wanted to. They still have +El+Indigo with them, Lucid has the power to install city-wide speakers, and we know Miranda kept copies of /some/ Metadream-enhancing music (albeit the Blue-Eyed Plague ones with bad side-effects). In the best case scenario, Echo or the Department of Safety also kept copies of the Memorial Stadium background music (which, having no lyrics, would've been safer than the BEP song) allowing for exact duplication. In the worst case scenario, at least try filtering out the lyrics in the BEP music and, uh, test on a terminally ill volunteer, I suppose, to see whether it can be used as background music for an Optimistic!Indigo song.

Admittedly, that's speculative, and Lucid may or may not be on board considering Penelope's misguided optimism about humans accomplishing things on their own.

About my "Exit Interview" concerns: those strike harder because it seems to me that the revived Seventh Street Gang (and allies) have to be holding the idiot ball to use the Greasemonkey as their base; they /have/ to fear retaliation, and long-range bombardment is a thing. One way this might be fixed is to, in fact, /not/ have them use the Greasemonkey as a base (Jonny was just there to drink out his sorrows). Rather, their sanctuary was decentralized over many of the buildings of Seventh Street, with hidden supply caches and resistance members blending in with the populace, never meeting in the same place twice. Gosh darn it, thinks Commander Yates, who at that point simply orders the Citadel to firebomb all of Seventh Street. HOLY SHIT, says the reader, as well as the Angles who by now have overcome their fear of going outside, hastily making sure there aren't any (as of yet not quite viral enough) Words painted anywhere around their neighborhoods. This gets rid of the idiot ball while making the failure of the Word more realistic - maybe scorched earth censorship can work after all.
