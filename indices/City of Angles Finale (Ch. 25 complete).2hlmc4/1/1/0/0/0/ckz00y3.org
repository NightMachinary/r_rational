Hey, thanks very much for that offer! I'd be happy to accept it, as long as it's not a bother to you (please don't trouble yourself on my account).

I think City of Angles is pretty darn close to Rational (having many of the traits listed in the sidebar), aside from the Seventh Street Gang's Greasemonkey decision that was a bit glaring. Rationalist is a little... different (if you haven't read it yet, I'd wholeheartedly recommend the trope-namer Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality), and arguably includes an moral imperative toward transhumanism that conflicts with Penelope's ideals. One reason why this is an imperative, rather than something Penelope can simply wait around for humans to get right, can be found in [[http://www.nickbostrom.com/fable/dragon.html][The Fable of the Dragon Tyrant]]: [[#s][Spoilers about the main idea]]

[[#s][It may not be a perfect fit to City of Angles as written, but a Rationalist!Penelope would probably]]

That's my take on it, at least.

Again, thank you for your generous offer, and for the story as a whole!
