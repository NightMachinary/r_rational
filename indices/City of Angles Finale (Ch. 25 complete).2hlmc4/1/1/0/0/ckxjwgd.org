I think the difference point here is when you state that Penelope's optimism regarding humanity is misguided.

One of the ongoing themes of the work is optimism, that once the roadblocks of doubt and fear are removed -- ones which cause people to look inward and choose selfish and defensive motivations instead of sensible and community-minded motivations -- people will choose wisely.

This is why Echo choosing to euthanize people for their own good is flawed, and why Bedlam converting people to Picassos for their own good is flawed. Lucid, on the other hand, presents the third option... but allows people to CHOOSE it rather than have it chosen for them. And inevitably, they do, once they're clear of misconceptions.

At risk of spoiling, the upcoming epilogue chapter concerns people re-discovering the tools they need to re-create the stadium, and both how they deal with that discovery and how society reacts to it. But it has to be humanity leading the charge, not the aspects. They have to choose the Lucid path.

I'll admit I don't know if this is rational or rationalist. I feel it's humanist, but whether it meats any other -ist is another matter. When I started these stories, honestly, I didn't know this subreddit existed. I simply wrote what I felt needed to be written. If rational folks enjoy it, that's great; if not, that's okay too.

If you like, I'd be happy to PM you a link to the bonus story. It's retail-only but if it'd help you understand the series better, I'm okay with that. I mean, it's just a few bucks of a lost sale, and I have a good day job. S'cool.

Regarding the Greasemonkey, I'll admit this is a bit of a fault with it, but my justification is the overwhelming sense of victorious pride the rebels felt. With the Word, they felt invincible, and made a symbolic stand on recaptured ground. Unfortunately practical reality set in a day or so later. No doubt other resistance pockets still exist, and the Word still exists, but it's not enough to win the day. Again, this is an ongoing theme of the series; you don't overcome a foe through strength of arms, you overcome a foe by understanding their flaws and dealing with them with cleverness.
