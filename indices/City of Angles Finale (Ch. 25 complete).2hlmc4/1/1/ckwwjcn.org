Hi there, author here. I understand your disappointment and that's fine, obviously not everybody will dig my story. But I'd like to clear up one factual thing.

Bedlam, Penelope, or Echo cannot simply wave-wave-poof and re-create the stadium. It took thousands of people working in tandem to create it in the first place. Echo may have initiated that incident, but it took a massive and communal effort to make it happen.

Ultimately it's not gods that shape the City, but the people who live there; the goal was to get them to a state where they COULD accept the dream and create things like the stadium. That's where the nudges come into play, because mankind has to choose for itself. Best they can do is remove the roadblocks of misdirected fear, despair, and hate which block the way to a rationally chosen future.

You might enjoy the vol//003 book which will be published later this year, which includes an epilogue story that deals directly with the fallout of the stadium and what will become of these ideals.
