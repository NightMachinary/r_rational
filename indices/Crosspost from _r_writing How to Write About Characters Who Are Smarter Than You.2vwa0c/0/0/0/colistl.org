Yeah, I though it was enjoyable. It's a little bit Hollywoodified, in the sense that they set up some historically inaccurate conflicts for the sake of drama, but it does hit some of the highlights, and does make an honest attempt at showing intellectual effort (even if it falls short at times).

My gold standard for fictionalized Turings is /Cryptonimicon/ by Neal Stephenson, where you can tell that Stephenson not only took the effort to actually understand the math and engineering, but also took the effort to knowing all of it well enough to communicate all that stuff to the reader. Film is more difficult, since you're constrained by time. Most of what constrains /The Imitation Game/ is the belief that cognitive conflicts aren't enough to be the center of a movie - instead you need emotional/political/romantic/authority conflicts.
