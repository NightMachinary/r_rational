  This is about the "aesthetic impression of intelligence", not about actual intelligence.

Yeah, as the title says, "How to write /about/ characters who are smarter than you." It's an interesting distinction, since it seems to imply that writing actually smarter characters isn't so much about making sure they actually say or do smart things as it is making sure what intelligence they have is communicated to the reader. Which, in most of fiction, is a good enough first step I suppose: especially since just getting past the whole "Shotgun jargon at the audience and then explain it in simple terms" trope needs to die a fiery death.

  That said, part of the reason that The Imitation Game has a much better intelligence density than other movies is that it draws from history, and that's an easy way to write about characters that are smarter than you, since it's fairly easy to verify intelligence after the fact rather than coming up with your own products of intelligence.

True: I considered watching it because I loved reading about Turing's life and work (and really enjoy Cumberbatch as an actor), but also because I was curious to know if it pushes the envelope in terms of how the intelligence is displayed on screen:

  And The Imitation Game falls into a lot of the intelligence tricks that define a lot of fiction - things like someone being really fast at crosswords (or whatever) in order to show their intelligence in a way that the audience just has to take for granted.

Apparently not. Ah well. Did you enjoy it anyway?
