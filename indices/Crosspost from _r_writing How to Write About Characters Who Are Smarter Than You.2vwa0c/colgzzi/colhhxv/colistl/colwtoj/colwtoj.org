  Yeah, I though it was enjoyable. It's a little bit Hollywoodified, in the sense that they set up some historically inaccurate conflicts for the sake of drama, but it does hit some of the highlights, and does make an honest attempt at showing intellectual effort (even if it falls short at times).

Huh. I hated it, more than any other movie I've watched in years.

It seemed to me to fall into all the standard fallacies about brilliant mathematicians (/ scientists / etc) being antisocial weirdos, which was emphatically not the case for Turing. Then they dropped much of the actually awesome historical context, to insert bullshit plot lines of their own devising. The people are stupid, the organisations are stupid, the plans are stupid, the drama runs of the idiot ball... it looked like the director was allergic to competence. I am confident that I could do far better than the characters, whereas without historical knowledge I couldn't help the real Turing much.

Basically I was intensely disappointed that it wasn't more historically accurate, and offended by many of the changes they made. A movie closely based on Turing's life would have been (IMO) better in every way than the loosely-inspired-by drama that they make.

Then again, I went through Primary and High school reading about this period and others in cryptography books my Grandpa gave me, so I care more than most people...
