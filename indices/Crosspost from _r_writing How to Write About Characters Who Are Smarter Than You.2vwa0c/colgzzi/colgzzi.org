This is about the "aesthetic impression of intelligence", not about actual intelligence. And /The Imitation Game/ falls into a lot of the intelligence tricks that define a lot of fiction - things like someone being really fast at crosswords (or whatever) in order to show their intelligence in a way that the audience just has to take for granted.

And the aesthetic impression of intelligence isn't bad! It's a perfectly fine device if you need to get something across to the audience quickly. But it's not real intelligence.

That said, part of the reason that /The Imitation Game/ has a much better intelligence density than other movies is that it draws from history, and that's an easy way to write about characters that are smarter than you, since it's fairly easy to verify intelligence after the fact rather than coming up with your own products of intelligence.
