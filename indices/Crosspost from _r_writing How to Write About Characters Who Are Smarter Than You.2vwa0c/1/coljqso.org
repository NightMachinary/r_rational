gonna have to agree with alex here. superficial intelligence is obviously something that is required as much as superficial any-other-trait, because the audience has to be told things as well as shown things -- but i don't think that's the type of intelligence most readers of this sub are interested in.

that said, i don't really /want/ to read about characters who are smarter than me. i want to read about characters who are /as smart as/ me. if there is a difficult puzzle that a character solves, or a character has a brilliant insight, but the chain of deduction is entirely inscrutable to me -- well, that's not particularly engaging. i want to read about solutions that did not occur to me in narrative time but would have conceivably occurred to me had i thought about it; the kind of solutions that are sufficiently esoteric to require effort to understand on my part, but not an uncomfortable level of effort.

edit: fixed the god-awful spelling
