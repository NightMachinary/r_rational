to go to actual intelligence rather than the aesthetic impression of intelligence...

I love AI. I love finding out how they work :3

one of the "cheapest," but also really effective way to make an AI opponent more difficult without making it cost more resources is to... well, cheat. like in LoL, the bots have unfair vision of you- they will always ward the brush you're in, 'magically' knowing you're there, making them seem like they're just really intelligent and cautious, when they're actually just cheating.

ok, so you can't write Mr. Smartypants (and if you could, you'd instantly be as smart as him, because whenever you're faced with a problem, you could just go "what would Smartypants do?" and have the answer he'd give) but you can make him smarter by giving him unfair access to information he otherwise couldn't.

...like sherlock holmes. "this particular kind of mud only comes from X place" how does he know? did he research it? did he test it? no, he just lolmagically knew, thus making him more intelligent than otherwise possible. ...when he's really just cheating.
