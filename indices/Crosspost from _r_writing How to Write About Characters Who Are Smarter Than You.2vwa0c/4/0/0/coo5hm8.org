I'm also drawing that distinction, I just didn't explain it very well. it was a mistake to mention holmes, as it gave you the wrong idea

ok- consider the game example. suppose I run two ganks on two bots

Bot A sees me leave my lane since there's minions nearby when I do. he takes my movement speed and the length of statistically likely ganking routes and places a ward in the brush where he estimates me to be at the time he estimates me to be there

bot B just cheats and can see me the whole time, so he places a ward in the brush where I am.

to the player, there's not much difference in behaviour between the two- they both seem just as smart. behind the scenes, bot B uses waaaaaay less memory.

think of it like how DnD handles intelligence: smartypants sits down at a computer and tries to guess the password. behind the scenes, a die is rolled and smartypant's high modifier is added to it. since it is higher than the difficulty check, smartypants now knows the password. from here, there's two options: produce a handwavium reason for knowing it (like holmes) or just give no explanation (like quirrel) (this was my mistake- holmes does this method, but he's more famous for handwaving it- to the point where it's overdone to comic effect. I'm getting at the core idea, not the dressing that disguises it)

why? because surely someone as smart as smartypants would be able to find /some/ way to guess the password, even if the author wouldn't be able to. consider the bots again. there are legitimate ways to tell if you're about to be ganked- pro players do it all the time (it's usually based on the reactions of the opposing players you can see- a weak enemy that's playing aggressively is either a fool or knows his ally is there to back him up) so an sufficiently intelligent bot could too. ...it's just cheaper and easier to cheat.

intelligence, roughly is how good you are at attaining knowledge. to write someone smarter than you, just give knowledge to the character freely, even if they would ordinarily have no way to attain it.
