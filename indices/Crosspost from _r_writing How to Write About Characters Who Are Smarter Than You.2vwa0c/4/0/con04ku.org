I find it interesting that for lots of problems now anyone can just "lolmagically" know things, simply by googling for a few seconds. I wonder if it makes it harder to write knowledgeable characters set in the present. Sure, it's impressive to know that Queen Liliuokalani was the last monarch of Hawaii off the top of your head, but if the read can find this out in 10 seconds it doesn't lend much support to the idea that this character is the smartest man alive or the best investigator in the world etc.

Then again, I personally draw a strong distinction between knowledgeable and smart that most people don't seem to, so maybe it's still an OK (if overplayed) technique for general audiences.
