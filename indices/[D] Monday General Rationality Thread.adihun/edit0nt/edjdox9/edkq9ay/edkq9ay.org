Exactly, the actual steps to succeed are very mundane and boring. Superficially, I am better off than most people, and that's mainly due to my upper middle class parents giving me a good education along with a pinch of luck. My brains were a distant third in determining where I am today. My brother for example, is naturally a far better rational navigator of the real world & that's only partly because he is very smart. He is also more willing that I am to put in the effort to understand regulations, navigate bureacracy & fill out forms.
