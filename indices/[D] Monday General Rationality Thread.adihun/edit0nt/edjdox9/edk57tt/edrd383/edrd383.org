Move, either to a different country or to small town where competition is lesser and every opportunity hasn't been taken yet. Or just play a different game, maybe you're better suited for a different area. The top is far easier to reach if you have a competitive advantage, be it talent, early start, resources, contacts, skills etc.

Besides there's no point in trying to argue with some low level government secretary / attendant. Even if you stomp them, they'll just call their boss over and he'll tell you that's not how it works, you are mistaken, that source is outdated, this is a very recent change..

​

Exploits and opportunities exist IRL but they are mostly available in the business world, not in the employee scene. Opportunity is out there, it just takes either a lot of work, time, risk or money, and possibly all of them to get it.

​

It's mostly a matter of risk, and using rationality to choose the most optimal risks to take, without risking failing so hard you can't get back up again..
