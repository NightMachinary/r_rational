That's exactly what I did by moving to the US as soon as I got the chance, and slowly drifting into the kind of work that I like. But I still find it necessary to deal with bureaucracy back home. I'm too old to be making big waves, but it's fun to look at the world through the eyes of smarter people and understand what I've missed.
