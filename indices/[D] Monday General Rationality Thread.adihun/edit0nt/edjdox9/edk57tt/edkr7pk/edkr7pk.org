Agree completely. That's why I put 'rational' in quotes. I have read EY's Newcomb link, but a refresher won't hurt. I just don't like dealing with people and that puts me at a disadvantage. Terminal values can also put constraints.

Thanks for the Money Mustache link. This subject is very dear to me. Would love to retire earlier. A few wrinkles I want to point out from my experience as an older person (since most [[/r/rational]] people I assume are younger than me):

1. Your expenses depend on your dependents too. Kids, aging parents, etc. If you retire single and then meet your SO and get married and have kids, that can change the equation.

2. Living in a country where inflation rates can increase significantly will also throw a wrench in the works.

3. Your medical expenses will increase as you get older. This can dramatically alter the equation.
