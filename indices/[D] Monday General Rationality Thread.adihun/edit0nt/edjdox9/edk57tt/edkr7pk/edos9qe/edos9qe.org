Ahh all good then, I guess if it's a matter of preference and not of lack of ability then that makes things harder as it is a lot easier to train yourself to be better socially than it is to train yourself to like it.

I do agree with your first point, I guess you have to plan for "I want to be able to spend x each year" rather than "I currently spend x each year"

About the second and third they are covered in [[https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/05/29/how-much-do-i-need-for-retirement/][this]] fairly well in that the 4% rule survived the big inflation rates in the 70's. I must admit that location makes a difference in that I'm not sure this would have worked if you owned only, say, Japanese shares considering the shit they've gone through recently. To plan for that sort of thing though you simply buy a mix of international shares.
