I sometimes wonder if over-consumption of fiction is actually unhealthy (at least for myself) for this exact reason.

Sometimes I spend a considerable amount of time reading stories or imagining scenarios in my head that seem more preferable and easier to game than real life. And of course imagining a world in which you're better equipped to achieve success doesn't actually make you more successful in the real world.

The problem with some rational fiction, is that it assumes that there are significant unsolved problems that will give a single person an advantage over other people if solved. And often times this just isn't the case in real life. In most cases, if there's a loop-hole someone's already exploited it to the point where it needed to be closed. If there's a more efficient method to do something, it's probably already common practice or you'll find that it costs more to execute than you gain from using it. It's still good to examine things and make sure you're doing them in the most rational way possible, but the people who find new improvements in old fields are by far the exception, not the rule.

I think the hard truth is that it's the people with the most resources or the people who are most naturally skilled (at whatever they're trying to do) who are most likely to succeed. And the only way you can realistically increase your chances of success is to pursue goals that play to your current strengths and incrementally increase your own resources and skills where possible.

And all that sounds a lot less appealing than doing some brief calculations and figuring out the optimal route in life. Or being able to point out some fallacy that someone else is using and surpass them by avoiding it.
