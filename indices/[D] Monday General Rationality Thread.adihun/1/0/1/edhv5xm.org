I specified it because I, and I assume everyone, already sees a ton of American media everywhere. American media for the most part to me doesn't seem nationalistic because it doesn't need to be. You cannot fake your country being the most powerful in the world when it is the most powerful in the world. Seoul or Tokyo would be a weird place for aliens to invade, Washington DC or New York would be realistic first strike locations.

Not that there aren't hypernationalistic American media, just that relative to the total volume of American media it's rare.
