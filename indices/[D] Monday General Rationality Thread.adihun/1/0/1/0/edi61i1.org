Tokyo is a pretty sensible place to invade, actually. It's one of the A1 world cities, along with NY, London, Shanghai, and whatever the fifth one is (I forget.) Plus, it would be pretty sensible for the aliens to invade a mountainous island archipelago. They'd have orbital superiority and therefore total freedom of movement, but any counterattacking force would have to deal with Japan's highly defensible terrain.
