  Rational agents should WIN.

Calling the people who are making the wrong decisions to get ahead in life "rational" just because they try to think like stereotypical "rationalist" characters is a fallacy. It is similar to the average person thinking of "rational" people as emotionless and spouting statistics to 3 decimal places rather than simply people who make smart choices.

If people see that who you know is more important than what you know and use that to achieve there goals that is rational. Complaining that it shouldn't be that way and not getting what you want is not.
