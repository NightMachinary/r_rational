This Money Mustache not the first guy to spout this type of nonsense. I could argue with you how 5% returns after inflation is pretty much impossible after taxes and fees. Or how it has too many dependencies on things you can't control like market fluctuations and all that type of stuff. Or even how it's focused on defense and saving when you should be focusing on making more instead, so you can save 5% of 1 million instead of 5% of 100k.

​

But I won't so here's a post to do it for me: [[https://www.thefastlaneforum.com/community/threads/from-fire-to-dire.86108/]]

Rich people don't waste time saving money, that's a futile effort. It's much more productive to spend that time finding ways to make MORE money instead. Mainly because there's no limit to it, if you make X even if you somehow save 100% of X you still can only make X. But there's technically no limit to how much more money you can make.
