This will sound ranty. I have this crippling sense of helplessness when dealing with the real world in general and Asian bureaucracy in particular, in stark contrast to the elegance displayed by rational heroes. The world seems explicitly anti-munchkin. A rational hero typically reads the rules, be it physical, magical or legal and then comes up with a clever exploit. Guess what, my home country doesn't work that way. Regulations are subject to the whims of corrupt officials. The most basic govt. services requires knowing the “right person”. Socially skilled people who are willing to “grind and level up” do far better than someone socially awkward no matter how ‘rational' they may be. How does one go about exploiting rules when the rules are interpreted at the whim of some incompetent govt. or bank official. It's deeply frustrating. Almost everyone I know is better at this stuff than I am. And the skill required is basically a willingness to accept huge opportunity cost in running through the system like a lab rat.
