For non-Americans, how nationalistic is your country's media? This is a topic I've been thinking a bit about lately. I'm in Canada and our media isn't very nationalistic at all, regardless of whether its state produced or by Canadian writers. It's often set in Canada or at least has Canadian characters, but that's about it. The fact that it's set in Canada may even entirely go over your head if you miss a few minutes/paragraphs.

By contrast, the light novels, manga, and anime from Japan and Korea I've read are often much more nationalistic. The small scale slice-of-life stories often talk about how great Japanese/Korean food and deserts are. The larger scale urban fantasy stories often have Korea/Japan be the premier world power that can defeat countries like the USA or China.
