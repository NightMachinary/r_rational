The obvious meaning of the notes here is that Su has known about this issue since well before the beginning of the story. So now it is being revealed to us.

Though the bit about a scene being not produced for us is very weird. Like I get why the letters might give us the info we need in a better way, but..hmm. Maybe I am over thinking it.
