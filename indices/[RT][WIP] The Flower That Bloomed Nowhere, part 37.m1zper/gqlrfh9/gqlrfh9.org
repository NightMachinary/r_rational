You know, I can't help but wonder if it was intentional to make Su study a discipline focused on entropy given that her own problem is somewhat 'entropic' in nature as (it seems) her identities are irreversibly mixing together. Even if it had once been possible to separate them out - will it be now?

For example, Su clearly associates more with the person-from-the-flashbacks. On the other hand, I think (but am not 100% sure) that her weird math skills and other general prodigiousness is from the person named Utsushikome (the person from the flashbacks seemed to struggle with academics).
