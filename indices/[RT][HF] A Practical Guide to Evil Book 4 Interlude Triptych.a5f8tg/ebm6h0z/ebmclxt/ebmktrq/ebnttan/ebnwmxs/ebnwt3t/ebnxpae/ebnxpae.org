  “Catherine Foundling died at Second Liesse,” the Warlock gently said. “What walked out of that fortress is an impression of the young woman made on the fabric of Winter, no more and no less. I'm sorry, Masego. I really am. I know you liked her. But even if the Black Queen believes she's the same person, she is not. Amadeus didn't realize it either, he doesn't have the learning. But he described what happened in the city to me. There can be no doubt.”

There IS now an undeniable "Cat", Warlock thought she was merely facsimile made of winter.
