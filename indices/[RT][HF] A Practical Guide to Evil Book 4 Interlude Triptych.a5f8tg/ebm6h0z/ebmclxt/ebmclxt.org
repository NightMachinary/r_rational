So many things here.

The Dead King is amazing as always. He feels like the kind of video game mid-game boss you cry after defeating, because the dude had /Class/ and now you're left with the crappy villain with the dumb motivations. Except that he's undefeated and closer in power to the optional late-game superboss.

Cat doesn't seem to have a Name, title or anything but she can do magic (?) and still feels confident enough to walk to the Herald of the Deep and chat with him. Most importantly, she can light her pipe herself. It only took four books.

Archer still MIA. Please.

Akua is still a ghost, but now she's a Winter free one. She's becoming more dangerous by the chapter. I mean, she was acting like a Good girl but at least Winter was there to be an Evil influence on her. Now there's nothing and if you can't trust her to be Evil, you can't trust her at all.

Edit: reading the comments on EE's site made me realize I'm stupid. Sve Noc has ascended and chosen Catherine as her priestess. Cat isn't doing magic, she's doing miracles. Miracles of Winter Night sound more like fairy tales stuff than something you would light a pipe with but you should always bet on Cat to remove the wonder and romanticism out of anything.

Edit2: more stuff. The Dwarves' kleptomania appears to be some sort of racial mental illness rather than a cultural thing. At least, it's common enough to have a name and disruptive enough to consider controlling.

The Heroes at Cleves are obviously the White Knight and the Witch of the Woods. Some major shit is going down there if the two hardest hitters of the crusade are here.
