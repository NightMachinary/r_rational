  Sad to see the end of Hannoven, but they were quite badass in the face of death, and their young will live on.

And this is exactly why no Heroes came to save them. The Story was too good to have a cop-out "and then heroes came and saved everyone"-ending. This is the stereotypical bastion of badasses that fell, but their children will swear vengeance and probably produce several Heroes down the line.

Seeing their history it's probably not the first time this pattern occurs, much like Callow.
