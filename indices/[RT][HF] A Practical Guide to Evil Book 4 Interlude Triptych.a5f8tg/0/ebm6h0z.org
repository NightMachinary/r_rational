Love the conversation between Papenheim and the Dead King. Friedrich is proud that the Dead King remembers his line, and the Dead King is cordial and polite to the dying man.

It's wonderful how you can have a friendly conversation with a mortal enemy, before returning to merciless total war. It's almost like a play.
