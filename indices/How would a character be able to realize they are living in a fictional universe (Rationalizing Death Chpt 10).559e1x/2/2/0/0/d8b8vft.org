I think most authors usually elide over the content of textbooks, except when they're meaningless technobabble or a factoid that's part of the plot.

Harry Potter, for example. Hermione spends her days reading books on magical theory. But the theory doesn't exist. If she tried to think of a contradiction between what they predict and reality, her brain would supply a fatuous "prediction" on the spot, pre-designed to be harmless and fit the worldbuilding.

  Well, Eardhart's Extinguishing Draught famously appears to conflict with Johnson's law, that the composites of a unique poison are always made from non-poisons themselves, but that was explained in 1973 by Magwalt Humdinger as a result of several of the components not being true poisons, but more accurately classified venoms that employ debilitating magical effects. That's only a theory, though, Humdinger's classification system was never experimentally verified.

That's not even the author deliberately placing a thumb on the scales (which they could do, of course, if they entered into conflict with the character); her universe just fundamentally /operates/ on rules like "X is governed by very complex sciency rules that must be learned, offscreen, in order to understand it". You can't appeal to a textbook

Meanwhile, Neo's universe does have some science - not computer science, but there's biology and physics and you can discuss them in some detail, because it's a sci-fi story.

But the world doesn't have conservation of energy, because the authors forgot/deliberately ignored it. If he looks up "can humans produce more energy than they take in", he will find that it's a well-known fact they produce X watts of net energy output.

There's /science/ - he can ask why animals didn't evolve to eat each other, for example, and learn that the sun provides much more energy than animal biology does so it's more efficient to eat plants or use solar panels. But the only way he's going to learn about /conservation of energy/, the real world concept, is if the author is genuinely too stupid to spot the contradiction and puts it in supporting, say, the reason they can't use antigravity thingies to build a perpetual motion machine.
