Well, that's all very interesting and you make a good point that I largely agree with, but you also seem to be saying that you know your viewpoint if applied as in the original example would not lead to a better world and you're okay with that because the thought process you used to get there is more appealing to you (and also to humanity). If you're essentially saying that you are not the sort of person who is suited to rationality then that's fine in and of itself, but it's not really very good when applied as a defence of a conclusion.
