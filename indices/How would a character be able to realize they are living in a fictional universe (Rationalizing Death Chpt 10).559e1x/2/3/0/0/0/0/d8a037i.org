I think I see where you're coming from, but I think that - if the AI's designed correctly, which is definitely a big "if" - individual human's autonomy wouldn't be much more abridged than it already is by society. I as an individual am already surrendering a lot of my self-determination to society in exchange for a whole lot of benefits, and on the whole I'm pleased with the transaction. A good AI running society would probably give me an even better bargain.

Or are you valuing human autonomy in a social sense, in which case we'd probably need to agree to disagree on our different values?
