That's based around a certain theory of how an AI might work, since if you could find a more efficient neural architecture for it than the human brain it could think better than humans. That said, what you said is my main argument against that model. I just don't think intelligence works that way and even if I did, I don't understand why anyone would want to create an optimizer AI anyway.
