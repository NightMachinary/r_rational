It's possible to write a character marginally smarter than the writer, by using smarter-than-the-writer sources/assistance, or having a character arrive at conclusions faster than the writer would or on fewer clues or skimpier evidence.

Far more difficult to write a character /noticeably/ smarter than the writer, though, unless you're having a significantly smarter person (or group) actively providing input on the character's thoughts/actions/reasoning, and the writer is less involved in that aspect and more in integrating the result into the rest of the story.
