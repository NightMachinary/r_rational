Another option is to look for flaws in the simulation. If it runs in the physical universe then it's limited (in terms of processor power and memory) to something less complex than the real universe. It may not be possible to notice it; if it's accurate enough then there won't be any human-perceptible flaws. Likewise, if the author can tune your mind in real time then you won't ever be able to remember noticing it because zie will just cut the memory out and make you think something else instead.

Assuming it's possible to notice, then things that could give it away might include: minor clipping errors, improper rendering of complex things like hair when moving quickly / in a windstorm, vision cones that don't quite update quite fast enough and therefore leave a flash of blackness at the edge of your vision when you turn around quickly enough, or improper rendering in reflections. Likewise, if some of the people around you are NPCs then you might be able to notice overly simplistic behaviors, especially in complex environments with lots of people where the processor has trouble keeping up.
