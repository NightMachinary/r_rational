I don't understand what it means for a character to be living in a fictional universe. A fictional universe doesn't contain any characters; it contains depictions of characters. Normally this distinction doesn't matter, of course, but it matters here.

The best I can come up with is "if the description of this fictional universe described an actual universe, would a character in it be able to recognize that his universe matches a description that was used as fiction".

I understand the question if you replace "fictional universe" with "simulation", but I'm not convinced that what we normally refer to as a fictional universe is a simulation in a relevant way.
