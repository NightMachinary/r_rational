Yes; the trivial and always correct answer to "how does a character realize they're fictional" is "the author decides that they do". A fictional character may never notice that they're fictional against the author's will, rational fiction included - if it becomes apparent that anyone rational would realize that they were fictional, the author may avoid it and preserve rationality by retroactively changing past events to make it less obvious, and this in fact produces a more rational story, not a less rational one, by the standards of most.
