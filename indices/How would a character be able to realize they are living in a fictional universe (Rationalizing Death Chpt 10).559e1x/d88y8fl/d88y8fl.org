At most they would develop /strong suspicions/ about it, because there is no way for them to distinguish and prove whether it's a fictional universe, a simulation (which would be a more perfect version of the former), an unknown natural phenomenon, magic, or something else that's behind all the things they are observing that makes them think about being a fictional entity / in a story.

As to how they would get such suspicions in the first place:

- inconsistency --- FeepingCreature's answer is one example of this: the character's background knowledge about the world is in conflict with their personal experiences. Examples: Harry Potter, Naruto, SCP Foundation, Bible, etc. In all of these, if a character was to sit down and carefully analyse the laws of their universe and the current state of their society / existence, they would realise that the map of the world is inaccurate or incomplete in at least /some/ manner.

- genre savviness: one of the easiest cases is when the protag starts to notice silly fanservice tropes happening all around them.

- while philosophising / developing their worldview / starting to ask existential questions to themselves: some characters wouldn't need any specific strong prior experiences to start believing that they are, in fact, characters thought by someone else. If people in our world can wonder whether they're being part of someone else's dream / thoughts ([[http://www.dreamviews.com/beyond-dreaming/94402-we-may-all-inside-dream-sleeping-god.html][1,]] [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamApocalypse][2,]] etc) then so can fictional characters.
