  Senario1: A person develops something akin to D&D sorcerer powers. They allow themselves to be tested. A few months gives some exciting new hypothesis about physics and such, a few years sees the codification of laws we'd never noticed or misunderstood. Similar powers never manifest in anyone else but the new laws of physics we derived from them hold up in all real world experimentation we devised. - I'd imagine the vast majority of people would just chalk it up to science we don't understand yet, as what we were able to work out holds up and advanced some of our areas of understanding.

Yes, but when that apparently happened back in the 70's, in [spoiler] Ra, it turned out to actually be a [even spoilier] real-life retcon by future humanity wielding sufficiently advanced technology, all of it still operating under standard physics[/spoilers]
