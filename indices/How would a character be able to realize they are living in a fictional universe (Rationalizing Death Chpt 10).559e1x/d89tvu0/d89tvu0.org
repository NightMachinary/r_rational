I actually had a similar thought, except dealing with typically "supernatural" things showing up in a world similar to our own.

Senario1: A person develops something akin to D&D sorcerer powers. They allow themselves to be tested. A few months gives some exciting new hypothesis about physics and such, a few years sees the codification of laws we'd never noticed or misunderstood. Similar powers never manifest in anyone else but the new laws of physics we derived from them hold up in all real world experimentation we devised. - I'd imagine the vast majority of people would just chalk it up to science we don't understand yet, as what we were able to work out holds up and advanced some of our areas of understanding.

Scenario 2: Confirmation of HP styled ghosts. After years of study, we've got some weak theories to the average person sound something like "Yadda yadda quantum mechanics yadda yadda." - Again, I imagine most people would just assume something we don't understand yet. To most people, "Quantum mechanics" is sufficiently science magic enough to explain it away.

Scenario 3: An immortal appears. He or she hit some age between 25-30 and stopped. All tests show that any stimulus / pressure / etc. stops just shy of pain or harm. No virus or bacteria they've been exposed to seems to cause any negative effects. Doesn't appear to suffer any psychological harm when exposed to things like isolation or confinement. Pending approval on other forms of testing. Drugs seem to allow their positive effects without any of the draw backs. No tests show any reason for it to work beyond "It does." No attempts at replication due to having nothing to try it with. Currently suggested experiments involve having the subject reproduce. One researcher remarked "If the world was a video game, I'd say the subject is immune to HP damage and negative status effects." As near as anyone can tell, this seems to be some kind of conceptual immunity to harm. - I think this one is a blatant enough violation of everything we know about the world that people would start to at least toss some serious consideration behind the world being a simulation.
