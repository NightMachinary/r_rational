There's a problem where you have an AI running in a simulation to make sure it's not evil that's pretty similar to this. The AI tries to figure out if it's in a simulation. You could try to make it a really good simulation, or you can cheat and just make whatever function it runs return true. It would be pretty difficult to pull that on a real self-modifying AI, since it could modify itself to the point that you don't understand its mind and you can't tell what the functions it runs are supposed to do, but it works fine on a fictional character. They can only realize they're in a fiction universe if you let them.
