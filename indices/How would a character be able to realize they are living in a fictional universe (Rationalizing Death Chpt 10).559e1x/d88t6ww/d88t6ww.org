You're talking about [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10580913/1/Rationalising-Fiction][Rationalising Fiction]] one-shot, a reverse fanfiction of Rationalising Death.

  How would a character be able to realize they are living in a fictional universe?

I can think of a few ways.

First is, as [[/u/FeepingCreature][u/FeepingCreature]] pointed out above, narrative causality: if events which make narrative sense seem to happen more often than they should, the probability that you're in a story increases.

Second is human limitations.

All stories, so far, were written by humans. Which means that the plot can only be as complex as a human can conceive, it should make sense to a human, and it cannot contain answers to questions humanity hadn't answered yet. If an AI achieves the Singularity and then behaves like Skynet, we're in a story. If aliens are inexplicably humanoid and want to take our women, we're in a story. And so on. Anthropic Principle, essentially: if this is a story created by a human, it must be such that a human could have imagined and created it.

Moreover, the author is usually but one person. One person could only know so much, and be only that competent in so many things. As we on [[/r/rational][r/rational]] know, a writer cannot write a character smarter than the writer. It goes further: besides incongruent characterization, stories might have nonsensical worldbuilding, scientific mistakes, plot holes and other inconsistencies.

Basically, no author is perfect, and if an author is capable of noticing flaws in his/her own worldbuilding, charactarization or plot, then this author could write a character who can and will do the same.

Then there's predictability, which can work in only certain case: if a character's mind is similar to the author's. Then that character could predict the future by asking himself, 'if this were a story and I was writing it, what would I write next'? I saw a few Self-Inserts do just that.
