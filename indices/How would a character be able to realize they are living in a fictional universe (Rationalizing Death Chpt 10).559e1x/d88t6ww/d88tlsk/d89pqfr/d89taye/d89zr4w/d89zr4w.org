That idea has always sounded to me like "let's create God", which I dislike because I think it conflicts with my value of human autonomy even if the AI is benevolent. I'm all for transforming humanity into gods, but I'm opposed to the idea of surrendering our self determination to a god.

You can argue that a properly designed AI would take that into account in order to satisfy us, but I still disapprove of the reason for creating it. It always sounds like you're giving up on humanity and deciding we should create something better than humans to take care of us all. Even if I could do that, I wouldn't.
