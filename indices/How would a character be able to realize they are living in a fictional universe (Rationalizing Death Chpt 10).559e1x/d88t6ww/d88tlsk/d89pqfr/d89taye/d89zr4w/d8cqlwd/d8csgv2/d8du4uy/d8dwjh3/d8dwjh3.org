I do not believe that thinking in black and white like that is useful for a discussion of moral values. I have seen many rationalists, including Yudkowsky, discussing utilitarian morality as if any logical person would agree with them on what the right thing to do is. After reading The Righteous Mind by Jonathan Haidt, I no longer believe that human moral values can be modeled that simply.

It isn't just a matter of overcoming biases, it's about dealing with psychological predispositions that have been ingrained by natural selection. Some people find it easy to think like pure utilitarians, but many do not and possibly cannot because evolution has made us implicitly value things that helped our species survive when we were just tribes of hunter-gatherers. Going against that grain may seem rational, but not everyone is psychologically capable of doing it.
