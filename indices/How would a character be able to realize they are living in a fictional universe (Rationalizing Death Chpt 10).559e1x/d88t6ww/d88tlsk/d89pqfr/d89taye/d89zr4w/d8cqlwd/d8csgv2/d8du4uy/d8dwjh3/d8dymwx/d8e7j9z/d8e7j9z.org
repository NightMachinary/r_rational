Haidt really does explain it better and has evidence to back it up, but I'll try my best. Basically humans likely have genetic predispositions toward following the moral philosophy that their social group identifies with, while also rejecting the philosophy espoused by other groups, because that trait helped the group to survive. It's not Belief in Belief, it's actual belief that lies at the core of human social instincts.

The reason why rationalists/utilitarians have trouble understanding moralities different from their own is because they are the product of a culture disproportionately made up of wealthy educated liberals. In fact, the default way in which humans think about morality is to make impulsive decisions and then rationalize them afterward, and that's actually a good thing for our species to survive.

Haidt goes on to develop a new model of human morality and identifies six separate metrics by which we instinctively rate actions, of which utilitarianism is only based around one. Most philsophies, including religions, appeal to all six metrics so the cohesiveness of groups built around them tend to be stronger even when members understand that they have no empirical reason to believe as they do.

The lesson I got from this is that rationalists are not an island of sanity in a world of madness, just people who found it easy to think differently from others that happened to be very useful. I believe this has resulted in a inaccurate portrait of the human mind that sees irrationality as a bug rather than a feature. We can still teach people to overcome their biases, but we can't convince people to abandon their convictions.
