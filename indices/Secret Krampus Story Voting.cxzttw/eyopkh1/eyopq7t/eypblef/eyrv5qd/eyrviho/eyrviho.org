Yes, I hope people read the comments and don't miss out on the complete story! When I thought it was just the first chapter, I was disappointed because it felt incomplete. I might not have caught it if I hadn't noticed later on that the word count implied a much longer story than the one I'd read. I thoroughly enjoyed the work as a whole, so hopefully everyone who reads it gets to read the entire thing.
