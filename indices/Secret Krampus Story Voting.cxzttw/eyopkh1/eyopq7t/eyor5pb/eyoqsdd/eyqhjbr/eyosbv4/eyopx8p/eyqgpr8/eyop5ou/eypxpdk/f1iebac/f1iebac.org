(*TL;DR at the bottom.* I'm basically gonna use this comment to rant about my own story; your comment is just where it all happened to come spilling out of me.) :)

I'm glad you liked it! That's actually kind of a relief to read, because truth be told, I wasn't pleased with the way it turned out overall. I procrastinated a little bit trying to come with story ideas, and then I think the story suffered from a lack of planning.

The seed of this story was just something I jotted down in my brainstorming document, something like "A character's legs fall asleep on the toilet and they have to escape a serial killer." The idea was kinda lighthearted and goofy, and it /seemed/ to fit the prompt well enough. I had this Scary Movie-esque mental image of someone pulling themselves down a hallway all overdramatically with a killer stalking behind them all slow and menacing - but, like, funny. Because... toilet.

I came up with the "bursts of stupidity" thing and the "trapped in a horror movie thing" as twin catalysts to move the story along to the beat of a standard horror movie. I thought I'd be all clever and have the bursts of stupidity be an actual tangible element in the story rather than just having stupid characters - and, considering this is [[/r/rational]], I figured a rational character could /recognize/ when she was being unusually stupid and then try to account for it.

But then when I started writing the actual story, I realized that the rational tone I was trying to strike didn't fit with the goofy story I'd hoped to tell in the first place. I could only pick one, and given what sub we're on, the rational tone felt like the indispensable one. Even that first ridiculous mental image of the girl and the killer in the hallway didn't work, because in a rational story, the killer would just walk up to her, slash her throat, and walk away. This gave rise to a new problem in that /that image/ (now cut from the story) was really the only thing linking this story to the prompt I'd been given!

I played up the "escape" angle to try and fool people into thinking the story had something to do with the prompt. That's why the story starts with that particular line and then flashes back, that's why I named it "/Escape/" - to try and make it seem like there was some sort of travel happening, even if just in the reader's subconscious. I felt a little bit bad because I really did like my prompt, but I was too deep in it now and had procrastinated too long to change course. Near the end of writing, I actually realized the story would be better (more natural, more satisfying, more subversive of horror movies, more... feminist?) if my character got the jump on the killer and took him down, but then the "travel" content of the story would drop from, oh, about 3% to almost literally zero. So as much as I wanted that ending, I stuck with my original one.

The end result is something that's too serious to be silly, too silly to be taken serious. It's trying too hard to fit a prompt that clearly no longer applies to it even remotely, and it feels scattered and unfocused as a result. Even the basic prose felt lackluster most of the time.

*TL;DR:* The story got away from me.
