I'm wondering if there's a binary message in the pattern of breaths, but I can't figure out how that information would be broadcast, so maybe that's not it.

The ending implies that whatever he does is shocking, possibly self-injurious and/or taboo. So I'm trying to think of something shocking he could do to communicate the GPS's binary message to anyone outside of where they were being held, but there doesn't seem to be anything in the story other than the GPS itself that can send information out, and the the whole reason the character does whatever he does is because he's worried that the GPS might not work. I think I'm missing something key.
