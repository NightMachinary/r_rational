This is what I got toward the end: an AI meant to virtualize and thus save humanity from the end of the world is confronted by a human from our era who came out of some sort of stasis. The human at first misunderstands but later aids the AI, leading to the part that fulfills the prompt. It was nebulous enough, and the motives hidden long enough, that I didn't get it until toward the end, hence why I consider this to be in the “ontological mystery” meta-genre, like Lost or Ruby Quest.
