Thank you. To be perfectly honest, I wrote the entire thing Saturday morning right before the deadline (kinda forgot I was in this contest), and I think some of the logic isn't quite whole, mainly in the middle sections. I took this from a different much longer story I had planned, which would explain some of the logic and ideas better, but I think it also worked as a short story in a strange way. Though, I'm curious, why do you feel the ontological part was a surprise? I thought I kinda laid it out from the get-go.
