The answer: Protagonist assumes some information leakage when captors contact authorities to show proof that he is alive.

Details and excuses follow. Basically, the above logic should have been included in the text and I have no justification for why it was not. I was too busy optimizing words and missed the forest, or something. Sorry. I left the ending vague because I think it's more fun to think what the protagonist could have possibly done. Basically, if he assumes visual information leakage, body horror is a "good" option. If auditory, he may try to force visual by trying to remain silent, until he gets non-lethally shot or tortured. He may also try to talk in a weird way. Or alternatives. (Breathing was intended to set the mood, no hidden depth, though it does sound cool.)
