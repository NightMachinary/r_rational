Thanks While brainstorming for this story. I realized there was a lot of potential for munchkinery with the prompt. However most of the applications for such power would be negative. So sure my character could have committed crimes and got away with them. That route just didn't inspire me. I needed to know why my character did what they did and committing crimes did not fit in the peaceful society I imagined. I was more interested in asking what are the consequences to society in a world that's telepathic. I imagined people would be a lot more compassionate and understanding. That there wouldn't really be any major taboos of discussion. Then I asked how would my character fit into that world. What would they want?

The story was originally going to be a lot longer and focused on the performances they were giving. As it turns out having a show where you can't just read the performers thoughts is a bit of novelty. And the communities reaction to it.

I however procrastinated and ran out of time. I realized that what I wrote did work as a story albeit different from what I had originally planned.
