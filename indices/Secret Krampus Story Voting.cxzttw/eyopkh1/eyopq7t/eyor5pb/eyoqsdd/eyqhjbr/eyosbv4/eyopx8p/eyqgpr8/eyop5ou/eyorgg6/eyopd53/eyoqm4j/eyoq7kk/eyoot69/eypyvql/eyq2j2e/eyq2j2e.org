Same. It sounds intriguing, but I have absolutely no idea what the guy did. The only thing close to clues I could imagine were that the guy was important (had guards), the recurring mention of breathing, a way of widely sending binary information, the implication that said way was horrific/unexpected, and that the guy survived in the end, which eliminates my initial thought of some body horror. Hope the author comes in with the intended solution or something.
