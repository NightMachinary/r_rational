Thank you! I /probably/ wouldn't revisit the story since I'm pretty busy with life stuff right now, but hey, never say never.

Congratulations on taking home the gold (er, platinum) by the way! I haven't found the time to read your story yet, but the reviews are so glowing I'm really excited to read it when I do get a chance.
