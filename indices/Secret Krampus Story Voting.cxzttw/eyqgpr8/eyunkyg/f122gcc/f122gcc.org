*Author's worldbuilding notes:*

Tillane of House Jinia, second son of the second son, and a Onceborn, converted to this religion against his family's wishes. He is sixty years old this past Janyra (month).

He works as facilities manager of Jinia's College of Wellkeeping, where acolytes learn physical and psychological nursing skills -- wellkeeping of mind, body, and heart. His House is renowned land-wide for its skilled wellkeepers. (Think of a trade college campus, focused on nursing and psych.)

You Only Live Once is a slur against the Onceborns, adherents of the Message of Adael the Once and Future. He was a moral teacher who started a movement of love and morality. Adael was executed, quartered by four bulls, his limbs hung on the city gates for a day and a morning per the tradition, falsely convicted of the crime of plotting to blow up the Repository of Souls (colloquially known as The Cloud) after making the very public claim that he could revive people from death, not just reincarnate them. This was a hundred and forty years ago next Myra (month).

There are a handful of other religions, and their adherents are looked on as devotees who seek wisdom, not people who genuinely believe in a concrete spirit world or an afterlife. None of those religions shun being Born Again (reincarnated via a process similar to Joss Whedon's Dollhouse). Primarily, though, most of the people who run the government are Adeists, nonbelievers. No Onceborn has ever been elected to the House Councils of the Land of Sundor, and they plan to keep it that way for both biased and unbiased reasons.

The primary civic works architectural style is tribal brutalist concrete, with ziggurats. The weather is tropical with constant hurricanes. The people of Sundor are mostly Native American in appearance, but largely suburban American in culture. The Land (country) of Sundor has five provinces, New Movada being the most Arizona-like province (state), Kinkad being the settlement (city).

The rationalist focus, both in the prompt and in my story, is bias. The people who run the government think themselves rationalists /because/ they shun spirituality, but are blind to their biased unwillingness to allow people with other points of view to represent them, let alone make decisions on their behalf.
