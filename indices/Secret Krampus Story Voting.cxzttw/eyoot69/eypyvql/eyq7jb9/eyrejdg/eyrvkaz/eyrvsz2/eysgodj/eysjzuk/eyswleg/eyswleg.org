I think that's a fair criticism. When you post to a “rational fiction” audience, your title is essentially “information”, and your story finishes with an open-ended cliffhanger, most people would expect it to be a solvable mystery from the clues provided. The correct answer being essentially “I dunno how it worked but it did and it was gross yo” is a pretty unsatisfying end.
