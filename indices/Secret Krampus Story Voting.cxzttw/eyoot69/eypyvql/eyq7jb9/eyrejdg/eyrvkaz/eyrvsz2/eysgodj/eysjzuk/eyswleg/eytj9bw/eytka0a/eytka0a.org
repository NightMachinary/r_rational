Ah, I meant correct as “what actually happened in the story” not “the ideal response”. For me it was not about the taboo/horrific thing being explicitly described, just there wasn't /any/ taboo/horrific thing we could have guessed correctly. Looking at the story again without the expectation of it being a solvabls mystery made it a more pleasant experience, so I think the main issue was the audience's assumption of the kind of story it would be.
