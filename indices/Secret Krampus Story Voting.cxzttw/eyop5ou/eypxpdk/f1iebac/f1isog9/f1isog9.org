I extremely relate to the self-criticism here. I /loathed/ my entry for probably 70% of the time I spent writing it. Just remember that almost everyone is extra-harsh on their own writing, and you gotta account for that when modeling how your readers are judging it (almost universally less harshly than you). Every flaw feels super obvious and magnified, which is useful for identifying areas to improve but an unfair measuring stick for how to /feel/ about our work and ourselves. You wrote a solid, fun, complete story that a minimum of 12 people verifiably enjoyed, and I hope you're giving yourself credit for that!

I will add--it would be fun to see your ideal version of this story where you're not beholden to the prompt! Do you see yourself editing and re-posting it later on?
