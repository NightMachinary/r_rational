Prompt: It's said there are a million keys in the City of Locks, and twice as many doors. The Picker Guild tries to force their way through the doors with ingenious devices and working knowledge of the locks, while the Keysmiths sort and catalog every key found. The Cannoneers take a different path, trying their best to blast through walls and circumvent the doors, but their successes have been few, and they've raised the animosity of every other faction. Lastly, there are the enigmatic City Locksmiths, the lockers of doors.
