True, the RaNaNoWriMo was very interesting to begin with and IRL meet-ups seem like they could really help the community grow stronger locally.

However, after thinking about it for a while, I feel that better community organization around worthy causes may be a more marketable idea just in general.

By promoting and working with/on the [[https://centreforeffectivealtruism.org/][Center for Effective Altruism]]'s various associated groups such as [[http://www.givewell.org/][Give Well]], [[https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/][Giving What We Can]], the [[http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/][Life You Can Save]], among others, so that we can better exemplify rational values in the real world by gaming the system, getting things done and getting the world out while collaborating with like-minded persons.

Clearly these pre-existing organizations also desire that the general public be made more aware of rational thinking, as evidenced by the [[http://www.effective-altruism.com/ea/68/effective_altruism_outreach_plans/][Effective Altruism Outreach Plans]] under consideration at this time, so why don't we try and work with them?

We already promote stories about [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10503877/1/The-Amazing-Peter-Parker][The Amazing Peter Parker]] so why not stand by those ideals and help to create practical, real world changes that people can really appreciate.

Bronies and Reddit as a whole have become well known for championing their own causes and have gradually been recieved by the general population with a greater level of acceptance because of that, so why not our online community?

It's worth a shot, right?
