  So I guess the real question is how do you think you can best apply yourself to keep the ball rolling where you are how do we connect the dots so everyone else can do much the same given their own individual circumstances.

Well, at the risk of sounding repetitive, I think that at least trying to get something published in the traditional industry is a great first step. It doesn't take much work to convert a doc to Standard Manuscript Format and then submit it online to one of the dozens of paying markets.

As for how we can help each other, maybe a writing group wherein we read and critique each other's works isn't a terrible idea. I joined a local SF writer's group about a year ago and it has improved my writing tremendously in a relatively short time. This sort of thing has quite a venerable history behind it. Tolkien and Lewis were [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inklings][in a writer's group]] when High Fantasy as we know it was invented, and IIRC Gibson, Sterling, and others did something similar when they created Cyberpunk.
