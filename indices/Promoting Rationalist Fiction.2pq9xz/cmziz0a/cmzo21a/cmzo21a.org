I think it'd be cool to have a recognized Rationalist genre. And I think it'd have more influence if it was a recognized genre. There are a lot of novels and stories nowadays that have Steampunk influences, even if they aren't Steampunk. There's even (heaven forbid) a lot of stories that have Dystopian YA Romance influences, even if they aren't Dystopian YA Romance stories, simply because it is a thing. /Tons/ of darker fic is influenced by the popularity of Lovecraft fic. You can even see New Weird streaks influencing standard storylines, which is really neat.

I'd like to see more works of all stripes be influenced by rationality - I think it would make the stories themselves better, and I hope it helps nudge the sanity waterline a bit - and that influence comes from having a full-fledged Rationalist Genre.
