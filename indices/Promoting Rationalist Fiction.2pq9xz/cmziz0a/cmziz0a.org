Why would we promote it? In broad experience (as in, someone in my local LW meetup group actually bothered to measure), people basically either /do/ have the necessary personality traits to be a science nerd/rationalist type, or they /don't/. There are some traits that add up to a "proto-rationalist personality". Most others do not.

If you're trying to "raise the sanity waterline", what you /really/ want is to promote rational thinking in media works /not/ marked or marketed as "rational", which are exciting to /normal people/ for /their/ reasons.
