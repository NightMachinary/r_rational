It can't hurt to promote it. Pushing for raising the sanity waterline is great, and one of the ways to push is to get works of art out in front of the public which endorse rational thinking.

If in the Glorious SuperFuture(tm) there's no need for a "rationalist" genre because everything's generally rational, then hooray! But for now it's not a bad thing to band these works together and present them to folks.
