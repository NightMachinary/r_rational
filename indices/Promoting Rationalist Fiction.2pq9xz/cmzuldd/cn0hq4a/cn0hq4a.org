Well we could always try to one-up the Twilight fanfic writers that reworked /Fifty Shades of Grey/ with wild success using our own "Bayesian Conspiracy" that creates independent publishers and aids in the rebranding of popular fanfictions into original works.

The Transformative Works and Culture article "[[http://journal.transformativeworks.org/index.php/twc/article/view/501/422][Fifty Shades of Fan Labor]]" goes into this somewhat, but primarily discusses how fandoms become divided when pre-existing gift economies are undermine by more traditional capitalistic economies where major works cease to be available to the community as a whole, a betraying of loyalties and lose of trust that can greatly shake fanfiction communities.

Now if we could sidestep some of those issues I think that this whole set up could give us a lot of valuable exposure

But before we get to that stage we could try promoting pre-existing proto-rationalist works, get some rationality specific writing circles and doujinshi-style convention circuits going where possible, promote improved education efforts, sponsor some rational charity events, work our ways up in select publishing houses, and start holding panels on at minor then major conventions relating to fan culture and rational fiction, and then we will have secured for ourselves a solid platform for the promotion of rational fiction in general.

If we build this stuff up properly I think we have a real shot at getting rational fics on the map.
