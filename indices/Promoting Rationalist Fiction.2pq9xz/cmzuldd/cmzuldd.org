I'll admit I'm a newbie 'round these parts; I've got two non-fanfic rational works [[http://stefangagne.com/floatingpoint][here]] and [[http://stefangagne.com/cityofangles][here]] and that's it. But I can speak to the experience of being an independent author in general, and the difficulty promoting your work.

"Web Originals" or "Web Novels" or "Web Serial Novels" or whatever variant you like have exposure problems, because they're generally completely independent works which don't follow any traditional publishing channels. Few have eBook and fewer have print book availability, so they're overlooked by the fiction community as a whole. Lack of editors is another issue, as many can't afford to hire on an editor and rely on crowdsourced editing. (I do a mixture of the two.) The end result is a book which isn't quite polished, isn't available in standard formats, and isn't /seen/ as a result.

I can think of two things that may help rationalist authors. Authors in general, really.

One, if the community bands together to assemble a resource list for would-be authors to dip into, with tips for proofing and publishing and releasing. There's a number of tools like Kindle and CreateSpace out there which make the process easier than you'd think.

Two, if the community bands together to promote the stories they love outside of [[/r/rational]], to other communities and other forums. I watch my web traffic like a hawk and whenever someone posts to some random webcomic's forum I see a traffic spike. Anything that can be done to raise awareness raises the overall profile of a story and gets more eyes on the work.

Once more rational fic "beachheads" are established and awareness is raised and materials are available, its status as a genre may be raised as well.

This will be a rough road, though. I've been at it for twenty years now and I've yet to figure out the ideal formula despite tons of experimentation with formats, release methods, promotional avenues, etc. I welcome any suggestions from other authors or readers for how folks can get their work out there and pushed as a cohesive genre.
