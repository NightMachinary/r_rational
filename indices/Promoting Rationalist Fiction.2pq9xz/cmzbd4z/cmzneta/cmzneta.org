I don't think fanfic is a problem. Exhibit A: HPMoR. But there's critically-accepted/acclaimed fanfic works in the industry. Watts's "[[http://clarkesworldmagazine.com/watts_01_10/][The Things]]" and Scalzi's "[[http://www.amazon.com/Redshirts-A-Novel-Three-Codas/dp/1491514388][Redshirts]]" are both fanfic, and they were both nominated for the Hugo Award (Scalzi won his, and Watts /should/ have won, but was robbed). SF fans aren't strangers to fanfic.

And fanfic isn't a requirement by any stretch. Sword of Good, Three Worlds Collide, Study of Anglophysics, and Last Christmas are all good non-fanfic rationalist works.

Publishing is hard, and takes ages. I dread the day I finish a novel, because I know it'll be years before anyone else will see it even though it's done and ready! I've delayed starting one partly for that reason. But it can force us to up our game. And IMHO the benefits are worth it.
