There's a big problem, and that problem's name is fanfic.

If you go to look at the rationalist canon, to the extent that such a thing exists, something like 90% of it is fanfic. Speaking in general terms, fanfic has very little respect. A fair amount of the reason for this is that fanfic is also relatively devoid of editors, and the average quality suffers a lot as a result. But it's also because so much of what falls into the category of fanfic is utter garbage in other ways - stuff that you could never publish in a million years, even if the work were in the public domain. Fanfic is not something that most people want to have their name attached to, either as readers or as writers. (This is probably where someone quotes Sturgeon's Law at me, but I'm not a big believer in that.)

So if you want to go with the current rationalist canon, you'd have to defend fanfic at every turn. If you've recommended HPMOR to people, you've probably already had to say, "No, but this is one of the good ones", or maybe even give some explanation of what fanfic /is/, which inherently detracts from the recommendation. You'd end up fighting a war on two fronts, which is bad strategy.

I don't know. Publishing is hard, and if you're going through the traditional routes, it takes a lot of time. So if I were to finish up my manuscript and get it into its final form /today/, it would still be three or four years before it saw print, assuming that I could even find an agent or publisher. And then people /here/, would argue about whether it even fits in the genre (which might be in question since I don't tend to think about genre while writing).
