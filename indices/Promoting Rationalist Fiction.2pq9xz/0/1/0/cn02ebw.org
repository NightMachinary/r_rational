Publishing through a dead-tree publisher is ridiculously hard, but my understanding is that publishing on Amazon is much easier -- write it, you can post it. "Getting published" shouldn't be the difficult step.

The difficult step is "writing something that people want to read." That requires three things:

1. Imagination sufficient to come up with a good plot / characters / etc
2. Writing chops enough to realize those ideas
3. A lot of effort fixing the mechanics of the story -- proofreading, etc

Then you also have the issue of promotion. The value of a publishing house is /not/ that they put the words onto paper for you, their value is in the QA and promotion that they provide. They have finite time, a stable of writers that they've worked with before and can be confident will produce profitable work, and a vastly oversized slushpile of new authors, so it's hard to break in. If one can handle the QA and promotion though, publishing is relatively straightforward.

And yes, I'm aware that I've just handwaved off a huge amount of work. :> I've got a romance novel that I've been editing for /months/. I've done easily a dozen passes and I keep finding typos, grammar errors, and missing words. It's infuriating. I have *incredible* respect for professional editors. I don't know how they do it.
