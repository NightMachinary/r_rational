I don't really have anyone to ask that of -- specifically, no one with the skills + time + good enough relationship. I can find any two of the three, but not all three. Also, since I publish every week and haven't managed to build a buffer, it would require unreasonably tight turnaround times.

I don't know that I will have a buffer anytime in the foreseeable future, either, since the majority of my time will be devoted to writing for filthy lucre. ;>
