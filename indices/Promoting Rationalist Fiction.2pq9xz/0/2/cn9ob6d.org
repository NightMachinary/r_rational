Not to mention, most fanfic is speculative fiction. Speculative fiction lives in the speculative fiction ghetto. Fanfic lives in double-ghetto land.

Anyway, examples of epistemically rationalist canon: Worm, Pact, Ra. Although Ra isn't /very/ rational, just mostly.

Instrumentally rationalist fiction is hard to come upon, unfortunately. But writing such as speculative fiction emphasizing it's importance is fairly easy: give the main character motivation superpowers, like never growing bored and never needing sleep, and write a story about that.
