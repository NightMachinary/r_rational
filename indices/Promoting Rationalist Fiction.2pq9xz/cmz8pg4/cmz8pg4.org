I think we need to go back to our E.Y. roots and consider the parameters of the question you are actually asking so we can better identify a solution that actually meets those conditions.

So what are all of the conditions that define the problem that we need to take under consideration before arriving at a meaningful conclusion? Let's set some end goals here.

For instance, we want the public at large to be aware of rational fiction as a genre, but are their any preferences regarding how should we be known?

Steampunk is recognizable for its style and real world meet-ups, memorabilia, and major works involving alternate histories and Victorian era influences all around with off-shoots into dieselpunk and many others.

How might this apply to rationalist works? What are the defining characteristics of our "brand" that we would like to advertise to the general populous and what barriers might we have to overcome in order to do such?

The current tagging system proposes a number of useful short-hands for posible early points of contention, such as the differences between rational and rationalist, but we'll ignore those for now and look at the major categories of works that our community regularly findings interest in.

We see preferred genres that take their rules very seriously, as shown by the emphasis on hard science fiction and hard fantasy genres. And to better make use of these hard rule sets most prominent rational works allow for a certain level of deconstruction and munchkinry, granting the characters a more realistic level of self-awareness and general competence which the reader finds engaging and relatable.

More importantly though, these various actions that the characters follow through with are something that the reader can actually understand from the beginning in a realistic or practical sense. I would even go so far as to say that these themes can motivate the readers themselves to feel motivated and take on their day to day life in much the same way.

May even be what motivates our community to feature non-fictional works or educational pieces, they let us get a better recognize how this world works and we might better recognize and orient ourselves with respect to it and be the best we can be and from there build up higher goals using the things that we've learned from that process.

And if things like that are what our little community represents and we want to encourage its continued growth and wider recognition by the general population we need to better exemplify those ideas by being more successful while making those ideals more accessible to the public so that the works we feel exemplify those ideals can be more successful. Maybe network a bit so we can spread the word, put in the hours, and see what happens.

As far as I can tell, that'll be good for each member of our ranks individually and if we properly apply ourselves it could raise up the entire community.

So I guess the real question is how do you think you can best apply yourself to keep the ball rolling where you are how do we connect the dots so everyone else can do much the same given their own individual circumstances.
