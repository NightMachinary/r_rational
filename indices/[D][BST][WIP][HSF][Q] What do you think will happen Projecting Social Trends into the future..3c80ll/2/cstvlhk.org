The better question is: what are you trying to make happen?

But let me add one thing: the world will eventually just shut up and learn to deal with financial turmoil in a sensible way. Trends that can't continue, won't; debts that /can't/ be paid, /won't/ be. How can a future society deal with today's nonstop economic crises (usually involving investment bankers pumping up asset bubbles or raw commodity prices oscillating) in a sensible way?
