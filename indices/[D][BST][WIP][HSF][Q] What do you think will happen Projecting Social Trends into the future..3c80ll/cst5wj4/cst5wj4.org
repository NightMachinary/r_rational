Charles Stross has said that building a plausible near-future should be 85% known knowns, 10% known unknowns, and 5% unknown unknowns. (He uses a slightly different formula based on how far into the future, but that's not really important.)

So ... the known knowns are your social trends. These are the things that you can predict just by looking at what we know about where things are going. We can predict that gays will be more accepted in twenty years than they are today -- this doesn't take any special insights, just a look at the trendlines. We can guess that the United States of America will probably still exist; that's not even a terribly conservative estimate.

The known unknowns are a bit more tricky; we know that there are children being born /today/ who will be twenty years old in twenty years, and we can be fairly sure that they won't be carbon-copies of the either forty or fifty year old parents. We know that we don't know how those children are going to see the world; we /do/ know that they'll probably have access to better wearable computers, better interfaces for interacting with those computers, some form of virtual reality, and that most of them won't be driving cars. Some of them will go further than their parents in terms of "social justice", but it's hard to come up with something that makes sense which doesn't also sound faintly ridiculous to our ears. It's also possible that the next generation (or even the current one, given time) will have some sort of backlash against current trends. This are the things that we know we don't know -- but they're still on our radar.

The unknown unknowns are a sticking point. If you were in 1970 looking at where gay culture would be in 1990, you might have imagined a television show which featured a gay main character (though you would have been a little early), or pride marches becoming a regular, well-established tradition following Stonewall just the year before. But you would have been certain to completely miss the AIDS epidemic and what that would do to both the perception of gays and gay culture itself. AIDS was an unknown unknown in 1970.

If you want to make a plausible future, you need unknown unknowns. You need some small percent of things that weren't possible to predict with any accuracy. Without them, you're just making the future "like today, but moreso", which doesn't properly sell the strangeness of the future.
