By the way, this is why I get stress-ball-requiring levels of pissed off when someone points at the dilophosaurs' unique fictional traits in Jurassic Park as an inaccuracy. That's among the most scientifically sound parts of the book/movie - we cannot possibly expect to know /everything/ about dinosaurs; many features of animals simply are not preserved.
