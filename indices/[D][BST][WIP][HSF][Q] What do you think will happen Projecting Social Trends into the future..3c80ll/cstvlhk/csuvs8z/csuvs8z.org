"Financial Repression". Currently, finance has an utterly scary grip on the consensus economic understanding of the political class, but this is unstable, because the policies enacted run heavily counter to the obvious interests of almost the entire electorate. - Once some polity somewhere. Anywhere, Defects from TINA and regulates finance into oblivion, and prospers thereby (which they will.) a lot of governments are going to either change their tune or get voted out of existence.

This will have unforeseen knock-on effects. If the only party to run on a platform of "Nationalize the banks and end austerity" is the pirate party then that is going to lead to amusing IP laws...
