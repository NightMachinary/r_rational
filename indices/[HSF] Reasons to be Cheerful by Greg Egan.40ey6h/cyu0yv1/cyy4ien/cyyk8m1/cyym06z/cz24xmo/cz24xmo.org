Seconded. Just because goals can be arbitrary doesn't mean they're not meaningful. If there's something you really want to do, like "be happy" or "help people" or "have fun" or "have good relationships", then that's reason enough to do it, even if there isn't another reason behind that reason.

And if you had the ability to change what you really wanted to do, to something you otherwise wouldn't want, then that's a really hard decision to make. Like, what do you want to want to do? What do you want to want to want to do? If you make it a goal to change your goals, but you don't know what goals to change and to what, then you would need to determine what goals you want to change to. But in order to change what you want, you need to change what you want to change what you want.

To be honest, I think that the only reason one would want to mess with their utility function like that would be if there was something they wanted to do that they knew they could never do, either because it is trumped by more important goals or because they simply don't have the skills or resources etc.

Then again, it would also be useful for someone to recover from an addiction. Give this ability to someone who's trying to quit smoking and they'd probably never touch a cigarette again.
