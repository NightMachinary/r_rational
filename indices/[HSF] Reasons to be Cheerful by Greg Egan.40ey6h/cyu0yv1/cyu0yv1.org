It was a very good read.

It also launched me into armchair (read: uninformed) philosophy. Happiness is arbitrary. Therefore, it may be meaningless? Does this mean one must strive for something else than being happy in life? If so, what? All goals I know about either make me happy or make me happy because they make someone else happy.

After all, if we're bags of cells that call themselves self-aware, that is not meaningful either. We're all like the protagonist, except we cannot consciously move our sliders.

It would appeal to my coolness scale if Greg Egan had not given the protagonist a name. It only appears once anyways.
