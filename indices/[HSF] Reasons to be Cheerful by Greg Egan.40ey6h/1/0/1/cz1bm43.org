I mean, you could, but why would you want that instead of something else?

This reminds me of LessWrong's Metaethics sequence, e.g. [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/rn/no_universally_compelling_arguments/][No Universally Compelling Argument]]. If you can tweak your own pleasure center, you could motivate yourself into becoming the man of your dreams, but *you need to have dreams first*. This power is only ridiculously overpowered when in the right hands.
