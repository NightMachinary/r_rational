Yeah, it's ridiculously overpowered when you really think about it, you just need to let go of your preconceived notions of what life is supposed to be like, unlike protagonist. Theoretically you could single-handedly lauch humanity in new and exciting directions of research and engineering, just rewire your brain for that. Everything we see in the world is a result of humans responding to their environmental incentives - with that ability you could have a true rationalists, choosing underfunded areas of development, where human attention easily strays away and thus progress is hard to make.

I'm not saying it would be a cakewalk, but I can't even imagine the range of possibilities since I'm looking at it from my human perspective and that would be game-breaker.
