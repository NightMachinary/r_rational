  It also launched me into armchair (read: uninformed) philosophy. Happiness is arbitrary. Therefore, it may be meaningless? Does this mean one must strive for something else than being happy in life? If so, what? All goals I know about either make me happy or make me happy because they make someone else happy.

Things can be arbitrary and meaningful. In fact, since all attempts at "a priori" reasoning are ultimately based in axioms chosen arbitrarily because they happen to seem useful, all "logical" reasoning /must/ be arbitrary.

Or perhaps you just need a new definition of "arbitrary".
