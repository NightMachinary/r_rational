To someone who literally considers themselves a three-pound sack of fluid, fat, and neurotransmitters and has no particular problem with it, this is not particularly existential or dreadful. [[#s][]]

  I read voraciously, and on one level I could make clear judgments: I could pick the clumsy writers from the skilled, the honest from the fakers, the platitudinous from the inspired. But the prosthesis still wanted me to enjoy everything, to embrace everything, to diffuse out across the dusty shelves until I was no one at all, a ghost in the Library of Babel.

This, and Beethoven, I have some objections with. Bar practical reasons (interference with non-hedonic terminal goals, if there are such a thing? or simply prioritized terminal goals?), why would you ever want to decrease your enjoyment of something? You're strictly limiting your expected value of experience. I want to be /more/ eclectic than my already-pathologically-eclectic self, not less. The times I come to enjoy some new genre of music or art or fetish is a joy in itself to me, because the world can make me happier without ever having changed.
