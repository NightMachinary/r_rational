We talked about it early on as quite a few people requested it, but transcription is /super/ time intensive. Industry standard (so, professionals) work at about one hour per 15 minutes of speech. Which means somewhere between 2-4 hours per episode.

Maybe if our fanbase is ever big enough I'll ask people who want to to transcript episodes. If everyone takes one, just 31 people need to volunteer to catch up to where we are currently, which is a lot less daunting than one or two people spending ~90 hours transcribing the whole thing.
