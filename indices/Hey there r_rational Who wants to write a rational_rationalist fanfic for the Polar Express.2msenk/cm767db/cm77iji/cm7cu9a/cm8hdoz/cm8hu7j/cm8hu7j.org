The first large-fraction-of 2YE was written while I was holding down a full-time job. I resigned back in April 2014 and have been on sabbatical since. I traveled around the northeast USA and went to Australia, writing while traveling. My current goal is to write enough that I can actually start to make some notable passive income from it.

Also, I'm currently planning to move to Malaysia so that I can reduce expenses while I work on this. Although I might end up moving to my sweetheart's city instead; the rent there seems to be only slightly more than in George Town, Penang.
