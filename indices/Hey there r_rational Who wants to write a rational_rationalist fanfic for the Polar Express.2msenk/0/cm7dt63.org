I haven't seen the movie, but I have read the book.

The book has a time skip between the end of the story and a last-sentence coda that's /begging/ to be filled in by the rationalist fic. There are no plot holes along the road to him having his magic bell which rings with a sound audible only to those who believe in Santa, a fact that proves it to be magic (and can be tested on his friends who are skeptics, to prove it's not really just an age thing). The presence of the bell, of course, is most readily explained if his experience on the train and at the North Pole is entirely real.

But this raises a truly fascinating question: why, if Santa is real, do his parents not believe? Where the hell do they think the presents come from? Is their model of reality supported by any evidence at all? If not, how did they come to possess it, when presumably they were believers as children? But if so, what is that evidence, and how can it be reconciled with the actual existence of Santa?

Anyone who has answers to this has a truly compelling story on their hands of a child who, before the book itself even began, believed in putting his thoughts about Santa to the test, applying this tendency to the above questions.
