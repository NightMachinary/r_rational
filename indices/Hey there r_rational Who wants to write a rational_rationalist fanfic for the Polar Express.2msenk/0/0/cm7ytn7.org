  But this raises a truly fascinating question: why, if Santa is real, do his parents not believe? Where the hell do they think the presents come from? Is their model of reality supported by any evidence at all? If not, how did they come to possess it, when presumably they were believers as children? But if so, what is that evidence, and how can it be reconciled with the actual existence of Santa?

If you are looking for a coherent answer for a story, may I suggest the mechanic from Wildbow's Pact. The supernatural exists and has a regular effect, however events are retroactively rewritten in the memories of people so things seem mundane. The innocent (i.e. children) are immune to this affect, but only because they will rationalize and reject the memory as they turn into adults anyway.

Consider the case of Santa giving every child an extra gift: The mom sees an extra gift and assumes the dad gave it. The dad sees an extra gift and assumes the mom gave it. If they asked each other, they might think the other lying or joking about not giving it. If they really asked and trusted each other it might seem out of place... and then they would rationalize it as being a gift left-over from the previous year, or they might fabricate a memory together of one of them buying it. For poor families it is even easier, the gift must be a donation from the local church or charitable organization. The veil that conceals magic from the mundane might even alter their receipts to contain an extra gift if they really looked for it. Only someone who is really observant and really trusts their memory might realize the existence of the supernatural from evidence that always seems explainable by the mundane.

The experience with the bell could act as a catalyst that draws the protagonist into a supernatural world, as they refuse to rationalize it as something mundane or to just accept magic as is. From there, you could cross it over with your own original setting or with an existing setting with supernatural rules that are similar enough.
