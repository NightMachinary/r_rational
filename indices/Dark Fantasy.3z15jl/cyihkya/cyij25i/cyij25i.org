I read the first two books of that series. I admit I really liked how the stuff in his world was connected and made sense, the reason I didn't read the third book is... Well you are still reading the second no reason to spoiler it for you.

Also reading his book made me think of the Orson Scott Card's book about how to write fantasy.
