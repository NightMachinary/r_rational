I'm in the middle of reading the Mistborn novels right now, so I'm very biased, but it kind of sort of fits your bill? The first book really sets the stage: "Mistborn: The Final Empire". It takes place in a super-dystopia literally ruled by a god-like tyrant. The setting is very dark, and the book has its fair share of brutality, but I don't know if it's quite as dark as you want. The author does not dodge to avoid gore or horror, but at the same time the novel does follow a hero...

However, I will say that Brandon Sanderson (the author) is one of the most /superb/ world-builders. Everything makes sense and is touched on at nearly every level - for example, how the magic affects politics, society, culture, all the way down to the layman. I won't go into the details here, but... gosh. I'm midway through the second book and I'm only glad I waited until after college finals to pick this up because I don't know how I would have managed otherwise.

If you haven't already heard of it and discarded it, I would highly recommend checking them out.
