Not sure this qualifies but I'll throw it out there anyways. [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22500562-fimbulwinter]] has witches. It's about a guy transported to another version of earth by a goddess. An earth that's starting to go into an ice age as the gods are going to war. She wants him to be her champion. The mechanics of the transportation let him pick his magical affinities. It's far more munchkiny/wish-fulfillment than rational. Also tons of sex. Oh yah I should mention that it has a harem.
