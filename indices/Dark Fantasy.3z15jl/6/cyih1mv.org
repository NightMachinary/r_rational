I'm not sure my world qualifies as Dark Fantasy in general, and there certainly aren't any imps or witches with cauldrons. But, the book I am writing follows a bunch of people who wake up at the gates of a ruin city that used to be Evil Capitol. So... the Dark stuff is all in the past, and the characters are just trying to survive/loot the place/figure out who brought them there. Even so, they discover a lot about how the magic wielding, skull-architecture obsessed Bad society worked. Much of it isn't dark, like permanent space twisting and industrialised alchemy, but there is also... uh...dark stuff. Not Black Magic, as that doesn't exist as a separate thing, but things like research journals describing all the magical science they managed to get out of a less wasteful holocaust, to the thought police and social engineering. It will hopefully qualify as a rational setting. It won't stray very far into rational/ist/ territory, though.
