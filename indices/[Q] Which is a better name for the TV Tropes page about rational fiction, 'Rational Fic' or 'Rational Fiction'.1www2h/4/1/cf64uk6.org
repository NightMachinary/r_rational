  I'm not sure if it's that good because it kinda makes it sound a bit like every other fiction is horribly irrational and dumb

Some of us already identify as "rationalist" which has the horrible implication of other people being horribly irrational. I think I can stomach a tv-tropes page called "Rational Fiction". But if that seems too terrible, we could always use "Rationalist Fiction", fiction written by and for rationalists.
