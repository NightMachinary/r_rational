The thing is, Fic has now become the suffix denoting a type of fan fiction. Fix Fic, for example, or Slash Fic. The other wiki says that "fic" itself is an abbreviation of Fanfiction; and certainly that's how it's used. On top of which, the mere fact of Fic being an abbreviation gives it a sort of unofficial, all-comers-welcome sort of a feel, which prompts associations with unpublished, un-"professional" work.

So, we should only use "fic" if we mean to indicate fanfiction primarily; unless we're trying to promote linguistic change, which doesn't seem to be our aim, and would complicate things unnecessarily.
