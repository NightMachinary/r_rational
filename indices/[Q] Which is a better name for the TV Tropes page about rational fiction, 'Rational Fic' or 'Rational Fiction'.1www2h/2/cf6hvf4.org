As I see it there are two options: either we mean to talk about any and all fictional works which fit under the "rational" umbrella; or we mean to talk about the emerging subgenre of fan fic that is rational fic.

If we mean to talk about all "rational" fiction, I would argue for the name "Rationalist Fiction." We're talking about fiction that exemplifies the values of /Rationalism/, not about fiction that is objectively intelligent, because that begs the question of "rational by whose standards?"

If we mean to talk primarily about fanfic--even if we might consider extending the label, through loose usage, to published works which are similar to such fanfic--then I would likewise argue for the name "Rationalist Fic."
