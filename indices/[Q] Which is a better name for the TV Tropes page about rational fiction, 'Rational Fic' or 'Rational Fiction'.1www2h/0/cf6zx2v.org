"Rationalist Fiction". Though it also seems that eaturbrainz has a different concept of what this is about than [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/3m/rationalist_fiction/][I did]]. Plenty of SF, including all 'hard' SF, aspires to lawful worldbuilding. Plenty of mystery novels aspire to be fair puzzles. Plenty of litfic aspires to GrayVsGrey morality (something I find profoundly uninteresting which is why there are phoenixes and Dementors in HPMOR). Rationalist fiction is distinguished from existing genres by its ability to exhibit useful explicit cognitive skills, which in turn /requires/ that good thinking not be an Informed Ability. Munchkinism is a major feature of HPMOR and its derived works and is itself a useful cognitive ability; you could also handwave a lot and try to trace it back to Null-A, though I'm not sure you should.

But to be /rational/ is something that many people would say their literature aspires to, and that's not at all the same as /explicitly rationalist/.

  "I will remark," Dumbledore said while Harry was still trying to sort out how to reply to this completely unexpected rejoinder, "that it is a common misconception of Ravenclaws that all the smart children are Sorted there, leaving none for other Houses. This is not so; being Sorted to Ravenclaw indicates that you are driven by your desire to know things, which is not at all the same quality as being intelligent."
