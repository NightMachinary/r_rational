I'm suspecting that the reason aerb has no computers (and the backpacks can't produce them) is that they'd put too much strain on the simulation. Nowadays we have more smart devices than people in in the world, not counting the huge amount of "dumb" electronics that exist pretty much everywhere.

If the Aerb simulation has a finite capacity (even though it can still simulate at least 5 billion of people) then it makes sense that the DM might have stopped all the attempts at creating complex electronics.

Aerb used to have way more sentient beings but it was before Jon's time and it's pretty suspicious that the population dropped conveniently before the main character appeared
