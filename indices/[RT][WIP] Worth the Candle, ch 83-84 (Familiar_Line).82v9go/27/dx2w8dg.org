I enjoy this story enough that I'm doing a re-read and I'm up to chapter 42 (just after they killed the unicorn in ch40). The discussion of that chapter is now archived so I can't ask this there: did they save any of the blood from the unicorn? It would be a shame if they killed it, drank a couple of mouthfuls, and then left it lying there. Given how much time they spent planning it, I'd like to think that they came up with some magical way to store the blood...assuming that's possible, anyway.

Someone else asked this, but it didn't get answered. Not sure if that was deliberate or not.

Oh, since this is an old thread: paging [[/u/cthulhuraejepsen]]

EDIT: Question was answered a couple chapters later. Yes, they stored the blood and meat.
