In the case of Valencia and Fenn it's a very generic 'they have upper-class ancestry', not the /unique/ positions that Amaryliss & Grak have.

The cousin of the princess, by belonging to an actual royal family, is probably already more deserving of the title 'princess' than Valencia or Fenn are.

Unless of course the princess has ten thousand cousins or so, in which case the 'cousin' is still of the same level as Valencia & Fenn in regards to princesshood.
