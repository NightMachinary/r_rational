Sure, but would that still be a good thing to do? Forget genocide; let's suppose we have the choice of killing [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/KillSixBillionDemons][+six billion demons+]] six trillion devils and letting one trillion human souls in the hells to decay, /or/ leaving six trillion devils and one trillion souls to exist for all eternity. What's better?

Many people, me included, would be seriously inclined to kill them all. The tuung, though, and perhaps Juniper, given that conversation in Chapter 84, may choose the other option. How many happy people justify the existence of one person in eternal suffering?
