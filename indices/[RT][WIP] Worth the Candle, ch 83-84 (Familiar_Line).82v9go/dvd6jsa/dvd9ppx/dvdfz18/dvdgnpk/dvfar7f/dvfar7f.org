I think the flashback is linked to that. Joon realized that it felt more engaging if his players had some sort of choice in their quests (even if it meant they just chose who to listen to), and so I think the DM is hiding quests for a similar reason. This way, Joon is doing things because he wants to, and not because he just wants to clear his quest log.
