Great Chapter!

Making electronics is easy when you know how and have magic! Lol, just blank circuit boards alone probably took teams engineers decades of work to perfect. They are not remotely as simple as they look. Maybe the author meant breadboards.

You know, this sidequest feels like a problem they just don't need. Our hero already has a blade that can be disguised, he doesn't need a summon-able one. One baby is enough, not 500k of them.
