A simple circuit board is just a sheet of non-conductive material with a sheet of copper pressed on one side and then etched by a chemical process... certainly nothing that complicated or difficult to replicate! The circuit boards in modern complex devices are more involved of course, but the basic ones were good enough for the first tvs/computers. Remember that Aerb already has radio, cars, so it's not like she's trying to make a computer in Middle Earth!
