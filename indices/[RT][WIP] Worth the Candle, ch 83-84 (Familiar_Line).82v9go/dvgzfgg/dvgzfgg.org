Has the gang received any new quest notifications since meeting the DM? Maybe it's just paranoia, but it feels kind of off that nothing in these chapters triggered any game notifications. The DM seems to be manipulating events at least partially for his own amusement, and removing the convenient "this is important" hints would certainly make things more interesting.
