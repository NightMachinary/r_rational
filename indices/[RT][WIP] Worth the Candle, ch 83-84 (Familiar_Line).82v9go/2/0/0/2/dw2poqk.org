you should re-ask your second topic in a newer thread, I'd really lik eto see more replies on Val teleporting and having a different experience. I misse dit in the story and it seems kinda important since it implies some amount of interaction between Souls, Hells, portkeys, and 17yo girls? What about the bacteria being rendered inert or removed when bulk teleporting. Are they lucky Val didn't come out dead? I know there's a difference between bulk and people ports but they didn't know would have a reaction it could have been serious.
