Ah, disregard then. Looking at it with that in mind, they seem to be describing different dioramas, a forest vs. a city. I'd overlooked that in my initial read.

I still kind of want there to be a payoff for the peacocking turtle women. A lot of the worldbuilding in the story is touched on only briefly, which is necessarily kind of shallow (although it may, in aggregate, imply deeper links). Probably not enough words to cover it all though, since there's so much detail to go over.

I've got an unrelated question, since I only recently got caught up I'm not sure where discussion is at. Back in chapter 73 there's a moment where Valencia teleports with Amaryllis. Valencia appears to not experience the traditional blinding pain as a result, asking if it hurts. Did people have any theories on that?

Since that was the first time any character has been implied to not feel agonising remembered-but-not-experienced pain during this transition, my assumption is that the pain is due to the difficulties of teleporting a soul (which a non-anima presumably does not suffer from).

Specifically, the teleportation key might be ripping the soul from the body, storing it, facilitating the teleport, and then replacing it. The 5 person limit could be based on the storage capacity of the teleportation key (which may mean it could be subverted by powerful soul magic, although my assumption is that it's a balance thing).

As to the pain itself, the likely possibilities to my mind are (a) that removal of the soul is an intensely painful experience, (b) that a disembodied soul is, by necessity, in pain, or (c) that the particulars of the teleportation key storage are the culprit, for example if it involves a sojourn of unspecified length in one of the hells.

The discussion about teleportation in chapter 84 doesn't help hugely to resolve this. It implies that bacteria get wiped out by bulk teleportation (makes sense), but presumably the teleportation key allows a very large number of bacteria to be teleported (and if the quantity of bacteria affected the limit, you'd expect that that would have been noticed).

If the pain-caused-by-soul-storage thing is correct, it's possible that Valencia doesn't count towards the teleportation limit. She could effectively be transported for free. If nothing else, she could probably sit in Sable while it happens (I think the party discussed that as an option, but I don't remember it going anywhere).
