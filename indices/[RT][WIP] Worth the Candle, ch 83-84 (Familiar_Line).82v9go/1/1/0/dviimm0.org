Depending on the mechanics of how devils find their non-anima puppets, they could perhaps triangulate a position now that they're confirmed to communicate (at least on some level, if only on the level of rumors). If it's more like randomized possession based on fourth-dimensional proximity rather than something like Val's tendrils, then the scariest part would be Joon's remark on showing empathy to devils and Val eventually being tricked or moved into a show of clemency after revealing her abilities/identity.
