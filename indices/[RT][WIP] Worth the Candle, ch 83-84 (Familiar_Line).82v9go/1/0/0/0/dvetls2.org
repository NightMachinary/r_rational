Well, Valencia is essentially one compliment away from loyalty 20, so...

She is probably the most overpowered member of Juniper's kharass, currently. Juniper himself has the potential to become an overgod, the locus could resurrect druidic civilization, but Valencia /reaches into hells and takes apart millenia-old devils for spare parts to compensate for her drunk-walking/. She is in a position to greatly upset the world order, /right now/.

And this was from 10 loyalty. What will she get at twenty?
