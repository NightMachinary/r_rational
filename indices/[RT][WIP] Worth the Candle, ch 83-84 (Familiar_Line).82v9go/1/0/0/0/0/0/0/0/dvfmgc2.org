Hm, fair point regarding Valencia's ability to identify the devils with the skills she wants.

We didn't see master-planner devils, no, but even if there's none (which doesn't seem that likely), social manipulations would be enough. She could recruit people who will recruit people who will recruit warriors and mages for her army; if she doesn't have devilish master planners, she could use a social-genius devil to identify and then recruit a human master planner. She would have half the city where she wants it to be in a day, or in a week if her selection of devils is limited to manipulators.

Whether Juniper's group is preparing as well or not doesn't matter that much, since she has advantages in speed of work and deception. Juniper and company are much more effective in direct fights, but she would never be where they expect her to be, and her web of influence would grow faster than their.

I suppose without devil-planners it wouldn't be a sure victory, but not a sure loss either.
