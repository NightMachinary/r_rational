I basically agree with your first paragraph --- the reason I measured combat ability is that it's more or less been what's tested in the story so far. That said, I think the situation you construct is a bit artificial; it depends, for example, on Val being able to pick out and recognize the (presumably rare) master strategists among the demons.

I'm not sure I agree with your second claim---so far we haven't seen the demons demonstrate general genius at planning, just in-the-moment social genius. I suppose that if you gave Val the element of surprise and let her build a bomb, she could kill Juniper and company, but I think letting her prepare and not Juniper is not a fair test.
