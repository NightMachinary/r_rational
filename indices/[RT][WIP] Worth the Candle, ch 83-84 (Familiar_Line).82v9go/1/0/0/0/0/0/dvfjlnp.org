Fair enough, but why would we measure her power based on how well she can make her meatpuppet punch and cut? If we must judge it based on her value for hypothetical war effort, I imagine there's quite a few overcompetent devil tacticians, strategists, and combat instructors, which would be more valuable than warriors by far.

She does lose to Juniper if given no time to prepare, but also would most likely be able to take out their entire group combined if given a day in a city. (Not that measuring her power based on whether or not she can win a conflict against her other companions is correct.)
