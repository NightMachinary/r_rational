The deal with the anyblade is that it's limitations were baked into it at creation, it's impossible to modify or reproduce those effects, and it hews to no known laws of magic. An entads deal is that they just happen, and that questioning them is not only impossible, but fruitless anyways, since every part of the process is irreproducible. However, Druid magic is a system, which means you start asking questions like where mass goes to and comes from, and other questions Joon asks. Of course, there's an boundary sopping you from doing that, which is what makes it frustrating.
