I'm receptive to some of these points, but not all. To the first in specific; I think you've misunderstood the root of Juniper's unease with druidic magic.

  Saying Druid magic doesn't have structure is kinda wrong to since you can clearly apply a lot of limits to it and if it was all powerful Locus would not be so vulnerable. You can clearly define there forest ends even tho the border would be somewhat moving and wouldn't resemble a straight line.

Druidic magic is clearly limited; specifically, the inability of Druids to experiment with Druidic magic to better understand its capabilities or develop reliable practices is a fairly sharp limitation. It's not that Druidic magic has no structure, but that mapping its structure is impossible. Since experimentation and armchair theorizing are core personality traits of Joon's, he takes the idea of a magic seemingly designed to thwart his curiosity a bit personally. It's not about the impossible feats Druids can accomplish, it's about being told he's not allowed to investigate how they work.

  Anyblade is broken and is a god among weapons.

I suspect the limitations are fairly sharp (hah!) on the Anyblade, much like the clonal kit. In both cases, they were magic items that Joon was largely responsible for. When he had to stretch the capabilities of the clonal kit a bit, we saw the experimentation demonstrated a bit more in the text. With the Anyblade, I imagine most of the "broken" exploits were already considered and rejected during its time as an rpg item. There might be a nice opportunity in the story for someone to get excited about the possibilities, only for Juniper to chuckle and shoot them down. That'd give a chance to explain WHY he can't do more with the anyblade, but I doubt he's actually missed a trick with it.
