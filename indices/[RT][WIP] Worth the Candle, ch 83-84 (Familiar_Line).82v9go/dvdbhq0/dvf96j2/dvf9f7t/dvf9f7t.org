  There is an actual god watching over the MC and deciding what he gets away with, so there just is no holes for that kind of munchkining.

Yeah, so dumping unneeded or easily trained stats to raise soul magic for instant solution would be impossible, yet he did that. So it boils down to another of my problems, narrative can set limits at any time, when it's convenient to set them and relax them when our hero needs to progress.

  Would be stupid anyblade anyway if you could just make a hammer with a blade somewhere.

This is actually pretty tame and doable. I also listed examples of actual blades, plus toothpick is hardly a blade already. Soul sucking was done with simple tools, so i see no reason why Anyblade can't have the same function. I also had questions about disappearing mass, density and change of the material.
