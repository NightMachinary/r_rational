  All of this may result in creating the most durable thinnest (even if atom thin is not possible, toothpicks are pretty thin), sharpest weapon that can cut anything with ease. Decorations being vague he can create a smart blade with a mini super computer attached to it.

No. There is a DM around and he manages what the backpack gives. Seems obvious that he would say no to getting whatever with the sword too. Would be stupid anyblade anyway if you could just make a hammer with a blade somewhere. Or a nuclear bomb with a blade stuck in it.

There is an actual god watching over the MC and deciding what he gets away with, so there just is no holes for that kind of munchkining.
