One of what I would consider the main problems with this story as it stands right now (one of a few) is that Juniper knows more than the audience does.

The problem is that there's a lot to Aerb, both in terms of magic systems, nations, races, and other things, and /logically/, Juniper has been going through a whole lot of sociocultural bootcamp -- and this has been stated to be happening a few times in the text. And the problem with /that/ is that A) I don't want to write "Mary and Juniper sit in a room while he gets things explained to him for several days" and B) most people wouldn't want to read that, because it would mean stalling out the plot for a hundred thousand words and C) most people would forget about whatever was written in that stretch by the time it became relevant to the plot and D) some of it would never be relevant to the plot, because not literally everything ever shown in the world can/should be, especially with a big world.

I made the decision fairly early on that I would just bring up things when I thought they were relevant, either through flashback to when Juniper first learned about them, or direct exposition/aside, depending on what I felt worked better.

This comes with a few pros and cons. I think the biggest con is that some people really want (or claim to want) massive exposition dumps. I already feel like WtC has too much of that, and there's no way that I'm going to add more on top of what's there, especially when it would give the impression of a dangling plot thread when I've already been accused of having too many of those, or taking too long to get where I'm going.

(There's always been a strong argument for having the reader learn things along with the main character, but that really limits what sorts of books you can write, and has some results that I don't like, especially with regards to the plot.)
