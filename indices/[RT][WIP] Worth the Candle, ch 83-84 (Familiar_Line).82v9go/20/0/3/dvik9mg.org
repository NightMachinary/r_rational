I love worldbuilding and I've always enjoyed the bits about Aerb because you've lured most of us in with the promise of a compelling /rational/ world. But when I'm reading, I take a step back when I realize a particular segment is more of an infodump that's only loosely topical (most recently, that lengthy aside on travel in c82 or the way some characters sometimes talk for the sake of disseminating information). I think it's part of the convenient charm of the D&D layer, where the DM (or narrator) has absolute discretion over what to reveal. The toughest part might be balancing exposition (including side-quests and flavor encounters like the two men arguing over familiar eudaimonia, which I really liked) so that the world feels complex and "alive" while, as you say, avoiding those red herring plots.
