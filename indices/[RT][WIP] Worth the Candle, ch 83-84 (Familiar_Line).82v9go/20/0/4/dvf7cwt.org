Sure, but those questions were relevant in the story way before. It's not even a massive exposition dump.

I can see 1 & 2. As being just questions, 2 is more about the limits and similarities of Anyblade to Druid magic, but 3 & were directly relevant in the story. Half if not more of his problems with Druid magic is mass and size change, well his Anyblade does that on a daily basis and he never thought it was similar?

3) No one talked about Dragons when Juniper was ecstatic to fly a helicopter, how exactly that was not relevant to the story? Starting in a plane, that would be logically a huge waste for transporting prisoners, was not relevant? He even wanted to take helicopters with them into the bottle and no one said "Hey Juniper flying is dangerous , cause Dragons". That's one sentence.

4) He goes on a speech about God in the next chapter, Fenn jokes about Virgin Princess, so he didn't notice what he has done or "Pregnant Virgin Mary" at all?

This is not about them sitting in a room, in fact most of the stuff could be resolved with one-two sentences.

  I don't want to write "Mary and Juniper sit in a room while he gets things explained to him for several days"

I don't want to be the bringer of bad news, but most of this series is sitting\standing\moving and talking\explaining. Large part of it is Junipers inner thoughts and you even have a separate insert real world part of people literally sitting and explaining\talking. People talking is kinda my favorite part next to the adventure part.

As i mentioned Junipers talk about God(Chapter 81) was him literally sitting and explaining while Amaryllis listened, in fact wasn't she the only one that listened till the end?

Edit 2: Aren't there two chapters named "In Which Juniper Stares At His Character Sheet". That's kinda sitting and explaining to himself, again, loved them.
