This are some questions i had about the story or stuff that i noticed.

*1) Druid magic and Junipers dislike of it, it's structure and how it's so different from other magic.*

While his less when fond treatment of druid magic can be attributed to his dislike of something solely based on faith in particular, i find it ironic that most of the structure and ways in which Druid magic works was described in his rant about God in Chapter 81. The whole thing about "if omnipotent and benevolent, why suffering - when means not omnipotent or benevolent" can be applied to druid magic and describe it limits and how\why it doesn't work if you lack faith.

I can understand his dislike towards Druid magic, because it's similar to faith in God, but it being vague or breaking laws of physics (not making sense) and examples he lists as such are contradicting what he actually does himself or other magical schools in the story. Saying Druid magic doesn't have structure is kinda wrong to since you can clearly apply a lot of limits to it and if it was all powerful Locus would not be so vulnerable. You can clearly define there forest ends even tho the border would be somewhat moving and wouldn't resemble a straight line.

My problem is more about what he attributes to Druid magic not making sense or breaking the laws of physics. Cause anyone at that point should ask "How do Anyblade?" Most of the transformations and momentum changes that he attributes to Druid magic not making sense are present with the Anyblade. Form change,structure change,momentum transfer nullification,size,weight, composition. Yet he only questions similar stuff in relation to Druid magic.

Requirements of Druid magic are in fact similar to other schools of magic. Why exactly, blood magic gives you an ability to produce fire from your hand, the answer at this point is the same as for Druid magic "It's magic". The only thing consistent in all magic that gives all of them sort of structure is that you have to pay a price - blood (Blood magic), believing\faith (Druid magic), bones (Bone magic) etc. In fact i think Gold magic is more mysterious than Druid magic.

*2) Anyblade is broken and is a god among weapons.*

It's also pretty similar to Druid magic in many aspects.

  It immediately sprang to life in my hands, changing and warping into different forms, becoming thicker, then thinner, sharp, then dull, long, then short, never staying as one particular sword for very long. Despite that, it was perfectly balanced in my hand the entire time, forming counterweights in the grip to ensure that the shifts it underwent weren't too jarring.

  I directed a thought at it and transformed it from a sword to an axe wrapped in decorative gold hair, then to a small dagger with a skull on the hilt, then to a bronze khopesh.

  It could only do blades, but it was pretty permissive when it came to what a blade was, and I could work whatever I wanted into the ornamental features of the sword, axe, or other bladed weapon I formed it into.

So there does the mass disappears to (It was a toothpick at one point)? What about it's density? It can change the material it's made of? It can adjuster sharpness? How durable it is? What are limits to what counts as an ornament? Can it have properties (poison, curse, etc)

All of this may result in creating the most durable thinnest (even if atom thin is not possible, toothpicks are pretty thin), sharpest weapon that can cut anything with ease. Decorations being vague he can create a smart blade with a mini super computer attached to it.

Can he create a blade that extracts\traps souls akin to the stuff he was using in the first chapters? Can he create a Gunblade, Star Wars lightsaber, High-frequency blade from MGS Rising any other blade with extreme properties? What happens if the blade is chipped in it's longest form or in it's smallest form, would it be simply counted as it changing form and bear no effect what so ever, does it need to be destroyed to atomic level to seize all functions or it has some magical properties powering it? Can those properties be replenished or the blade powered up if he created an ornamental feature that got power from souls, like cars\bikes do(he already used some infant soul before, so he wouldn't be exactly against the idea)?

*3) Dragons believing that skies of Aerb unequivocally belongs to them.*

So this sudden description of why they can't take a plane to the Boundless Pit raises a couple of questions with me.

1. The first chapter started with our hero Juniper being frown out of a plane. Wasn't it a waste to go through a lot of discussion and arguments just to throw a handful of prisoners into an Exclusion zone? Wouldn't those resources and ability to transfer something via plane be better spent elsewhere? Since they are practically killing the prisoners and not really expect them to make it back, it's a lot of money and energy spend for almost no payoff.

2. So Aumann was so powerful, went through Dragons or just didn't care when he used a Helicopter to fly over a pretty sizable desert? Wasn't it also implied that he did it multiple times before? So Dragons just don't care about that part of Aerb?

3. So we had FIVE helicopters chase or party with no prior preparation and on a very sudden schedule. Dragons didn't care about that, it was arranged in a fast manner disregarding Dragons or again group that gave chase was to powerful to care about that, since they had Larkspur aka royal prince with them?

4. Since all of the above took place and Juniper was super eager and heavily questioned why him flying a helicopter was not part of the Narrative to that point. How nobody ever mentioned Dragons having the domain over Aerb skies to him before, did i just miss it? Why using a helicopter to get to Botomless Pit is not even toyed with by Juniper, he wanted to have\fly one so badly before. He even mentioned his father being a helicopter pilot and having some flight experience before. Why the possibility of finally having to fly one, as the means to escape from the Botomless Pit, never even enters his "narrative sense" as the result of this line of thought?

  The train was necessitated by the fact that we didn't have a better way to get to the Boundless Pit.

  This wasn't just a question of bureaucracy; some of the worst disasters in Aerbian aviation history were caused by dragons going after improperly cleared flights, which was obviously the kind of thing that had a chilling effect on passenger air travel.
#+end_quote

And instead it's quickly dismissed by.

#+begin_quote
  Also, there was no doubt in my mind that we were going to have to fight a dragon at some point, but that thankfully seemed like it was going to be a long time coming.
#+end_quote

They go on the Narrative hunt with almost 0 evidence and speculated about tiniest of possibilities, but this is not even considered. I dislike the "narrative as the driving force" personally, but they mention in it in relations to "princess on a train" that has less indications that it's a narrative thing. But this huge thing is completely flies over their head and no one said anything before to Juniper that flying a helicopter might be a problem. They didn't steal a helicopter only , because they couldn't transport it, not because it would be dangerous to fly it.

#+begin_quote
  But it was obvious to me that if the Dungeon Master had a single dramatic bone in his body, I would fly a helicopter at some point, especially because this marked the second time that I had come close to a helicopter and then not been allowed to fly it.

  “But some things are definitely clues,” I said. “Some things have cosmic significance, for lack of a better word. And helicopters are one of them. They're part of my backstory, again, for lack of a better word. I'm not saying that everything is going to have meaning in one way or another, I'm just saying that this probably is a clue, and if we don't go back for the magic helicopter, or we can't take it with us, then we should at least be on the lookout for other helicopters. Really, we should just go there and use bulk teleport to put it somewhere that we can get it again, if we need it. For both the helicopters, actually.”

*4) Are we having pregnant VIRGIN MARY in the story?*

So who counts as the father, Juniper since he was conducting the ritual? He seems pretty okay with this God metaphor and doesn't even mention this whole thing in his "God rant" in the next chapter.

I can even stretch this to the Trinity metaphor in some form since we have Father, Son, Holy Ghost - Locus,Solace being one and the same or mixed together at the end of the ritual. I can even stretch it even further to just having those forms Father\Juniper|Locus, Son\Juniper|Solace, Holy Ghost\Solace|Locus they somewhat fit those description if you separate the three as their roles in the ritual. Father - helped to give birth to Solace or provided power for the ritual. Son - standing in the ritual hierarchy, using the external power provided for the ritual or act of being born. Holy ghost is well, yeah, it's obvious.

So nobody mentioned that fact and Juniper was not even considering or thinking other what he has just done. Similarities to God were not even considered or brought up as arguments during his speech about God in the next chapter.

--------------

Current chapters are were fun. Even tho Chapter 83 felt somewhat jumbled or jumping from one thing to another, or containing a mix of scenes and ideas. Maybe it was just me, but it kinda addressed a lot of things at once and maybe even some comments that i saw before from readers. It's probably my imagination, but still it felt kinda strange to me in some places.

I would love to hear opinions of others towards the stuff i brought up. Maybe some questions can be answered or viewed at other angles. Maybe i even missed something, i tried to be more diligent this time and search\reread the novel to find answers. I still very much like this novel.
