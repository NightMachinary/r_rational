That's unfair so you can just brush off a huge portion of things by saying:

#+begin_quote
  They were made with magic so it's the way it is
#+end_quote

But you can't apply the same to a magic system for the same reason of

#+begin_quote
  This is magic so it needs to make sense
#+end_quote

I can clearly understand why he dislikes it, but at the same time i find it funny, that Juniper is using a magical thing that doesn't make sense in similar way and he just ignores it. Also, didn't he come up with the Anyblade himself or fairies that heal you, it seems he was fine with creating magic that functions only because it magic.

Okay, how exactly you produce fire from your hand with Blood magic, what are the laws of physics for that? How exactly he is having double blood in his system, he would be super dead if his body followed the laws of physics?

For me Druid magic has a constant thing that's price (mana in other stories). You need to use faith and creativity to use Druid magic and Locus has a clear limit, so power source is not infinite, it's pretty defined. But when we have soul magic and it actually requires nothing to change things or what would be the equivalent of mana\price in this case?
