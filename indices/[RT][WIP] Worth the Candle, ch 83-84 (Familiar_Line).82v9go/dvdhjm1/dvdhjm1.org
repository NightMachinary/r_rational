Happy for the chapters coming out as always, thanks author!

I liked the feel these chapters had, they had an amount of caution, but it wasn't the be all end all. Amaryllis discovering Earth technology is great, and now it seems she has somewhere to direct her energy. Fenn was fun as per normal, and I like how Val was pulled in by the book, making comparisons to herself. I could see her becoming a book lover. Grak chilling with the other dwarf was pretty funny, just at the right timing since I was wondering where he was.

Joon hearing the psychic messages were pretty cool, kind of want an extension of that magic/technique. Interesting how happy he was to go alone with it all. I did jump to the handmaid swap as Joon did too, happy surprise to find out I was wrong. Seems like the partnership with the handmaid could be entertaining, I do wonder if she or the princess is to be the companion.
