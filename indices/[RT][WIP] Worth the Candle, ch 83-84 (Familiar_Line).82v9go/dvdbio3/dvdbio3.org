So this time i will focus on stuff i liked about the story first and some questions later. It seems i went other the word limit and will have to separate it, quotes and final words pushed it well past 10 000 character limit.

1. Chapter to chapter character interactions and dialog is great. It feel like living people taking to each other, a group of friends going on a journey\adventure. They all have their quirks and ways of talking, positions they like to take and jokes that they make. Spoken dialog between individuals is pretty awesome.

2. Most of the in chapter stuff is consistent between itself. It's nice to follow and end with an interesting cliffhanger, that doesn't feel forced and is instead implores you to read more of the story.

3. World and people inhabiting it are rather unique, even when they have similar counterparts in other fantasy stories. Same can be said about magic systems.

*Problem\questions i have about the soul magic and ending to the Fallather's ark.*

So i initially thought that "lines branching off from the soul" that Juniper uses to check on his companions actually had a real direction or\and distance to them, so he could have easily identified the fake Amaryllis. Since the line would not point towards her. I didn't find the confirmation that they functioned that way. But since he already tried to check Grak's soul directly and didn't do it only because Grak simply was not fond of the idea. Why didn't he check fake Amaryllis directly when he was touching her during the motorcycle ride? He didn't even need to do it stealthy without her consent, they could have just put Grak into the glove first and have Fenn watch, while Juniper explained to fake Amaryllis what he wanted to check her soul. At that point she either complies and is exposed, or disagrees and he has no reason to trust her, cause real Amaryllis would've agreed.

That whole chapter was them being paranoid about the most minor of thing and taking outrageous preconditions, but it all was resolved with ton of luck, guessing and Juniper taking actions with no justification. He even says it himself. All while he has actual reasons and ability to check things. He notices tiniest of details and comes to conclusion that Amaryllis is fake in the span of minutes if not seconds, but when he has time and ability he forgets about it.

  Why the lie? It was easy to construct a reason, working backwards;

  ... but that was post-facto reasoning, not why I'd did it in the moment. Was it something subconscious? Or that my augmented mind rolled a high number somewhere and fed me the idea of lying? I tried not to stare at Amaryllis. I'd been lying to her, was that my original intent or a byproduct of keeping information from Grak?

He wasn't even sure in the end, but acted upon it.

  “Imposter,” I said, feeling a momentary flip of my stomach as I looked down and worried that I'd made a mistake, even with what the game had told me.

  We're sure?” asked Fenn.

  “Game notification,” I said, tapping the side of my head. “Not one hundred percent before that, no, but she wasn't using her magic items, and -- maybe I knew it from instinct, or Luck, or beamed into my head by the game.”

This is why i disliked that moment and "narrative" in general. He had all the logical,intellectual and discerning power to resolve that situation, he goes into long stretches of constructing thought and finding solutions, but it all came down to "gut feeling", even tho the whole situation could have been avoided beforehand.
