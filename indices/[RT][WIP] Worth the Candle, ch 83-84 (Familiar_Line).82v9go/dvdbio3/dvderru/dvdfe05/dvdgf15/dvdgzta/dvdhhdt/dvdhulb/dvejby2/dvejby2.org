No, I didn't see that. Also, /ahhh/, all this time you were talking more satisfying ways the author could have resolved that conflict, not about which actions the characters should have naturally taken? Damnation, I entirely failed to pick up on that, I apologize.

If so, sure, there may have been better ways to foreshadow impostor!Amaryllis than having Juniper lie without a clear reason... unless it's a set-up for some as-yet-unknown plot thread, of course.
