It's sorta fair. I just think that it would be a better resolution than "I was suspicious for no reason". Especially because he wanted to check Grak directly, before that. My problem is, it's described in great detail how they were taking precautions and being almost paranoid. He even felt that something was wrong.

Hell, he could have driven with Fenn while Amaryliss & Grak were inside the glove, but instead he solved the whole situation with His gut feeling. To me it felt like the whole Fallather situation was resolved by characters getting dumber and making obvious mistakes, instead of upping the intellectual battle. Mistakes that weren't even made under constant stress and one side finally breaking under tension, they both kinda fizzled out of their schemes and Juniper just won because he felt something was wrong.

Actually, the whole thing that clues Juniper in is fake Amaryllis being unable to use the inherited magic tools, cause she is just a copy. Boy, this plan was dumb from both sides, if Juniper just asked impostor Amaryllis to use immobility plate or her weapon, he would instantly understand that she was fake. Or you know something more casual and that he could ask real Amaryllis to do even if he didn't suspect her "Hey Amaryllis sisnce we are driving together use the glove to get Grak and Fenn into it". Holly, it's even mentioned somewhat, after Fenn gloved herself.

  I picked it up and handed it to Amaryllis, who hesitated for a second before putting it on.

Fallather master planning depended to much on easily discoverable things. I guess he went senile after all those years, how did he even trick the prison system.
