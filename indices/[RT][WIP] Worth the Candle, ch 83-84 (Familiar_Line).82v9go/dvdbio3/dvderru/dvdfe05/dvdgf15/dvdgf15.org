Regarding the pelehr, fair point.

Still, it comes down to the fact that there was no reason to think that checking Amaryllis' soul directly would show a different result. From his perspective, he looked at her soul just a few minutes ago, and since that time she wasn't in a position to interact with Fallatehr. Why would there be noticeable changes?

And even if he /did/ re-check, he would have likely done so via the soul-link again, just because it's faster. The only situation in which direct contact would have seemed a better option is that /specific/ situation with impostor!Amaryllis, which he simply didn't consider.
