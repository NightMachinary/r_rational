What? I can even accept his guard being down and not really taking soul magic as a serious, cause he was tired. But they still were double and triple checking Grak and being cautious about everything else.

  Amaryllis created by copying Amaryllis' appearance onto an accomplice's soul was outside of their expectations

He saw Fallather change someones appearance before. I think that they even discussed the possibility of copying appearances, hell i think he even considered that souls could be copied fully, before Fallather said it wasn't possible, plus the whole Fallather related collection of chapters was about suspecting people and being cautious. I even quoted Juniper suspecting something and being cautious, but not knowing why he is like that. It was chapter upon chapter of them going to the extremes of being cautions, but an easy action of checking directly was beyond reasonable?

  He had little reason to suspect that Amaryllis was compromised in the first place, and even less reason to re-check her soul.

He left her alone with Grak, he had a lot of reasons to think she might be compromised.
