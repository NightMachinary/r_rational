I was kinda talking about both. Speaking of natural actions. It just occurred to me.

Fallather thought that Juniper had lost his soul magic, cause he arranged for that and he sent fake Amaryllis to test it. Well, this was a dumb plan or it was strange for Fallather to believe that Juniper was not a soul mage at the moment. Cause if he is not a soul mage what is the easiest way to test if Amaryllis is not an impostor - ask her to use the bloodline only magic items, that they you at least sure she is physically not a copy. Juniper didn't do that, that should have raised some questions if Fallthather is that smart, but at the same time why send a fake one if she can be so easily discovered.

Fallather's plan put Juniper into two separate states.

1. He is a soul mage still, so he won't test Fake Amaryllis with bloodline only magic items, but instead would check her soul, but would not do so directly. - So sending a copy it rides on Juniper being a soul mage and not checking her soul directly or accidentally asking her to use one of the relics.

2. He is not a soul mage, so he can't check her soul, but he also would not ask her to use any of the relics to at least be sure she is the real one. - Sending a copy at this point is more dangerous than sending the real one, cause it's super easy to check her with relics and he has no real choice but to at least check that the body is the real deal.
