  Why didn't he check fake Amaryllis directly when he was touching her during the motorcycle ride

Because he had no reason to. At that point, he had no reason to suspect that checking her soul via soul-link and directly would show different results, the entire stratagem with impostor!Amaryllis created by copying Amaryllis' appearance onto an accomplice's soul was outside of his expectations. He was mainly worried about Fallatehr changing his companions in ways too subtle for him to detect, which no reasonable amount of re-checking would counter, and had little reason to suspect that Amaryllis was compromised at all.

With Grak, he had to use direct method because da nad had no connection to his soul (since da nad loyalty was below ten).
