I also generally dislike conflict resolutions that pan out by lucky spur-of-the-moment revelations rather than careful considerations. Feels like a cheap way of getting a surprising twist into a climatic action scene.

The fact that WtC was pretty self-conscious about this, as evidenced in the lines you quoted, leads me to cutting it a lot of slack.

I mean, the characters actually talking about this, having a plausible in-story mechanism, and trying to learn from the failure of their plans instead of going "hah, improvisation FTW" puts WtC miles ahead of pieces like worm, in this regard.
