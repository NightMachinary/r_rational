  A green-skinned woman had a shell on her back, embellished with miniscule gardens and inch-tall trees that gave the impression of a living place, a world in miniature (and I could vaguely recall seeing something like it before, but couldn't quite place where).

I'm a little surprised that Juniper's forgetting this scene from the Cranberry Bay arc (Chapter 38), but not immediately suspicious:

  I ... decided to follow along after a green-skinned woman with a shell on her back to see what her deal was. The shell was decorated with a complex, miniature cityscape which had been affixed to it, and she walked in such a way that all the buildings of the city stayed level with the ground. I stopped myself from wandering after her only when she saw that I was paying attention and flashed me a smile.

That said, I do find it suspect that this NPC has reappeared, although the logistics make sense.

It seems like either a dangling plot hook (possibly for resolving the bottlocus situation, if the miniaturisation is magical rather than actual models) or a potential complication (e.g. if Shelly is actually a spy for one of the more subtle threats). Best case scenario, the whole thing's just a red herring.
