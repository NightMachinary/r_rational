Not a typo, but a continuity issue:

#+begin_quote
  I felt something touch my chest, but one of my hands was on the railing, and the other was holding Fenn's hand, so I left the brief contact go unremarked.
#+end_quote

A few paragraphs later:

#+begin_quote
  <Okay. Who are you?> I asked, looking around the room for Fenn, though I had enough situational awareness to find her.
#+end_quote

There's no mention of Fenn leaving him in between.
