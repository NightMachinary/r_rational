I'm picking Valencia, because apparently Joon-bait is close enough to me-bait to be basically the same thing. SHE'S SO CUTE, I MUST HUG HER!

Edit: Just putting this here, my mental image of what Val looks like is Sella from Prisma Illya when she's being a 2d girl, A2 from Nier Automata when she's being a 3d girl, and Azathoth when she's being a 4d girl.
