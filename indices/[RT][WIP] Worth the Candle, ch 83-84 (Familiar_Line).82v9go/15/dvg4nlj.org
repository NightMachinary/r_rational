How does everyone picture the main characters? In my mind the party looks something like [[https://i.imgur.com/oG2IfJR.jpg][this]], except maybe swap the Red Prince as Amaryllis out for [[https://i.imgur.com/LYzjSDY.jpg][Lightning]]. They don't quite line up with how they're described in-text, e.g. Valencia is probably closer to [[https://i.imgur.com/NqFFloW.jpg][Alice Nakiri]] in-text than Lohse, but the latter also has a demon inside her so thematic parallels for me overwhelm the actual description.
