Yeah, but there is a defined path from player to GM in aerb, so it is pretty likely it had happened before. I'm getting a poisoned chalice vibe, with each player forced to oversee a world where the existing exclusions force you to be monstrous. They attain GM powers and want to fix the world, but find that their only real power is adding exclusions. Then they have to convince the next player to attain GM-hood and take over, so they can stop hurting billions of people. The perfect crapsack world.

It seems to trite for Arthur to be the current GM, so I'm thinking his hiding/exile is a way of getting out of ascension.
