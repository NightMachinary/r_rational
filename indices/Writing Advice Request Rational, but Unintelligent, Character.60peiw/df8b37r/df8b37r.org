I'd go with making him unable to think quickly, but able to apply existing knowledge for the most part.

Any quick decisions he makes fail to take into consideration a facet or two that may or may not change the outcome of the situation entirely.

Perhaps he's able to use knowledge he gained, but there's little to no "transfer": when trying to learn a new thing he might miss obvious similarities to things he's already learned, or previous solutions that would work in the new case as well.

Another thing you could do is have him unable to solve most problems on the fly, but able to do so slowly, but usually correctly, given access to a pen and paper.

You know, the more I think about it, the more unattractive the prospect sounds. Good luck making it entertaining. The idea is neat though.
