If he's a /rational/ idiot then he should be finding ways to work around his idiocy. So, what is it exactly that makes him be perceived as an idiot? I can think of a few possibilities (mix and match as desired):

1. Working memory. This is a huge limiter on intelligence, because holding multiple bits of information (e.g. steps in a calculation, facts about a situation, candidate hypotheses) in your head at the same time is crucial for most sorts of reasoning.
2. Long-term memory. Difficulty learning skills and remembering facts makes intelligence harder to achieve.
3. Speed. Perhaps your protagonist simply takes a long time to get to the right answer.
4. Improvisation/creativity. Maybe it's hard for him to figure out solutions to novel problems or react to changes in his environment.
5. Concentration. An inability to focus on the task at hand is a pretty serious drawback, especially when combined with a speed issue.
6. Any of a variety of conditions like dyscalculia, dyslexia, ADHD, dysphasia, dyspraxia, etc. could be interpreted as idiocy by a society that didn't know better. If you pick a specific condition (or combination of conditions) you can also look up how people cope with it.

Almost all of these have work-arounds in a research environment. Have your protagonist treat his mental abilities as a problem to be solved.

1. Long-term memory? Keep extensive notes.
2. Working memory? Use a whiteboard (or similar).
3. Speed? Take extra time.
4. Improvisation? Practice, and come up with new situations to work through.
5. Concentration? Make notes about your thought process and take a break when necessary (i.e. the bookmark approach).

Point being, if somebody thinks that they are an idiot and doesn't want that to get in the way, their first step should be dealing with their perceived idiocy.

*EDIT:* Oh, and I forgot to mention that the absence of these tools can become a source of tension. What if your protagonist really needs to remember something but they don't have their notes?
