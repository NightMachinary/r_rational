Do you want him to be dumb? Because you could also go for not well-read, bad vocabulary, inarticulate, but nonetheless quite smart.

If you want him to actually not be very smart, then I think the key is to make him figure out what he's not good at and how to get around by relying on tools and other people. You could make him act largely as the outside view. He doesn't know how likely your plan is to succeed, but he has figured out that if he takes your estimate and cuts it in half, that generally works pretty well.
