A /simple/ person, looked down upon for lack of sophistication and not particularly deep in thought, who nevertheless acts rationally? I think you can get 90% of the way there by granting him the willpower to follow through on his intentions, and the last 10% by removing certain cognitive biases. (E.g. when all the smart characters are working super hard on something, he might be the one who is able to ignore sunk costs and say "I want to try something else now".)
