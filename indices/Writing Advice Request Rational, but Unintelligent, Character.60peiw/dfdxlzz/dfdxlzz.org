I'm currently writing a rational character who is deliberately of "medium" intelligence. They're not stupid by any stretch of the imagination (they're, say, in the 1-2 SD above average range of present 21st century standards), but they're deliberately not the standard genius protagonist you sometimes get in sci-fi. Here are some things I've found help me write them:

- Give them interests and focuses that require some thing other than intelligence as the main determiner of success. In my case this is mostly persistence. Their job largely involves digging through virtual crap and sorting it out. It doesn't require any great creativity, but does require a certain amount of doggedness. Focusing on what they /are/ good at is easier than focusing on what they /aren't/.
- Having a specific idea of some non-intelligence related limitations they have. In my protagonist's case this is social anxiety.
- When things get too complex or outside their frame of reference, have them quite visibly fail to understand and either ask questions or shrug. This has happened to my protagonist so far both with gender and simpler things like x86 emulator formalisms.
- Avoid them having to do things that I personally would be impressed by the intelligence level of. My plot largely consists of the protagonist chatting with people and methodically debugging complex systems.

An unrelated thing I've found useful in the past for playing not entirely rational but fairly stupid characters in RPGs (one was a drunken lord, the other was probably fairly bright but was also 10 years old) is to give them a very short attention span. This neatly does an end-run around letting them do complex plotting and such because even when they try to do it they get distracted halfway through and go do something else.
