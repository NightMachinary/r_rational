[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-bad-name-worm-oc-the-gamer.500626][Here's]] the best recent example of that I've seen. Note that he has low intelligence /and/ low wisdom, so he forgets important things and makes sub-optimal decisions. But I consider him a rationally-written character because he never makes these sub-optimal decisions in service of the plot; only because they're in-character. He also has domain-specific mastery (of a very low-prestige domain).
