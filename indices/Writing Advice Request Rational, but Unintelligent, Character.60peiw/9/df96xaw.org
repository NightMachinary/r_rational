Limited executive function? A character who can carefully solve small problems, but who can't handle being thrown large amounts of information from multiple sources in parallel?

Sure, it can be gotten around partially by using a lot of paper and making tables, or conceptual link-maps, but when you have dozens or even hundreds of data points to analyze and map in relation to each other, it's easy for mental fatigue to set in and the goal to look too far off to be attainable.
