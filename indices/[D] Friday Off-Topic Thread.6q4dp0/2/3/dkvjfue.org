Was exactly where you were with Gurren Lagann with the same thoughts. I slogged through the first few, and think I was actually on episode 8 when I stopped, called my step brother (who kept insisting I watch it) and said "I don't get it, it's a decent anime but nothing special, a bit cliche honestly." He asked what episode I was on, I told him, and he was like "Okay, watch one more episode."

So I did, and finished the anime within a couple days.
