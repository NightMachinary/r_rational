There's a save-editting tool for Undertale if you'd like to skip toward the end of a pacifist run [[https://crumblingstatue.github.io/FloweysTimeMachine/][here]]. You can skip around rooms and talk to people even if you don't want to do fights, that way, too. Once you've finished it there's loads of fanworks to get through, too. Tons of quality remixes, fanart, and fanfics.

TWEWY isn't a traditional JRPG -- it doesn't really follow many of the tropes of it. It's more like an ARPG, though it's /set/ in Japan.

I'm not sure how much you'd like it (or if you've seen it already), but the literal only movie I've watched in the past several years is Zootopia and it's pretty darned great.

I would suggest Earthbound and Mother 3 were it not for the injunction against JRPGs. Other than those...

My Hero Academia and Mob Psycho are great insofar as anime goes. I would thoroughly recommend One Punch Man as well, but it doesn't really fit the theming. Kickass music, though!
