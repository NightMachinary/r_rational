I'll check that out!

If and when you finish Undertale, there's plenty of stuff I can recommend for it -- actually, you could probably watch up to the point you were at in the musical (yes, there's a musical) [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99g8k_LAhi0&list=PLU-TFjG0qugDOnndeSWGpQ_BTmzEBlK09][here]] -- just don't read the comments or skip ahead. The end of the neutral run is at "An Ending", though I'll note that there are a couple pacifist-exclusive sections in it you may want to be aware of.
