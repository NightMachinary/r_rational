I decided I was in need of some more optimism in my life so I checked out Gurren Lagann. 5 episodes in, I'm starting to wonder if I'm missing something. Don't get me wrong, the show has been perfectly fine so far and I'm enjoying the action well enough, it just hasn't been as good as I hoped and there wasn't much to indicate it's going to get better.

I really have no right to complain after having slogged my way through the original Dragon Ball, and my worries here aren't anywhere near the existential crises I've had in the past over how much I like a tv show. I just want to know if and when the series becomes something /more/ because I'm worried I'll get bored with it if it doesn't.

I recently discovered [[https://www.youtube.com/user/OatsStudios][Oats Studios]], which has some of the best looking short films on YouTube I've ever seen. I couldn't find clear info on what they're trying to do with Volume 1 that didn't involve me giving them money, so I'll just recommend their Lovecraftian horror stuff for your viewing pleasure.

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKWB-MVJ4sQ][Zygote]] has a great body horror monster and the most coherent story, but my favorite is [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm0V24IEHao][Firebase]] for the fantastic imagery and sense of cosmic horror it instills. People also seem to like [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjQ2t_yNHQs][Rakka]], but I found the post-apocalyptic alien invasion to be uninspired even if the lizardmen covered in nanotech look pretty cool.

I found myself surprisingly enjoying the almost two-hour YouTube video [[https://youtu.be/LkoGBOs5ecM][Sherlock is Garbage and Here's Why]]. The guy clearly never liked the show in the first place and I think he gives a little too much credit to the original books, but he really hits the nail on the head for what Steven Moffat's weaknesses are as a writer while figuring out what led the series down the path of disappointment for its fans. I don't agree with everything he says, but he makes some good points that were worth seeing.

I didn't think that the show emphasizing Sherlock's characterization at the expense of the plot was a problem at first, both because I liked his character and figured the mysteries had always been [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CluelessMystery][Clueless]] anyway, but it definitely became a serious issue as time went on. I actually loved season 3 and liked The Lying Detective in season 4, but I can definitely see how that writing led to the characters becoming poorly-written crazy people with magic plot powers.
