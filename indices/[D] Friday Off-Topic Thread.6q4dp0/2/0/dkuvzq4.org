  I decided I was in need of some more optimism in my life so I checked out Gurren Lagann. 5 episodes in, I'm starting to wonder if I'm missing something. Don't get me wrong, the show has been perfectly fine so far and I'm enjoying the action well enough, it just hasn't been as good as I hoped and there wasn't much to indicate it's going to get better.

/Gurren Lagann/ basically has four parts, of roughly 6-7 episodes each.

- Part 1: where you are. The weakest part of the whole show.

- Part 2: starts at episode 9, IIRC. Dramatic and emotional. Goes up to Episode 16.

- Part 3: starts at ep 17, goes until roughly 21 or something. More "people drama", very Gundam-esque.

- Part 4: 22 or something, goes until the end. The famousest, awesomest part. Ends with epic hotblooded speeches summing up the themes of the show, so you know what you just watched.

If you don't like Parts (2) and (4), /then/ you don't like /Gurren Lagann/. I can't explain why without spoiling the show.

Actually, fuck it, spoiler for a hotblooded speech. I love writing this one out.

My basic motivation is to be able to spout stuff this epic /in real life/ and have it /actually be meaningful/.
