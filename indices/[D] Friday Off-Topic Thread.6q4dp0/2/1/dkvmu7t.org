  I recently discovered Oats Studios, which has some of the best looking short films on YouTube I've ever seen. I couldn't find clear info on what they're trying to do with Volume 1 that didn't involve me giving them money, so I'll just recommend their Lovecraftian horror stuff for your viewing pleasure.

Honestly, even if you do give them money it's unclear what they'll do, and Blomkamp has admitted as much.

Unsustainable models are a real concern.
