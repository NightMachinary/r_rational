I'm about to board a sailing ship (Blue Clipper) in Halifax, Canada, and sail to Let Havre, France. If you do not hear from me in September, we probably suffered a horrible accident and all died.

(Probably not. Sailing is one of the safest hobbies around)

Still, cant help being really excited and somewhat nervous. Mostly because my usual packing strategy - take what's on hand and buy whatever I'm missing at the destination - is really not well suited for the ocean.
