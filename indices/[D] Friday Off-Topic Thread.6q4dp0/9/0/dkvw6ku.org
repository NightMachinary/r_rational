There are a couple of reasons that writing a fic for it is harder than writing a fic for, say, Saved by the Bell:

1. There are a ton of characters and a ton of plotlines, which means that you either have to address all of them (which is a ton of work) or just drop some of them immediately (which feels unsatisfying).
2. The series is renowned for its good characterization, good prose, and complex plotting. All those things take both time and a skilled author, and if you ditch them your imitation will be rather pale.
3. There are some series that have a good core idea and bad execution, or a good premise that lots of plots can naturally spring from. I would argue that Game of Thrones is a /fairly generic setting/ which makes it not as amenable to fanfic.

I was watching a video by [[/u/hbomberguy]] the other day and he briefly talked about "memeification" of games; I think there's something similar that happens with fanfic. /Harry Potter/ isn't the franchise with the most fanfics just because millions of teenagers grew up with it, it's also because it's very ficcable. /Game of Thrones/ is ... not.
