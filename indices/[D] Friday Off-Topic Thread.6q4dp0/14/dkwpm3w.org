I recently got a laptop bag (the well-reviewed Timbuk2 Command), and was very disappointed.

The bag I'm using now doesn't fit a laptop, hence the attempt to upgrade, but it has this small outside pocket that I keep my keys, metro card etc. in. Very convenient. The biggest problem with the new one is that it doesn't have that.

Well, it kinda does, that's why I picked it, but it opens on the side, so you have to turn your hand at a weird angle to take anything out.

Which is not so convenient. Also, it's larger than I need, and kinda bulky even when empty.

Basically, what I'm looking for: Large enough for 13‚Äù laptop. Beyond that, smaller is generally better, since I want to carry it around pretty much all the time. Convenient outside pocket with zipper Sturdy, since I use it a lot and don't... like buying new things

Any recommendations?
