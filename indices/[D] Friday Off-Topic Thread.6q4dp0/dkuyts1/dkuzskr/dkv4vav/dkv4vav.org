Cultural common points, and commonalities in storytelling and mythology are two things I'm really interested in! It's incredible the similarities in folktales that cultures came up with to explain natural phenomenon. I think it's important to identify those commonalities in storytelling as a way of making our stories more appealing without watering things down.
