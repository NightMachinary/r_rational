No, the joke was that =dibbun= (=child in Redwall Abbey=) sounds vaguely like =dybbuk=. There aren't actually any (runs Google search) ghosts capable of malicious acts of possession in /Redwall/ canon (though I think there have been a few beneficent ghosts).

(Also, I think I may have run across this word previously in a children's book in which the protagonists were half-genie, or something similar.)
