Yeah, those are the three points that came to me when I read this question (I couldn't articulate them quite that well).

I'd also add that -4- ASoIF partly relies on one-shot "tricks" that play with the audience's expectations regarding Fantasy tropes. The Book 1 execution, the Red Wedding, the "For the Watch" mutiny, Tyrion's trial by combat, etc. Those are all based on placing a character in a "place" that is usually safe-ish by Fantasy standards, and then pulling the rug from under them. Of course they're a lot harder to pull off in fanfics (or in later books/seasons, for that matter) because the audience starts to expect them.
