Finding rational anime is hard man (although I'd like to hear some you've watched that's considered rational!)

I don't know exactly what you've seen but I'll throw out some commonly cited ones that are at least /smart/, if not completely rational:

Log Horizon (Characters trapped in MMORPG world, smarter, more group focused SAO)

Death Note (Smart enough to be fun)

Code Geass (Somewhat smart but in the oft-derided sherlock holmes way where protag makes massive, complicated leaps out of miniscule data)

Can't think of anymore off the top of my head, though I'm sure there is more out there.
