I've been mentally tossing around an idea for time travel mechanics for a while now. I was thinking about how you almost inherently need to severely limit how time travel works in order to create a meaningful plot. After all, how many Doctor Who episodes wouldn't have happened if the Doctor just hopped into the TARDIS at the first sign of trouble and went back to fix the problem before it happened?

The system I'm thinking of limits time travel by separating the world into two types of objects: time-flexible and time-inflexible. When a person travels back in time, they create a separate timeline diverging from the original timeline, with whatever change the time machine creates. The main difference is that when the alternate timeline reaches the point in time it started, it collapses back into the original timeline. From the perspective of the main timeline, every time-inflexible object stays the same, but all time-flexible objects /update/ to where they were in the alternate timeline when it collapsed.

For example, if at 12:35 I go back in time to 12:25, grab a time-flexible pencil and write a note on time-flexible paper then put the pencil in a different room, then after ten minutes at 12:35 the timeline collapses and, from the main timeline's perspective, the pencil instantaneously teleported to another room and the paper now has a note written on it.

This system limits time travel by keeping everything in terms of a main timeline. Every jump through time always returns to the main timeline as a simple list of changes, so you don't have to worry about things like causality loops and you aren't at risk of ending up in complicated scenarios that would confuse most readers. Depending on how you want to do things, you could allow nested time-edits but the system is much simpler with only one layer.

When a time-edit collapses and all the time-flexible objects update, the way I see things working is they'd outright swap space with whatever they were in. So if I dropped the pencil in the fish tank, when the time-edit collapses the spot on my desk where the pencil was would be replaced by an amount of water in the shape of the pencil. Naturally, this could be used as an assassination technique; knowing where someone is when the time-edit starts lets you put an object where their head will be and when the time-edit collapses their head is now separated from their body.

Being time-flexible would be tied to the atoms in question and not the object 'as a whole'. If I snapped the pencil in half, put one half in the fish tank and the other in a different room, the main timeline would update with half a pencil in the other room, half a pencil in the fish tank, and the spot where the pencil was on my desk would be replaced half with air and half with water.

Another interesting facet of this kind of time travel is that it produces scenarios where people act in extraordinary ways. Assuming it's simple enough to find out whether you're in a time-edit or not, many people would consider such drastic things as sacrificing themselves or other reckless behaviour if it helps stop time-flexible objects from being abused. You might literally nuke the white house with the president in it just so that the enemy can't put time-flexible objects in the oval office to assassinate the president in the main timeline. Mechanics like these would lend themselves to characters willing to 'make the hard choices' and would also present an opportunity to discuss the ethics of, say, torturing someone for information in a time-edit.

Your actions in a time-edit will very likely not go unnoticed. Any organization in on the secret worth its salt would ensure that when they discover they're in a time-edit, they notice and start taking notes. If finding out that you're in a time-edit is simple, that means that most organizations in the know will catalogue /every/ time-edit, even if they don't know what happened in it. How much each organization knows of course depends on how much information they have access to, but if you make big flashy moves like nuking the white house, people will take notice even in the main timeline.

Of course, a time travel mechanic isn't a story, but I think this sort of thing is an interesting way to incorporate time travel into a story without risking losing the readers or spiraling into causality loops and paradoxes. It leads to interesting moments where a person's incentive structures completely flip around because they're in a time-edit now and the gloves just came off, and it gives the time traveler foreknowledge, which is one of the things that makes time travel stories unique, but also prevents time travel being the answer to every single problem ever.
