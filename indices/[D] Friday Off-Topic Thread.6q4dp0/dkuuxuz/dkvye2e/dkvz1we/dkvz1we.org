I've heard of The World Ends With You, but I've yet to start a JRPG that I wanted to finish so I'm not sure if I enjoy the genre. Avatar is wonderful and I'm currently reading a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6ffjma/monthly_recommendation_thread/dijbsfe][slice of life fanfic]] for it that makes me feel happy.

Undertale is a weird case for me in that I got emotionally invested enough in the neutral ending to make me want to make things right in a pacifist run, but I didn't find the game fun enough to want to go through the journey there all over again.

I know there's more to the story that I'll discover on a second playthrough and I know I wouldn't have been as effected by the parts of the story I was if the gameplay was any different, but I just didn't have much fun waiting for the parts I found interesting.
