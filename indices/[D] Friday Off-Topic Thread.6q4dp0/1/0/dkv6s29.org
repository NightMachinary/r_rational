What defines whether an object is time-flexible or time-inflexible? I like the idea of trying to rationalize a time travel mechanic that /does/ allow for timeline-modification, but my worry is that the categorization for -flexible/-inflexible objects would be arbitrary based on story needs. In that case, it would be little different from Doctor Who, which has "fixed points in time" (typically the go-to answer for your question of "why doesn't the Doctor just avoid the whole problem in the first place").

Maybe "time-flexible" objects are solely objects that were sent back in time by the machine? So initially, your example time-traveler goes back to 12:25, makes a bunch of changes, but at 12:35 the timeline reverts back to the original - the only differences being where he's standing (any substances in that space he now fills are swapped, as you described) and the knowledge he gained during that alternate timeline. So maybe initially he starts using it just as a way to gather information, or run simulations, then he realizes he can essentially teleport (with some planning)...then he realizes that if he brings an object back /with/ him, he can leave it in a place in the alternate timeline that affects the main timeline (like your example of leaving an object where someone's head will be in the main timeline).

A system like that has some nice benefits from a writing standpoint:

- It uses hard rules that the reader can rely on
- It allows for a natural development and progression, as (a) the protag figures out better uses for the machine, and (b) as the consequences of those uses begin to catch up to him
- It's already limited, but further limitations can prevent the ability from running too wild (ex: machine only can go back in time X minutes, its size limits how much it can bring back, it needs Y minutes to recharge, etc)
