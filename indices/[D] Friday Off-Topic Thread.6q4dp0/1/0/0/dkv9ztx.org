That problem, of arbitrary 'this is time-flexible because it's convenient' things, hadn't really come up for me, though I guess I forgot to note that whenever I've thought about what objects are time-flexible, I've been thinking about it as a process that people intentionally use to make objects time-flexible. Something like an alien tech machine or a magic wand or whatever fits the context, just that it's intentionally used and is the primary source of time-flexible objects. (Personally, magic sounds the best if you want an everyman to happen across this, but other explanations would work too).

To some extent, there will still be some element of 'it's time-flexible because it's convenient for the author', but the author would then have to trace it back through to 'why did someone make this particular thing time-flexible?'. Also, I feel like letting people easily identify time-flexible objects could benefit the story. Perhaps while in a time-edit, time-flexible objects have a kind of glow? That would also neatly resolve the question of how people would tell that they're in a time-edit.

I'm also not sure what to think about time-flexible people. In a world where a lot of different groups are using time-edits, a time-flexible person has to personally live through all of them. It's a radically different experience than living in the main timeline and sending copies of yourself back in time (or copies of your brainstate to your past self, whichever) to hopefully change the present. It also doesn't bring /too/ much to the story because time-flexible notes can already bring information from yourself in the time-edit back to the main you. Being time-flexible yourself streamlines the process but doesn't open many doors.
