I was with you up until the space swapping of the substances. It seems unnecessarily symmetrical. Instead, why don't you insert some effect based on obscure, proven, theoretical, hypothetical, or otherwise (creatively) interesting effect? I think you'd get much more mileage out of something like that storywise. It could be something explicitly negative (predictable) but it could be more.
