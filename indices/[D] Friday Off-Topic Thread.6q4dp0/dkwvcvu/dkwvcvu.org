I just finished /The Marvelous Land of Oz/, the sequel to /The Wonderful Wizard of Oz/. This rather puts the idea of a rational Oz fanfic into a rather different light, what with the Powder of Life, Wishing pills, and a truth-detector good enough to detect lies of omition. Oh, and the transhumanism and the character who develops anxiety over mortality. And of course, no one, with the possible exception of Glinda, is all that rational, because I'm not sure it was ever supposed to make sense.

I also started rereading [[http://takeflight.rovang.org][Power Rangers: Take Flight]], partly with the hope that I could recommend it as a rational fan adaptation of a Super Sentai series. It tries, but it takes a quarter of the series before anyone becomes sufficiently motivated to not just accept the monster-of-the-week status quo. Oh, and there's an episode about Philosophical Zombies.

I feel like it at least has an excuse for the battle-on-foot --- battle-with-mechs formula, but it isn't especially clear about it. Doesn't make up for some of the ... weird... decisions that come about when random civilians get advanced military hardware.
