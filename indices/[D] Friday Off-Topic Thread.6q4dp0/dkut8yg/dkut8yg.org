Story Prompt/Idea:

The setting is the near future where most things are pretty similar to now, but full-brain emulation is now possible and there is a lot more storage space and processing power in our computers by a few orders of magnitude and all the associated technologies implied by such a shift.

Our protagonist is a not-so-smart guy, fairly average, but he's interested in the implications of the new full-brain emulations that was just revealed to the world and he's a very strong believer in the patternist theory of mind. He believes without any doubt that an emulation of him is the same person as him and he would like to have some version of him to live forever aka immortality.

So he decides to do something fairly reckless and immoral. To ensure there are multiple versions of him being simulated in the present or future, he decides to rent a sufficient amount of storage space to pirate himself and to make copies of his mind publicly available online to anyone to download for free. Anyone can download a simulation of his mind and do whatever they like to it. However getting his simulated mind to do work for them will require making an agreement of some type with the mind itself since it's not as if the mind will be coming downloaded with any insurances, agreements, or warranties.

Question #1: What would you do with the possibility of full-brain emulations to leverage your way into a position of power and/or immortality?

Question #2: How do you think people would react, (ab)use, or interact with a free copy of a human mind?

Question #3: Do you think there is any chance of his wishes of immortality succeeding with this gimmick?
