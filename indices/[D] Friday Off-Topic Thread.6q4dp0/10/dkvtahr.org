So I finished F.E.A.R. and... meh. The graphics are okay (especially for a 10-yo game), although the environments start to blend in after a while (there's a /lot/ of gray). The IA is interesting and the fights are engaging, but they also become more and more repetitive as the game advances, mostly because they become less about exploiting terrain and weapons to flank enemies and more about using the slow-mo to headshot everyone before they have time to react. The horror segments get old really fast, and the story is really bland and boring.

Besides the actual plot (unethical creepy experiments on little girl which turned her into an unstoppable ghost), the main problem is that the story feels detached from your actions. The main character is mute, which means the other characters kind of talk around him HL2-style, and also means that you can't share any of the valuable intel you might get during you visions or after talking to Fettel.

Also all of the NPCs you meet do something really stupid, get captured, and/or die within 10 minutes of you meeting them, so it's hard to get engaged.

I'd love to play other games that exploit the general combat system (small squads of smart enemies with powerful weapons and lot of movement abilities), but the sequels abandoned all the distinctive gameplay elements and most of the aesthetic and only kept the generic creepy little girl, the generic cannibal bad guy and the generic evil corporation, so that's a dud.

Though I guess I could get back to playing Superhot, since the gameplay is kinda similar.

EDIT: Also, reading papers and conferences about FEAR's AI is interesting... it does confirm that the AI is roughly as smart as I thought it was. The bulk of the of the perceived intelligence comes from 3 factors:

- Actual intelligent placement. The AI (usually) is smart enough to know when it needs to move to a different cover.

- Just like the Half Life soldiers, they have enough health and good reflexes that you actually perceive them as a threat.

- They speak a lot to signal awareness of their environment. "Grenade!", "He killed all my squad", or "I see a flashlight!".
