  EDIT: Also, reading papers and conferences about FEAR's AI is interesting... it does confirm that the AI is roughly as smart as I thought it was. The bulk of the of the perceived intelligence comes from 3 factors:

  Actual intelligent placement. The AI (usually) is smart enough to know when it needs to move to a different cover.

  Just like the Half Life soldiers, they have enough health and good reflexes that you actually perceive them as a threat.

  They speak a lot to signal awareness of their environment. "Grenade!", "He killed all my squad", or "I see a flashlight!".

I'm not a very experienced gamer, but I liked the early levels of Jedi Outcast for about the same reason (though it generally gets a whole lot easier later on).
