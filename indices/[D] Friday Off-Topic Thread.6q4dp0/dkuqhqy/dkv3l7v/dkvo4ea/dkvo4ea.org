It's not a gig in that I'm paying for the trip, they're not paying me :p generally for the basic crew there are no particular requirements - for the bigger ships you just sign up with their agent, like [[http://www.maybe-sailing.com]] or windseeker.org.

For the permanent crew, the officers that take care of the trainees and who are actually getting paid, there are some qualifications required but the exact ones will depend on the ship. They need to be legally allowed to command a ship in any case.
