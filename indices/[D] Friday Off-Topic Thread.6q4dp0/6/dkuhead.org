*I posted the below comment last week but I was two days late to the thread (an eternity in reddit time) so I decided to repost it to get a wider range of feedback.*

So, some of you probably noticed the Erogamer story posted here recently and in a comment thread prior. I started reading it and stopped because I lost interest in it (though I may pick it back up). I want to discuss something that occurs in the story, so *spoilers and NSFW content ahead*.

I've put a link a bit further down, but here's the context you need to interpret that link if you haven't read that story: [[#s][]]

It's a ~950 word section, a quick read. Just wanted to know what some of your thoughts were on this piece and what it says about explicit/implicit consent and the psychology of people, as I'm assuming it's fairly atypical for someone to have a neurological need to be raped.
