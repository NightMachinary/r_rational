I think rape fantasies of some kind are a fairly common kink, but the desire to act on them and especially the need not to 'cheat' by giving ANY form of consent is a lot less so - most non-erogamers are very well aware of the dangers that could bring and are much happier if they have, say, shared the idea of their fantasy with a trusted partner first. Also rape, even vaguely consensual 'rape' is unlikely to be what someone wants sexually in the real world if only because you can't give someone feedback on what you like at all.
