Let's see if we can start an MMA thread:

Cormier made weight without a towel this time! I am so excited. As someone on [[/r/MMA]] said, I just know there's an obstacle cause of coke, pregnant women, and dick pills for JJ to run through and potentially ruin things still somehow.

I'm also excited to see Demian Maia finally get a title shot. I am just a huge fan of the jits.

Anyway, my heart says DC but my head says JJ.
