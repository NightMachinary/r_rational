I can't say much about Daniel Black books, but Perilous Waif was a very enjoyable read, if a bit too short. It has fairly solid worldbuilding so far, and it's pretty action-packed. Maybe not the most rational read, but I consumed it all in under a week, and was very disappointed that it ended so soon.

I think there was a post here by Eliezer who recommended it, describing it as "a transhumanist fairytale", and that's spot on. The only other story I've read with similar amounts of transhumanist themes explored sufficiently from "widespread usage" point of view is To The Stars, the sci-fi Madoka fic. I also can recommend it, if you can deal with an unfinished story with glacially slow update schedule. As a nice bonus, it also is much longer, especially if you consider its planned length.
