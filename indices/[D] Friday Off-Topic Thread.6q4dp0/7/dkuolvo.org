Hotels and flights for CrossingsCon were /finally/ booked this week, as well as for our vacation after that! I'm also finally kinda on-track with GRE studying every day, emailing prospective PIs, and otherwise getting on-track for my PhD applications this autumn.

Also, in terms of imagery, how creepy would it be if you looked at a human face, and it was sort of suddenly part-human, part-shark? Like, not gills or gray skin or anthropomorphized. The same face, but suddenly with [[http://images.entertainment.ie/images_content/rectangle/620x372/SHARK2012112145705.jpg][beady black eyes and a disjointed, gaping jaw full of sharp teeth]], but still otherwise human and able to /talk/? The goal here is to warp an actual face into conveying pure, all-consuming, I'm-going-to-kill-you-just-because-you're-there /death/.
