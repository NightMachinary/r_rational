Oh, there will certainly be more than just these three terrain types, this will just cover most of them. Concrete would probably just be a skin of stone (same properties, different appearance), while wood is indeed unique enough to be its own (mostly due to the flammability). Wood actually came up as something that will need to exist with trees, both when they're standing and knocked down. No doubt there will be others, such as glass, and a myriad of skins just because.

While discussing this on Discord I realized that a more sophisticated means of handling transitions between terrain types will eventually be needed, but that's probably in optional mod territory. Still, the voxel system demands that we reduce the amount of information needed to define a tile as much as humanly possible, which was how we came to trying to reduce terrain types to fundamental groups in the first place.
