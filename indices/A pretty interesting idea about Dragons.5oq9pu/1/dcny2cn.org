First of all, I personally think i should have given a description of what was in the video when sharing it. Therefore, I apologise for not already doing that.

Yes, I am aware that eastern mythology represents dragons very differently from western mythological dragons. And yes, that means i know that by the western definition of dragon (a usually huge powerful beast covered in reptile-like scales, claws, wings etc.) the eastern dragons like Chinese or Japanese dragons (floating serpentine four legged creatures usually representing some sort of divine power), Indian mythological creatures (like naga's etc) do not qualify as dragon's under it.

From what i have seen of Vsauce videos, they have a pretty unique (sort of meandering from topic to topic) quality to them. They feel like moving from one topic to a completely different and disconnected one with barely any transition. I just took the quotes as transition's and assumed an entirely different idea was being presented after each such quote/transition. I did this almost reflexively and so the idea of seeing the entire video as a whole didn't even occur to me. I am used to seeing them as a series of barely related ideas.

I should have done a little more independent research before sharing this video, and thus possibly share it in a more appropriate thread. The premise of the video doesn't really belong in Rational Fiction.

I shared this by the name “A pretty interesting idea about dragons”, because I really didn't put much faith in the idea of Dragon's being a chimera made of ancient predator's of our very very distant ancestors (the first mammals). It was just something interesting, and so i thought worth sharing.

So, Yes. I agree that it is much more likely that dragon's were just fanciful imaginations resulting from our fear of snakes or something. It is also likely the less convoluted theory.
