Idk about the dragon analogy. to define the different views and in VS2's interpretations HAS THE same meaning as that of a darth vader head in our popular era. IMO, VSauce2 told us an anthropomorphic meta-allegory and not a philosophical argument so much. What Beyond G&E says is: “He who fights too long against dragons becomes a dragon himself; and if you gaze too long into the abyss, the abyss will gaze into you.” VS2 is looking for is Lacan to explain his convoluted reasoning. It is like a feeling of the abyss staring back is a "sinthome" - which is a neurotic symptom. It is a characteristic of the psychological analysis of an individual and derisive of innocence and exploits sovereignty. [[http://www.psychoanalysis.ugent.be/pages/nl/artikels/artikelsPaulVerhaeghe/Englishsymptom.pdf][In the context of the creation of a new signifier or sinthome, creation is only creation insofar as it builds upon the lack of the Other, that is, insofar as it is a creatio ex nihilo: “It is by this [the lack] that I try to meet the function of art, what is implied by what is left blank as fourth term, when I say that art can even reach the symptom.”58]]
