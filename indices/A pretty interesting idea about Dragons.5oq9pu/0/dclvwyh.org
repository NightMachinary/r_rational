The biggest problem with this argument is that it supposes that dragons, as such, existed outside of Western mythology. Eastern "dragons" are not actually dragons, and neither is Quetzalcoatl. These are interpolations by Western scholars, a sort of mythological equivalent to the same drive that led people to give out names like "sea cucumber" and "sea lion."

I also dislike how the video takes out of context quotations and supplies them with a different meaning. The video means for you to infer that Nietzsche and Chesterton are referring to dragons as symbols of the same ideas that the video is using them to represent, but in these three statements (Nietzsche, Chesterton, and the video) you have three separate symbolic meanings. Also, I am highly doubtful that "He who fights dragons" was even the intended translation of Nietzsche's passage; I have never heard it till now and googling this alternate translation turns up very little.

Other things that don't add up:

- The snake did not make Gilgamesh mortal. It *kept* him from becoming immortal, but he was already mortal, which is not what the video implies. Furthermore, to the best of my knowledge, scholars are in agreement that the snake figured in this myth not because it was dangerous but because the shedding of its skin represented eternal youth. I am more than happy to hear arguments against the idea, but to not even bring up the current consensus implies that VSauce is unaware or else unwilling to admit that this idea would be controversial.
- There were predatory birds and mammals before there were primates. Why is it only primates that are described as having these instincts?
- "Birds of prey" may not have evolved immediately after the end of the Mesozoic, but the first birds evolved from meat-eating theropods. If VSauce wants to posit that birds universally dropped carnivory for a time, only to pick it back up later, then this needs to actually be argued.
- Similarly, some major forms of carnivorous mammal did not appear until later in Earth's history but miacoids were a group of predatory mammal that first appeared 66 million years ago (near the end of the Mesozoic) and ate, among other things, mammals that were smaller than themselves.
- Not all dragons have legs or wings. In fact, the earliest dragons were likely legless.
- The book /An Instinct for Dragons/ is basically this video in writing and shares many of its flaws. Checking reviews, I can't find any scholars who actually liked the book.

In short, this video is not just wrong, but so wrong that I'm hesitant to watch any other videos by the same creator. I know enough about comparative mythology to spot the problems here (and I'm enough of a skeptic and procrastinator to fact-check the biology side of things when I ought to be doing schoolwork) but the next video could be just as horribly wrong, but about a subject that I know nothing about.
