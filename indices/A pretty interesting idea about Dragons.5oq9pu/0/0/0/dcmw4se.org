VSauce told us an anthropomorphic meta-allegory and started it out with ten minutes of what turns out to be bad mythology and pseudoscience. I'm cool with spinning conspiracy theories and writing psychology fanfiction but I /don't/ appreciate it when people try to pass it off as fact. There are people who are watching this video and coming away with misinformation; I don't require that fiction be banned, or even that every page of it be plastered with disclaimers, but I do expect people to have the common decency to not present themselves as informative and in that guise present fiction.

It is okay to present fiction, but you do not pass it off as fact. You just don't. Never ever forever. I recognize that I might be considered extreme by the community because I advocate for radical honesty and dislike even white lies, but I would expect that we can at least agree that it's a bad idea to /create a supposedly educational video that misinforms people./

I am familiar with the full quote from /Beyond Good and Evil/. In German, it says:

#+begin_quote
  Wer mit Ungeheuern k√§mpft, mag zusehn, dass er nicht dabei zum Ungeheuer wird. Und wenn du lange in einen Abgrund blickst, blickt der Abgrund auch in dich hinein.
#+end_quote

"Ungeheuer," to the best of my knowledge, does not translate to "dragon." I am have been searching up and down and have not found any source that offers "dragon" as even an alternate definition.

(Btw, your link is broken)
