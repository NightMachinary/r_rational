  I refute it because the evidence is weak and at odds with reality.

You mean that dragons (from any culture) have no similarities with snakes or large birds? Uh huh.

I think I would say the animal traits that make up mythical creatures are chosen because a fair number of people find those traits impressive or creepy, that the animals turn out to be predators of our ancestors is just coincidence in this case.

You don't need to refute an idea just because it is presented badly, though I agree that his evidence and stuff was of poor quality.
