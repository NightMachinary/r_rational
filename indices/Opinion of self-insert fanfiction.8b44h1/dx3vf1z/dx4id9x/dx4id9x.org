Well [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10996503/1/Of-the-River-and-the-Sea][Of The River And The Sea]] is an SI in Naruto about a women reincarnated.... into the bloody mist. She /tries/ to be as rational as possible.... but she's mentally ill IRL and there's no bloody medication so we watch her slow decline in mental health for 11 years until she finally deserts for Orochimaru who basically, as in canon, is the guy smart enough to develop entirely new branches of science when he wants to, so he basically reinvents schizophrenia meds and CBT. Then the fallout of living in the bloody mist for 11 years despite being exposed to normal earth values for her 20-odd year life beforehand, and she ends up only partially functional, which is nice in an SI. She starts occasionally doing really irrational stuff and only sometimes recognizing it because she's legit not right in the head. Good stuff, intriguing, even if the first 12 chapters are total edgelordville
