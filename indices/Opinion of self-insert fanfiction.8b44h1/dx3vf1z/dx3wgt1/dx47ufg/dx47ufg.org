As thrawnca says its always "according to author" but it's important to have the ability to write something that is not literally author.

I think in many ways this is more important because it helps give different voices to characters. When you already are writing one character as you its easier to write everyone as you without distinguishing characteristics or contrast.

That said if you want to see how this kind of thing can work spectacularly well inspite of this "rule" go read " the man who folded himself. "

It is an excellent example of flipping everything I just said on its head.
