Like all rules of writing, I think the rule "Don't write self-insert fiction" is subject to the following caveats:

- Any rule can be broken, if the writer is good enough.
- Unless you can articulate the reason why the rule shouldn't be broken, why your story doesn't run afoul of that reason, and why your story /needs/ that rule to be broken, you're probably not good enough.
- The vast majority of writers aren't able to pass that test, and you're likely to be in the vast majority.

That said, some of the best fiction out there is the stuff that breaks the rules. /Someone/ has to be on the leading edge when a [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CyclicTrope][cyclic trope]] cycles back, and they're generally lauded for it.

I think HPMOR is a very good self-insert fiction; WtC skates a little too close to wish-fulfillment for my liking; Stephen King's self-inserts are really freaking weird but don't quite break suspension of disbelief, and pretty much every other SI I've read has been written by someone who shouldn't have broken the rule.
