I haven't read either story mentioned, so my comment wasn't meant to be a judgement on either story. I'll probably get around to WTR eventually, but "1.1 million words and still ongoing" is not a project that I want to undertake at the moment. That's about the length of the entire HP series, or the first four ASOIAF books.

I probably won't be reading Kaleidoscope at all; Naruto is not one of my fandoms.
