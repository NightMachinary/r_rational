Eh, I think that's oversimplifying. Yes, he is often the Only Sane Man, but frankly, if you take a look at canon, that's pretty justifiable. I mean, the technology exists, so /why doesn't Superman wear a kryptonite radiation shield?!/

And he can't always help everyone, [[#s][eg]]. If anything, the unrealism is not so much in the main character pointing out reasonable things, but rather the frequency with which other characters actually take good advice. Though that's still /far/ from always.
