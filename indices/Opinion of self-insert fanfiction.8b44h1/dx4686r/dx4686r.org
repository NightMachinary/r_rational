  I also recommend Worth the candle but we all know of it and its a very unique case. The MC is basically an SI in his own original universe. It has most of the qualities of a self-insert fanfiction but the reader knows nothing about the fictional universe which makes it so special. It's a mystery for everyone including him.

WtC has some problems for me and some of them take root in it being a direct self insert. It also is a wish fulfillment to an extent, rather slow and earned one, but still. Not even counting the literal ROB in it. There is a lot to discuss about WtC and i already posted a lot of my problems with it in respective thread. Instead i want to talk about the description you gave to the "self insert" stories and their tropes.

  Using his knowledge of the past, present, and future, the self-insert has to adapt to the fictional setting he was placed in. In self-insert fanfiction the SI is usually placed in the setting by a ROB(Random Omnipotent Being), reincarnated, or my preferred option, inexplicably transmigrated.

  Self-insert fanfiction has a tendency to delve into wish fulfillment, SI's ignoring glaring canon plots he should not be able to avoid, SI's easily becoming overpowered compared to their fictional protaginists/antagonists, and SI's focusing on romance rather than solving canon problems of the fictional world.

Your explanation of self insert fits almost perfectly to any Isekay\transferred to another world fiction, even some of the trapped in the MMO ones. I think the problem is the writing style and what authors want to achieve\tell with their story, not exactly the self insert itself.
