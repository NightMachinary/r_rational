Isekai is mainly original fictions. I tried to explain what a self insert is in a self-insert fanfiction. Fanfiction is a whole other bag of worms that I'm looking to get into. With this ring pulls off the self insert trope so well because the DC universe is so expansive. Every character you are introduced to has its own back story already established due to years of world building the author does not have to get into.
