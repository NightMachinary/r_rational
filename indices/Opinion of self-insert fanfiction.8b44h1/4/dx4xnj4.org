Going a bit meta, commercial fiction has a different sort of payout for me than self-published amateur work.

Commercial Fiction needs to tell a reasonably complete story in 80k-160k words. There needs to be a big climax at 90% of the word-count. And the work needs enough mainstream appeal to cover the costs of marketing and production.

To make a food analogy: Commercial Fiction is like a a high-end Italian restaurant. We expect excellent polish and presentation. The food is comforting and tasty, but the variety is constrained by the form and the need mass-acceptability. The result is something "Well Rounded."

Amateur work is what happens when my foodie friends call me over and say, "Hey! You've got to try this!" I don't expect that their Szechuan-Peppercorn-Infused Brownies will be comforting or well-presented. They might not even be good. But that's not the point.

Instead, experimental work, at it's best, is someone pushing an idea as far as it can go. Often, this involves sacrificing other aspects. The result isn't "well rounded" in the sense that commercial fiction is. But it's often very interesting.

ROBs are a way of hand-waving a premise. That would undercut commercial fiction. But I don't mind them in experimental fiction. They're a way for the author to jump straight to the interesting part of their idea. And, I'd take a ROB over a couple pages of unnecessary setup.

SIs are an experimental technique. The technique isn't great in most stories, which is why commercial fiction doesn't use it. But, "With This Ring" is all about the author using the technique to do something interesting.

I'd argue that Fan Fiction is a shortcut in the same way that ROBs are a short-cut. You can start off with an authors note like: "ROB takes level 1 Intelligent Hermione, Harry, Ron and Daphne and drops them on a tall ship. They can't see land. They don't recognize the stars. Magic doesn't work."

This lets us get straight to the interesting idea -- what would a group of teenagers do if they were stranded on a boat in an unknown location -- without the 40k+ words of fluff that commercial fiction would need to tell us that one is courageous, one reads, one whines and another is haughty.

The cost of experimental fiction is that, if the interesting idea falls flat, then you don't have all the other fluff to fall back on. And, since most ideas don't work, there's a lot of terrible fan-fiction. But, amateur works are still one of the few places where I run into really novel ideas.
