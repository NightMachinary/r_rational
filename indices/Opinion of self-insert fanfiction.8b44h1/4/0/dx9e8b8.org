This is a great distinction, restaurant quality vs home experimentation quality.

I'd further add that although amateur work can sometimes be well-rounded and complete, there is always a cost to that. Some people don't have the experience or skill to do a complete work - but still have an interesting and thought-provoking idea to get out there. Some simply don't have the time to write 100K, or have so many different ideas that they'd rather write 10 * 10K. Dismissing work purely because it takes shortcuts would just mean that you don't hear those ideas.

  And, since most ideas don't work, there's a lot of terrible fan-fiction.

That's R&D for you...
