ROBs ruin any story, even though the idea was to make it easy to get started.

SIs are better being OC SIs (so the main character is still a character) and preferably doesn't know anything about the setting/story. Reincarnation makes things even smoother, but aren't 100% necessary.

Orange Lantern is better because he doesn't know the precise setting and plot, but essentially has magic knowledge that's indifferentiable from a lantern database, and so becomes a mere universe transmigrant.

Kaleidoscope was okay because it only focused one particular plot point (instead of no knowledge), but wasn't terrible because he didn't know the whole plot and anything about Itachi.

There's another Naruto fic I liked a lot because the SI knew nothing about Naruto at all (it didn't exist, he's a ressurected soul in a baby). If you try to search for it, he's raised by the Sannin and acts like a senpai for Minato. It's a few hundred thousand words. I can't remember its name.

ROBs suck because an omnipotent power makes everything seem kinda pointless and life untrustworthy. It makes a goal of going back or being normal pointless (common goals, although plot forces the mc to not do that). Zelretch as an excuse is similar, but not nearly as bad.

That Naruto fic I mentioned is great because of how well it ties together SIness with the story.

Inexplicably transmigrated works, but you need to be careful of everything becoming stupid. It's generally worse knowing about plot here, rather than knowing about it when being reincarnated. The idea is generally to make a new plot and don't follow the old, if you know about the plot in the first place. You want to make the story feel real, and following the plot while knowing it breaks the fourth wall too much. Being in the same setting while knowing how life could be if you weren't there is ok, being explained by multiverse differences.

Essentially, you can't know the same plot while you follow it, because that breaks the fourth wall too much. The plot has to be different and the SI needs to accept that. This rule can be bent if the SI only knows a little bit about the plot/setting/characters. The thing is, the characters shouldn't feel like they're in a story, but living life, as all characters should.

In a way, good SI fics are those that turn it into an isekai/reincarnation fic.

I'd be interested in a good quality counterexample to refine this rule.
