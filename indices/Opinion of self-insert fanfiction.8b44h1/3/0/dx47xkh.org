To date the best ROB stories I've read use the ROB as a possible explanation that is in doubt.

Or it's actually not quite a ROB but is a god and the story is about that sort of disparity.

There is an amazing pony story about celestia pretty much creating everything from scratch gradually ands slowly and the conflict of that story is within her being unsure that anything in the universe matters because it was something she invented for herself "from dust"
