[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/blood-and-chaos-the-story-of-a-btvs-si-turned-vampire.354777/][Blood and Chaos]] was an interesting Buffy the Vampire Slayer self insert which I quite enjoyed. The main character seemed mostly rational, although has some odd goals at times.

It's not finished, and only has very rare updates.
