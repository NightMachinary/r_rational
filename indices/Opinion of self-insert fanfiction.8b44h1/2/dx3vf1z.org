I have great distaste for ROBs. Hate them on general principle. It nullifies, any stake or value or meaning to a story to have a ROB just set it up for you.

I prefer reincarnates when alternatives are not possible.

That said I also feel like a story can probably be better served with a none-omniscient characters. And most of the time I find self insert fiction to be a kind of authorial crutch.

An author writes themselves because it's easy to ask "what would I do in this situation?" Which is essentially a step of simplification down from asking "what would X character do in this situation?"

Personal preference, it's not something that is impossible to overcome or do well. But I feel like the successes are more in spite of self-insert fanfiction rather then because of it.

That said I'd argue that Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality reads a lot like Eliezer wrote a amnesiac self insert into Harry.

Also although it's not Rationalist it's useful to remember that Dante's Inferno and Paradisio was effectively Bible Self-insert fanfiction. So it's not strictly speaking a guarantee something is going to be bad either.
