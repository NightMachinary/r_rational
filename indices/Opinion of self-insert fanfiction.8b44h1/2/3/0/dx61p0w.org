It is more in how they setup the framing device and in particular the use of ROB as done in space battles where especially with a self insert they just call it a "Random Omnipotent Being" just... if it's that meaningless and arbitrary of you to have a plot device why are you bothering?

The arbitrary but some how focused on specifically the one being with no context, meaning, goal or instrumental reason behind it? that is what I dislike.

As soon as you start defining a ROB as something other then an arbitrary entity you drop the random from it.

As soon as you make it not actually omnipotent then your dropping that.

So yes I'm fine when it's not literally a ROB I'm just incensed and have to work about four times as hard to even bother reading a story if their 'hook' is "So this thing I don't care about at all and could be literally just some dude writing a story to make the situation sets up me in this situation." It's like not just an self insert, it's a self insert with an double mobius reach around self insert writing the self insert with the self insert acknowledging the bullshit of the self insert and why are you bothering to do this author I don't care if you just wink at me about it like that shut up.
