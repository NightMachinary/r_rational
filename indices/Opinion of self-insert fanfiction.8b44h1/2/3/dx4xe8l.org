  I have great distaste for ROBs. Hate them on general principle. It nullifies, any stake or value or meaning to a story to have a ROB just set it up for you.

How do you feel about ROBs when they're dynamic characters who are omnipotent /relative to the protagonist/, but not relative to the setting? Like, say, the Greek gods in any story with multiple Greek gods; or The Architect in /The Matrix/ movies? Basically---someone who has root-level access to the simulation the protagonist resides in, but where the ROB still also resides somewhere and does not have root-level access to their /own/ reality, and where the protagonist may potentially have effects on the ROB's "level" of reality that the ROB can't just magic away?

Because, er, I've been planning on writing a story with characters like that. (Imagine the setting of /Portal/, but with a VR world instead of a bunker. Would the GLaDOS of that setting be acceptable?)
