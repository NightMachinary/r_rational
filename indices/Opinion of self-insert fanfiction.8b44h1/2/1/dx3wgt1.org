Funnily enough, EY's response to the argument that Harry is a self-insert in HPMOR is to consider it a compliment. He feels like /everyone/ in it is a self-insert, to an extent, so people acting like only Harry is instead of everyone means he wrote everyone well. Not trying to debate the point, I just find it interesting

Although that does lead into a larger point: if a writer has to contain everyone and everything they write in their head (which I don't necessarily agree with, but I've seen a lot of people that do), to what extent is a character /not/ a self-insert? For the purposes of this thread's discussion, it's "when the character is intentionally made as a self-insert", which is why I'm saying this as a response to you rather than as a response to the OP
