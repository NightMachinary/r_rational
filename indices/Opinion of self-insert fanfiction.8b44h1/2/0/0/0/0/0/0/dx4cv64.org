Ah, yeah, in that sense, agreed. They're basically just a plot device anyway. Unless you get something like Aqua in Konosuba, which subverts and parodies that trope by making the deity much more fallible and dragging her down to the "other world" with the protagonist (I know this might not be what we had in mind originally here, but given that /a lot/ of isekai Light Novels are basically self inserts of some kind, I think the comparison fits).
