Oh, I see. Personally I don't have any problems with ROBs like Q. I hate how ROBs are overused as a method of kicking off the plot. Anybody who spends time reading SI stories already knows the broad strokes, so why bother wasting time and words on a rehash of "I'm ROB, I was bored, I don't particularly care about you, here's your new world, enjoy"?
