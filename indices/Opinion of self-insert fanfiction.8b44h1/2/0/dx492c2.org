  I have great distaste for ROBs. Hate them on general principle. It nullifies, any stake or value or meaning to a story to have a ROB just set it up for you.

Personally I don't hate them, I just think that they're an uninteresting setup. In my opinion, [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/corrupted-data-files-star-trek-si.510418/][Corrupted Data Files]], a third-person comedy fic where the SI took Data's place, did it right by not addressing how or why the SI came to be where he was. And besides, if you're reading a story on the Spacebattles forum, you already know the deal.

Following that logic, I can't think of any SI fanfics that wouldn't be improved by removing the ROB chapter and any references thereto.
