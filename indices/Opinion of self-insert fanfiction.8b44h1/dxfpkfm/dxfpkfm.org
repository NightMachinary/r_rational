I don't really write self insertion any more. I still like to imagine myself being a fuckawesome mover and shaker in the world of my choice, but whenever I try to commit an idea on paper my inner nitpicker comes out to play and calls out all of the shenanigans I had to commit in order for Someone Who's Literally Me (in personality, experience, skills, power levels, or some combination of the above) to not immediately die a horrible death in most of the settings I want to play in. Deus ex Machina is fun for pure self-indulgence, not so much for suspending disbelief.

(Shameless self promotion--my last attempt at writing an SI, and all of the Fridge Logic that immediately sprang into mind, actually inspired a story: [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m39krh8rthwp3ipOrclXjAT0CHOTksVfiDI0oLkmUGg/edit?usp=sharing][Free to Play]] )
