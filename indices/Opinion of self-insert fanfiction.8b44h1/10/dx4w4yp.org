Could someone explain how Kaleidoscope is rational? The MC seems to follow an extremely simplistic and straightforward plan: Train until you are useful enough not to be killed.

It's also why I stopped reading. There are so many things the MC could have tried, but they just turtle up and train? That seems insane. As in, literally not right in the head. I could not understand how his plan was supposed to work, and indeed it did not work at all. I stopped reading after everything happened just as predicted and he was "killed" with the rest of the clan. His plan did not have any noticeable impact at all. If I have missed something, I'd be quite interested.
