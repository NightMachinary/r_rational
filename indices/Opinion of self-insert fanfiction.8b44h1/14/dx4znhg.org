Lots of SI's on the alternatehistory forum which is quite fun to see how you'd industrialise a nation or the optimal routes for a country.

I don't think SI's have to be fictional so I'm not sure why you said that. Me waking up in Queen Victoria's body is identical to an SI.

Also worth the candle isn't that unusual it's similar to a few comics that have been posted before about people being transported to DnD worlds that they are familiar with.

What came first ROBs or ASBs?
