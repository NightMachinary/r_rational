I would de-recc Dreaming of Sunshine for going on for several hundred thousand words without significantly deviating from canon or developing the main character in an interesting way.

For the opposite reason, willingness to divert from canon, I would recommend Roll the Dice on Fate, as the main character works effectively to derail canon even as a child.
