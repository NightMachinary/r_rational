Even the best SI tends towards wish-fulfillment. This can be okay... I I just need to moderate my expectations and be prepared to drop it if it drags on or loses too much tension by making the main character OP. With this Ring was/is right at the threshold of what I consider worth reading... if the main character was just a little bit more successful or if other characters were just a little bit less willing to call them out when they act crazy I would have probably dropped it. Worth the Candle avoids a lot of problems and intentionally deconstructs a few others... I think the fact that the author is writing a younger version of themselves helps them avoid some of the sleezier wish fulfillment.

In [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/in-my-time-of-troubles-dnd-si-sorta.426130/][My Time of Troubles]] it is a DnD (Forgotten Realms) reincarnation SI. Main character is an Orc cleric/priest and goes about trying to improve Orc civilization. It has the semi-continuation/sequel (original still in progress) Young Justice SI The Dark Shard: Enemy of The Light, where the MC is again reincarnated this time in the DC universe. They go about trying to better organized the governments capacity to deal with magic. Very long. Rational/rationalist to a reasonable extent.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10779196/1/Walk-on-the-Moon][Walk on The Moon]] is a Naruto reincarnation SI in which the MC goes about trying to accumulate the raw power to escape Ninja life... making them self miserable and isolated in the process. Plots dragged on some but the character development is solid. Rationalist in an edgy kind of way.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10796824/1/Dragonfly][Dragonfly]] Naruto reincarnation SI. The SI doesn't have what it takes to relentlessly seek after power, so instead they make the best of things in their own way. A short and sweet story. Kind of the opposite of Walk on The Moon. Maybe anti-rationalist by what most people expect from the genre, but rational in its realism.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/dreaming-of-worm-complete.440227/][Dreaming of Worm]] features a case 53 SI. There ability to influence canon is limited by their semi-lucid state, but they try. Short and Sweet.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-prison-of-glass-worm-cyoa.486424/][A Prison of Glass]] is a Worm CYOA fanfic told from the canon characters perspective that shows just how crazy/scary a SI can look from the outside. A deconstruction.
