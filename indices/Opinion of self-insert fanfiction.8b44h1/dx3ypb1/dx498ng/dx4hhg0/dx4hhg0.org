The author is also really bad about having redundant point of view shifts (i.e. showing an event from 3 different characters perspectives), in a way that really slows the plot down. I think A Dark Shard is a lot better in terms of having more consistent plot development. The author borrows from the structure of Young Justice canon without following it too closely.
