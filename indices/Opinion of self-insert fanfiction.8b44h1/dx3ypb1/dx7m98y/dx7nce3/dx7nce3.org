I just started reading it after seeing it recommended in another post. It hasn't broken my suspension of disbelief, or made the main character too ridiculously OP, or stuck to the rails of canon, so it beats 95% of SIs out there. It looks super long, but as long as the author keeps the plot moving that's okay. At chapter 30 currently.
