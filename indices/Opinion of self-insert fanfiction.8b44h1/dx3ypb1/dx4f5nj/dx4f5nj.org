I'll second a recommendation for Walk on the Moon, though I think many would object to it being called rational. The most generous interpretation of the main character is that she has some significant character flaws and biases that make her life far more difficult than necessary. A less generous interpretation is that she's non compos mentis and would be diagnosed with something pretty major in the DSMV (I'm not quite sure what).

Others may draw a different line, but I would nonetheless call it rational. Despite being nuttier than a fruitcake, the main character intelligently uses her resources in a systematic manner to achieve her goals. In some ways, it serves as a deconstruction of SI fiction, as, perhaps, it is not only plausible, but likely, that a person would not be entirely sane when entered into such a situation with such knowledge.
