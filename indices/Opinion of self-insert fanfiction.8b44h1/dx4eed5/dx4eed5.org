That's not what "self-insert" means. An SI story is simply one in which the author appears in the story, almost always but not necessarily as the main character. There's nothing wrong with SIs per se; the reason they draw hate is because the SI often ends up being a Mary Sue. As to omniscience...I've read a lot of SI stories and, even in stories where the SI is familiar with the setting, I have literally never read one where the character is omniscient, or even omniscient about the setting.

Some good SI stories:

[[https://fanfiction.net/s/7347955/1/Dreaming-of-Sunshine][Dreaming of Sunshine]] SI is reincarnated as Shikamaru's OC sister. Sticks a little too close to stations of the canon to be ideal, but it's rational and a lot of fun.

[[https://fanfiction.net/s/11402847/1/Roll-the-Dice-on-Fate][Roll the Dice on Fate]], by our own [[/u/Jackercracks]]. The SI is born as a baby, orphaned during the 9-Tails attack, and needs to do everything he can to avoid being inducted as one of Orochimaru's experiments, up to and including becoming Gai's disciple. Derails canon almost immediately.
