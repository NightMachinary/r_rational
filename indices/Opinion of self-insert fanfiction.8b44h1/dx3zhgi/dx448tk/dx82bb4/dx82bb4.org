With this Ring has good and bad points.

The good : it's arguably fairly rational fiction. The author tries to accurately model the crazy mix of magic, schizo tech, and flat out power rings that is the DC verse. Villains who shouldn't be able to harm a guy with a power ring - like the Joker - get arrested like kittens.

The bad is that it's really, really long, and a lot of the content is semi filler. Really it does have regular bits of drama and action, it's nothing as bad as Robert Jordan books, but it still starts to drag.

The final problem is that it's full of comic references and story references and moderately difficult to follow if you haven't read the comics.
