I haven't read any of the comics, and only recently began watching some of the Young Justice TV series, and although I'm sure I've missed references, I've still quite enjoyed WtR.

I guess YMMV. I agree it's very long, but it's pretty action-packed nevertheless. Probably something to do with the speed of updates; there are chapters that would feel like a let-down if they were a month apart, but with them arriving every day, it can get away with being long.
