  A self-insert fanfiction is a story where a character or "self-insert" is inputted into a fictional setting of a preestablished fictional universe for which the character has omniscient knowledge of.

This is kind of a weird definition of a self-insert that seems to be completely different from how I've heard it used everywhere else. A brief google search indicates that I'm not misremembering here. It this definition unique to rationalist circles?

The ordinary definition of a self-insert is when an author inserts themselves into the story. I.e. a character in the story is clearly based on the author of the story. This can range from having a character with a similar personality to the author to having the character literally be the author, including awareness that they are the author. The latter seems to be common in comic books, with characters having discussions with the author character about plot points or other things.

Omniscience has nothing to do with it. Sure a self-insert could be omniscient, but so can any other character. A self-insert could break the 4th wall, but again, so could any other characters. Those are properties that are orthogonal to the concept of a self-insert.
