Yeah, to me the prototypical example of a self-insert is the SI is a new kid at Hogwarts and Harry and Draco both want her to be their girlfriend, and the SI just blushes a lot, gets straight As, and is the star of the quidditch team, but doesn't actually have any sort of omnipotent knowledge.

I guess the overlap with the Rationalsphere and the whole concept of munchkinry makes the genre-savvy variant more beloved here.
