We're coming up on a 3-week break on writing. After the update this coming weekend, the next update will be in mid-late September. It seems like the quest is finally starting to pick up steam (there's a lot more discussion now) but the break is unavoidable unfortunately, since I won't be able to write during that time. I'm glad with how things have gone so far, though.
