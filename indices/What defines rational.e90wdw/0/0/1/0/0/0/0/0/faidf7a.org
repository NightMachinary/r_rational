[[/r/worldbuilding][r/worldbuilding]] is a place where people share stuff they made up, as in "this is a picture of a Kerithronean ranger, and here are some facts about how they breed their horses and play the traditional Kerithronean Mounted Games." If you enjoy making up worlds and want to share them without the bother of writing a story, [[/r/worldbuilding][r/worldbuilding]] is for that. It is not intended to discuss works of fiction as such.

People may have been throwing around the term "hard fantasy" for some time, but that is distinct from it being a currently broadly accepted and currently popular genre. Sword and Planet, for example, goes back a hundred years, but it's a fairly obscure niche that went out of fashion some time ago. It is also not necessarily the case that all the people using a term are going to be using it to refer to the same thing; the encyclopedia entry you link to limits Hard Fantasy to stories with rigorous magic systems, not to intelligent and consistent worldbuilding fiction in general.

My point is that this place is basically the only destination I've found explicitly dedicated to discussing and promoting deep-worldbuilding fiction. And I've gone digging, for marketing reasons; if there's another such place, and it's got more than two dozen cranky holdouts posting twice a month, I'd be delighted to hear about it. There's spacebattles (and related/schismatic forums) but those are more eclectic, and frankly the proliferation of rules and fights-over-rules terrifies me.
