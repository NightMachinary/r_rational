  My point is that this place is basically the only destination I've found explicitly dedicated to discussing and promoting deep-worldbuilding fiction.

Yeah, and I hate that, because it /shouldn't/ be dedicated to consistent worldbuilding, it should be dedicated to rational/intelligent characters who are /genuinely/ rational/intelligent. I feel like people into consistent worldbuilding sort of co-opted the "rational" designator to refer to the thing that /they/ were doing rather than referring to what it already was.^{[/citation needed/]} I blame Worm for that. You can /easily/ find posts...

... with tons of people discussing Worm, and many of those people saying "Worm is neither 'rational' nor 'rationalist' and was never intended as such," yet a ton of people still consider Worm one of the foundational works of "rational fiction" and allow that to color what they think "rational fiction" actually is.^{[/citation needed/]}

Look at something like Branches on the Tree of Time. It grants the premise of Terminator's worldbuilding and then has Sarah Connor react rationally to the world as it's been presented to her. HPMOR grants the premise of HP's worldbuilding (with a few tweaks to things that really just don't make sense to the point of breaking the setting (like Transfiguration) because a certain amount of worldbuilding /is/ necessary and Rowling didn't do enough because the early books are for children) and then has Harry react rationally to the world as it's presented to him.

Rational fiction was supposed to be about characters and their thought processes, which is incredibly difficult to do correctly. That's probably why there's been values-drift towards worldbuilding^{[/citation needed/]} because that's just /easier to do./

  People may have been throwing around the term "hard fantasy" for some time, but that is distinct from it being a currently broadly accepted and currently popular genre.

People are still writing it, though. Brandon Sanderson is often presented as an example. Rational fiction is /certainly/ not "currently broadly accepted and popular." Statistically, pretty much no one has ever heard of it. Are people still going to be writing rational fiction in ten years?
