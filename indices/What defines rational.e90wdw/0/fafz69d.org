A good place to start:

  There's a scene in the movie The Hobbit II: The Desolation of Smaug which Tolkien did not put into the original book.

  The movie version goes like this: The thirteen dwarves and Bilbo Baggins have just spent one and a half movies fighting their way to the place where Thorin, leader of the dwarves, expects to find a secret entrance into the lost dwarven kingdom of Erebor. This entrance can only be opened on a particular day of the year (Durin's Day), and they have a decoded map saying, Stand by the grey stone when the thrush knocks, and the last light of Durin's day will shine upon the keyhole.

  And then the sun sets behind a mountain, and they still haven't found the keyhole. So Thorin... I find this painful to write... Thorin throws down the key in disgust and all the dwarves start to head back down the mountain, leaving only Bilbo behind to stare at the stone wall. And so Bilbo is the only one who sees when the light of the setting moon suddenly reveals the keyhole.

  That thing where movie!Thorin throws down the key in disgust and walks away?

  I wouldn't have done that.

  You wouldn't have done that.

  We'd wait at least an hour in case there was some beam of sunlight about to shoot through the side of the mountain, and then we'd come back tomorrow, just in case. And if that still failed we'd try again a year later. We wouldn't drop the key. We wouldn't wander off the instant something went wrong.
