There are some things in general that rational fiction should try to avoid:

- Don't negate cause and effect. Actions should have consequences.

- The main character does not live in a world tailor-made for them to succeed. The same rules that apply to everyone else should apply to them. If they are exceptional in some way, this should be explained, as well as the constraints of their power/ability.

- Villains do not do dumb things for the sake of being evil. Look at pretty much every James Bond villain. Don't just assume the hero is dead because "no one could have survived that" (this applies to heroes as well). Don't throw someone in a cell and forget about them, giving them a chance to escape.

- Don't mix up what is possible and what is probable. Just because something /can/ happen doesn't mean it /should/.

- Don't rely on /Deus Ex Machina/. Solutions should not fall from the sky just because the hero (or villain) needs them.

- Consistent rules with regard to "power levels" - a character should not be inconsistently stronger or weaker just because the scene requires them to fight someone.

- Characters, and in particular their sidekicks, should embark on the journey for their own, legitimate, reasons. Sidekicks in particular seem to always be around at the right place and time to be scooped up by the main character, and instantly join their group when they have no real reason to (and sometimes reasons /not/ to).

- Don't create world that is black and white - people have their own agendas, some might be bad people doing bad things and some might be good people doing good things, but there are also good people who do bad things and bad people who do good things.

- Avoid harems. This is pretty typical when the main character is the hero off to save the world. Women will instantly fall in love with him. If they don't immediately do so, something will happen to make it so.

- Character should communicate. Very often we see misunderstandings turn into something huge because someone was reluctant to divulge a piece of information.

- Characters shouldn't immediately rush to judgement, especially judging someone based off of their appearance or character. usually when this happens, the "twist" is that the guy who was mean and gruff and reluctant to help was really looking out for the main character, trying to teach them something, or didn't want them rushing off to get themselves killed, while the nice guy was manipulating them by feeding their ego or insecurity.

- Avoid "Evil Emperors with massive armies that appear from nowhere" - armies run on their stomach. Supply trains are a thing. An army is composed of more than just a general leading soldiers; logistics, engineering, cooks, doctors, transportation, even accountants make up and army. Soldiers need to be fed, armed, sheltered, paid. Even in an absolute monarchy, the ruler is still constrained by something as simple as crop yields.
