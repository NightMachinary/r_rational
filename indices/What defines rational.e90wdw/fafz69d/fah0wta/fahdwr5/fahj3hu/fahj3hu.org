Do we have access to movie-Thorin's internal monologue throughout the film? I don't see how supposing some measure of self-doubt as an explanation for his despair in the face of defeat is inconsistent with his prior actions. The latter two points refer of course to a different Thorin, which is why I called it a retelling. I haven't actually watched the films since their theatrical release so maybe I'm misremembering.

I guess I'd prefer that “rational” fiction focus more on internally consistent, realistic worldbuilding that explores the natural implications of some collection of premises, where things don't happen merely as the plot demands. Characters can be flawed and “irrational”, even capricious, so long as their actions are compatible with their experiences and motivation, which are otherwise within the range of variation for their class. I'd sooner call the genre that features “intelligent” characters implementing clever solutions that invoke IRL book learnin' “rational/ist/” fiction, personally.
