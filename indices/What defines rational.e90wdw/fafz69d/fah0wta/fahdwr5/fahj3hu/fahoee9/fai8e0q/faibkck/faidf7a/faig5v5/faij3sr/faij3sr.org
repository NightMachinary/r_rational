Like I said, I'm not a rationalist, and I've no interest in rationalist fiction. I looked at HPMOR ten years ago, decided it wasn't for me, and moved on. I can get how this might have originally been a scene for people who wanted what EY wants, and the scene might have drifted on from there to become something broader/different. I have no dog in that fight, since I've only been here for six months and this isn't properly my place. Some people here like Pyrebound, I tell them about Pyrebound, I sometimes chip in to interesting discussions, but really I'm on the margins, and I'm okay with that.

I just take issue with the idea that "hard fantasy" or some such is a significant thing. This place isn't big, but it's a reasonably lively forum for discussing deep-worldbuilding fiction. Is there somewhere else we're supposed to take those conversations? With the obvious exception of separate spaces for discussing specific popular works like Worm or PGTE--and no, Worm's world isn't super-coherent in the first place. The "rational" side of the al/ist divide seems to be providing a useful service not available elsewhere.
