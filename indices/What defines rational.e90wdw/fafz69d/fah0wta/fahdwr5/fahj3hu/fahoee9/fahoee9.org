  I haven't actually watched the films since their theatrical release so maybe I'm misremembering.

I watched the first one in theaters and never bothered with the other two, and at this point I probably wouldn't be willing to sit down for 9 hours and watch all three of them back to back to back for less than fifty dollars (a hundred if I'm required to give them my full undivided attention).

  I guess I'd prefer that “rational” fiction focus more on internally consistent, realistic worldbuilding that explores the natural implications of some collection of premises...

My problem is that [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_fantasy][that genre already existed before rational fiction]]. "Worldbuilding porn" was already its own thing.

  [T]hings don't happen merely as the plot demands. Characters can be flawed and “irrational”, even capricious, so long as their actions are compatible with their experiences and are otherwise within the range of variation for their class.

That's called "being well written." So what is it that differentiates "rational fiction" from "well-written worldbuilding porn" and distinguishes it as a genre? According to both the old and the new sidebar definitions and the expressed opinions of a lot of people on [[/r/rational][r/rational]], there's /nothing/ that distinguishes rational fiction except a collection of tropes related to rationalist fiction.
