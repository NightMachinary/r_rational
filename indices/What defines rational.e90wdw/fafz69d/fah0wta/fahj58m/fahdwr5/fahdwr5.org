  Like, I can easily envision Thorin and co. having worked so desperately hard for this success, all the while filled with clawing doubt, that when they're met with failure at what should have been a moment of triumph their niggling misgivings surface to say “fuck it all! we were never to succeed here anyway”.

  I can also imagine a “rationalist” retelling where Thorin realizes partway through that they've no hope against a dragon and keeps trying to find face-saving (and life-saving) outs, having long discarded greed and pride but just wanting to reconnect with his old dwarf-college buds lol

  Alternatively, maybe Thorin reasons that the solution-space of some arbitrary dwarven puzzle is so mind-bogglingly vast that fiddling around in the neighborhood of his incorrect solution has little expected payoff.

Sure, Thorin's reaction could easily be /rationalized/ by positing him having reached that moment by way of a counterfactual trajectory that led to the formation of for all intents and purposes a different Thorin. It's still not a perfect fit because it's a post hoc rationalization, but sure. I don't really see what that has to do with the actual reaction of the actual Thorin presented in the movie.

  even if the featured characters weren't acting “rationally”

I still hold that this is the quintessential property that defines "rational fiction." I'm still not a big fan of the current sidebar definition, it's just as vague and generalized as the definition it replaced and is too inclusive of anything that just so happens to have strict worldbuilding. Rational fiction isn't supposed to be about worldbuilding, it's supposed to be about [[https://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/level3intelligent][intelligent characters reacting intelligently]].
