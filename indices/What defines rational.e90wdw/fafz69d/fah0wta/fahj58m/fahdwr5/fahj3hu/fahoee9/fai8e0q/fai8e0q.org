Well, [[/r/hardfantasy][r/hardfantasy]] says it has 17 people; where else would you suggest discussion of such things go, if not here? The Wiki entry you link to is barely more than a stub, and I hadn't heard of it elsewhere, so I'm not convinced that hard fantasy in that sense is really an established and accepted genre. I'm no rationalist--I wrote a wonkish fantasy serial and was told people might like it here--but the rational versus rationalist distinction seems useful enough to me. Someone once said that about half of this reddit are HPMOR fans, the other half not--is this true? If so, it seems like a good approximation for a broader rational/ist divide.
