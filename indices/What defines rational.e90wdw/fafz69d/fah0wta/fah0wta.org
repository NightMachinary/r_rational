That still seems like a “rationally” written storyline, in the sense of consequences flowing from actions instead of from ad hoc storytelling fiat, even if the featured characters weren't acting “rationally”. Like, I can easily envision Thorin and co. having worked so desperately hard for this success, all the while filled with clawing doubt, that when they're met with failure at what should have been a moment of triumph their niggling misgivings surface to say “fuck it all! we were never to succeed here anyway”.

I can also imagine a “rationalist” retelling where Thorin realizes partway through that they've no hope against a dragon and keeps trying to find face-saving (and life-saving) outs, having long discarded greed and pride but just wanting to reconnect with his old dwarf-college buds lol

Alternatively, maybe Thorin reasons that the solution-space of some arbitrary dwarven puzzle is so mind-bogglingly vast that fiddling around in the neighborhood of his incorrect solution has little expected payoff. If your 32-digit keycode doesn't work, there are so many "reasonably close" codes to explore that even if you're in the right ballpark and dedicate your life to trying different codes, you'll never find the correct one (ofc this gets proven wrong when a nearby solution is indeed found, but maybe Eru had a hand in that, or something).
