I hadn't heard the "car mechanic-ist fiction" analogy before. I like it :)

It makes me think that there's a wider genre of which both rationalist and mechanic-ist are a part: fiction that teaches you something. It might be how to fix a car or mix a drink or think better, but there's some real skill that's being imparted. When you come to a place in your life that resonates with that fiction, you know how to do the right thing.

More than anything else, that's what I look for.
