My shorthand is "not Harry Potter." HPMOR aside, the original canon shows breathtaking lack of concern for internal consistency or intelligent plotting. The plots of books four and five are both ridiculous Rube Goldberg schemes to manipulate Harry into doing something extraordinarily simple that Voldemort could have accomplished with much less effort ("have Harry touch a portkey without entering a yearlong tournament" and "go get the damn ball yourself," respectively). The books are regularly mocked, even by devoted fans, for bizarre oversights and niggling inconsistencies (as one webtoon put it, "how come they need a permission slip to visit the candy shop, but not to play murderball?"). They're still enjoyable for a lot of people, but making the world and its events plausible is plainly not a priority for the author. In rational fic, it is. Bonus points if the protag wins by thinking things through, and all the other self-explanatory stuff on the sidebar.

In practice, there tends to be a LOT of fan fic, litRPGs, and so on, because that's the general trend in webfic right now. It's not necessary for it to adhere to any particular genre, though given the emphasis on worldbuilding I think it all winds up as some kind of speculative fiction. In theory it'd be fine to have realistic fiction where the MC is highly observant and clever, I think.
