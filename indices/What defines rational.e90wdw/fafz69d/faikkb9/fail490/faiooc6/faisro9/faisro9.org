  Certainly under stressful situations... otherwise sensible people can act in ways that seem senseless.

Sure. But emphasis on the word "seem." Human reactions aren't simple. It's never just a single stimulus triggering a reaction, it's everything else that's ever happened in the history of your life and the situation context. There's always reasons for a reaction.

That's what a reaction is supposed to be - you hit the cueball and it strikes the eight ball at a certain angle and the eight ball reacts by going off at a different certain angle.

The issue with Thorin's reaction is based on granting the premise that the eight ball has gone off in the opposite direction from where a real eight ball would have gone in that situation. Arguing over rationalizations for why Thorin's reaction could have been realistic based on different orientations of the cue ball or whatever is fundamentally missing the point. It's just one specific example, you're not supposed to get caught up in dissecting it. It's a common thing in stories, the plot requires that a character react a certain way in order keep the plot from going off the rails, so the character reacts that way regardless of whether a real person would react that way in real life.
