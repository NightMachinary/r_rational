But ... that's just what I'm trying to tell you: I can easily picture someone acting in the manner described, even if they were quite intelligent. Hell, I can see my dad acting like that, and he's brilliant. The man loses his temper twenty times a day, forty if there are small children around. You're talking about what a real human would do while ignoring the very real human elements of temperament and stress. Under real-life circumstances people do not always act in the optimally productive manner they would choose if they were considering the matter dispassionately from a distance.

To me the gimmicky part of the sequence, as described, is not Thorin's reaction but the "last light" referring to the moon. Bit of a silly gotcha. Also doesn't make any damn sense, because if you're including the moon as a light, what about the stars? But I digress.
