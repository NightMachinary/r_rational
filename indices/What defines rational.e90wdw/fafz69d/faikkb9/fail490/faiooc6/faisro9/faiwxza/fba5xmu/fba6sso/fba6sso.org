There are a lot of tonal and other inconsistencies between Hobbit and LOTR, because the former was written much earlier, before the world had really gelled in Tolkien's head. Like the scene in Rivendell where the elves are singing "tra-la-lally" and acting silly--Tolkien looked back wincing on that one. Likewise we're never given any hint in Hobbit that the One Ring is anything worse than slightly mischievous, and the original published text had Gollum agreeing to give it to Bilbo as a prize for winning the riddle contest (and apparently intending to honor the pledge).

Gandalf is much more effective versus wargs in Fellowship, basically setting off a magic foe-only firebomb on a whole pack of them. He fights off half the Nazgul on Weathertop with pyrotechnics Frodo et al can see from miles away. He's reluctant to use magic, but when he does use it he's quite powerful.
