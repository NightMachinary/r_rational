Actually, I can totally see any number of human beings reacting that way, for various reasons, not all of which apply to Thorin. Certainly under stressful situations--and I think the Erebor example qualifies--otherwise sensible people can act in ways that seem senseless. Bilbo might well act calmer and more sensibly because he has much less personally at stake where getting in the mountain is concerned. But I'm going by a description here, since I got bored and stopped watching two-thirds of the way through the first Hobbit movie.

ETA: Phylogenik already addressed this above, more or less. Human, and presumably dwarf, behavior, can't be boiled down to what makes sense in pursuit of explicitly stated goals. Sometimes you're standing by the side of dragon-infested mountain wearing chain-mail underwear, and it's been six months, and you got locked up by an elf and had to escape in a damn barrel of apples and nearly drowned plus there were goblins and spiders, and at the climactic moment you were counting on to see you through everything seems to go wrong and you say AAHHH fuck it, and go down the mountain to smoke pipeweed. Not necessarily to start home immediately--EY's description doesn't say as much--but just to cool off and get away from the thing that's frustrating you.
