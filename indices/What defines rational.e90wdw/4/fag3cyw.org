I think of it as all the characters being people and not just "hohoho, I'm the big bad that kills people for no reason because I'm evil. In rationalF, characters are people and many of them have a "grey morality" theme where both sides are doing evil things.

There's several stories where the core element of the plot and the story is about tropes, Practical Guide to Evil and THe God are bastards.

Most rationalficiton stories seek to deconstruct story tropes and subvert reader expectations.

Characters aren't idiots for no reason, there's none of that eye-rolling forced plot movement when a character is forced to do something stupid by the author.
