Historically, the term was coined by Eliezer Yudkowsky to describe fiction (or, I suppose, also narrative nonfiction) that gave the reader a peek at the process of /skillful thinking/.

By analogy, "car mechanic-ist fiction" would be a story that would actually teach the reader, by fictional example, a useful lesson about fixing cars.

This subreddit popped into existence mostly nucleated around that original definition, but then the natural thing happened - we just started posting and upvoting whatever we liked. People have retro-codified this as stories driven by lawful rules that the reader can think about in advance, or characters not holding the idiot ball, or characters being smart even if the story doesn't try to teach you to do what they did, or stories about interesting science or philosophy.

So the people whose first exposure to the term "rational fiction" was this subreddit (or something like it), naturally associate the term with what we've promoted via this platform, which might be loosely described as "things you'll like (or more specifically, upvote) if you also like fiction depicting skillful thinking."
