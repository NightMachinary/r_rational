About 60k words or probably a little under 200 standard pages. Read the first couple of chapters to get a feel for the mood (warning: the first contains rather graphic descriptions of death, torture, and rape - the next chapter is much more typical scifi cool stuff).

I'm at Chapter 5 and it seems to be a much more rational treatment of AI than you usually get.
