The world and the AI and its creator are fun... But I think you have to be pretty forgiving to enjoy this.

The lead is /not/ rational, and not likeable. She is at least interesting for the first 5 chapters, but she becomes less compelling later. The climax is extremely unsatisfying (and nonsensical), and the ending is just... bizarre, on a number of levels. And quite a few times, there's explicit torture porn for paragraphs at a time. Some of it helps the story, but it kind of goes overboard, I think.

There are some good ideas in this story. It examines some uncommon second law conflicts and a unique subculture of a superintelligence-ruled Matrix. It's actually pretty good when we're not looking at Caroline. But the story seems to go to some effort to bury its good ideas. It's short enough it might be worth a read regardless, but keep your expectations low.
