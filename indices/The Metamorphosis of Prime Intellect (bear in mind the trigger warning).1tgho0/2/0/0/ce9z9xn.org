  so many people opining about Hollywood's tendency to make AI the baddie
#+end_quote

I think that's a proper complaint because usually Hollywood's reasoning behind making AI the baddie is something along the lines "the AI is angry and wants to have revenge" i.e. anthropomorphizing the AI and making it have human emotions which it wasn't necessarily programmed to have. That's an entirely different reasoning than what FAI advocates have.
