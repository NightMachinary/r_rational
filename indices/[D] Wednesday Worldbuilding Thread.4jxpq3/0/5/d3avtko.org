Universes are infinite, but infinity here is countable. Like natural numbers, there's a distinct progression from universe to universe, rather than having an infinite variety of universes between each universe. So even the closest universe to ours still might have diverged 20 years in the past, or has an earth with 99.999999999% the same elemental content as ours, or has the large hadron collider in the same place.
