I always figured probability would take the form of a log-odds dimensional axis. Call the two ends Yes and No, for instance. Then planeswalking means moving along that dimension while also moving through time in the normal way (which is maybe the hard part?). It /ought/ to take a large Probability distance to find a universe very unlike yours, but it'll depend upon where the causal "hinges" are.

I think /Mostly Harmless/ and /The Long Earth/ worked this way.
