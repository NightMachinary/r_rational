I had an idea a while ago, which I've consistently failed to work an actual worthy story around, where there are these portals that, upon activation, split the universe in two (like a quantum event), and the portal in universe A connects with the portal in universe B.

There'd also be a variation that's activated twice (well, half the time): the first activation splits the universe and does nothing in universe A, and the second activation in universe A causes the portal in universe A to link with the portal in universe B at the moment of the first activation.
