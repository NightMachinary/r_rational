I was thinking of writing some extremely detailed book, such that since the parallel universe would also have had to had that exact same book, the book would contain descriptions of every detail of reality you wanted to keep the same.

However if you want to connect to a universe exactly the same as your own a better solution came to mind: Nothing about your description of the box seems to say you can't put a person in a spacesuit in the box. If you put controls to the machine in the box as well, then you can put yourself in the box.\\
This would guarantee that the parallel universe was exactly the same in every way you knew of.
