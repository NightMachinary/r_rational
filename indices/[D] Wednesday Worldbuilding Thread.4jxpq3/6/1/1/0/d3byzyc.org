There is about 1900 tons of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris][debris]] being tracked in orbit, most of it in chunks over 100 kg. That's about 4 to 5 times the mass of the ISS (which is big enough to cover about one american football field). Add to that the roughly [[http://www.universetoday.com/94392/getting-a-handle-on-how-much-cosmic-dust-hits-earth/][100 tons per day]] of meteors/dust that that crash into the earth's atmosphere.

Of course, we'd reach a point where we are producing more than 100 tons per day fairly quickly if we have exponential replication of factories, so then we'd start mining the asteroids. We would probably start with near-earth asteroids rather than belt asteroids, reducing the delta-vee required by careful selection of asteroids that happen to be near a transfer orbit.

In any case, the factory part that does the complex refining and manufacturing doesn't need to be near the asteroid; you can ferry small chunks (or even entire asteroids) to the near-earth location for further processing. Remote controlling rockets is something we're actually pretty good at already, so it's unlikely to need telepresence. So by the time we start /needing/ a human (or humanlike AI) presence off-planet, the throughput would be something incredibly massive.
