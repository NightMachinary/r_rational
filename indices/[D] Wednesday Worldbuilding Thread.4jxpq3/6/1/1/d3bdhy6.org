  And if deployed in space, they would have essentially no launch cost beyond whatever the initial starter unit costs

Nanofactories will still need matter to work with, and /someone/ has to pay the cost of launching that mass. You can work with space junk for a little while - you can work with other people's satellites for a bit longer, if you don't mind them getting /really/ cross with you - but that'll only last so long. And any matter that you send /down/ (in the form of finished products) is that much less that is up there.

You /could/ pull off something fancy involving asteroid mining for extra mass, but then you're going to have to place your factory a good distance away from Earth (because that's where the asteroids are) meaning there would be a substantial delay before your product got anywhere close to the Earth; an Earth-based factory can respond to changes in market trends more quickly.
