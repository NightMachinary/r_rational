I'm expecting self replicating robotics to have their day in the sun sometime soon. Factories that produce other factories should have a big economic impact here on earth when they arrive. And if deployed in space, they would have essentially no launch cost beyond whatever the initial starter unit costs, so coupled with the various advantages of space (no gravity, etc) the industrial network could actually grow faster there.

(Futurists often roll the possibility of self replicating factories in with nanotech, but it's distinct -- we have the bones of a plan to do this in the form of existing macroscale industrial equipment/systems. Just incrementally keep automating it, until it's automated from beginning to end, and you have a crude replicator.)

From a story perspective, I'm not sure how to make this feel distinct from a generic post-scarcity scenario. Basic income definitely seems important since jobs basically won't exist, but maybe you could go the other way and have a society where citizens are encouraged to own their own chunk of the means of production, kind of like home ownership is encouraged today.

Another thing is that maybe in 40 years the AI won't be good enough to run these factories entirely, so people will use telerobotics to sub in for it. That is a reasonable use for hyper-realistic VR. That would also tend to limit the factories to close earth orbits or the ground. It would also keep a large segment of the population employed, potentially making them much wealthier in the long run in the interplanetary economy, compared to those who sit around and collect their basic income checks.
