Instant futurology:

In forty years, we'll all be in our late 50s and early 60s. Social change on these timescales is driven more by people being born and dying off than individuals adapting to the changing times, so to a first approximation our attitude to those things will be the same it is now.

Imagine how someone born in 1958 sees the world today. That's how you'll see the world of 2056.

My guesses are

- Blow-up dolls with vibrators in already exist, what more do you want from a sexbot?
- Not much to be said on VR from a moral standpoint, unless you have strong ethical opinions about graphics cards.
- Basic income will have had some small-scale trials. People in pubs have back-and-forth arguments as to its merits.
- Privacy schmivacy. Your medical records and bank statements will be fine, everything else is fair game. People in pubs pinpoint the loss of privacy as the moment when this country* went to shit.
- I haven't seen much evidence that advertising technology is getting that much better. Adverts may be more advanced today than they were twenty years ago, but they're no more effective at getting people to actually buy stuff.
- Changing someone's mind is a subset of advertising. Same answer.
- Designer babies: a subject of contention and occasional protests outside clinics. Just as abortion debates were dying out, too.
