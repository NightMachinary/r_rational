  Blow-up dolls with vibrators in already exist, what more do you want from a sexbot?
#+end_quote

Can pass the turing test (or at least, can /mostly/ pass the turing test, to the point where people start feeling attached to them to the exclusion of relationships with flesh-and-blood humans.)

Think "Chobits."

  Not much to be said on VR from a moral standpoint, unless you have strong ethical opinions about graphics cards.
#+end_quote

It's not necessarily a new thing, but I see it as a pretty strong extension of the moralizing people already do about violent video games.

  Basic income will have had some small-scale trials. People in pubs have back-and-forth arguments as to its merits.
#+end_quote

Basic income will be more or less absolutely necessary within twenty to twenty five years or so to avoid societal unrest from people unemployed by greatly increased automation. In the next (conservative estimate) 10 years alone, a few million truck drivers will be put out of work because of self driving cars. Better 3d printing will smush manufacturing jobs, and even artistic jobs won't be safe as machine learning algorithms figure out how to spit out simple music, logos and designs.

  I haven't seen much evidence that advertising technology is getting that much better. Adverts may be more advanced today than they were twenty years ago, but they're no more effective at getting people to actually buy stuff.

  Changing someone's mind is a subset of advertising. Same answer.
#+end_quote

We're getting better and better at understanding humans. Combined with good predictive AI, it'll be easier to figure out how humans react to stimuli, like ads.

  Designer babies: a subject of contention and occasional protests outside clinics. Just as abortion debates were dying out, too.
#+end_quote

This one I guess I'm more iffy on; I don't think understanding of human genetics has advanced that far yet. But I am looking 40 years in the future.
