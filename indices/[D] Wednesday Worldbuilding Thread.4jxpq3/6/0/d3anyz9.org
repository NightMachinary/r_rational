I doubt anyone can give a concrete answer to this question that does not boil down to "People will figure out what I've been saying all along." You make some really good points about what will change morality, by the way.

As for what I expect:

- People will be even more relaxed about sexuality.

- People will have betters models and working theories about the ethics of communication and manipulation.

- There will be a gradual shift towards transhumanism.
