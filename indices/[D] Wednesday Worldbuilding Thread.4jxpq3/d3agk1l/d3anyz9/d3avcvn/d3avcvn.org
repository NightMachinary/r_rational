  People will be even more relaxed about sexuality.

See, I actually think sexuality is going to look really weird from our perspective. People are becoming sexually active later and later, especially in wealthy countries with low birthrates (think Japan, Germany), but that's coupled with much larger access to porn. What I think will happen is that individual fetishes won't be nearly as stigmatized, but attitudes about actual sex will become less relaxed.
