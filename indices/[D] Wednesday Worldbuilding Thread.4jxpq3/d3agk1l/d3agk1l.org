How well can we predict morality 40 years in the future? Some things I see drastically affecting the status quo in the near (relatively speaking) term:

- sexbots
- extremely realistic VR
- basic income
- erosion of privacy
- better advertising techniques
- better techniques to change someone's mind
- designer babies/superior cosmetic surgery

But it's difficult to predict how all of these things will interact.
