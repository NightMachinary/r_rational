In Nick Bostrom's superintelligence he puts forth a fairly convincing scenario for iterated embryo selection. Effectively you need deep learning to of at hundreds of thousands sequenced genomes, which is the most expensive part to make things possible.

Next you use a method called iterated embryo selection, the interesting thing about it is that given our current laws it's not explicitly prohibited like genetic modification is.
