As far as war goes, when there's no issue with distance, a well-placed teleporter could disrupt an entire nation because a singular teleporter could allow assassins and military forces to act extremely quickly - Germany wouldn't have been stopped on their march to moscow in WWII, the Japanese could teleport to the eastern coast, plant a bomb on some factories, and run away, among many other things.

Then there would be massive research into discovering if people can detect Teleportation devices like there are with TV signals, and many other things.

A society with teleportation as commonplace as scooters could potentially be disastrous.
