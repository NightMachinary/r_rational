A lot of times when writing fiction based off the real world, people introduce one new technology and sees where it goes. But usually that new technology is always rare and scarce.

What if we make it a commonplace?

I've been trying to think up a world where teleporters of any size can be made by any seven year old with a science kit, and seeing where that goes. Discovered early enough (say, by Graham Bell with mythology of "seeing stones" and whatnot from before), there would be little to no infrastructure linking anything together. Perpetual motion is also a commonplace, also part of the same kit.

I'm not so sure about the effects it will have the outcomes of wars though. Definitely lots, seeing that supply lines no longer need to be maintained, but I don't have enough knowledge about specific conflicts to know how they would be affected.
