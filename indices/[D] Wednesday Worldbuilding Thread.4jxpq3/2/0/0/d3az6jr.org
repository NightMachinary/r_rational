Sorry, I was thinking more Stargates rather than teleporting to arbitrary locations.

While most of the ideas still hold, borders can be marginally enforced as long as you can prevent one end of the gate from crossing your border. Which would be difficult if anyone can airdrop teleporter gates (that survive impact).

But deploying a teleporter into enemy territory also runs the risk of allowing the foe to come through, so all gates probably have self-destruct failsafes.
