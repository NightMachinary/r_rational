Teleporters through teleporters, yes.

They're more like wormholes than teleporters, linking space together (portals), so teleporters can be treated as 2D objects.

I'm not a big fan of negating the infinite motion part; how would you be able to vaporize a planet? Terminal velocity applies on-planet, off-planet would require the resources to get into orbit and precise calculations to align your portals.

Also, throwing one end into the sun would destroy the portal before killing everyone. Probably.
