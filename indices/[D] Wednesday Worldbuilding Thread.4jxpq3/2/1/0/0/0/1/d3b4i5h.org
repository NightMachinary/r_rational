  I'm not a big fan of negating the infinite motion part; how would you be able to vaporize a planet? Terminal velocity applies on-planet, off-planet would require the resources to get into orbit and precise calculations to align your portals.

Generate enough energy to get into space, then accelerate heavy objects straight down. "Vaporize the planet" is hyperbolic, but WMDs would be cheap and easy.
