Oh, sorry, the teleporter technology is more like gates/wormholes, so you build a pair at one point and have to move the other one to your destination. Any size of teleporter, but the only way to turn them off is to destroy them. Stargates.

Yes, which makes loads of fun.

Planetary colonization becomes trivial, once you get a teleporter to your location. Probably interstellar probes with teleporters on them have been sent out, with pressurized water propulsion from the bottom of the ocean.
