You only need a fairly small physical ability to make this work. Information transfer is the main ability, anything else is a bonus.

Telekinesis? Or whatever you call it when an intangible being moves an object it's phased through. An individual damiad can only exert a tiny amount of force, but a large enough group working together can rip a person apart from the inside. (Metaphor for DDoS, I suppose.)

Moving heat from one world to the other.

Generating electrical impulses or currents.

Performing certain classes of chemical reaction. Maybe they can ferment sugar!

Oh, and whatever effect you choose, they should be able to build machines or trees in the alternum that have a continuous effect on the material world. Which would require regular maintenance, and be vulnerable to sabotage from other damiads.
