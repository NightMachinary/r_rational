How exactly do seeds/trees and damiads transgress the boundary between prime and alterum? Maybe thinking about how exactly stuff, or at least information, can and does go from one side to the other when it normally can't will help hammer out what sfx the damiads can pull off.

Also, out of curiosity, why and how are trees and damiads 'crystalline' when they appear to be largely detached from prime in general and the properties of crystals in specific?
