The damiads are fully aware of the world and capable of seeing everything within it, however they're also quite apathetic to what goes on the in world unless it affects the alterum. Their language is the language of the trees; every new branch on a tree is a statement, every embellishment on their crystalline facets holds meaning. These meanings are in theory accessible to anyone with a third eye, but it would take a huge amount of work since not only is the "language" very foreign, but the mindset behind the language is /also/ very foreign.

There's very little evidence for the damiads being capable of learning human language or adopting human mindsets. They do sometimes seem to respond to speech, but it's unclear whether this is because of the medium or the message; it might be that the speaker just hit the right series of sounds to be interesting.
