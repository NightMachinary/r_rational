Damiad are the users, trees are the forums. It seems best to continue the metaphor from there if possible.

Not all members of the forum know how to do everything. Certainly on a fashionable hats forum most of the members know at least the basics about fashionable hats, but only a subset know anything about pure mathematics. Therefore I think each Damiad should have different limits in how they can interact with the world.

Then getting Damiads to do something then wouldn't be just about convincing them, but also about figuring out how to produce a community with the right technical skills. Maybe the Great electromancers of the world are those that manage to make trees that attract Damiads that specialize in manipulating real world electrons or something.

The weakest of mages would have trees with topics unrelated to the prime world, and their Damiads would only have 'layman's knowledge' of anything to do with manipulating it. Of course, ludicrous quantity could always make up for quality.
