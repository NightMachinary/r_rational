In this metaphor, the admin can see the following:

- Who's online.
- Who's posting new threads, who's commenting on threads.
- Timestamp of messages.
- Length of messages.
- */Not/* content of messages.

So the admin has to operate mostly on guesswork and a reading of trends. Tools that they're able to use are temp ban, permaban, restrictions on new members, locking a thread, deleting a thread, elevating someone to moderator, etc. All the stuff that an admin of a forum could do.
