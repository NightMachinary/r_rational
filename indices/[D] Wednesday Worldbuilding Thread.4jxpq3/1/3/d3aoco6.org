What exactly can the admin perceive of the forum? You can't moderate something you don't see.

Otherwise, I'd suggest having damiads be able to interact with the physical world at the cost of some scarce, but otherwise useless resource. So damiads are ready to do the admin's bidding since it's the only way they can profit from the resource (and trade it for premium privileges or whatever), but they're not going to spend all of it on something they don't care about unless they really like the admin.
