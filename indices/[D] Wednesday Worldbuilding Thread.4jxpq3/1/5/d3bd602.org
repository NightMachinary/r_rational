...the first thought to come to my mind is that two magic users can't get too close, or their crystalline trees will get tangled (they might be intangible to the Prime Reality, but surely not to each other) and this will (a) be extremely embarrassing for both of them, (b) probably damage one or both trees, and (c) likely result in each tree's damiads taking revenge on the owner of the other tree for the damage to their tree.

(From the point of view of a non-magic user, there will simply be two people glaring at each other, and every time one of them moves his head, the other one gets his head moved)

This may have a certain number of effects on society; you can't book two magic-users into neighbouring seats at a theatre, for example, or on a plane, and theatre- and plane-booking systems must take this into account (or they will have dissatisfied customers).

...given that the trees /are/ intangible and invisible on Prime Reality, this also means that it's possible that a magic-user backing into a wall might get his tree entangled with the tree of a magic-user on the opposite side of the same wall. (For maximum awkwardness and danger, one of the two magic-users may be inside an elevator currently in motion...)

This, of course, all assumes that the tree is firmly anchored to the skull. If it's only attached to squishy brain tissue, then this sort of tangling is likely to be immediately fatal to both...
