Is it possible to build arbitrarily small gates? A pair of finger-sized gates could make a reasonable bug - sound still transmits through it (just make sure the guy on the listening end is /really/ quiet).

Is it possible to "roll up" a gate, such that it can pass through a /smaller/ gate?

Alternatively, can a gate be mostly-assembled here, then have the bits passed through a smaller gate and finally put together on the opposite side?

If either of the above are possible, then a single spy in an enemy country can sneak a really tiny gate past the borders (perhaps disguised as a monocle, by placing glass in it?) and then, after some time, quietly let in an entire army.

Telephones could work off gates as well; you have one gate in your home phone and the matching gate at the Exchange - the operator merely attaches your Exchange gate to the Exchange gate of the person you wish to talk to (and releasing poison gas at the Exchange can probably depopulate most of a city).
