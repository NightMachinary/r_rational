Alright, let's say for the sake of argument that Alexander Graham Bell discovers teleporter technology in January of 1914, six months before WWI, and doesn't have the good sense to keep his mouth shut about it.

Navies disappear basically overnight, since there's no need to ship anything across the ocean, and thus no need to protect shipping lanes. It's possible that the nations of the world are able to stay together, but I think it would be a near thing, since no borders can effectively be enforced. The global economy goes flat in an instant, since now shipping costs virtually nothing and anyone can compete with jobs against anyone else. This is probably a disaster for nearly everyone. Real estate in the country is now a lot more valuable, and conversely, real estate in the cities crashes through the floor.

World War I, if it happens, is going to be a game of spies and sabotage rather than armies and navies. Borders are indefensible. People can be defended only to the extent that their location can be kept secret.
