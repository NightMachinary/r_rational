  The eyes would be dormant until the owner felt true fear of death for the first time - a short time later they would activate. The Mangekyou is triggered by guilt

Experimentations with body modifications combined with gradual evolutions leading to Sharingan make sense, storywise. But how does emotional triggering work? And at that, why fear of death and guilt, and not, say, ego death, first deeply-comprehended true joy, or something else?

  The eyes are passed on by eye-to-eye contact from someone who has them to someone who has the right genetics and chakra for them. A chakra 'seed' that can grow into an eye is deposited, and develops over time into a full-fledged eye.

The canon mechanics of eye transplantology served as a good plot device for sacrifices (Shisui), unique gift thefts (Danzo), limited resources (eye hunt in general), etc. What purposes does this alternate mechanics serve? An eye-to-eye contact, if I picture it right, would involve some awkward Clockwork Orange style arrangements that would feel like out of some [[http://knowyourmeme.com/photos/412712-hentai-quotes][weird manga]] --- why not then (if the scarcity is removed anyway) reduce it even further to something like tear exchange in a specialised manner?
