  Experimentations with body modifications combined with gradual evolutions leading to Sharingan make sense, storywise. But how does emotional triggering work? And at that, why fear of death and guilt, and not, say, ego death, first deeply-comprehended true joy, or something else?

Mostly to make it fit early canon. The few people we see unlock the Sharingan are in situations where they expect to die or see a friend killed, and the Mangekyou appears after you kill a close friend or family member, although Kakashi also gets it after he feels guilt for Obito's death. Also, if the original creator didn't necessarily want everyone to have a copy of his wonderful eyes, but also didn't want family to die because they would have needed it, could have made it dormant by default. While it doesn't make a great deal of sense, it can be justified (barely) and so I'm probably going to go with it in order to match it to canon.

  The canon mechanics of eye transplantology served as a good plot device for sacrifices (Shisui), unique gift thefts (Danzo), limited resources (eye hunt in general), etc. What purposes does this alternate mechanics serve? An eye-to-eye contact, if I picture it right, would involve some awkward Clockwork Orange style arrangements that would feel like out of some weird manga --- why not then (if the scarcity is removed anyway) reduce it even further to something like tear exchange in a specialised manner?

This isn't a way for people to gain a Sharingan. It's an explanantion of how people who have one (i.e. Uchiha) get the required complexity, since it's not purely genetic (or else you could just clone Uchiha until you have a Sharingan factory). So in essence, people who would naturally have a Sharingan also have one in this AU, but they need to have seen a Sharingan before in order to unlock theirs. Due to the mind-body dualism I'm using to explain chakra, I needed a way to pass the mind aspect of the eye on to descendants. I'm also going to use it to explain why some eyes have the same Mangekyou abilities.

To give an example - Hinata gets the Byakugan because she has the genetic markers (inherited) and the required chakra structure (passed on from other Hyuga, unintentionally). Naruto would not have the Byakugan, no matter how many times he gets a close-up view of a Byakugan eye, because he lacks the genetic markers. Kakashi's Sharingan is a transplant of one of Obito's eyes, which already contains the genetic marker as well as the chakra structure from another eye.

I hope that makes sense. I don't think I'll discuss this part in-story, but I'll be using it to explain why, for instance, kidnapping children with Byakugan/Sharingan tends to not work for the kidnappers and isn't done any more. I'm not sure if even the characters in-universe will know this is how the eyes work.
