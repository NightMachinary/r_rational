Here's another magic system for you all.

Parallel to ordinary matter and energy, there are three substances which permeate most of the universe. These are Light, Radiation, and Dark.

Light and Radiation oppose one another. Light is introduced into the universe when there is 'creation,' which is most exemplified by the process of nuclear fusion, while Radiation is introduced by 'destruction,' most exemplified by nuclear fission. They are only removed from the universe when they encounter one another. Dark, meanwhile, grows wherever there isn't Light or Radiation (iron and iron minerals tend to be rich in Dark).

Due to an interesting sequence of events, human nervous systems are abnormally suited towards hosting both Light and Radiation, which in turn is insulated from the rest of the body by an abnormally high concentration of Dark in the rest of the body. Ordinarily, Light and Radiation are present in roughly equal amounts, which has some minor health benefits in terms of resisting poison and infection, but interestingly, it also mean that, by passing through the right mental state, a person can cultivate the Light or Radiation in their system, destroying one another and being replenished by eating, drinking, and breathing. When it reaches a certain density, it begins to push against the Dark in the rest of the body, and eventually causes the Dark to 'crack open' and fall away.

If this process is performed by cultivating Light, this leaves the person with a bright aura of one of five colors (Red, Yellow, Green, Cyan, Blue), and two corresponding supernatural abilities (Heat Generation and Passion Inducement, Light (the ordinary kind) Generation and Panacea Touch, Electric Current Generation and Anti-Decay Touch, Time-Slowing and Calm Inducement, Restoration Intuition and Wound Undoing), while if it is performed with Radiation then the person gains a blinding white aura and the ability to wither or disintegrate things. Regardless of which version someone undergoes, their cast off Dark becomes a second being, who is black such as to be a three dimensional silhouette of their originator, whose default disposition towards their originator is distinctly negative, and whose action carry a sort of inertia, which makes undoing them via means that are not also Dark more difficult. For example, a ball thrown by a castoff Dark being would be more difficult to stop, unless you stopped it with something rich in Dark, like a metal bat.
