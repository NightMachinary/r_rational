In settings where people can visit an infinite number of alternate universes, there's a problem that arises with the question of how people can find universes that are remotely similar to our own, and also not wind up in the vast empty space between galaxies.

A simple but interesting solution occurred to me the other day. You have a device that can open a portal to a similar device in another universe, but the device is connected to a box, and will only open a portal to a universe where the contents of the box are exactly identical.

So, if you put something complex in the box, you'll wind up in a universe almost indistinguishable from your own, but get some extremely pure metal, etch an English dictionary on it in tiny letters, evacuate all the air from the box and make absolutely sure there are no contaminants, and you'll be able to link to an incredibly alien universe where the inhabitants just happen to speak English.
