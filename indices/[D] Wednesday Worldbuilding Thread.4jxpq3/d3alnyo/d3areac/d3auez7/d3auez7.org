Sure, I've heard that explanation used before, but how do you objectively define similarity? If it's just distance into the past when the universe diverged, then I think you'd be severely limiting the setting. There might be a somewhere in the multiverse where, for example, humans co-exist with a vast sentient jungle that gives them powers over animals, but the divergence point would have to be so far back in time that the chances of recognizable humans evolving- and therefore the chances of finding that universe through random exploration- would be impossibly slim.

In other words, if the divergence point greatly pre-dated humanity, then anything really recognizable would feel like a contrivance, while if the divergence point was more recent, you'd be stuck with alternate history settings.

If instead you try to define similarity between universes by number of shared concepts, then you run into the problem of what really counts as concepts. For example, lets say that that universe with the sentient jungle shared 70% of it's concepts with our own universe- so that there was a 30% chance that any new concept you encountered either doesn't exist in our universe, or exists in a different form- a hypothetical instead of a reality, or vice versa. So, is there a 70% chance of encountering a McDonald's? What are the chances of the world existing at all? Not 70%, because you have to include the chances of the solar system existing, the galaxy existing, the arbitrary group of every third star existing, and so on, perhaps infinitely.

Basically, the implications of that definition confuse the hell out of me, which again, to me, makes the setting feel contrived.

The thing I like about the box idea is that you can bring elements like humans or English into a very strange setting without raising any question of probability at all, since their appearance is explained by the mechanism.
