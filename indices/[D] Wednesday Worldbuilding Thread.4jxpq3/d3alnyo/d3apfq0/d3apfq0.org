The thought occurs that this could also justify many cheap alternate-universe tropes.

Like the existence of an alternate [[/u/artifex0]] and an alternate [[/u/Chronophilia]] in a universe where e.g. dragons exist. By normal, everyday causality, it would be fantastically unlikely for the same set of parents to meet and fall in love, let alone have a genetically similar child, let alone have this happen once every generation!

But if the box contained a photograph that you appeared in, then naturally both universes would contain someone who looked like you, dressed like you, and shared at least one interest with you (whatever you happened to be doing at the time). While still containing seemingly-absurd differences e.g. whether the dragon in the background is real or an odd sculpture.

I'd envisioned the "box" as a natural phenomenon outside human control, to prevent people from trying to exploit it by putting in an object they specifically want.
