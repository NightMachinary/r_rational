I need help fleshing out a magic system.

1. There's an alternate plane of existence that overlaps prime reality, called the alterum. Things in the alterum are normally invisible and intangible.
2. It's possible to plant a crystalline tree into your head, which will exist only in the alterum.
3. These trees are home to some number of damiad, small crystalline entities like cut gems which live in the trees.
4. A functional tree gives you access to a third eye and second sight (so you can see into the alterum), a second mind (which allows a few preternatural abilities), and the ability to give commands to the damiad.
5. Damiad have different roles within the tree. Some just sit around, others create and prune branches, and some come in to embellish the branches. Better trees attract more damiads, so there are some feedback loops, and different kinds of trees attract different sorts of damiads.
6. Someone with a tree can issue commands to their damiads to effect change on the prime reality, but there's a strong chance that the damiads will simply not listen. The chance that they'll listen to any given command goes down when less novel commands are given, or when more commands are given.

The idea basically came from "how do you make internet communities into a magic system". Trees are forums or subreddits, damiads are users. The person whose tree it is must then be something like an admin, though one who only has a loose understanding of what the damiads are actually "talking" about. The admin role also has some features, like the ability to ban users or make a blanket prohibition against new users, but no actual ability to communicate policy. The "topic" of a tree is sometimes the person wearing it, but can also be something like woodworking, fashionable hats, or pure mathematics. This is not known to the person who has the tree, at least by default.

But the magic system itself seems a little bit too loose right now, especially with the big question mark over what effects it can produce. I've got a 95% complete story right now, but without some grounding, simply saying that the damiads can do anything that they can be convinced to do makes it seem a little too vague.
