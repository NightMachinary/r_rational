I think I'll probably end up going with that in combination with what [[/u/gabbalis]] said. But more abstract and alien.

To take the metaphor further, let's say that you're an admin of a forum whose language you don't speak. You don't have access to a dictionary, they don't use pictures, and all you really have to go on is the following information:

- Who's currently online.
- Who's a mod.
- Timestamps of comments.
- Length of messages.

You have some vague sense that the users are reacting to you, or the world around you, but it's /really/ difficult to figure out what they're all on about, let alone to steer their conversation or control the growth and direction of the community. You bought an apple and saw a new thread being created with a dozen hurried replies to it; are they talking about apples, fruits in general, commerce, the person you bought the apple from, botany, foods, bodily functions ... or is this just the equivalent of an off-topic thread that has virtually nothing to do with your purchase?

So the damiads /do/ have varied skillsets, and different trees attract different skillsets, and damiads prefer to do things that deal with the topic of their tree, but the correlations aren't obvious even to a scholar of damiads (in the same way that it would take you a long time to untangle why this subreddit has a much higher than average number of software engineers as compared to the general population).
