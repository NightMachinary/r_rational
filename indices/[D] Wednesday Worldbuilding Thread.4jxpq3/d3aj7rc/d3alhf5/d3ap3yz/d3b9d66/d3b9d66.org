Out of curiosity, how aware of the world are damiads, and on average how willing are they to establish greater communication with their 'admin?' Are they able to understand any language? Or at least able to understand some sort of symbolic system?

If they are sufficiently able in these respects, it seems likely that, /eventually/, a precocious mage will eventually figure out a way enter into explicit communication with their damiads. I don't know how, if at all, that will actually enhanced their ability to do magic, but it certainly seems like it'll do something. It might incredibly unlikely, but unless it's impossible, then a sufficient time abyss will leave it happening eventually.
