Given that the tree is literally growing out of someone's head, perhaps you could have it so that it is "watered" by that person's thoughts, and therefore specify what type and ability of damiads attracted to that tree can do?

For example, a person who love maths (not just a mathematician) would attract damiads that can and will do exceedingly complex calculations, while a person with severe wanderlust could have damiads that grant them extrasensory capabilities.

Then, you could say that a damiad can inherently produce any effect, but it gets harder to "convince" one to do an effect the more removed it is from the topic of the tree. Like, a Math damiad would do an engineering task with only some minor grumbling, but it would take a lot to convince it to do anything purely physical.
