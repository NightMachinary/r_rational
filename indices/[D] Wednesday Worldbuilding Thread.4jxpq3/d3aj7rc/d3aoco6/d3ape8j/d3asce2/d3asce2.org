That does not seem like enough information to effectively do anything close to admin-ing or moderating. Like, you can ban people, but how do you decide who to ban if you don't know what the damiads do or say? Can the admin feel the emotions in communications, or something like that? Otherwise, good luck distinguishing a structured, constructive comment from an almagation of insults and racial slurs, etc just by its length and the lengths of the following posts. There could be an upvote system, but if the admin only elects moderators and locks threads following majority vote, then he's not doing any actual admin work.
