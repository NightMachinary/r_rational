Perhaps limit interactions with the physical world to information transfer, research, communication, etc? So a damiad couldn't give you the ability to throw a fireball, but they could tell you exactly how to build a flamethrower, or grant you skills associated with firedancing so you could mess with flammable substances relatively safely, or note that you didn't notice that the man you walked past five minutes ago was drunk and holding a bottle of alcohol which might work for your purposes. You might also have migrant damiads flitting from tree to tree, distributing information, or have a class of generalist damiads that establish themselves in communities of similar trees and disseminate discoveries or methods.

There must of course be wretched trees host to flocks of troll damiads, purely offensive squalors that can tear a tree to shreds, but if not distracted turn inwards and tear apart the users' mind.
