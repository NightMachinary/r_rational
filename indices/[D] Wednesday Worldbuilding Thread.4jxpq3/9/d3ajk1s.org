Anyone have any thoughts with regards to rational!Fire Emblem: Fates? The plot as it stands is kind of a clusterfuck of irrationality, so rationalizing it makes for an interesting challenge.

I'm completely removing any plot elements related to the Astral plane/deeprealms/Mycastle, because any rational protagonist with access to that kind of advantage would steamroll the plot. The Awakening trio will probably have more of a role in the plot and get a major competence upgrade.

And is a Yato powered by rational thought /too/ on the nose?
