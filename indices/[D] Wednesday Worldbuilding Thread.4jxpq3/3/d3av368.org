I'm planning an AU Naruto fanfiction, based more on the beginning of the manga and ignoring most of the last third or so. I'd like to get some feedback on how I want to make Chakra work. Warning, it's quite long and maybe a bit more technical than interesting.

So, a few things that I decided /must/ be an outcome of the system, for setting reasons:

1. Only ninja have large chakra reserves, but it's not because of heritage (so clan ninja don't automatically have much more chakra available)

2. Most people can't spam high-level abilities. Kakashi, as per canon, can only use 4 Chidori in one fight, and he's one of the stronger ninja.

3. Chakra is composed of two parts, physical and spiritual/mental. Each part must be developed separately, although both grow over time.

4. Bloodlines are hereditary, but not purely based on DNA (so you can't splice some DNA and then gain someone's powers). Sharingan, Byakugan and Rin'negan are all explained.

5. Nature Chakra should be a massive power boost.

6. Conservation of Energy isn't important, neither is Conservation of Momentum, but no matter can be produced in large quantities (the energy costs are too high) - so no The Waves Arisen-style [[#s][spoiler]]

7. Sealing makes some sort of sense.

8. Almost all abilities from early Naruto (i.e. pre-timeskip) as well as some from post-timeskip can be explained by the model.

9. Tailed Beasts make sense, although they can take any of a number of forms from super smart to super dumb.

Everything else I was ready, in principle, to sacrifice in order to make these parts work.

The system I settled on works via the idea of souls in the sense of mind-body dualism. Basically, in an extra-dimensional way, there's a substrate that has human minds in it (they don't overlap). Where the spiritual energy that makes up the mind meets physical energy in the body, produced by the cells, chakra is created, allowing the soul to control the body. Control happens through the head, but very skilled people (e.g. Tailed Beasts, Tsunade) can keep operating even without a head and then heal/regrow it.

Ninja have their chakra 'unlocked' when they join the Academy. (I'm doing more, unrelated, worldbuilding with regards to learning.) What this means is that essentially, a technique breaks open parts of their chakra network, causing a drain that gradually increases over the course of several years and leading to an excess of chakra being created. When the drain stops, the ninja has starting-level reserves. I'm aging all characters up to 16 when they become genin, and they start school at age 4-5 (same as in the UK), so they might have a starting growth happen from age 5 to age 10 or so. After there's a decent amount, it can be increased simply through expending it. However, the 'trick' used only works for people of a certain age - start too early, or too late, and you can cause horrific damage & death. It was reverse-engineered from how the Sage of Six Paths gave humans chakra originally (makes more sense once I explain Rin'negan).

Chakra has a physical component and a spiritual component. They come from separate sources, and combining them produces energy, although it's not immediately discharged. Think of two rivers meeting and merging, and the story's world as being a cross-section of the meeting point for a rough idea of where I'm going. By causing some eddies and currents, the objects in the river can be moved.

Nature Chakra is effectively 'downriver' - where the chakra flows to after it's been used. It's a huge resource, and access to it is a huge power boost. Mokuton is so strong because the wood is fuelled mostly by nature chakra, and therefore very cheap for the caster to produce and manipulate (compared to water or earth techniques). It also causes a range of problems; once you tap into it, if you stop using it, you will die. It hardens the body and you need more nature chakra to be able to move at all, including breathing and heartbeat. On the plus side, it makes you resistant to damage. It can be stored in the body in small amounts. Nature chakra users have bursts of action followed by short rests. They aren't common.

A person has a body and soul. Both come from the parents - the body is formed as in our world, but the soul is created by a combination of the mother and father's souls (note: soul isn't meant in a religious sense - it's basically a mind implemented in a non-standard medium). Special techniques, affinities and bloodlines can therefore be inherited.

Tailed Beasts are rips through which huge amounts of physical and spiritual energy rush. Attempts to contain them and use them have generally failed in the past. Sealing them into other creatures led to insanity and massive damage. What basically happens is that a mind/soul has a live mains wire attached. However, over time, more and more soul pieces were left attached after the energy source broke free, and a weak personality appeared over time. Some souls were left attached more or less intact.

Sealing is basically meta-magic. It's a way to modify chakra and physical & spiritual energy using chakra. The seal Minato used on the Kyubi is one that repurposed large parts of his own mind to create a filter between Naruto's chakra network and the demon's, which is why it killed him. Most seals are much safer, as only small amounts of energy are needed. Most seals that have an effect have a storage component that is charged, and loses power over time. Better seal users can make their storage parts more efficient, so they last longer. The writing on seal paper is used to guide the seal master on where to weave chakra through the material, and has no meaning of its own. Copying the writing doesn't do anything.

The Rin'negan are eyes that see all dimensions. You can literally look into peoples' minds, and tear out their souls to absorb their knowledge. You have perfect control over your chakra because you can see where the components flow, and how to change them (nobody else can - it's like trying to paint in the dark for them). You can absorb attacks, because you see the structure and disassemble it piece by piece as it hits you. There are a range of sealing-like things you can do - for example, give other people access to chakra. The Rin'negan won't have the same powers as in canon, but they'll be similar-ish.

The Byakugan are a weaker copy of the Rin'negan. They see only in the physical world (albeit with massively increased range) and chakra. There is no way to block them, although they only see in monochrome so using two similar shades of different colours can let you write messages they can't read (red on green, for example - think of colour-blind tests).

Those two were relatively easy, as there's a communal theme. Finding a theme for the Sharingan was hard. They're an offshoot of the Byakugan. A Hyuga with a gift for medical techniques modified his eyes so they would store whatever they saw. He had to give up some of their usual functions, however. As his splintered-off family experimented more and more with new powers to add, they gave up core parts of the Byakugan and were left with a much weaker eye that could however learn and grow. The main Hyuga clan cast them out, and further experiments were banned within the Hyuga family.

The Uchiha, as they named themselves, developed their eyes further and further. The Sharingan could see chakra still, and store that knowledge. Over time it would become stronger and stronger. The eyes would be dormant until the owner felt true fear of death for the first time - a short time later they would activate. The Mangekyou is triggered by guilt, and the way it works is by taking the strongest abilities it's seen and mimicking them, at the cost of the eyes' internal structure, both physically and spiritually.

The eyes (both Sharingan and Byakugan - the Rin'negan can't be passed on; the Sage's set is the only set) are passed on by eye-to-eye contact from someone who has them to someone who has the right genetics and chakra for them. A chakra 'seed' that can grow into an eye is deposited, and develops over time into a full-fledged eye.

The Sharingan only makes sense if someone (or several someones) deliberately created it, imo.

That's most of the chakra-centred worldbuilding I've got so far, although there's more worldbuilding and also some plot. I don't plan on explaining this in-universe, but I need an explanation out-of-universe so I don't accidentally write things that don't make sense.

If anyone has feedback on what they subjectively liked or didn't like, for any reason or none at all, or what they think of the system as a whole from the perspective of a potential reader, I'd like to hear it very much.
