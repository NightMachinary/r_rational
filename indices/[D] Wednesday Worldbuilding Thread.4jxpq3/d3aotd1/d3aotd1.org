So, I got a story where a conspiracy of immortals are controlling a seed generation ship.

Somebody from the outside(a trans-dimensional traveler) came in, disrupt the status quo, and give said generation ship a new hope, an 'out' of the situation they found themselves in.

As a result of the disruption, a power struggle broke out, and the good guy immortal wins over the 'bad guys', who are all corrupt and lazy. The assembly all got assassinated.

Now, you're in a rapidly changing society where people are starting to get a fresh look on thing, including the conspiracy theories that the guys at the top are all immortals.. Naturally this is all done in secret, and there's no proof that such a cabal exists, beyond floating conspiracy theories.

There's a strong tradition of immortals having masks, but it's going to come unraveled sooner or later, especially since there are little in the way of propaganda, political, or secret police functions in that particular society.

So I am thinking about how the immortals(which are the nominally the good guys) are going to survive the transition without getting killed or relegated to a jail, preferably without using EVIL methods to win.
