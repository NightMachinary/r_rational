Magic for converting energy between different forms? Ie, heat into kinetic energy or vice versa, or into creating complex chemicals that wouldn't form on their own but which only use the elements at hand. If non-sentient organisms can use simple magic, maybe there are plants that feed just on the excessive heat, and cool themselves by turning deadly heat into harmless wind current, allowing them to survive in way too hot environments?
