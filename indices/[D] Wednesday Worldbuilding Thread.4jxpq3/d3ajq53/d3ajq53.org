Hey guys. So, supposing I was making a world that uses functional magic and has "temperature" as a major theme - as in, thermodynamics. What attributes would you expect to see in a magical system like that? I have some ideas already. Also, what kind of natural phenomena do you think would proceed from such a system, and how does it effect the world?

I was thinking of having the world effectively be like a lava zone from a video game, with lots of molten magma and lava everywhere - what kind of climate could maintain that, and also not kill everyone living there?

Again, I have some ideas as to how I'm going to pull it off, but if you think of something especially unorthodox that I might not have thought of, please go ahead.
