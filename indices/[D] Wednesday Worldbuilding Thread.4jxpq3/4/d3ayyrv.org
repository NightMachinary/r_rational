A while back, I discussed a protagonist for my next story in the superhero genre. He is no longer human in his biology. If you imagine an amoeba made of a rubbery, wax-like substance, that's close. He is a reluctant hero because his powers came with a big problem. Constant hunger that cannot be sated. If he eats more mass than he uses, he grows larger, and more hungry. As his size increases, he also becomes less capable of rational thought. As he grows larger, he can also eat faster. This combination scares him, with reason.

He can consume anything organic, but has weaknesses to solvents and temperature extremes. He does need oxygen, but can absorb it from the air, water, or even some digestible solids.

I've been trying to think about how to introduce him. Here's what I've got, tell me what you think.

First, when he first got his powers, it was during a super villain attack on his place of work, a research lab. The subject of research was a living plastic that would be introduced to landfills to recycle organics into said living plastic, which would then be harvested. He became this substance.

Specifics withheld, but he ended up consuming a super villain while instinctively trying to fight back. Three of his coworkers also disappeared in the battle. He is certain that he ate them by accident. He tries to convince himself that they were already dead, because he saw them being attacked before he was thrown into the plastic vat. But he doesn't know.

It was possible to verify through various means that he didn't intentionally kill anyone, so he was not imprisoned. But he doesn't trust himself, so he asks to be incarcerated anyhow.

A compromise was made. He would be incarcerated, as he wished, but he would need to pay his own way by acting as the first line of defense against other prisoners escaping.

The first scene will be a small group of heroes going to the prison to try to convince him to be more active in the world. He's stopped more than twenty super-powered prisoners from escaping, a perfect record. Despite causing some mental trauma to a few would-be escapes, he hasn't eaten (much) of any of them.

His name has also changed. I originally wanted to call him 'Bandit' but he has too much self-hate to give himself that name. He will, instead, start with the name 'Lump,' which is appropriate because he is an amoeboid with the surface consistency of wax. He is capable of taking humanoid shape, but requires an artificial endoskeleton to do so. Even when he forms himself into a human shape, he doesn't really look human up close, and makes people uneasy in his presence even when he tries to be unthreatening. Uncanny Valley territory. When he fights, he intentionally tries to unnerve opponents by flaunting his inhumanity as a psychological weapon.

Does the concept of using a self-hating super-powered individual who insists on being imprisoned as a prison guard make any sense to you? I've thought through it, and I think it will work, but I'd like to know what problems you folks might see.
