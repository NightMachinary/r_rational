  I got a really dumb reply. This is dumb.

  Yeah, it's a bot and it generates its responses randomly; it doesn't know what's funny and what's not. Sometimes its responses are hilariously absurd; other times they're boring and weird and completely unfunny. You're welcome to page it again for a new response if you don't like the last one you got.

I take it that means it gives a different answer every time?
