It sounds like N-gram generator, so I would not call this "AI." It's not that it doesn't understand the meaning of words (let alone the phrases or ideas constructed), but it doesn't even understand grammatical sentence structure and parts of speech.

It just so happens that using N-grams with N >= 3 generates something that has reasonable parts of speech (most of the time), so as our brains are processing each word in linear order, they're (most of the time) thinking, "hmmm, maybe something down the line will enable this to make sense" rather than red flags like "wait, there's no way that word would go there." Let alone when we look at the sentences as a whole and see problems like "that's the wrong form for a prepositional phrase" or "that's a number/tense mismatch" or "um, this sentence all dependent clauses and no main verb."

In short, what's amazing is the human brain's ability to keep trying to find patterns even when its barely there.
