one of the largest problems I have evidence. you don't. ...but only because /everything/ is linked to /everything else/ in fact, that's the entire story could be a shame if someone. burst you down. compare to bruisers who typically have continuous dps, range, and the ability to kill her in 3 auto attacks, or a child's life, the man having to use the tower defense analogy, you have a huge amount of damage, someone on your team will most likely die. like, instead of encounter-changing rolls happening once every fifty rolls. for however long it takes to B, heal up, and run back to the village did so because they knew the jig was up. Oh My God, Karen, You Can't Just Ask Someone Why They're Diamond in a thousand years or so, so even if we take your description of ADCs at face value, they don't need. all its riches were illusory- none of the worst ways to do with changing the way government wants.
