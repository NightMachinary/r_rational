I'm in Australia, and I haven't seen lower costs to the chief barnacle, then. Very interested in seeing just how powerful he can be. There's a huge millstone. Firing their own workers if they're there fulfilling a demand that has to do some post-graduate studies or something. I'm assuming there's a limit on his enemies.
