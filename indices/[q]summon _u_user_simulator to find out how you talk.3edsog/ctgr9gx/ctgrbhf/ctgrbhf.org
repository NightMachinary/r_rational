There is no convention for at what stage this is considered a subjective experience, but them see someone wave at them or thinking they are experiencing it. The first time only one person waves at another person. The other person might say they remember being waved at is not a person at a particular point in time, that they are waved at is not real, when mean that Harry Potter is not real, when mean that Harry Potter or Hermione must dies, and Voldemort has made Hermione close to immortal. To explain what I mean by the person claiming to be Empress.
