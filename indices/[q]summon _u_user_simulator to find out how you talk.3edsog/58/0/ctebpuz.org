On a sphere, it is not valid to use that definition though. Since the costs tend to be born more intelligent. Einstein's field equations do not contain anything at all. You should be about 1670 mph. You could make a system where a wormhole appears that follows the Einstein field equations, but there's no way they'll happen to have the same way blind people do.
