Ah yes. That dumbledore character's ship stick provides really shitty endowments so ship players will want to avoid playing with him if they anticipate a lot of trouble in the late game. Skyrim's sapient ship mod wouldn't work if it had the same sort of progression system because then its high-wizard classes would be completely unbalanced.

And yeah, the hermit crab is clearly a pretty boring class to get assigned in the sapient ship mod because you'll end up being assigned to sitting around blocking hallways during boarding for most of the game.
