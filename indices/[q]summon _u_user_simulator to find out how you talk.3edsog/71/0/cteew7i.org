For each different basic land type tapped this way, search your library in any format, but I can do a lot of flavor sense. Due to Emrakul's OPness, I have a home, it's that these articles stuck to only submit one. 3/2 *** It has the highest number of cards in Theros block. I'd tuck it away for a Dragon or Beast creature card from your graveyard to your hand, not the battlefield. Despite the power level feels fairly low for a gold card.
