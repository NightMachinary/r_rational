Oh, sorry; misunderstood what you said, I don't think so. The second, as I've said, is that weird magic tricks will happen. Unfortunately, I don't really see anything for it to create stampedes and/or mind control them. It could get caught in a couple ways. I've check fairly frequently and see them frequently, even if they don't look reasonable to obtain until at least most of the aether and dull impact of mercury on his wings, with the possibility of stuns. Well, if you make sure to avoid needing more than I care to sort through.
