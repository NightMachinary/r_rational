Huh. While that's true, the only one it came up with was Donjon. The shrine/skull thing is for Fallen London, which is much closer to interactive fiction. The second is with it. The fourth is with donjon. The fifth is for Dustforce. The perspective one is css trouble I was having. 1.3 is for terraria which is barely an RPG. The patch and coding is for an incremental game called Sandcastle Builder, then the next is for one called Kittens Game, and I have no idea on the last one.
