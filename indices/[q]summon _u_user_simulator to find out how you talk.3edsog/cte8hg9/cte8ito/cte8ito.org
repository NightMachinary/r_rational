The story in question is Khandhas on the clone get duplicated? Despite falling asleep partways through, I was just about to post a correction. Any copy that extends the area demarcated by the original body are duplicated onto clones, but injuries sustained by the original body are duplicated onto clones, but injuries sustained by the clones as a kid are the reason I'm so fucked up now. Sorry for the slow response, by the capsaicin intermingling with your friends list, but mind adding me? Ah yeah - I was supposed to give to you!
