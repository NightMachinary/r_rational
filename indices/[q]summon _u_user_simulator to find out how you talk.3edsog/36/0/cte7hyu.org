Not a pig owner but I haven't tried that yet. They're also working on it. This looks like a great site, and I've already spotted a few new things and being more like the person I wanted to be. Though I admit typically only eat it as two convex or two concave surfaces. TL;DR chickens have a fourth cone for motion, and better overall cone distribution.
