Never age while you read or observe stuff

fake photographic memory by taking time to memorize things

go from mediocre at speed chess to brilliant

get fit and dominate in fighting sports with your insane reaction speed

if you have the mind for it, go into a field that requires much thinking like philosophy, theoretical physics, math or so. You could fake infinite computational power of not for pesky things like boredom and limited memory.

Get a scan to see if your brain actually speeds up or your thoughts are offloaded somewhere where time holds no sway because if the first is true you'd benefit from a brain to machine interphase to type or control devices at /their/ speed. If the second, panic.
