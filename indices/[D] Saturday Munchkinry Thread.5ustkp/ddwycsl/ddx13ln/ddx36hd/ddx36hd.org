the biggest piece repairs itself at 10% the whole object's mass per hour. broken pieces remain but disassembling does not count as broken. you don't get a new battery for removing the one inside, just a powerless phone and a battery that regenerate.

cutting a laptop with an axe or smashing it would let you harvest metals, plastics, and some small components if they survived though.
