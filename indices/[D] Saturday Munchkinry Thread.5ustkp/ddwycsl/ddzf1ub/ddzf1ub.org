If it's a generic fantasy realm and not Earth, the maps on my phone would be useless, unfortunately, but I'd still have a major leg up in naval navigation because of my watch. Assuming a cosmological setup more or less analogous to ours, a way to measure time with precision would allow for longitudinal navigation that would be impossible without it.

Other than that, I honestly don't think any of my items would be useful. A pocketknife with extreme durability and self-repair is cool, but not exactly a major martial force-multiplier. Lacking a data connection, my phone's primary use would likely be as a calculator. I'd mostly have to rely on my knowledge of more applicable technologies (steam, gunpowder, etc.) if I wanted to make any real waves. I suppose the batteries in my phone and flashlight could do some interesting things once I had a use for electricity, but a few meager watts of 3.7v, even in perpetuity, would be hard to leverage into much.
