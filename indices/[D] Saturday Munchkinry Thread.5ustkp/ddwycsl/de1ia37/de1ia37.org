I had two notebooks so I can generate paper and sell it , I would get 40 pages per hour (once I have a reliable method of leaving the notebooks in a state the magic considers "broken" whithout damaging the pages to munch ) my belt , clothes and shoes are other things I can probably duplicate (cut them leaving one side bigger , the clothes self repair, cut them leaving the other side bigger , and then attach the two pieces together). I would have to experiment a bit whith the self repair sistem but it seem posible that i could duplicate specific pieces of my phone if I break it carefully the problem is that i dont think i have the knowdelenge and tools to do a lot whith most of them but some things like pieces of batery can be used as explosives or if I manage to get whole batteries i can make things like a improvised taser(or die trying ) . other ideas are using the increase of volume of the self repair to destroy things I 'm not sure how that is supposed to work but I imagine that a jersey that was burned regenerating from a zipper slider placed in a closed space will break things very violently and that has a lot of uses .It would be great if I had some useful nonfiction books in my Ebook but unfortunately I mostly only have fiction books .
