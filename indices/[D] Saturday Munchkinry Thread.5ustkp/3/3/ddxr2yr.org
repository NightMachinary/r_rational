Hmmmm.

Invert gravity - anything in the sphere is flung into the air (on exiting the top of the sphere, it follows a ballistic trajectory)

Invert (electromagnetic) inter-atomic binding forces - anything in the sphere disintegrates and the separate atoms are violently flung apart.

Invert friction - with careful choice of units, any moving object of known initial speed on entering the sphere can be accelerated to an arbitrary given exit speed. (More complex than either of the above)

Invert the strong nuclear force - I'm not quite sure what this does, but I suspect that the only thing left within several kilometres is a large crater which still glows a few centuries later. There will certainly be a lot of shattered atoms.
