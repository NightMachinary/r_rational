You have the power to modify physics in a limited area. What do you do?

Rules:

- The affected area is always a sphere of 1m diameter.
- The center of the sphere is always exactly 5m from your center of mass, in whatever direction you choose when you conjure it.
- The sphere cannot move once created.
- At creation time you choose one natural law as expressed by a mathematical formula. Within the AoE that formula is inverted so that, e.g., F = 1/ma or a = m/F.
- Only one sphere can be extant at a time.
- The sphere lasts as long as you concentrate on it.
- There is a 10s cool down between uses.
- For some bizarre reason all physics within the sphere remains exactly the same except for the one modification you've made. In your munchkinry you may need to explain what that means.
