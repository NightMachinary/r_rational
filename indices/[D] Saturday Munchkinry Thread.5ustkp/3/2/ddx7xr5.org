What is "1" in those systems?

Normally, when 1 newton of force acts on 1 kg of matter, it results in 1 m/s^{2} of acceleration, and a naive interpretation says that inverting it should have no effect (1^{-1} = 1).

However, imagine a system where 1 newton of force is acting on 1000 g of matter instead of 1 kg. It would still result in 1 m/s^{2} acceleration before inverting, but the inverted value would be changed by a factor of a million.
