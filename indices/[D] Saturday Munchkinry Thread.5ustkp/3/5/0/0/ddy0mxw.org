Even given that, you still get a sphere of destruction. For example F=1/ma, smaller particles moving produces more force than large ones. The brownian motion of the particles that make up for example a brick wall, each atom would have an incredible amount of force. It would disintergrate and explode, the phyiscal law that allowed it to exist had changed to the extent that it can no longer exist in that state. The force of the air particles hitting into each other might even be enough to cause nuclear fusion. Thus, sphere of destruction.

The specifics change with the law being changed, but in each case I can think of normal matter is not able to survive the change. The physical law changing would have to only effect things on a macro scale to be function usefully.

In which case I'd probably switch some constants to do with nuclear fusion and make an absurd amount of energy and thus money, use it to fund existential risk projects and a lavish lifestyle. There might be some constraints but generally speaking it's hard to completely control someone with the ability to fly by hopping on a 5m long pogo stick and turning off gravity, as well as the capacity to destroy any extant material and be a one man nuclear state.

Also I'm sure there'd be some way to use gravity to make an alcubierre drive, so I guess explore the universe as a stretch goal.
