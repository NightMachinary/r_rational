1 would just be a constant, but it's the units that are important. Changing Newtons from being Mass * Acceleration to being (Mass * Acceleration)^{-1} .

Screwing around with which size unit you use doesn't do anything, it's like 100cm squared isn't any bigger than 1m squared, despite the former having a number 10000x larger as it's 10000cm^{2} as opposed to just 1m^{2} .
