Who decides what's a natural law? With some equation juggling you should be able to get any effect at all that you can specify within that sphere.

What about the units not matching up? Force equals some amount of N^{-1} doesn't make any sense.

It sounds like this would very easily destroy the universe, akin to what happens when you throw a glider at a gigantic Game of Life construct.
