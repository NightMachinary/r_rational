Interesting question! I think the best application of this power is to invert the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_decay#Natural_sciences][exponential decay laws]]: x = exp(-A*t).

*Radioactive decay*

N/N_0 = exp(-lambda t). After inversion, N/N_0 = exp(lambda t). That means it is no longer a radioactive decay. /New matter is generated from nothing/. You get free nuclear fuel and, in the long run, free energy.

The process will be at its fastest if you use the least stable isotopes. That means you will have to be extremely careful or your setup will go horribly wrong.

*Capacitor charge*

You can cause exponential growth of electric charge in the capacitor. This solution also gives free energy, but might be a bit safer (and slower. and less exciting).

*Other ideas*

Beer froth also obeys the law of exponential decay! It means that... actually, I don't think it is useful.

Maybe you can turn [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_dilation][time dilation]] to your advantage, I am not sure.
