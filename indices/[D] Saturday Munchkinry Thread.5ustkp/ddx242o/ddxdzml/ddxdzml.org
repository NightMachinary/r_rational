Could be used to break any password by iterating through all possible answers.

#+begin_quote
  Consider a function that iterates through all possible passwords. I choose password N=1 to test. What if I were to test password N, and if it fails, to consider a 'what if' had I tested password N+1 instead?
#+end_quote

The recursive behavior allows you to test any finite numbers of possibilities in zero time. My simulated "what if" tries the first password in the list. If it fails (which is likely), then the simulation starts a simulation of its own to try the second password. If that fails, then the simulation's simulation starts a simulation to try to the third password. This continues until the correct password is found, which halts the recursion.

This can be used to solve any problem which can be iterated. Bank account passwords, testing of new machinery, design of ideal spaceships by brute force, etc.
