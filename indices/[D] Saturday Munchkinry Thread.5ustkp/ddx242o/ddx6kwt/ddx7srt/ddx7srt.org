  "What if I had really applied myself and been elected President?" Hmm... my advisors are telling me such important secrets! Hmm!

You remember trying and failing to get nominated, as most people you don't have enough political skills out of the box for a past decision of your to have changed.

  "What if other people were able to run 'what-if' scenarios?"

  "What if someone else was running a 'what-if' scenario where they were me?" "What if that someone was the ruler of the world?" "What if he also really was me?"

  "What if someone figured out how to use the 'what-if' mechanic to create a turing oracle?"

  ...

  "What if a time traveller visited a younger me in order to teach me the secrets of time travel?"

"Sorry Dave, I can't let you do that". The simulation can't show you things that aren't possible, at least now you know you're the only simulator.

  Run complex and dangerous experiments quickly and easily: "Ready to start?" "No, hold on a few more minutes." What if I had said yes? "Hold on, gimme fix something!"

Now we're getting somewhere. You suddenly remember nothing, you see it as a sign that you died performing the dangerous experiment, but as you can't remember exactly what went wrong you need to try to single out a single binary possibility, maybe via multiple simulations (e.g. "What if I mixed elements A & B only?" you remember nothing unusual happening, later "What if I mixed elements A & B, and then C?" you see nothings and figure out A & B are safe but adding C causes something bad, maybe an explosion, "What if I told my intern to mix A & B & C while I was far away looking through a video system?" you remember seeing the intern die, it looks like a poisonous gas did it).
