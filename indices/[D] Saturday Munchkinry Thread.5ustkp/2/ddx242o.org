You can think of "what if" questions about past events and suddenly you (also) have the memories of the you from that (simulated) timeline.

Both the canonical and alternate kind of mesh together so small differences are harder to spot and larger differences have a kind of super imposed feel.

As you dismiss the scenario you lose the memories (like a dream) but you can keep records as usual.

Can you conquer the world?

[edit]

The implicit premise of the "what if" simulation is that it's about possible worlds, not an information pump or a genie where you state the end state and see how you get there, but you state a possible divergence (e.g. different outcome in some action, different choice) and you remember how that unfolded. For example if you had to guess a 128 bit number you can't simulated "what if I guessed the right number" and "remember" it, but you need to ask "what if I guessed the first bit is zero" and brute force it.

Another implicit constraint (it's better to spell it out) is that it takes time to go through the "new memories", as would take to go through regular memories.
