I can very rapidly search through a large collection of books for anything useful. "What if I had read this book yesterday? Okay, I remember it being useful, let me write a summary of the main points. What if I had read this book yesterday? ...no, no new insights there."

Hmmm. Or... "What if the entire universe had started one hour earlier but everything happened in exactly the same manner?" I think I can use that simulation to get a good idea of what will happen in the next hour.

Debugging software - "What if I had carefully investigated /this/ function for bugs? Nothing? Right, then, what if I had carefully investigated /that/ function?"
