"Sorry Dave, I can't let you do that". You can state the divergences not the outcomes of the divergences. So you can sample 2^{1024 x 1024 x 1024 x 1024} random blobs, remember reading the writings of the monkey shakespeares and if you're really unlucky unleashing a UFAI on humanity (they're way more probable than the FAIs in the data).
