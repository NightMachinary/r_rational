Some of the things I had on my at 4pm were silver jewellery, so I guess I can sell bits of them and at least not starve. Other than that I have my phone, with a bit of fiction and music on it, but no internet of course so it would mostly be a novelty. I guess I could hire myself out to do calculations but more likely it would be stolen from me if I showed anyone...

Oh! But! I have cocodamol painkillers and first aid training. I think I'm going into healing...
