Did he really explore every other possible avenue? I don't think so. Maybe his choice can imaginably be defended as reasonable, but we don't ever get to see his reasoning, so it's hard to endorse this.

Looking at the criteria on the sidebar, we see:

#+begin_quote
  The rules of the fictional world are sane and consistent.
#+end_quote

Nope. It's not explained why violating the conservation of energy like this is reasonable, or why anyone set up society to be like this, or how society happened to fall into a state like this accidentally. The rules of this world are nightmarish and arbitrary, not sane and consistent.

#+begin_quote
  Nothing happens solely because 'the plot requires it'. If characters do (or don't do) something, there must be a plausible reason.
#+end_quote

Everyone has been brainwashed and genetically engineered and whipped into holding the idiot ball and supporting this system. The main character is the only person to show autonomy. No discussion of how reasonable human beings could transition into this system ever occurs.

#+begin_quote
  Any factions are defined and driven into conflict by their beliefs and values, not just by being "good" or "evil".
#+end_quote

Eating other people for no apparent reason, when agriculture could conceivably exist, seems a lot like being evil for the sake of evil.

#+begin_quote
  The characters solve problems through the intelligent application of their knowledge and resources.
#+end_quote

The main character mostly just wanders around and gets lucky while bluffing and never getting called on it.

You could argue that all of the irrational elements of the story amount to forgivable worldbuilding that sets the stage for the real plot. But the entirety of the plot is spent exploring this world. By the time all the irrational aspects of the story are out of the way, the story is five seconds from over. And the only thing supporting the idea that the character's decision to give up was rational is your own personal interpretation of the situation he was in, which isn't based on any strong evidence from the rest of the story because the rest of the story didn't make any sense.
