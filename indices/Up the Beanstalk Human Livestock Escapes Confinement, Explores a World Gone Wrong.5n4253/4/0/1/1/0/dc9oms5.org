I think the problem I have with your characters is none of them have /it/. That /spirit/, as you said. They'll go so far, try so hard, get so lucky, and reach turning points, inflections in destiny. And then they just stop.

The man locked in the room has nothing else to do, so he sits in the chair and is hooked into the game knowing it's a fate worse than death. And then, paradoxically, to earn the death he already had available, he submits. He could've just destroyed everything there, ripped it to shreds, and waited to starve.

A man trapped in an alternate dimension is sent to prison by a government so insane it makes ours look reasonable, and somehow for years he forgets how to /jump/ between them, waiting until his release to even try. An act of submission to /Order/.

A man finds a girl that isn't dead or alive deep down in a parking garage with delusions of being a hole in reality. She grabs him and holds on tight, and he doesn't have the /Conviction/ to pull her to her feet and drag her back the fuck out of there.

It's bloody disgusting, watching a hero and knowing that they won't be tested at some critical point, won't get to /try/, won't have a chance to /see/, but simply fail, automatically, absolutely, with no saving throw.

It isn't often that I look around me in the Universe at These Broken Laws and have thanks that whatever put them all together wasn't /worse/, but at least it wasn't quite as awful as you.
