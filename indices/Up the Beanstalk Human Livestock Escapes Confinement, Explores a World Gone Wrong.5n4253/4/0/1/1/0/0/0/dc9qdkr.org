I think it's a fundamental alignment clash. Not one of Good against Evil, or even Chaos against Law, but something more like Protagonism against Fate.

What use is Good, if it does not look into the soul of Evil and call it awful? I think the same has to apply here. It's a matter not of quality but of identity.
