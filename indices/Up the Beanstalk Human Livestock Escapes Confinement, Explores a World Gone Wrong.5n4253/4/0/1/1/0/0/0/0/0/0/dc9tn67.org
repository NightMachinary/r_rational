  But the collection of your stories as a whole is tremendously flawed because it has no balance.

There are plenty of stories of the type you enjoy out there. I would even say they are the majority. There would be no use in adding more of the same, so I've focused on filling out a less developed niche. I do, nevertheless, have a few stories with happy endings that you don't seem to have read.

  The certainty of inevitable failure visible in your work means that once you've read one, you've more or less read them all. It's all the more frustrating precisely because of how memorable the details are; the core is sick and diseased. What impact can a story have if you know how it'll end before it starts?

Why live, then, when you know it will end with your death?

  why don't you hide a story with a good ending in that collection somewhere?

The Black Pool, the Little People trilogy, Metal Fever, Little Robot, On the Beauty of Nature and the Nature of Beauty, Give Me the Good News First

  Imagine someone reading through your work. After a few stories, they get to predict the inevitable failure, and the suspense is gone; they're just picking over the bones. But then, surprisingly, they come across the good ending! A shock! Now, in every story afterwards, the uncertainty is back, the suspense is real, and it'll never completely go away.

See above. That is indeed why I ended the Little People trilogy in particular on a high note, because the first two were imaginative but dreary and bleak, and I wanted to surprise the reader.
