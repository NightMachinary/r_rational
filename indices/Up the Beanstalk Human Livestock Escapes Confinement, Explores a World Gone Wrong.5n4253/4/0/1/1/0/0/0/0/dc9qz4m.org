I think you've nailed a way in which we drastically differ. I don't think in terms of a good/evil dichotomy, where one is to be maximized at the expense of the other (at least with respect to fiction) but instead in terms of balance.

How many movies or books do you know of (that are any good) where nothing bad happens? Further, are there really no good movies or books with sad endings? Is that not a valid area of human experience for fiction to explore?

I do not think we are here only to be happy, but to experience every aspect of what it is like to be human.

I'll also point out the fact that you recalled plot details of those stories demonstrates they are memorable. They made a lasting impression on you. The only bad art, writing included, is that which makes no impression at all.
