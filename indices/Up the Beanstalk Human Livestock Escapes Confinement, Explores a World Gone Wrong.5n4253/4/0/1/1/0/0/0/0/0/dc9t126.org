  I don't think in terms of a good/evil dichotomy, where one is to be maximized at the expense of the other (at least with respect to fiction) but instead in terms of balance.

  I do not think we are here only to be happy, but to experience every aspect of what it is like to be human.

But this is the crux of the problem! Individual stories of yours I might dislike more or less; I don't generally like stories with bad endings, but that doesn't mean they don't have a place. But the collection of your stories as a whole is tremendously flawed because it has no balance.

The certainty of inevitable failure visible in your work means that once you've read one, you've more or less read them all. It's all the more frustrating precisely because of how memorable the details are; the core is sick and diseased. What impact can a story have if you /know/ how it'll end before it starts?

I clicked this link knowing the story would follow the same general path as all of yours do, including not only the bad end but the mincing, pathetic, regret your protagonists tend to have right beforehand. I did think there might be salvageable interest in the details (there wasn't, this time), but mostly I just was frustrated enough with your work that I wanted to say something about it and it was common courtesy to actually read the story first.

If you do believe in balance, why don't you hide a story with a good ending in that collection somewhere? Not just a poisoned pear, but an authentic victory in the same way almost all of them are complete defeats. That one twist would massively raise the stakes for anyone reading the rest of them, since it would create the perception of uncertainty that's missing right now.

Imagine someone reading through your work. After a few stories, they get to predict the inevitable failure, and the suspense is gone; they're just picking over the bones. But then, surprisingly, they come across the good ending! A shock! Now, in every story afterwards, the uncertainty is back, the suspense is real, and it'll never completely go away.
