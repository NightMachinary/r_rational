:END:

The main character makes what I feel is a rational decision at the end, upon discovering there is nowhere to escape to and nothing to be gained from trying to topple the existing paradigm.

This is in contrast to the typical rah rah, overthrow the system plots found in films like Snowpiercer, for example. When the end basically implies that the outcome was to destroy themselves.
