  But there's this undercurrent of industrial sameness to it

I am relieved that comes across clearly. What you wrote there is about as concise (yet accurate) a description of what I am "about" as I have ever seen. My core is a featureless concrete cube and the intolerable feeling of grinding, repetitive, frigid banality is indeed what most of my work strives to capture.

  There's never any suspense, because the protagonist always loses.

I can't argue with that, haha. It is horror, after all. But I have some [[https://www.inkitt.com/stories/scifi/14223][science fiction]] where a clever protagonist uses his brain to come out on top. You might also like my Little People trilogy, as it ends in an ultimately happy albeit somewhat bittersweet way. Likewise with The Black Pool, come to think of it.

Maybe it's just a difference in taste but I can't imagine /horror/ with a truly happy ending that I'd actually want to read.
