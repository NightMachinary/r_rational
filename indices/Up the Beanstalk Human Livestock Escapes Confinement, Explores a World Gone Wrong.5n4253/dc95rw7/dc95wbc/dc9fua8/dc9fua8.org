Actually.... I don't know about that [upon discovering...]. It strikes me as a sort of inverse Pascal's Mugger. There are times when the "rational" action is what is classically "irrational" - and this strikes me as one such situation. If all rational courses of action lead to shitty situations, then isn't the actual rational course of action to look at irrational actions? It's not like they could make the situation /worse/.
