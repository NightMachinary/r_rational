I don't know. From a negative utilitarian or deontological or position, the end of Snowpiercer is perfectly rational. I don't think that the story qualifies as "rational" on the basis of the character making a single decision, especially when it appears to be breaking the rules on the sidebar.

I mean, for starters, "nothing happens solely because the plot requires it" and "if the characters do (or don't do) something, there must be a plausible reason." As much as I wanted to "buy in" and suspend my disbelief, I just couldn't do it anymore once our protagonist claimed that the escapee had bitten his ear and /nobody/ thought that it was a bit weird to encounter this when they had just heard an announcement that the escapee had a tagged ear.

To be frank, this feels like a perfect example of what doesn't fit in the genre, and I think that you know this, considering that you've described the story as a "lucid nightmare." If all that's required for a story to be rational is that a character make one reasonable decision then the term is essentially meaningless.
