The rational action at this point is actually maximum spite. Attempt to destroy as much as possible, kill as many as you can, and ruin whatever you see until you are dead. Anything else encourages the behavior of the universe as it stands.

You can even argue that it's possible he's being simulated; in this case spite is an even more effective choice because if enough simulated people are spiteful and destroy as much as they can through their hate, the project as a whole might be dismissed as unfeasible.

Love doesn't beat apathy. Hatred does. If ever you find yourself entirely doomed, if everything you care about is ash, grab onto your inner dark side as tightly as you can and let it rule you and fill you with its fire.
