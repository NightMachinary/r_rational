Sure, here are some ways I felt it was mishandled:

1. In my opinion, good satire ridicules ideas by having a character (or the setting) take those ideas to their extreme in a humorous way, and then having their humorous actions stand on their own. If you actually have the "smart" character start debating the satirized concepts with the satirical character, it ruins it. The debate feels hollow and one-sided, since one side is intentionally a strawman, and it's also so on-the-nose that it turns the rapier wit of satire into a sledgehammer. I'm not saying that that approach can never work, but I think it is very difficult to execute well.

2. The caricatures were unsubtle and mean-spirited. I mentioned before about taking an idea to its extreme. That might sounds like it can't be done subtly, but it can be. It's the difference between a character saying "You're so selfish not to donate to my church! Jesus tells us to give our possessions to the less fortunate; but I'm saved so I can keep all my money, it's okay for me but not you," vs a character saying "You're so selfish not to donate to my church, Jesus tells us to give our possessions to the less fortunate" while sitting on a golden throne and wearing a jeweled crucifix. That second example isn't exactly subtle, but it's subtle /enough./

3. There was nothing fresh or original about the caricatures. The "ha ha gross furry otaku" and "blue-haired SJW feminist who eats donuts all day and hates white men" strawmen, for example, have been done to death in online discourse.

Sorry for taking so long to respond. Your question was legitimate, so I wanted to put an effort into my reply.
