You're free to make whatever assumptions you want about my motivations. I'm not going to get into a debate about what is or isn't going on inside my head. I will happily engage with counterarguments against the substance of what I wrote.

I won't dispute that the survivalist's characterization was worse, since I haven't read the entire story. My argument isn't that the "SJW" character was the most ridiculous caricature, it's that the abundance of ridiculous caricatures made the story feel like the author's soapbox and detracted from its quality.
