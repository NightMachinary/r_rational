Sure, you need shitty people, but I think it's possible to write shitty people without making them shitty /characters,/ if that makes sense. A character can be a shitty person while still coming across like a real person whose opinions--however reprehensible--can still plausibly come across as making sense from their own perspectives.

I see what you're saying about the story not just making one specific demographic the designated punching bag, but I personally don't think that that mitigates the strawman/sledgehammer issue--it just means the story is playing musical chairs with the role of the strawman.
