I empathize with your frustration about "not my job to educate you." However, I think that response has its place. For example:

1. People in social justice spaces--or really, any controversial spaces--are often confronted by people challenging their viewpoints in bad faith, with no intention of giving counterarguments any genuine consideration. In those situations, trying to educate the person is a waste of time, because they aren't open to information that conflicts with their existing viewpoint--in fact, debating with them just polarizes them further. I think it's reasonable to choose not to engage with such people. This applies to pretty much any community--atheists are justified in ignoring angry religious people who come in asking sardonic questions just as a vehicle to preach at them, religious people are justified in ignoring angry atheists who come in with sardonic questions just as a vehicle to preach at them, etc.

2. Sometimes, rather than trying to convince anyone, people are just looking to talk about their beliefs and experiences with other like-minded people. In those cases, at those times, those people haven't "opted in" to a debate. I think it's reasonable for someone to choose not to engage in a debate if they don't want to at that time. (Of course this doesn't apply to situations where the person is already actively participating in a debate on the topic.)

3. Sometimes the information being requested is so basic that, by demanding to have it spoonfed to them instead of just looking it up, the asker is wasting everyone's time. I think it's reasonable to tell someone to "just look it up" if the information is readily accessible.

Having said all of that, I think that anyone who explicitly sets out to convince others (in a particular work, or at a particular time) does accept the responsibility of fully supporting their point, refuting their opponent's actual arguments instead of their own strawman version of said arguments, and responding to the opponent's questions with sincere, informative answers. This includes social justice advocates. Many social justice advocates do rise to that responsibility.

Rational debate with social justice advocates is definitely possible--just as you say you've experienced in the rationalist community. But resorting to what you call base propaganda can never accomplish that. To answer your question--"If you can't engage in honest debate with a group (it's not my job to educate you et all) how do you deal with that kind of claim?"--the answer is that you move on from people who won't engage to people who will. There are countless essays and reams of discourse on the topic of privilege, for example.
