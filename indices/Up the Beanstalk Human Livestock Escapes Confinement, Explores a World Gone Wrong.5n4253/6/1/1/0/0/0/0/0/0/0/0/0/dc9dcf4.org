I think I would have been down with it if it turned out that they were /literally/ strawmen--like, personalities constructed within the minds of their own opposition and given life. That would actually be really cool! I was sort of hoping someone would say that was the case and that I would have discovered that if I read to the end. But if the point is supposed to be that they're "products of the behavioral sink happening in society today," I don't find the way they're represented at all convincing. Especially when they're used as vehicles to criticize real-world ideas without actually engaging with those ideas.

I'm trying to think how I can best articulate what frustrates me about the depiction...I don't think I would really have this issue with, for example, an "SJW" caricature being included just for comic relief. But to derail the story into a soapbox against, for example, the concept of "privilege," and to have the caricature exist just to offer up the weakest possible arguments for effortless refutation, strikes me as intellectual cowardice. The caricature, instead of just being a funny callout of a certain subset of ridiculous people, is now being used as a tool in a task it's unfit for.

For example, in the debate about privilege, Andrew characterizes it as being the natural result of people achieving varying levels of success though merit, and then passing their advantages to their children. Melissa lets this pass basically unchallenged, and Andrew concludes that privilege (as he describes it) is perfectly fair and not something to be concerned about. However, with respect to racial economic privilege specifically, the discourse surrounding that topic is more about how historically, systemic efforts to disenfranchise POC (refusing to rent or sell them real estate in certain areas, denying them jobs on the basis of their race, etc) created an inequality that persists due to the people who initially benefited from it passing down those advantages. In his rebuttal, Andrew doesn't engage with that aspect of the real-world debate at all.

There may very well be valid criticisms of the above description of privilege. And that's fine! But those criticisms should have appeared /in the story./ That is, if the author wanted to refute the concept of privilege in their story, they should have included both the complete argument for the concept of privilege and criticisms of /that/ argument.

Similarly, Melissa makes an argument that's roughly, "If the playing field were equal, everyone would perform equally. Everyone doesn't perform equally, therefore the playing field is unequal." I won't claim that no one has ever made that argument, but it's a clearly flimsy position that collapses under the slightest scrutiny. People who are well-educated in relevant fields and knowledgeable about the concept of privilege have made much stronger arguments in defense of the position that systemic inequalities exist, so if the author wanted to refute that position, they should have refuted /those/ arguments.

The character of Melissa is simply an unsuitable vehicle for conveying the author's views about the concept of privilege. I'll always be more impressed by watching a martial artist knock a skilled human opponent to the floor, than I would be by watching them kick over a cardboard cutout with a silly moustache drawn on it.

In summary: Caricature whose role is to poke fun at silly people = fine by me. Caricature whose role is to be a strawman so that the author can argue against a real-world idea without intellectually engaging with it = not fine by me, at least not in a work I found on a ratfic sub. Sorry about the wall of text, I got a little carried away.
