If you're going to expect me to be personally responsible for defending against the vague, extremely broad accusation that current social justice culture is detrimental to social justice goals, shouldn't I be holding you personally responsible for proving that it /is/ detrimental? Shouldn't I be demanding that you show me peer-reviewed academic papers demonstrating that, I don't know, regions with high concentrations of Tumblr users have less socially progressive legislation?

If you're not happy with my level of engagement, then ask more specific questions that I can actually work with. This just feels like throwing rocks into the Grand Canyon, you know?
