That definitely is a pitfall I've seen (especially young) social justice activists fall into--going so overboard in trying to advocate for a less privileged group that they take over the conversation, and drown out the voices of the actual members of that group. And Melissa's reaction--basically, "I'm trying to be an ally, how dare you reject my misguided and unwanted help"--is also a common pitfall, and in fact is discussed heavily in social justice circles as a behavior that should be avoided.

However, that behavior is not endemic to the movement; someone can believe strongly in social justice concepts without walking all over the people they're trying to advocate for. When the author tries to shoot down mainstream concepts like "privilege" just by connecting them to someone who behaves that way, instead of engaging with the best arguments for that concept, it's a prime example of strawmanning. If privilege is an invalid concept, it's certainly not "because some people who believe in it act like hypocritical assholes."
