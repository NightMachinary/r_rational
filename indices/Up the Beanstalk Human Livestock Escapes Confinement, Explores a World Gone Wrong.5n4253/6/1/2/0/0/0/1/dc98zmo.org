  If your first argument against social justice concepts is "some nutter once said something about exterminating white people, therefore that's the core of the social justice movement in its entirety and the only position I have to refute," then that's a prime example of your strawmanning the opposition.

It wasn't "some nutter". That implies it was only ever one person. Do you recall when #killallmen trended on Twitter? Was that one person? Are [[https://www.reddit.com/r/TumblrInAction/search?q=kill+all+men&restrict_sr=on][all of these]] the same person? This is a prime example of the sort of dishonesty I talked about.
