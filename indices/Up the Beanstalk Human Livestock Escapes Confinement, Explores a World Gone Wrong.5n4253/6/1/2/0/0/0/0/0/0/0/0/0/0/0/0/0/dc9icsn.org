I'm a white woman.

Are you referring to "race-based discrimination in debate" in the sense of "if you're white you shouldn't be allowed to participate in any discussions about race," or in the sense of "if you're white, you're not qualified to comment on the validity of POC's lived experiences?" Cause what I usually see is the second thing, being misinterpreted as the first.
