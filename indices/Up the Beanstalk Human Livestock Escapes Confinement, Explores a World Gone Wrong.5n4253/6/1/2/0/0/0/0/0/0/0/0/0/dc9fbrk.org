Can I ask what your lens has been into the movement? Like, through what spaces have you been, I'll call it "collecting data" on the behavior of social justice advocates?

Aside from asking that question, I also want to say that the question "is or is not this movement dominated by asshats?" is separate from the question "are the issues raised by members of this movement legitimate?" For example, even if 90% of people who like donuts are asshats, that doesn't equate to donuts not being delicious--you'd have to refute the best donut-related arguments of the most knowledgeable donut experts to draw that conclusion. After all, if a donut expert crafts an unassailable argument for the deliciousness of donuts, no amount of asshattery by their fellow donut-lovers can erase the validity of that argument.
