Honestly, that pushback has just been kind of ubiquitous in the feminist circles I travel in, so I'm not sure how meaningful a small set of isolated examples really is in that sea of it. But [[http://vmagazine.com/article/wearing-makeup-doesnt-make-less-feminist/][here]] is an article I found, written by a self-identified feminist, making the argument that her fellow feminists should not police other women's aesthetic self-expression, but should instead focus on fighting "the /idea/ that wearing makeup implies female inferiority.". And [[http://everydayfeminism.com/2015/01/why-our-feminism-must-be-intersectional/][here]] is an article on a popular feminist website, making the argument that feminism should be intersectional and inclusive, and including some links to academic papers on the topic.
