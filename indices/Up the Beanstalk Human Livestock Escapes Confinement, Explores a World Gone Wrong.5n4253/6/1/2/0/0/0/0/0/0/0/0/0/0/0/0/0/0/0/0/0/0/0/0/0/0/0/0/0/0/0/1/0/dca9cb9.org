If White feminists heard WOC saying, "This form of feminism ignores our race-specific struggles and expects us to fit into a one-size-fits-all mold," and the White feminists responded, "Hey! Stop it! Not all White feminists are like that!", then that would indeed be bullshit in exactly the same way that "not all men" is bullshit. It would be missing the point entirely--treating an indictment of a specific subgroup's shitty behavior as a personal attack on the entire group, and dismissing/silencing the actual issue in favor of defending against an accusation no one was making.
