I'm not really familiar with the "geek feminism wiki" or to what extent it's popular among social justice advocates. I can only speak to what I've encountered in practice. My experience has been that when I've seen someone call out another person for "tone policing," they've generally had a legitimate reason to do so.

I don't generally go out of my way to make others aware of my race or gender online unless it's in some way pertinent. I can say that there was a particular area where I previously disagreed with many social justice people, and I made a CMV post to debate that question without specifying my gender. The responses I got were civil, well-reasoned, and convincing, and changed my opinion on that issue.
