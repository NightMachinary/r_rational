I mean, I'm trying to understand here, but I'm still not getting what they supposedly did wrong. The platform wasn't meeting their needs, they expressed that, and when it continued not to meet their needs they left. I can't really form a strong opinion about some internet drama I wasn't involved in, but I don't see the issue. You said the site wasn't taking a cut, so it doesn't sound like the people who left cost anyone money except themselves.
