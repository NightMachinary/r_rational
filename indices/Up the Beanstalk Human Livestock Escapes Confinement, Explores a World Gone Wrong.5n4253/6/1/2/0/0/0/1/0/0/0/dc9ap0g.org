  No, you don't get to do that. I won't allow it.

You don't have the authority to disallow anything.

If you're getting your information from the echo chamber that is [[/r/tumblrinaction]], that explains a lot. In addition to those examples by definition being cherrypicked for the sub due to their ridiculousness--since, you know, mocking ridiculous Tumblr posts is the purpose of the sub--a substantial portion of them are either satire, trolling, or legitimate points taken out of context. There is some bona fide stupid shit to be found there, but again, the whole reason you're seeing it in that sub is because it was selected as an example of a ridiculous argument.

Again, if you consider yourself a rationalist, you should be engaging with your opposition's best arguments. That means, among other things, getting those arguments from the source--not from communities where the worst arguments are curated for you.
