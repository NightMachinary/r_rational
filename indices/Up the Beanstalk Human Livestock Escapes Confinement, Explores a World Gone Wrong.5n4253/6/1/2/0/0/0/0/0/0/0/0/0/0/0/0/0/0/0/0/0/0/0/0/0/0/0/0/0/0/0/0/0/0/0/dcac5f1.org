So a couple things about the example you linked:

First, as far as I can tell, this company isn't actually hiring people. They're a platform for practicing interviewing and getting feedback. The interviewers they used came from tech companies. However, perceived interview performance is /not/ necessarily equivalent to hiring rate.

I think this is a critical distinction. Gender bias can come into play earlier in the hiring process than the actual interview, and a real-world interviewer's perception of a candidate may be influenced by the knowledge that they're actually up for hire. For example, one major obstacle for women looking to be hired is the perception that they're less valuable candidates because they may take time off work for maternity/childcare. This factor would not influence an interviewer's rating of interview performance, while still affecting their hiring decisions.

Second, it's important to note that when feminists talk about the obstacles women face in hiring, actual sexism by the hiring personnel is only one facet of the issue. The ways in which men and women are socialized differently, and the different expectations placed upon women vs men, are critical factors in understanding why women face disadvantages in hiring and career advancement. (For example, the maternity/childcare perception I mentioned before--the social expectation that women take on the primary burden of unpaid domestic labor like child and elder care is a serious obstacle to women's career advancement, not only for the reasons I already described, but also because women /are/ more likely to take time off work to handle domestic labor in practice and lose out on seniority as a result.)

Third, the trend toward favoring men-who-sounded-like-women wasn't statistically significant, so it isn't good evidence for a claim that there's positive bias toward hiring women in tech.

The article you linked actually discusses this to some extent. Their initial findings that men performed better than women in the interviews disappeared when they controlled for people quitting the site after one or two bad interviews. It turned out women were much more likely to get discouraged and quit. This is an example of the "confidence gap", another feminist issue related to gendered socialization that I don't have time to get into right now, but I can later, or you can read about it on your own if you want.

I need to go to work soon, but I will pull together some academic publications re: hiring bias (don't know if I'll be able to find anything specific to the tech industry) when I get the chance.
