Thanks, that helps. This is still hard to follow, but let me see if I have the gist. Gittip is a site for sending recurring donations to people. Some of its most funded users were diversity activists. These users were targeted with harassment. They thought that the people running the site should be proactive about telling the harassers to go away, and that by letting misogynistic site feedback go unchallenged they were tacitly condoning it. They wrote a bunch of material to this effect and then left the site. Is that roughly what went down?
