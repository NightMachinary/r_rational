Tribalism predicates mindkilling--which is exactly what I see happening here. For what it's worth, I am slightly more sympathetic toward your position than I am toward [[/u/CeruleanTresses]]', but that does not and should not change the fact that this conversation is rapidly taking a turn for the unproductive.
