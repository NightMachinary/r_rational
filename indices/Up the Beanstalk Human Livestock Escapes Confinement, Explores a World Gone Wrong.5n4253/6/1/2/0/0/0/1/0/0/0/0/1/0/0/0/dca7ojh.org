Thank you, I appreciate that. I hope you aren't feeling too discouraged about your resolution. I think being able to introspect about it afterwards and apologize sincerely goes a long way. Not everyone manages to do that. To me that says that you're capable of getting to a point where you consistently live up to your resolution, even if you slip up sometimes along the way.

For my part, since I knew you were reading the thread, I shouldn't have used such harsh language in my initial comment. I know that writers put a lot of themselves into their work and that an attack on that work is just as hurtful as a personal attack, so I should have been mindful of that and moderated my tone. I'm sorry about that. It was a failure of empathy on my part.
