"#killallmen" is an ironic sendup of people who characterize all feminists as violent man-haters. It's deeply sarcastic. That's the kind of context you need to be aware of if you want to make legitimate criticisms of the movement. It's entirely possible to make such legitimate criticisms of that or any other movement, but not if you're getting all of your information about the opposition through a warped lens.

In any case, I'm not really interested in debating the social justice thing in and of itself. My position is that you weakened your story by writing strawman caricatures into it, regardless of what specific ideas you're ridiculing.
