I won't argue that you haven't had those experiences. I will say that my own experience has been different--that in engaging with social justice communities I've encountered insightful social commentary, heated debate, meaningful activism, and mutual support. Not /exclusively/ those things, of course, but enough so that I felt those were positive spaces. The "tumblr otherkin kill white men" stereotype and the social justice circles I've personally witnessed are like night and day.
