You asked for an example of well-received pushback, by feminists, against toxic forms of feminism that exclude women who don't fit into a particular mold. That's what I gave you. You don't have to like the website. I'm not really interested in discussing what kinds of advertisements you found on it.

Also, I question how deeply you read the article if you say "The article then goes on to paint all white people with the same brush, etc." Literally the second and third paragraphs of the article:

"White feminism is a set of beliefs that allows for the exclusion of issues that specifically affect women of color. It is ‘one size-fits all' feminism, where middle class White women are the mold that others must fit. It is a method of practicing feminism, *not an indictment of every individual White feminist, everywhere, always.*”" (emphasis mine)
