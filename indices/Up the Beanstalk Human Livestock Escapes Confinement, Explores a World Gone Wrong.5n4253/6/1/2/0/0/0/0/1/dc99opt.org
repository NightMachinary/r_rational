  Have you considered that it's not a critique of social justice as a whole, but merely the subset that behaves like that?

I'm pretty sure the author is making a critique of social justice as a whole.

  I think they lost the right to be engaged sincerely by tolerating genocidal rhetoric from within their ranks, and mocking objections to it as white male tears. This communicates that they do not acknowledge the humanity of a whole subset of people for racial and gender based reasons, and consider their degradation to be trivial.

Which is why people of any given group (whether that group is rationalists, social justice, Trump supporters, etc) are often very twitchy about their group being strawmanned. Your opponents, knowingly or not, are constantly trying to reduce your group to its most unlikeable members.

Strawmaning doesn't have to be malicious (people usually don't think "Muahahah, I'm going to unfairly misrepresent Trump supporters to make them come across as racist and hateful"), and it can be subtle. Like, if the context is we're talking about self-identified rationalists, and I say people shouldn't believe that they're smarter than everyone else, or if I say "Fantasizing about a Mary Sue who solves everything by being A GENIUS is seriously unhealthy, even creepy", I'm not explicitly making a critique of rationalists as a whole, but it's still clearly harmful for the rationalists' image, maybe unfairly so.
