Alright, I'll bite.

I think they lost the right to be engaged sincerely by tolerating genocidal rhetoric from within their ranks, and mocking objections to it as white male tears. This communicates that they do not acknowledge the humanity of a whole subset of people for racial and gender based reasons, and consider their degradation to be trivial.

The response to this is always to minimize or sweep under the rug the numerous examples wherein SJWs have proposed exterminating white males who do not crossdress or consider themselves women, while making some offhand comment about how those comments are fine anyway and anybody who objects to it is a big baby.

I don't want to die. My family is white, I don't want them to die either. It is not a comfort and does not excuse that sort of rhetoric that SJWs do not possess the power to actually carry out their threats. They may one day, and many historical genocides took the world by surprise, as the groups which carried them out were not taken seriously when they explicitly expressed the desire to commit mass murder. Right up until they were able to and did.

I think there is a core of good ideas in social justice but it is identical to the core of egalitarianism. It tells you everything you need to know that "egalitarian" is a dirty word to them, because they do not want any viable alternative. They want exclusive rights to define what it means to be a good person, the same way Christians do, such that membership is morally obligatory.

It seems to me that this feeling of "We're the good guys fighting the good fight" makes them feel as if whatever they do in the course of fighting their enemies is ultimately justified. That many things they would consider terrible if their enemy did it are okay for them, such as getting somebody fired over an internet argument.

That sort of thing actually is fucked up, inferior and contemptuous. I am not wrong to revile it, and getting pissy over a story which does not present your own ideology in a favorable light is immature.

It's the same reaction any time South Park makes fun of a new subset of society. Everybody else laughs while members of that subset sit there grimly, with pursed lips, even though they laughed with everybody else when it was some other group being ridiculed.

Suddenly it's not funny because it's something sacred to them, and they can't laugh at themselves, because they can't or won't see any flaws with their ideology or the behavior of its adherents. For example:

Is it? A devoutly religious person wouldn't agree. They would adopt your same attitude, that you're just misunderstanding their beliefs, being contemptuous of them, wrongly dismissing them as fucked up or inferior. Besides which, one of the points the story makes is that SocJus is in many ways just a secularized version of Christianity, with its own equivalent of inescapable original sin which only they can absolve you of.

It's said that in order to avoid criticism, one must say nothing, do nothing, and be nothing. I am not in that business. I have my own ideas, I have something to say, that's why I write. I don't care if you don't like it. It's not your story. If you have a problem with it, go write your own.
