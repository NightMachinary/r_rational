Weren't these activists some of the site's top users? That doesn't sound like people coming into a community from the outside and shitting on it, that sounds like people who were part of the community raising concerns about how it was organized.

I'm reading the forum thread linked from that "I resent you" article, and although Shanley Kane wasn't exactly /polite/ about it, there seem to be a bunch of people making reasonable and civil points in agreement with her. It looks like they mainly saw the whole thing as a safety issue. In fact, a lot of Kane's reasons for not engaging in a dialogue seem to be safety-related--apparently the Gittip folks wanted to livecast the whole thing or something like that?

Is your problem with the actual concerns the activist members raised, or is it specifically with Shanley Kane as an individual for being mean about it and not participating in a dialogue with the people in charge of the site?
