  You don't have the authority to disallow anything.

Yes I do. I can decline to accept your rationale for hateful rhetoric.

  If you're getting your information from the echo chamber that is [[/r/tumblrinaction]], that explains a lot. In addition to those examples by definition being cherrypicked for the sub due to their ridiculousness--since, you know, mocking ridiculous Tumblr posts is the purpose of the sub--a substantial portion of them are either satire, trolling, or legitimate points taken out of context.

Your original claim was that there exists only one person sincerely advocating for the mass murder of white men who do not identify as women or sexually prefer other men. Unless you mean to dismiss all but one of the examples on that sub, your claim is discredited. It is a more widespread problem than you're willing to acknowledge.

  Again, if you consider yourself a rationalist, you should be engaging with your opposition's best arguments.

In my estimation, I already have. What you mean is that you did not like my arguments. That is unsurprising. Any objection to them you can raise, I can also rebut. Social Justice, apart from what it shares with egalitarianism, is at the root of it predicated on false assumptions. It relies on powerful stigma against challenging these assumptions in order to survive.
