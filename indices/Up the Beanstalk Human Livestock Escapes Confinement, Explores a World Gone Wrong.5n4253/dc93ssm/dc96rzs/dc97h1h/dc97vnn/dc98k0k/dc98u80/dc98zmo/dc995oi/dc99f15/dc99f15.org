No, you don't get to do that. I won't allow it. There is no rationalization for murderous rhetoric I will accept. An identical rationale for identical rhetoric, but targeting groups other than white men, would rouse immediate and widespread vitriol.

This is not hypothetical, that exact experiment has been tried. There is [[https://www.reddit.com/r/menkampf/][a whole sub]] devoted to doing this and documenting SJW reactions to it. Moreover, you have strategically ignored page after page of posts on [[/r/tumblrinaction]] wherein SJWs unambiguously, sincerely pines for the exterimation of white men. Not as satire of anything, but as genuine hatred that they unwisely aired on a publically accessible website.

  My position is that you weakened your story by writing strawman caricatures into it, regardless of what specific ideas you're ridiculing.

You feel this way because the story does not flatter an ideology that is emotionally important to you. Your opinion has been noted, printed out and shredded.
