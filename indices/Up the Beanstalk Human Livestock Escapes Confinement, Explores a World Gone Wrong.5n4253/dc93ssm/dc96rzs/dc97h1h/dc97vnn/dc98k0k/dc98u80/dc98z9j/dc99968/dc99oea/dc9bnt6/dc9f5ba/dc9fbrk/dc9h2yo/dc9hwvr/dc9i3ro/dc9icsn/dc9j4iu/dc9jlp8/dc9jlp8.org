My experience hasn't been that intersectionality is ignored.

I'm sure there have been incidents where someone is being openly hostile to the point of rudeness, but I don't think there's anything inherently wrong with expecting people to engage with the substance of the argument rather than its tone. Or, for that matter, with expecting people to empathize with POC's struggles and oppose systemic racism, even if some POC are unapologetically angry about what they have to deal with. I think the callouts of "tone policing" are largely a reaction to people who outright dismiss valid concerns because they dislike the tone they were raised in.
