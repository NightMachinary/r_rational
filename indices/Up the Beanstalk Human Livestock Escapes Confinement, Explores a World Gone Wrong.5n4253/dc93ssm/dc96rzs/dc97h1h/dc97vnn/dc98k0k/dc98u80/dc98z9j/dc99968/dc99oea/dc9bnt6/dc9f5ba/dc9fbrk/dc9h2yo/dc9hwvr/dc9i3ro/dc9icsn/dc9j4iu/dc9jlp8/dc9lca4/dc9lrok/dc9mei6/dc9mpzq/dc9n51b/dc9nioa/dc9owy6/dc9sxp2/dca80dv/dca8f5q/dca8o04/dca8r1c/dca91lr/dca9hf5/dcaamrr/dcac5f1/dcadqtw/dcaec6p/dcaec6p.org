Yes, I saw that you included it. I felt it was important to emphasize it in my response.

The goal isn't for interviewers to bias themselves in favor of women. They're being asked to examine themselves for bias against women, and make a conscious effort not to discriminate. If they achieve that and there's still a gap, that's not because the interviewers are evil sexists, it's because there's a systemic societal problem re: the way women and men are socialized that needs to be pulled up by the roots.

Addressing the confidence gap is critical, and that is in fact a popular subject within feminist communities and a common target for activists (e.g., interventions to boost the confidence of young girls, especially with respect to STEM stuff). If you think feminists aren't talking about that and are focusing exclusively on the actual hiring practices, you're misinformed. There is an enormous amount of feminist material about how gendered socialization and expectations lead to women being disadvantaged in the workplace, /regardless of/ any straight-up sexist bias by employers.
