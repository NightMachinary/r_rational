  That might not be what you mean, but I suspect it is. Is that accurate?
#+end_quote

No. If it were, then that's what I would have said.

#+begin_quote
  I imagine that as less of a dismissal, and more of a "I refuse to get into a heated debate with a relative stranger. If you want to have this conversation you need to show that you can do it in a non-threatening manor"
#+end_quote

Again, if that were what I was talking about, then that's what I would have said. I wasn't talking about people who withdraw from a conversation that has become hostile. I was talking specifically about people who explicitly say they're dismissing the concerns of the movement because they don't like the tone those concerns are raised in. It's more common than you might think.
