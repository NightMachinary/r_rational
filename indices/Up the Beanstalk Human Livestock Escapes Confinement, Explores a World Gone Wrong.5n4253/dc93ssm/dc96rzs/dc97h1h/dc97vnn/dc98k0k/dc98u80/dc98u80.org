If your first argument against social justice concepts is "some nutter once said something about exterminating white people, therefore that's the core of the social justice movement in its entirety and the only position I have to refute," then that's a prime example of your strawmanning the opposition. It wouldn't be at all difficult for me to find examples of "anti-SJWs" advocating genocide, but you won't catch me attributing those ideas to the entire movement.

  I have something to say, that's why I write. I don't care if you don't like it. It's not your story. If you have a problem with it, go write your own.

I have something to say, that's why I comment. If you have a problem with my criticism, no one's making you read it.
