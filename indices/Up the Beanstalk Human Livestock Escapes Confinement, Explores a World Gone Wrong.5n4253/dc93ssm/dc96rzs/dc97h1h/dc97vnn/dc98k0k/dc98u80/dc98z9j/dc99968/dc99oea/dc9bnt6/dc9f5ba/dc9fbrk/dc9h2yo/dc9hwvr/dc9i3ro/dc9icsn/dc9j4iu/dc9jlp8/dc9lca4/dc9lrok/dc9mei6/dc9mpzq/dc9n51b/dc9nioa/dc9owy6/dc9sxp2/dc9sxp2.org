I'm not arguing that there are no toxic elements in the social justice community. TERFs exist, so there you go. What I don't agree with is painting the entire movement with that brush.

The first link you sent seems to be directed at, but not written by, a social justice person. For purposes of supporting your argument that there's endemic toxicity in the social justice movement, material written by social justice folks themselves would be more convincing than a secondhand interpretation of that material.

The second link seems like an intersectionality issue; and yes, there's a lot of discourse in the feminist community about the pitfall of denying other women's lived experiences, and about how one person's brand of feminism can be insensitive or detrimental to other women. I've mainly seen it discussed with respect to white feminists trampling over WOC, who experience very different forms of sexism than white women do. It's something I try to be cognizant of.

I don't agree with this writer's attitude that other women /should/ be like her, in the sense of being so deeply passionate about her work that the misogyny directed at her slides right off her back. It isn't wrong for women to be affected by entrenched misogyny, and it isn't wrong to call that misogyny out. The problem is with the /misogyny,/ not with the women who can't just ignore it. However, I also don't agree with lashing out at her for being honest about her positive experiences within the tech community. If I take what she wrote at face value, the individuals who spoke to her that way were out of line.

This is one of those things that's controversial in the feminist community, since that community is not a monolith. You're always going to get that asshole who calls you a gender traitor for wearing makeup or wanting to be a stay-at-home mom. However, there are just as many feminists (if not more) vocally, vehemently pushing back against that crap. You don't see that as often outside of actual feminist circles, because it's not entertaining to people outside the movement the way the assholes are entertaining.
