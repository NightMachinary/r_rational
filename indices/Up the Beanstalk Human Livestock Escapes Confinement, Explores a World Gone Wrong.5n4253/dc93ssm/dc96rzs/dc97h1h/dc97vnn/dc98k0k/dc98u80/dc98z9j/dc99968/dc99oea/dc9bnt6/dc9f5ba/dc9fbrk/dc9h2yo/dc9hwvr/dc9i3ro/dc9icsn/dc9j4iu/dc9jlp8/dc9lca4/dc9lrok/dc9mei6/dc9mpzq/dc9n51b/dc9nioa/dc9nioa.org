It seems like your argument is that I'm getting a biased view due to people treating me differently as an ally and a woman, so I should specify that the majority of my experiences with social justice culture don't involve my active participation. I lurk, I read blogs and essays and research papers, I fact-check, and yes, I read debates between "SJWs" and "anti-SJWs." This isn't a situation where I've only seen the facet of social justice culture that is presented to me as a woman and social justice ally. Most of the time, the people whose arguments I'm evaluating are not speaking to me.

I appreciate your providing a link at the end there, but it doesn't contain enough context for me to understand what's going on.
