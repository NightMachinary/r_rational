In retrospect, having cooled down, I am ashamed of having written this. I actually made a new year's resolution to be more patient and less harsh, look at me fuck that up already.

I don't reject you, how can I when I don't even know you? All I know about you is this one thing we disagree on. For all I know there's ten things more important to me that we agree about, and if I didn't know this one thing about you I'd admire you and want to be friends.

It frustrates me that you downplay certain things but I think our fundamental values largely overlap, and it was not cool of me to go nuclear over what amounted to mild disapproval.

That is a bad habit I have. I always feel like I need to be on guard against attacks that could come from any direction. I won't bore you with how I got that way because it isn't a good reason to be that way to people anyhow.

I always know before I blow up that I am being disproportionately ugly and will feel bad later but the temptation is always too great. I know what I shouldn't do but never seem to consistently implement that knowledge. When I get mad, all the restraints fall off.

I'm sorry I was a harsh, ugly person to you. You did not deserve the extent of what you got. You were magnanimous to be honest that you liked the story rather than trashing it because of my shit personality. That was cool of you, and I think I could learn something from it.

I am gonna leave everything I said up just so people can see I was shitty. Maybe you won't even read this. Sorry for being a poopy asshole though.
