You keep bringing up this geek feminism wiki like it's the last word in feminism. I'd never even /heard/ of it before you mentioned it.

Try just googling "confidence gap," maybe? Like, google it on the actual Google and not exclusively in this one specific wiki that I've never heard of and have not at any point been talking about? You will probably find more pertinent information that way. It's /not/ a tech-specific issue.

I don't really understand your examples about feminism being "shitty to people in tech." You sent me that thing about the open-source website, but I had essentially zero context for understanding what was going on there. It was just a guy talking about events I didn't witness, aimed at an audience of people who were familiar with the events in question. I did ask you to give me material written by the actual feminists involved.
