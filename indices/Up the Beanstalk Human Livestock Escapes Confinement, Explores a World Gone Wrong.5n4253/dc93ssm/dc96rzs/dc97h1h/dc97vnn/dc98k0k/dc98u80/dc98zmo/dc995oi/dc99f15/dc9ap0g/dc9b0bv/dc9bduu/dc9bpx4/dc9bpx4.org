  My point wasn't that it was literally just one person ever,

Don't exaggerate, or I will exploit it.

  it's that trying to shoot down an idea by saying "some of the people who believe that idea also want to exterminate white men" is a weaksauce argument unbefitting of any self-identified rationalist.

That isn't what I said. Here is what I actually did say:

#+begin_quote
  "I think they lost the right to be engaged sincerely *by tolerating genocidal rhetoric* from within their ranks, and mocking objections to it as white male tears."
#+end_quote

Do you understand the difference? Obviously they don't all engage in that sort of rhetoric. But besides the fact that a great many more do it than you were initially willing to acknowledge, the rest either silently tolerate or make excuses for it.

  I've said my piece. If you aren't open to my criticism, so be it--it's your story. For what it's worth, I liked your human farm story very much.
#+end_quote

I reject your praise, and you as a person. I don't want you to enjoy my work, to read anything else I have written or ever to derive any sort of benefit from anything that I do.
