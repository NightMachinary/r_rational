See, that's exactly the kind of thing I'm talking about. Contemptuously dismissing those who disagree with you as fucked-up and inferior people, instead of engaging with the substance of their arguments. That's a level of closed-mindedness better suited to the "religious nut" character from your story. I expect better of anyone who participates in rationalist communities.
