I tried to read it. It did have potential and I was interested in finding out why they were all there, but I couldn't get past the ridiculous Tumblr strawman character. Over and over--"Hey, let's take a break from the plot for a few paragraphs so the author can ridicule ideas they clearly don't understand, using an unsympathetic caricature as the mouthpiece of their opposition." It's every bit as cringeworthy as if "Melissa" were to write her own story where "Andrew" is like "DURRR, I'M A WHITE PRIVILEGED CISHET DUDE AND I HATE EVERY OTHER KIND OF PERSON AND I WANT TO HAVE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC ADVANTAGES OVER THEM FOREVER BECAUSE I'M ENTITLED TO THAT," while Melissa effortlessly shoots down his intentionally flimsy talking points. If the author self-identifies as a rationalist, I would expect them to engage with their opponents' best arguments, not with the asinine funhouse mirror version thereof.

I mention that one specifically because the point where I stopped was when those two characters were having a ridiculously one-sided argument, in which the concept of privilege was badly misrepresented even by the character who was supposed to be defending that concept--but the "otaku" and "religious nut" characters were also unrelatable caricatures who seemed to exist just to mock groups of people, not as realistic depictions of different kinds of humans whose values can come into conflict.

Putting aside the strawman thing, it's fine to incorporate one's own sociopolitical opinions into a work of fiction, but if you don't even try to make it subtle, it sticks out like a sore thumb and comes across as soapboxing. I think the author achieved that subtlety with the human farm story, which I enjoyed a lot. The political point was conveyed by the story itself, not by having characters pause in the middle of the story to exposit it. But the one you linked, not so much.
