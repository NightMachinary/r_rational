I think you're erroneously treating "social justice culture" as a monolith. The facet you're referring to is overemphasized in mainstream communities because it's the aspect that people /outside of/ social justice communities are interested in--"look at this, look at this ridiculous awful thing, pass it around." It's not really representative of "social justice culture" or what it's accomplishing as a whole.
