The "kill all men" thing has been brought up a couple of times, and I think it's critical to remember that the entire point of that sarcastic phrase is that mainstream feminists/"SJWs" /don't/ want to kill men. It's specifically mocking people who strawman feminists as man-haters who want women to rule the world. With very few exceptions, no one is actually advocating killing men, and the meaning of the phrase in context is not hateful toward men. The implication is basically, "Oh boy, I want low-income women to have access to healthcare--haha, I must want to /kill all men!/ It's funny because I obviously don't."

I think it's legitimate to argue that the joke is in bad taste, as long as it's acknowledged that it /is/ a joke and not in any way an expression of a sincere man-killing agenda. I'm not the biggest fan of it personally and I don't use it, but I often see people taking it seriously and holding it up as evidence that feminists want to kill men, which is missing the point entirely.

Putting that aside, I also think it's important to draw a distinction between "hate/derision," and the justified /anger/ of people who have experienced the effects of systemic discrimination in their own lives. Social justice advocates are often expected to present their viewpoints as delicately and politely as possible, lest they be rejected not on the basis of the actual argument but on the basis of its tone. Historically, however, that gentle approach hasn't worked as a means of achieving equality. Disadvantaged groups have made strides toward equality only by getting angry and loud and making the people with the power to change things uncomfortable. Being angry and loud didn't make their points any less valid.

You're probably right that you could cite examples of social justice communities being uncommunicative and hateful, but I don't think that would absolve you of the responsibility--if your goal is to convince people of your point of view--of engaging with the best arguments in defense of social justice concepts. As a rationalist, shouldn't your goal be to find the truth, rather than to win an arms race to dominate public discourse?
