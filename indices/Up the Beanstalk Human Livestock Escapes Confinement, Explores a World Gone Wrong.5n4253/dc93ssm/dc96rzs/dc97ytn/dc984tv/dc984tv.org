Like I said, I thought many of the characters were ridiculous caricatures. I went into more detail about that example because that was the first extensive, fully-realized "DURR, I'M A DUMB WRONG PERSON"/"I'm calmly refuting your points" debate that I got to in my reading.

Using caricatures is a legitimate technique that can be applied well or poorly. I think it was applied poorly here.

It's fine for you to be pissed off by my reaction. That's reasonable. I would probably be upset if someone disliked a work of fiction I had recommended, too. However, I stand by what I wrote.
