Honestly, I think the horror aspect in this Author's stories would be more effective if they didn't all have the same ending. There's never any suspense, because the protagonist always loses.

As always, there are metaphors to be drawn and ugly things to see, and sometimes there's even an interesting original idea. But there's this undercurrent of industrial sameness to it, where you always lose, even if you happen to win. It's almost as if the collection of stories as a whole is a metaphor for the individuals.

In most stories, you see rational behavior bent for sake of plot. In stories by this author, you see it bent for sake of grim metaphor instead; it's certainly different, but I'm not sure it's anymore actual Rat!fic than the former is.
