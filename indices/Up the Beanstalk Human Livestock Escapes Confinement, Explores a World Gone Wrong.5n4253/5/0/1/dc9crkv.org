I was curious about the metaphor of the inhuman element.

as a reader, I fluctuated between two views: that it was to show how awful it was to continue such a system in ABSENCE of an external threat such as this-- that is, that it should require such horror to breed horror, yet we do it willingly.

and secondly, that it was somehow a metaphor for the demands of nature, of entropy, the universality of death.
