Situation: the System just happened, but not to everybody. (Think "Homicidal Aliens are Attacking" style, since that was part of my inspiration.) So some people have LitRPG powers and some don't, and there are monsters either coming or here already and you're not really sure which.

You and your spouse don't have the System, but your twelve-year-old daughter does.

How do you advise her? Assume you are a reader of this sub, LitRPG, and fantasy/gaming in general.
