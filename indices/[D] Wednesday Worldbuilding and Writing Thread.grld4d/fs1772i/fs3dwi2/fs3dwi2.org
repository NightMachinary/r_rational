If it's my daughter, then my overriding imperative is for her to stay /safe/. Second on the list is for her to remain a good person; I /will/ disapprove of her going around murdering people, no matter the reason why. (She's twelve years old, she should /not/ be doing that).

So... I'd probably give this a good deal more thought in a real situation. But I think I'd advise her to go for some sort of crafting class. Something that /makes/ items which can be used by other System-positive people. Items like a shield that also protects against mental attacks, or a headband that makes the wearer more intelligent, or a brooch that hides the wearer from any monsters.

This immediately means that other System-positive people will have reason to protect her (because she makes nice stuff for them); it means that she has a source of the best gear (she can make it for herself); and it keeps her off the front lines (she is /not/ a meatshield, but she can make the meatshield even tougher). Plus, with any luck, she levels by making new equipment, so she doesn't need to become a killer at all.
