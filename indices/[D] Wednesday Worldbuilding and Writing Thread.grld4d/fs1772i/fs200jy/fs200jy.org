Your world is now basically a game with no existing walkthroughs, permadeath, and probably a bunch of unpatched exploits. You know what you need?

You need to become a Scout. Or any information-gathering class - seer, psychic, detective, etc.

In an undocumented permadeath game, the player who survives is the one who figures out the exploits and the monster tips. You want to be that person.

Plus, if you are that person, you can trade with everyone else the most valuable currency of a strange new world - lifesaving information.

Think about Vikings or conquistadors preparing a raid in foreign lands. Did they need warriors? Sure. But no warrior was as valuable as an expert scout, navigator or interpreter. In any group setting, "I can kill people" is nowhere as useful as "I know where the killers are, and I know their weakness."

And before you've got a team around you, Scout often has the skills to avoid combat and identify more or less friendly strangers.

There's a catch, of course. In any system, Scout is almost never the very best class. But to know the very best class in advance, you'd have to know the game system.

In a world where nobody knows the game system, and everybody needs to know it, "Scout" is the best class.
