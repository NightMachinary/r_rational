Hmmm. If crafting classes were off the table, I'd probably encourage her to be something that can dodge and flee, thus avoiding being attacked by monsters. I don't I'd encourage her to pick high-damage skills, preferring to advise her to get /out/ of any potential combat in double-quick time.

Self-healing and retrocausal powers would also be good - being able to undo even just one minute of time will find all /sorts/ of uses.
