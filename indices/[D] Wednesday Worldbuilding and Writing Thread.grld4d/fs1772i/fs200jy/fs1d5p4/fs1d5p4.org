I'm not sure that you could say. There are common tropes in LitRPG, but there's no guarantee that they apply in your situation. Assuming that the whole system isn't laid out from you at the start (it might be!), you don't know what the dominant strategies are. Heck, you don't even know what the enemies are like, and what you might need to prioritize against them. You also don't know how much leeway you have, whether you can bank resources for later or need to fight all-out from the start.

Most of your advice should depend on what information the system can give you, so I suppose step one is, before you touch anything, look through all of the tooltips, skills, and everything like that. Come to an understanding of how the system works before you try to put points into place, pick feats, allocate skills, or whatever its actual properties end up being. Get information on how many other people are "playing", what their capabilities are, how easy it is to have different roles, what other roles people have chosen, etc. Figure out what the monsters are like, what works against them and what doesn't.

If you have to send a twelve-year-old out into the field without knowing much ... well, she's pretty much screwed, and a lot of what you can offer in terms of support is 1) crunching numbers and looking at system math and 2) mental/emotional support.
