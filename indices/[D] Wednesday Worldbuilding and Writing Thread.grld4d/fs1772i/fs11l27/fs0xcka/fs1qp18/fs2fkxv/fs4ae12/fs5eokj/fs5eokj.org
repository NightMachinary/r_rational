Imo the best way to make it Worm-y is probably to have a base power (flight, lasers, element manipulation, etc) and then build the fusion power on top of it. So you have two powered individuals and you fuse their powers into one + spin it so it's related to the base power.

If Totally-Not-Access has the ability to shoot ice beams, then when she fuses Generic-Mover-Hero and Generic-Shaker-Hero the resulting Fusion-Hero has the ability to become an ice missile that freezes a huge part of area it hits while doing no damage to the hero itself.

The power's main weakness would be pretty obvious: it's signature base power means that anyone will realize quickly that Totally-Not-Access is involved. This means that she would have to think carefully about what 'combo' to go with first (if she's on a team).

The main limit should be up to you and what you want to achieve narratively. Either have it last for a set amount of time (a few hours to a few days) or for a set amount of uses. Maybe give it a hard limit so she can't make another fusion until the first one is undone. You could explore a lot of interesting ideas if you have a 'fusion individual' that doesn't want to be separated.

Another drawback could be to give the power an element of addiction, like Teacher's power has. People could get addicted to being in the fusion state, or alternatively the power could push the individuals into either loving or hating each other. Maybe Not-Access' base power gets slightly stronger for every successful fusion, or she loses her base power after a fusion but gains some sort of Thinker power that lets her think faster or command others better, etc. Remember that most powers in Worm encourage their users to use them, whether they want to or not.

The user's mentality is important too, there's not much of a point in giving that power to someone that would never use it. So the power of giving other powers or making others stronger would likely go to an individual whose main fundamental flaw is that they don't think too highly of themselves and would rather delegate their tasks to others, that could also fit with the ironic angle where such an individual could become an exceptional leader (should they develop enough confidence) because of their ability and experience at choosing the right people for the job.
