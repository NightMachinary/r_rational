To make it Worm-y, have the fusing power hijack the attention of the pre-fusion powers' Shards. The fusing Shard funnels the fused Shards' power through itself for a time. The people whose powers were fused lose their passenger for that duration. Your character would then have a cooldown time during which time they wouldn't be able to use their power. Training over time would increase the duration of fusion, decrease the cooldown time, and maybe allow for fusing additional powers.

It would probably be a Master effect.
