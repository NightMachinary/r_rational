I'm not positive, but I think blood sugar levels dropping would pass you out before anything else does. Google says anything below 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) is potentially harmful, anything below 54 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L) is actively dangerous. Might depend on how the energy is taken, though (if it prioritizes fat over sugar, for example, you might have something like Fat Gum from Hero Academia--where he builds fat to power himself, and when he finishes doing something crazy, he's thin again).
