  The Arks work using a warp drive using the periodic element 127 Uv(Universum(i made that up)) carry 100 people and 1000 embryos to start colonies in case the rest of humanity can't follow. Having used all of the Universum to be found on earth to get there, there is no way back.

You don't even have to make up an element to do this; just use antimatter collected from the solar atmosphere. It's ridiculously expensive and slow to collect, and the collection apparatus isn't something you'd probably take with you on a starship.
