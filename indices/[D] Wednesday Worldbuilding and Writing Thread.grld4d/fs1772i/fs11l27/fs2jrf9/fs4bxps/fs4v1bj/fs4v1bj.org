  Probably few enough people have played Warframe that you could straight up copy it without that many noticing. You also can get away with a lot of copying by having a specific enough sense of style that by the time you're done trying to copy it's not a copy anymore. The "imagine Wes Anderson trying to remake Fight Club" approach.

Setting aside the ethical questions this statement raises, Warframe is actually fairly well known, even amongst people who aren't avid gamers. It's in the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most-played_video_games_by_player_count][top 50 games]] with the largest playerbase. It's won multiple awards over the years as well. Even my rural southern coworkers who don't play videogames have heard enough about it (from marketing of other acquaintances?) to recognize the name the first time I mention it.

I don't think that its a good idea to begin your creative process by strait up copying another work, unless you explicitly label your derivative as fanfiction while giving due credit to the original creators. Maybe OP should write fanfiction to get a feel for what it's like to set up a story in that sort of world, and then OP can later write a separate story in their own original setting incorporating what they've learned from that experience.

But in the interest of not copying, the world-building ideas you've raised in your comment are a good jumping-off point. I do think OP would benefit from having a larger pool of creative works to draw inspiration from. The more great ideas he or she encounters, the less likely it is that any one copyrighted idea will be too prominent in composing OP's new world. For example, the manga /Blame!/ by Tsutomu Nihei explores a very different futuristic scifi world, but its mysterious setting still conveys similar feelings of claustrophobia/decay/melancholy.
