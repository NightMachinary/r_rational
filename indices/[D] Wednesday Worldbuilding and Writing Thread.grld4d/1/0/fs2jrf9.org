Probably few enough people have played Warframe that you could straight up copy it without that many noticing. You also can get away with a lot of copying by having a specific enough sense of style that by the time you're done trying to copy it's not a copy anymore. The "imagine Wes Anderson trying to remake Fight Club" approach.

But I've never played it so I can't be influenced by anything more than your description of it so...

Someone built an AI that underwent a hard takeoff, disassembled a large chunk of the solar system to build a Dyson swarm supercomputer, and runs the vast majority of humanity as programs in a simulated paradise. This story isn't about them. It's about the descendants of the handful of weirdos who were left behind because they really, really, actually, truly, at their core would be happier in the real world, the leftover bits of the solar system that weren't worth deconstructing, and the mess made by generations of people dicking around with supertechnology.

Mercury and most of the asteroids are gone; the Brain recycled them for parts. Venus keeps getting closer to the sun. The sun has so many satellites that it has a grainy texture.

Earth is a nature preserve. Someone wanted to end animal suffering, so now prey animals die of serotonin overdose when caught. Predatory animals evolved to be faster and too weak to actually kill their prey now that they don't have to. It's an interesting trip but anybody who actually liked this stuff would've uploaded already, so almost nobody lives there. Also you're used to the quiet of space and Earth is really loud.

The handful of uploaded people who are weird enough that they'd actually get a kick out of playing with your sad lot sometimes show up as beings of pure light or robots or nanoswarms or humans or whatever, handing out various god-technologies for a joy ride before going home to whatever it is they do.

The original scientific paper that spells out how to make your own superintelligence is freely available. You can do it in a long weekend. But if you follow the FAI utility function it'll immediately fold itself into the Brain. And if you make it follow some other function, the Brain will alpha-strike it before it can bootstrap into a threat, modifying however much is necessary so that it doesn't go paperclipper or negative-utility-maximizer on anyone. The AIs that survive that with any coherency are all floating around doing their own projects, which nobody can understand.

There's always the option of uploading, but if it actually would've made you happy then the Brain would've sent an agent out to convince you by now. So you're stuck out in the discarded bits of this solar system trying to come up with something to do with yourself.
