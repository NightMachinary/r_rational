I probably phrased that more extremely than I should've because I was posting when I should've been going to bed.

My point is more... if you want to make a story about a kid going to a wizard school with four animal-themed houses and a racism allegory with magical ability taking the place of race, just do it. Don't call it Hogwarts and don't do a beat by beat recreation of the plot with the names filed off, but these concepts are way too broad for somebody to own, even in combination.

If the work is well-known enough, anything even remotely similar (ie: being about wizard school is enough in Harry Potter's case) is going to be called derivative, because hugely popular things tend to be folks' only point of reference in that area (Harry Potter is the only wizard story anyone who's not into wizard stories is likely to have read). And if it's not so well known, the only people who like it are likely to have consumed other similar media and won't be so quick to complain about broad-level similarities.
