Has anyone played warframe? It's an old live service (7+ years) loot-grinder-shooter with robot space ninjas.

Quick (relevant) plot synopsis (To be clear they release plot at a pace of 1 hour of story gameplay a year, so it's not like I am ruining much) A spaceship gets stuck in the "void" between solar systems and the people on it go crazy, except for the children. The children, the so called ten-oh, are able to control warframes through some sort of telepathic link and channel powers through them. And there are liches and samurai and super AIs and greek gods and stuff. It's all very confusing. I actually barely care about the plot, the ambience of the presented material is the good part.

I really enjoy the setting. For one, it's constrained to just the solar system (because /bad things/ happen to those who try to leave) which allows it to feel like a space/sci-fi setting while also feeling claustrophobic, constrained, and familiar (e.g. like setting things on Earth). Sure the Moon is some sort of wrecked alien artifact called Lua now, but I know what that is and what it looks like. And Venus has been terraformed but it is still filled with deadly natural elements and what not.

For another it's very melancholy. Most of the characters and beings in it are broken beyond repair, the last of their kind. The main faction in the solar system, which clones humans since they became infertile, has long since thrown genetic stability out of the window, they are going to end soon. The super AIs are all broken or insane, can't be made any more, and mostly just dick around for their own purposes. The player Tenno/Warframes are all one off flukes / "one of a kind artifacts" (except where the game mechanics conflict with that).

It would be a really cool setting for a story, I'm just not sure how to create a similar world without straight up copying it.
