I'd steal some stuff from interstellar. The earth is dying(for some reason or another) and space ships(Arks) are sent out to different star-systems in hopes of finding a habitable planet to colonize. The Arks work using a warp drive using the periodic element 127 Uv(Universum(i made that up)) carry 100 people and 1000 embryos to start colonies in case the rest of humanity can't follow. Having used all of the Universum to be found on earth to get there, there is no way back. Sadly all star-systems are desolate leaving the Arks stranded. Luckily for a few ships the AI picks up on readings of Universum in some of the systems making a home trip available, but it takes centuries to gather enough. The crew enters cryo-sleep waiting for the day the AI has collected enough to return. Once they awaken an analysis of the embryos forces crew to birth them due to slight damage from the warp jump(this gives the children their special powers). Upon return to earth humanity does no longer use normal artificial wombs but a new type of artificial womb that births 10000s of identical babies at once(generally referred to by their batch number ie. someone was born in batch #598842). This makes the returning children referred to as True-borns(or Unicus ie. there only exists one of them) with the adults dying because they gave up their cryopods to the children when the ship returned.

I dunno if any of this makes any sense, it's quite late and i'm tired :p but take whatever you want and build on it. Also i don't really have any ideas for AIs going rogue atm.
