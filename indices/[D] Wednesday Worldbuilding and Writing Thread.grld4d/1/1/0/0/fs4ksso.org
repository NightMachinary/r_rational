Antimatter is just a bit too easy to produce to work as a true bottleneck for a society that has invented FTL/warp drives. They would easily be able to produce enough of it for ship to make a return trip. We are already able create and store antimatter for quite some periods of time and i have no doubts we'll quickly improve on the limits we have there. Maybe if you argued it uses the special properties of anti Carbon or something like that to work, but then there really would no difference to my made up element.

I personally wouldn't use antimatter in any other cases than energy storage and bomb-manufacturing.
