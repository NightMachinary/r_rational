If you ever want to really start a race war, you can make it so that non-humans can pray against gods weakening their power. This could create quite the conflict between those wanting to empower their god through the spread of humanity, and the non-humans striving to survive in peace with nature(or something like that). This could also setup and equilibrium between the forces that the main character could influence or just experience both sides of.\\
Just an idea though :p
