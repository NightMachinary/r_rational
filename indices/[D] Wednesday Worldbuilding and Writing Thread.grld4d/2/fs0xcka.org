I'm writing an Isekai and not taking it terribly seriously. I'm having fun with it, and not caring too much about making everything realistic.

That said, on a whim I decided to make it so humans make gods stronger when they worship them, while other species cannot. It's... resulting in a lot more racism toward demi-humans than I realized when I made it that way. After all, the gods that spend resources helping all humanoids are going to get less gratitude and loyalty from humans, while the gratitude of other humanoids is not terribly useful to them. Meanwhile human supremacist gods get stronger and stronger the more they favour humans at the expense of everyone else. Naturally, this also makes the non-humans a lot more susceptible to being taken in by demon lords and all that jazz.

I'm having fun with it, but at the same time I really don't want the primary focus of the book to be about racial issues, so I'm having the main character be an indiscriminate asshole toward everyone, humans and other humanoids alike.
