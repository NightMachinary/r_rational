Yeah it might be a bit over the top for a comedic novel.

Could have people switching between gods everyday to get different blessings to set up some stupid scenarios; Pray to the good of wine on friday to have a higher alcohol tolerance, pray to the god of healing saturday because the god of wine don't care about hangovers. Maybe having different effects on the world depending on which gods are currently the top 3 most prayed to gods. Like the entire world is more healthy in weekends because of all the people praying due to hangovers.

ETA: Maybe valentines day turns into something crazy because everyone prays for true love, but the god is the 'god of love and desire' making valentines day the day of desire where everyone goes wild depending on their self-control
