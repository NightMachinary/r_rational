The first major piece of advice is to think about the number of fights you're going to get into in your career.

If you're active once every few days, then over decades, you'll need to win /thousands/ of fights.

This means that, when you go out, you're either ensuring odds better than 999:1 in your favor, or you don't live to see high levels.

Next, I'd look at skills with "diminishing returns" or "negative externalities". Basically, are we in a system (like D&D) where experience-to-advance goes up based on /total/ level?

In, D&D, if you're offered "free" class levels outside of your main build run you should run the hell away. Like if an artifact offers you a free boost from (Mage 5) to (Mage 5 / Warrior 2) it's a horrible trap. The problem is that the warrior levels will /massively/ increase the experience it takes to get to Mage 6.

But, beyond that, I'd look to see how the system is balanced.

One reasonably common thing is to try to balance classes around /combat potential/. And this gets weird because mages also get a bunch of non-combat utility powers that would be a massive quality of life improvement.

If we set aside monster killing and just asked if I'd like the downtime activities of a high level Sorcerer or an equally high level Ranger, then I'm going Sorcerer any day. One of them gets powers with minimal practice and eventually can have a flying house. The other has to train all the time and is good at shooting arrows.
