The system is laid out for you in that you know what skills and classes exist (which encompasses basically any theme you can think of) but light on details about what they actually do.

As for how many people are "players" I'm going for something more than the initial 10,000 from Homicidal Aliens but still far less than the 75 million that would be 1% of the population. Maybe somewhere in the neighborhood of an even one million worldwide. Initially none are close enough to contact.

Changing roles is possible in that you can re-spec every ten levels but the process is unpleasant and essentially removes you from the fight for a full day, so it's not something to be undertaken lightly. Unless you're spec'd for flexibility or filling multiple roles to begin with, but then you risk being bad at lots of things instead of good at anything.

Overall, assume you have to take someone who is woefully unprepared for this, and turn her into a superhero, because when the monsters come they will be actively hunting her so if she's useless she's dead. What would you advise her to pick in terms of starting power-set? Pretty much anything is possible but it starts small and gets stronger. (For example, a Level 1 Illusionist might be able to provide battlefield control and distractions but not much else; a Level 100 Illusionist can alter reality within the range of her powers. Then again, on any given System world /maybe/ one person will reach Level 100.)
