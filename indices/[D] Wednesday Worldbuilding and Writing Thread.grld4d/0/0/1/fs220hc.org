I was originally thinking she should be a stealth build. I was picturing her as sort of a shadow assassin almost like Jason from He Who Fights With Monsters, but there was something about that that just didn't sit right, aside from an ordinary kid not having the brutality to pull that off. I think you just nailed it, though: stealth, yes, but scout/infiltrator rather than assassin.
