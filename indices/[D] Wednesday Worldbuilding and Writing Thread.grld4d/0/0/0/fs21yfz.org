On the other hand, maybe there is good documentation of the rules, or expert players with good advice. In that case you might try to spot useful exploits in advance.

Some exploit categories to look for:

- "meta" powers like Power-Copying or Power-Sharing, "subversion" powers like Hypnosis, "coordination" powers like Long-range Telepathy, or any "time" power (haste, future-sight, past-sight). These powers are hard to balance well, so they're probably either too weak (ignore) or too strong (get them!).

- "truth" powers are super-valuable for teamwork among strangers. "Lie Detector" or "Unbreakable Oath" or similar powers can be amazing to help your faction grow and stay effective.

- "supplier" jobs like Alchemist or Weaponsmith. If there's a lot of people and/or a lot of teamwork in the world, and if you don't have to fight on the front lines to level up, supply jobs can be high value and low risk.

- "cost immune" class-identity pairings, like having a soul-damaging superpower while being a golem with no human soul to damage. These are often hard to pull off (unless you're a character in someone else's novel!) but can be game-breakingly powerful.

- stacking buffs or stacking cost reductions. Often there's something in the game that lets you drive a power cost to zero, or multiply a power effect over and over.

- setting up monster farms or slaughter tunnels for cheap levelling. Depends on how people level up, but almost any "danger gets you levels" system can be exploited, especially if players of different levels can sneakily cooperate.

- monsters who can switch sides and become allies. This is often game-breaking if you're in place to pull it off.
