Oh, she /definitely/ keeps going to school and getting a bit of normal life.

Grinding levels is something she does for at least an hour every afternoon, after homework. In a variety of safe ways, including playing a paintball match (to grind dodging and/or stealth skills), chess matches (to grind raw INT), or bowling (to grind DEX). Each of these, I keep track of her score and make sure to keep her informed how it's improving, trying to trigger her competitive nature into pushing harder for more EXP. If possible, I put her against continually escalating opponents as well; building up to (say) a two-dozen-army-veterans-versus-one paintball match, or a series of chess matches against the Crafty chess engine; because I doubt she gets EXP from easy contests.

But, one way or another, one way this whole apocalypse thing is going to be /over/. When that happens, I want to have a daughter who's still a sane, balanced human being, with a basic education behind her. (I'm not sure if this 'System' thing will continue working once the Apocalypse is done with). I /don't/ want her to have put everything into this strange System and to have cut off all other paths for the rest of her life. Hence, school and normal life continue.
