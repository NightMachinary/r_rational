I'm on and off doing worldbuilding on a superhero project of mine, based off various comic-book tropes deconstructed and reconstructed. And there's this particular superpower I'm trying to justify without too much handwaving, but I'm not sure how.

i have a character whose powerset is similar to Access, co-owned by both Marvel and DC. She can sorta do a fusion dance of two people temporarily, creating a person who has abilities similar to those she has fused together, and who remembers a backstory that is a narrative blend of the backstories of their constituents.

I rather like this power, but I'm not sure how to make it Worm-y or grounded.
