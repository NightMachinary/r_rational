Archer and Thief are not as clear cut as White's group of sheep. Both of those Names are not intrinsic Hero names, they are what I call Skill Names. Names earned through skill alone (Scribe is another example if Scribe is even a true Name and not a nickname) and not based on some deluded moral.

They are part of the superclass called Neutral names so as such don't benefit as much from the favors of the Assholes Above as a true hero Name would (like the White Knight).

Whether the Narrative will account for that is up in the air. Still, gambling on that Narrative for a win for The Woe, would be a very bad gamble after all the shit Cat has done.

I agree though that staying together is a sound choice. Their skill sets compliment one another.

That's true for Heroes and Villains alike. Only Villains due to their nature, rarely form groups (Calamities notwithstanding). That's One of the reasons Black was adamant and thorough on killing individual Heroes BEFORE they could gang up for their misguided and (for the most part) stupid goals.

"Never underestimate the destructive capabilities of a group of idiots with insane moral delusions and resources."
