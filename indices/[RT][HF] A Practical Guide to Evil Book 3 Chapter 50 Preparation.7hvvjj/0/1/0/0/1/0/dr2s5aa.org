yes, that is one way of determining for certain. if a person has been Named for a long enough time, and if you observe them over that time (or have reliable records) that will give them away. I was speaking more specifically to the case of Thief and Archer, who we haven't seen enough of to be able to use that method. And most specifically Thief, who doesn't have any magical light construct powers to give her away either.
