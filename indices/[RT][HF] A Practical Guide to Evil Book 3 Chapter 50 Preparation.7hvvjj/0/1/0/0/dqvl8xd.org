In all known examples, Names which can go either way (to include Squire) are still always granted by either Good or Evil. there is no proper noun neutral, at least not that we have evidence for yet. there are some cases where it is not really clear whether their powers are granted by Heavens or Hells, but so far everyone is either one or the other.
