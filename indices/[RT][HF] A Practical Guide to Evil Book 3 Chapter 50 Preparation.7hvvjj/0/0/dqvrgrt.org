I think I agree about Hune. Lots of the story is about Cat's struggle with Sacred Values vs Utilitarianism. She wrestles with where she should draw the line.

But, a lot of the internal conflict seems artificial. Much of it doesn't fit with a military commander who's willing to bet the souls of a continent.

Take Nauk. Cat's a woman-of-the-people. She leads a legion. I'd assume that she knows 100s of legionaries by name. And 1000s by sight. After battle, even the minor ones, there'd be dozens of people dying in a medical tent. I'd assumed that Cat would visit and write condolence notes. This just happens off camera, since we don't know Unnamed Legion Member #245.

But she's got to have spent hundreds of hours talking to the dying. She's sent her friends to their deaths dozens of times. Many of them, she'd know that they were likely to die.

The Nauk thing shouldn't be new to her. It's just new to us because it's the first time it happened on camera.
