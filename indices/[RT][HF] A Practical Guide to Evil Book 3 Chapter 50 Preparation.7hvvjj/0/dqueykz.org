Cat being angry at Hune felt kinda out of the left field. She's been on the receiving end of making these hard choices for most of her life as Squire so you would imagine she would be less hypocritical.

The way the situation is presented, I'm thinking the best way to go forward would be for the Woe to go in on their own once the battle starts. The way Cat beat Akua before was by playing the role of the Queen, pulling out the sword etc. Playing the role of a Heroic group, outnumbered and outmatched, would give them a big boost imo.
