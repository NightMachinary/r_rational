My take is that the events in Arcadia foreshadow what's going to happen in books 4-5, as of all the players in that drama I think Akua aligns best with the Duke of Violent Squalls:

New Evil (Malicia/King of Winter) wants out of the old patterns. Catherine takes down a paragon of Old Evil (Diabolist/Duke of Violent Squalls) and claims their power for herself. She uses this power to wage war against Old Good (Principate? Bard?/Summer) and eventually forces them into a corner, where she's able to wrangle them into becoming New Good.
