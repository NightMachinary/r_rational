It's not about mechanical limitations, though. It's about breadth of options. If Ranger's combat abilities are just run, jump, hit thing with sword, and shoot thing with bow, then she will do poorly against a Level-1 intelligent Fae Queen. Consider:

Fae Queen: I control time in my domain. You are frozen in time until I say otherwise. I'll set off a bunch of explosives around you and unfreeze time just as they go off.

Ranger: You can't freeze time in your immediate area / I dodge the explosions / whatever other contrived reason allows me to survive this.

FQ: Okay, I turn invisible, fly up 1 mile, and control the weather to cause a blizzard that freezes you to death.

Ranger: I'm the Ranger. I'm transcendent at wilderness survival, so I'm immune to blizzards. Also, you're from Summer so blizzards aren't really your thing.

FQ: Fine. I drop an invisible rock on you.

Ranger: I have transcendent senses and dodge ability, so I sense it coming and dodge.

FQ: Okay, well, I control the terrain in my territory and/or can generate blast-furnace levels of heat at will, so I turn a 1-mile radius around you into lava.

Ranger: Well, crap.
