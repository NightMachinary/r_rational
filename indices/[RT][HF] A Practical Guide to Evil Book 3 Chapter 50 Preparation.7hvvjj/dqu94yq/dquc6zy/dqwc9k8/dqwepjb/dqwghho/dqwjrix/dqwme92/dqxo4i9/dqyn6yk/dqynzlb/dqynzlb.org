Breadth of options are literally mechanical. As such, those perceived limitations on part of Ranger have no hold in this story. If the story says she can do it, she can do it.

It may not jive with your sense of what's possible, but it's clearly possible from the view of the author and the story. Whether or not it's jumping the shark is up to you.

The same "contrived reason" that allows Ranger to break a time stop is the same "contrived reason" why she'd be able to ignore the effects of a 1-mile lava pit.
