I've noticed that the more complex the speculation, the less complex the end result, and vice versa.

It would be entertaining to see if Creation and Arcadia were moving in tandem in this instance such that Winter (New Evil that's tired of the old patterns) and Summer (New Good that is trying to play the old pattern) align to take down Akua (the last remaining bastion of the old pattern).

EE has stated that Arcadia merely shadows creation, but I don't see what other event would correspond well enough to the highly influential change that just occurred to the faerie realms.

Again, just like the speculation on Ranger dying, this may not go anywhere. Would be fun, though.
