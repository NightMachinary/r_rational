I am frankly not sure how The Narrative would deal with a group of two heroes and three villains. Heroes get heroic boosts for being outnumbered, but villains don't? If they were in a tower that exploded, would only Archer and Thief survive because there was no way for them to survive, thus giving them a heroic trope insuring their survival, but villains in a party don't get that trope?

It has already been estabilished that you can't hijack /all/ heroic tropes as a villain-Cat got her ass handed to her by the demon in her soul, while a Hero would have been fine. So it's up in the air if that's what would happen. That being said, that episode while fighting summer fey where they all acted as a unit seems to imply their effectiveness is multiplied when acting together, so staying together may very well be the optimal move.
