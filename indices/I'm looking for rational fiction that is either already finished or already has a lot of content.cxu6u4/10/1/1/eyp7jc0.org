  The Arithmancer, which fully explores a magic system much closer to HP canon (or at least closer to typical fanon), involves a very reasonably-motivated Hermoine (most of the others are left unchanged) and is overall an incredibly satisfying read. She combines science and magic in a way that is much more reasonable than HPMOR, and her new innovations come at a much more believable rate.

Ehhhhh, the Arithmancer is okay, the sequel is just godawful Mary-Sue claptrap with a contrived plot. Honestly with how "competent" the main character is compared to the DE the war should be over within a few chapters, but she just sticks to bad tactics and it goes on as a result.
