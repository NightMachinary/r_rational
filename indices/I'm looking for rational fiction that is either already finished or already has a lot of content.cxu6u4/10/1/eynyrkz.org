Having recently been in your exact situation (looking for something nice and logical to read following HPMOR and Worm), I can tell you what I found that kind of scratches that itch:

Worm, probably second after HPMOR as the archetypical Rational fic, which has reasonably-motivated characters, very well-thought out world dynamics, and a really brilliant power system, with people who fully use their powers.

MoL, which, while it doesn't have quite as hard of a magic system as HPMOR, is still quite logical and the characters each have their own motivations, and stick to those motivations, that ultimately makes it a very satisfying read.

The Arithmancer, which fully explores a magic system much closer to HP canon (or at least closer to typical fanon), involves a very reasonably-motivated Hermoine (most of the others are left unchanged) and is overall an incredibly satisfying read. She combines science and magic in a way that is much more reasonable than HPMOR, and her new innovations come at a much more believable rate.

By the same author, the Accidental Animagus is also quite good. While it doesn't explore the magic system nearly as much, it works out fine. It's much more character driven, and both Hermione and Harry (who serve as our primary POV) are prepared, reasonable, clever, and way less willing to go along with things “just because.”

The Practical Guide to Evil is also top-notch. It examines a world where “hero” and “villain” are actual, measurable qualities, and protagonists and antagonists are actually just far better at fighting than regular people. Stories can be weaponized, our protagonist is fed up with how the good guys have the deck stacked in their favor so much, and Dread Emperor Irritant (the oddly successful) is one of the best historical figures ever.

Lastly, there's the Metaworld Chronicles. While nowhere near the quality of the others I listed (especially at the start), it still becomes a fairly good read in time. It only passed muster as ‘rational' in my mind thanks to the main character, who actually acts based on logic rather than emotion, but it does become a fairly engaging read with time.
