Its one of the most detailed & immersive world building i've ever read. Each of the characters has a back story, defined motivation for doing whatever they're doing, each location has a back story, there's history of over thousands of years, its so detailed that events of one night spanned over 100+ standard ~3000 words chapters! On top of that, its more thoroughly focused on philosophy, governance, politics with intense twists and turns of events. I was quite pleasantly surprised to find such a gem, and at the lack of following considering how intricate, rational and philosophical this novel is.
