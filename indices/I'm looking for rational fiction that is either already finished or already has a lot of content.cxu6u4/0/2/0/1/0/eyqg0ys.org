The characters make sensible decisions, no one grabs the idiot ball, the characters are driven by logical, rational reasons and not because the plot says so. It's not as rational as, say, HPMOR, but not every story needs to be. Maybe it isn't your cup of tea, but it is widely considered one of the best online works of fiction ever created, and I'm inclined to agree.
