Thats really just a way for the author to handwave away all of these issues. However lets say I give that to you.

What worm then ignores, is the huge impact that non-powered people would have a huge effect on the lifestyle of a powered person.

It makes anyone not powered useless-which couldn't be further from the truth. Every major government would realistically create kill squads consisting of ordinary humans to kill ANY powered threat. Every democracy would have debates on the roles of powered in society, every authoritative state would try to control as many powered as possible- through any means necessary.

Lastly, all of the worlds most powerful powered would never be in America. India and China would be the real powerhouses with: a more dangerous lifestyle, more people. And that would have great repercussions on the world.

Seems like the entities are american too. How shocking, and unique.
