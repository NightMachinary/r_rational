The whole idea of superhero's and super villains makes no sense.

People with powers aren't gonna wear tight clothes and fight crime at night. People with powers aren't gonna join a gang and run heists for a measly 40k.

No realistically, they'll live as ordinary citizens-joining the military, security firms, various corporations, brand ambassadors etc. Governments will pay millions for supers to become their citizens because an abundance of supers is an insane level of increase in a countries military preparation.

Ie, Eidolon becomes an Iranian citizens-> Iran now has one of the worlds strongest militaries.

Aka, they'll live an exceptional life- the most privileged and powerful people on the planet.

And those people do not roll around in the dirt like gangsters, like supervillains AND superhero's

Therefore, worm makes no sense as it is entirely based around supershero's and supervillains.
