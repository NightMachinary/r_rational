It's not to everyone's taste, and it's far from finished, but With This Ring definitely has a lot of content (over 2.5 million words and counting).

Compared to HPMoR or MoL, it's not especially rational. Compared to the source material, though - comics and animated series - it's highly rational. The author puts a lot of effort into having the universe (or multiverse) make sense within the constraints of comic book logic.

Typical pitfalls are the slow pace - updating daily, but often providing more detail rather than moving the plot forward quickly - and concerns that the protagonist is not properly challenged, though opinions on that are quite divided. Strengths include the carefully considered and detailed plot, humor, and author involvement; as well as updating the story every day, he's active in the associated discussion thread and fixes any reported typos in under a day.
