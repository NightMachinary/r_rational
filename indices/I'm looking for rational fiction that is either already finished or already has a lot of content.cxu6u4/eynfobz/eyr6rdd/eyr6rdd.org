Luminosity is a rationalization of Twilight, Radiance is a sequel from another character's perspective, and Flashes is an anthology of vignettes set throughout both books.

I accidentally read Flashes first, so some of the drama of the novels was spoiled, but from what I've heard others say who never finished Luminosity, I guess it kept me hooked long enough for it to get good.
