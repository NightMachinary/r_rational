Came to say exactly these three. At this point, I honestly like the Arithmancer a bit more than HPMOR (heresy, I know). It stays closer to canon, people are a bit more realistic in their capabilities, and the magic system is more universally explored, beyond just a few spells that are explained.

Worm is probably the second king of Rational stories, and is incredibly well-written. It explores what a world that actually has superheroes/villains as a sizable minority of the population would actually be like. Warning: it's fairly depressing.

Lastly, a PGtE is the most unique of the three. While not yet completed, it still is incredibly long, absolutely hilarious, and has some really fascinating world building. It's set in a fantasy world where being a protagonist or main villain is a measurable quantity, and tropes and story beats are both predictable and can even be weaponized by those who know what they're doing.

I would personally rank the Arithmancer as a 10/10, Worm as a 9/10 (it's just a tad depressing for me), and a PGTE as 10/10. For reference, HPMOR is probably a 9/10 and MoL is 8.5/10
