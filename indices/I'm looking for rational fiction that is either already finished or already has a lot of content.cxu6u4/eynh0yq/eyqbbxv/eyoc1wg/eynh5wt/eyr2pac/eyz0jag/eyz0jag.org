Wait, you're saying there was a plot outside the Uriel bits? O.O (Joking, but not very--in my memory the other characters' largely-ineffectual squabbles and confusions fade into noise next to the awesomeness that is everything Uriel. A bit as though you had an HPMOR Harry in your story occasionally, but the story itself was ostensibly about Stanley Shunpike's daily ups and downs.)
