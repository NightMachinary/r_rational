Worth the Candle is the obvious choice. It has a ton of content and is written by an author that is very well regarded here.

I'm greatly fond of Metropolitan Man, also by Wales. Rational Lex Luthor.

Sticking with Lex, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5536346/1/Inviolate][Inviolate]] is another good read.

The Erogamer is coming along quite nicely. While I wouldn't say it is nearly finished it does have a lot of content.

Unsong isn't really rational/rationalist but it is definitely rationalist-adjacent.

Also rationalist-adjacent, Worm captures the general sentiment of having a protagonist that coldly considers her options at each point and a lot of the story takes place in her head as she tries to plan out how to respond to her rather crazy circumstances. The narrator is er.. a bit unreliable, which adds another layer to parsing the story.
