It's easy to forget that we're looking from Hermoine's perspective, who by her own admission doesn't feel that it was that great of an accomplishment, just clever use of tactics that Harry even came up with. From the Order's perspective, they just hear that Hermione managed to take out three hundred unstoppable death machines single-handedly. They didn't know what she did, only that it was something that should have been impossible. Sort of like with Voldemort's flight, it's only impressive if you don't know how it's done.
