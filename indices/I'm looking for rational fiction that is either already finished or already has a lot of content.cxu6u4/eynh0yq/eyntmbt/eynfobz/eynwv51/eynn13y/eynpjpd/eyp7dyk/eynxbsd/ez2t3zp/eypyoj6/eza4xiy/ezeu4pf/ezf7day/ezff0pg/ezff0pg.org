I think it picks up in the 30s. When all the crazy stuff starts happening in the second year Hermione responds to it in her own way and tries to find solutions (including contemplating a transfer to Beauxbatons in France, because who wants to keep going to a crazy-dangerous school with apparently incompetent staff?). If I'm remembering right, that's also when she starts to get mixed up in the house elf plot line and starts making some discoveries about Hogwards.

It reads like a slice of life story from a rational student caught up in crazy happenings at wizard school rather than an adventure story. She really just wants to learn math, learn magic, be with her friends, and keep safe. I happen to like slice of life writing, but it does get slow in places...

It is possible to have a significant departure from cannon in the first year, but it requires significantly changing the characters and circumstances. Arithmancer tries to play it straight with the only change being Hermione as a math prodigy and fleshing out the field of arithmancy. Stories like HPMOR give /everyone/ the benefit of competence and rational pursuit of their goals and the story changes radically as a result. Can you recommend some fanfics where the first year was significantly different from the novels?
