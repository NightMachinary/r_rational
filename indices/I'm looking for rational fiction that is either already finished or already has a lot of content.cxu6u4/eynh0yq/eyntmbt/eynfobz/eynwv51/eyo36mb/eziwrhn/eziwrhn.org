So I'm like 7 chapters in and I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around the main character's thought process and train.

The style of the writing makes me feel like I have to shake my head to clear it. Of which I actually did and it didn't help.

I like the premise a lot but as someone who doesn't remember/know much about the bible and not particularly giving a shit about the Abrahamic religions, means I'm having a hard time getting into it. I also feel all the verses are overcrowding the rest of the story. I understand the why they are written and discussed between the characters but it's hard to not gloss over it when there is more than a paragraph or two.
