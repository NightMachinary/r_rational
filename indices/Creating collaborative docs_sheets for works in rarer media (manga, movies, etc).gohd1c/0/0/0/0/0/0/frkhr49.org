It's excellent! Is the syntax the same as Excel? I should invest some time in learning it, and I don't know what to search for. Can you separate anime/manga tags? They are very different media. It might be a good idea to have separate scores for different domains of each entry. An extreme example is how Royalroad does it, but I think adding at least a Rationality Score and Overall Score is better than having a single number. I was adding items now, and I noticed I was conflicted in what scores to give. To fill them, I imagine asking some veterans can help?:)) Though as long as the mods include it in the weekly rec threads, it will get filled in time.
