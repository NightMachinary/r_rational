  Is the syntax the same as Excel?
#+end_quote

No idea, honestly: I've only ever worked with Sheets!

#+begin_quote
  Can you separate anime/manga tags?
#+end_quote

Done.

#+begin_quote
  but I think adding at least a Rationality Score and Overall Score is better than having a single number.
#+end_quote

This would require a lot of changes, to be honest. The template (Name, Review, Score) had to be added manually each time, so this would require both changing the formulas and redoing the structure. I think at this point it's easier to just write your overall opinion and explain if it's rational(ist) in reviews.
