Well I can't imagine a character consistent version of the Shino we saw, who was shown to care so much about the 'greater good of the whole' and all that Aburame jazz, actually killing another Konoha ninja. That would be, in his eyes, like a drone killing another drone; maybe it would feel good personally, but I think killing another Konoha ninja (damaging the greater whole he belongs to), clashes to too strongly with his ethics to be considered.

And so long as the story sticks with this (maybe there are consequences for all the Aburame having such a point of view), I think it could still be rational.
