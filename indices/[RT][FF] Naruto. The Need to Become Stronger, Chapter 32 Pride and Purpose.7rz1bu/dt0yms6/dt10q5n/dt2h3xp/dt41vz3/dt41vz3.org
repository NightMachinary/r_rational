No no, Shino is not an unreliable narrator - I meant that the scene is not written from his perspective, so you can't tell what he's thinking. This is a fight scene written from the perspective of a spectator, unlike previous fights, and so I meant to realistically show that just like in any other spectator sport, you're not going to know what is going on in the participant's heads.

But, it is entirely possible I should still have foreshadowed that the fight would end like this, and I might still end up adding a line about how shino's insects are nearly all dead at this point to make it less confusing for the reader.
