I CAN understand the not killing Neji part. I cant understand the forfeiting the match part. Shino had every advantage over Neji and had only been shown to take one hit, while Neji only scraped by in not dying against superior tactics. The author replied below saying Shino was an unreliable narrator but we had no examples of that previous to this chapter to indicate such. Therefore as I was reading I was forced to take things at face value. With the story presented as is, the only logical conclusion was that Shino should have won. To randomly say he was an unreliable narrator and not provide reasons or clues as to why immediately rips this out of rationalist fiction.

This is all presuming my basis of understanding rstionalist fiction as "a story in which, using all evidence provided, gices you the chance of figuring out how it (or a scene) is going to end.
