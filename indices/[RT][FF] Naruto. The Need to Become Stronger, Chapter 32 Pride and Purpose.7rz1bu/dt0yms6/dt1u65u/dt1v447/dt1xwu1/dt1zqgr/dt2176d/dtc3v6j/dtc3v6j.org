This is a few days late, but I read it as Shino already having shown the qualities to be promoted to Chunin, and didn't care about the pride aspect of winning the tournament, so he decided to forfeit so that he wouldn't risk fighting a much stronger opponent. Neji is wounded, and could very well die, but Shino doesn't care.

I think the problem with your objective of showing that we should second guess what we're seeing is that we don't actually get confirmation of why Shino did what he did. It's one thing to make it look like Shino was winning but was actually burning resources in an unsustainable way. However, we don't get shown that explicitly. Shino lost bugs, but we don't know precisely how many, and insects can multiply quickly. He doesn't seem to have used much chakra. So as it is, he basically gave a short speech and forfeited for cryptic reasons.
