Ah, but the fight between Sasuke and Temari was written from his perspective, so that could never have happened. What can and what did happen however is that Temari shields her fan with her own body because it's precious to her - that was foreshadowed a tiny bit with her comments from earlier, but the reader could not actually have known that would happen.

And I don't think that's necessarily a problem. /Some/ things should be predictable, certainly, like all the major plot elements of the story. But I also think that any rationalist story should have surprises, because it's simply not realistic for everything to happen exactly the way you suspect. Otherwise you get fake, Sherlock Holmes type rationality, where the characters can perfectly predict everything because they live in a world without fundamental uncertainty. That teaches the wrong lesson, I think, and that's what I wanted to avoid.
