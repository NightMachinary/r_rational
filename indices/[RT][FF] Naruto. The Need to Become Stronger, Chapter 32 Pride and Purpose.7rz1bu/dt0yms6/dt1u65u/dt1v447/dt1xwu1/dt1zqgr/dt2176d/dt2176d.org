Hm, okay, I get what you mean. I think this is the same issue that people have with Naruto not being 'rational' enough: By any objective measure he's really smart, but the narrative doesn't always make the reader feel that way. Similarly, in Shino's fight he was rapidly running out of resources, but the narrative made him seem dominant up until that point, so I guess it feels weird.

Maybe this was a mistake on my part, but I actually made the deliberate decision to make the narrative unreliable in that regard: To show the reader that they should mistrust their own feelings by having events turn out differently from how it feels they ought to - just like in real life. After all, it's only in stories that you can exactly tell why things happen the way they do. But maybe it's actually just jarring and feels off, at least to some readers.
