I'm sorry but it didn't feel like there was any chance of Shino even getting remotely injured while fighting Neji. If you meant to show that I did not see it. You only have one instance of Shino being hit by Neji, and that's when he's using his ultimate defensive technique.

Furthermore

  The beetle flew at Neji, dipping and straining under the weight of its burden, yet drawing ever closer nonetheless. Neji tore at his bonds with increasing desperation, shouting, screaming as his death approached ever faster until at last he tore one bleeding arm free and thrust his palm towards the insect. There was an eruption of air as an invisible force struck the beetle right as the explosion went off, scattering dead insects and broken wire in every direction. Neji was left standing in the debris, his breathing ragged and his eyes frantic as he searched for his enemy.

  “We each must have our purpose,” Shino concluded, as he gathered up his weapons and sheathed them within his robes. “If we lose the one given to us, we must discover ourselves anew. However, you are correct on one count: The way you are now, your life is indeed worth less to me than even a single one of my insects.” He turned to face the examiner. “I forfeit the match.”

Shino doesnt seem wounded, tired, or even fazed by his opponent. While just a paragraph earlier you had Neji and the reader absolutely on edge thinking Neji was going to die. It's just such a sudden reversal with no agency on Neji's part. He does nothing except barely manage to not get blown up and he wins? That doesnt make sense. That's just plot force working for Neji.

I really do enjoy this story quite a bit but that was just incredibly jarring compared to all of the other fights you've had us seen. It's like you completely switched writing styles for the last paragraph.
