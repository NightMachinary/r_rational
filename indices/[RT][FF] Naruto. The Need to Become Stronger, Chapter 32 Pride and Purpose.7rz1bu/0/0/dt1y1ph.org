Your observation is correct! If you check back on e.g. Sasuke's fight with Temari, you'll see that the world 'slows down around him' whenever he flares his chakra. This is in fact the result of chakra enhancing his senses and speed of thought.

However, what Asuma observes in Shikamaru is A) way beyond that, and B) he doesn't appear to be flaring his chakra to do it. But your thinking is definitely on the right track :)
