I find myself liking this version of Naruto more and more; if the Nara actually do have a super duper thinking technique (maybe some kind of Yin chakra manipulation?) it would be perhaps the most badass characterization of the clan ever to be seen in fanfiction. And it would make the whole Ino-Shika-Cho combo even more powerful. Even if the Nara would have to be stationary to use their technique, it wouldn't matter; the Yamanaka could just read their minds and relay to their allies and victory would practically be assured.

Though I always wondered; isn't super fast thinking an ability all ninja would have to have? I mean, at least from what I remember from the anime, you simply cannot fight as fast as they do with reflexes alone; you gotta be percieving things slower as well. Maybe Asuma didn't think the Nara thingy is a technique because there actually is a technique that makes your brain run faster, but it doesn't make you any smarter?
