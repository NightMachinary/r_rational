Did he? He already lost a huge chunk of his insects to Neji's rotation. Neji had just shown that he could escape Shino's wire/explosive trick, AND that he could defeat him in melee despite Shino's reach advantage.

Now, it's entirely possible that Shino could still have pulled something out of his hat even if it killed all his bugs to do so, but I wanted to show that he is a true shinobi: Like Naruto said, he's the type of guy you have to actively remember exists. He's not going to take the chance of one of them getting seriously hurt just to stay in the limelight. So this is, in fact, Shino's own brand of rationality you're seeing.
