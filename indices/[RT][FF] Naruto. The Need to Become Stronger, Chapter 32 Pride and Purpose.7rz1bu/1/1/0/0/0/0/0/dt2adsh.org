There's a quote from a reviewer of an entirely different piece of media that I think is relevant here, though I'm paraphrasing: "The author of a story has an incredible amount of power, to determine what it is their reader experiences and feels. That power is contingent upon building a rapport and connection with the reader, and the reader trusting what they're given. Breaking that trust must be done sparingly, lest the rapport be broken entirely." Unreliable narrative might make readers mistrust their own feelings, but it also makes every other event far less emotionally impactful and reduces our ability to care about and even /follow/ the events of the book--it's one thing to have a /consistently/ inaccurate narrative i.e. based on one character's biases-that we can correct for. But something this jarring means that we can't e.g. follow the tactical paths of fights and basically have to wait til you tell us who wins. To take an extreme example, in the sasuke/temari fight, based on the paradigm established with Shino, Sasuke could well have randomly run out of chakra and lost the match with minimal warning. See the issue?
