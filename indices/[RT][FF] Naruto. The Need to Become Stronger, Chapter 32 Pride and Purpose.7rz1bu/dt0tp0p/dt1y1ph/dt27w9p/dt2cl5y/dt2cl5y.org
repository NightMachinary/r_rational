Good points, all of which I'm planning to address in a future chapter, since Naruto is certainly having these same thoughts.

The biggest part of the answer is that all ninja techniques have a mental component. Just as Naruto told Mizuki, he /can't/ actually learn e.g. the shadow clone technique because you need A) huge chakra reserves and B) you have to be able to mentally split your thoughts into two streams of consciousness to create the clone in the first place - something which is incredibly difficult to do.

The other part of the answer is the secrecy aspect: Basically, there are far fewer actual bloodline limits than people think, because people like Shikamaru lie their pants off about what they can do (he's probably not thankful to Naruto for just blurting the truth out like that), precisely to prevent people from figuring that stuff out.

So it's only the smartest people like Itachi who figure out stuff like explosion release and become incredibly strong as a result - and being ninjas, they don't share this realization with anybody else.
