I'm just wondering; if things like the Yakamana telepathy and Nara shadow stuf / potential speed thinking aren't bloodlines, then how do they maintain secrecy?

I mean, Ino can use her clan techniques, so she knows the necessary secrets. So wouldn't enemy shinobi make it a priority to capture young Yakamana like her? Because once they get the secret, they'll get it forever, won't they? Even if they eventually have to ransom her back, they'll have it.

Or do young clan members like Ino and Shikamaru, despite being able to use the abilities, not actually know how they work somehow? Is it more like the Aburame implanting bugs; something done to you when you're young that you have to spend your entire childhood learning to use, so that even if enemy shinobi learned how it wouldn't be like implanting a third arm; simply impossible to learn how to use effectively?

Because I just realized that if all these secret techniques aren't bloodlines or similarily restricted, then wouldn't Naruto could potentially end fighting a gigantic (Akimichi), super fast thinking shadow using (Nara), telepathic (Yakamana) Madara. Because Tsukuyomi (and genjutsu in general) really must be an incredibly affective away to torture bloodline secrets out of somebody.

Actually I wouldn't mind that. I can't imagine anything more awesome than a telepathic collective of giant Naruto's using their massive shadows and incredible planning abilities to take out entire armies XD.
