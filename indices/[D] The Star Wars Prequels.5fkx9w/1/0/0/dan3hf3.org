That would be an interesting way of reinterpretting the story, the Sith and jedi's actual main power is precognition, which is incredibly powerful against non force using enemies, but against eachother lead to a stalemate, (like in mistborn where because someone else is noticing your intentions changing the possibilities become fractal). So the whole war was actually Yoda and Palpatine playing precog chess.
