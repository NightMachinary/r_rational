I wouldn't mind it as much if the tone was more "wouldn't it have been great if the prequels were doing this cool thing" instead of "this is what the prequels were saying and no one understood it and they are actually really great".

Taking something that is bad and changing it to make it better is totally [[/r/rational]] material, but back arguing as to why it was actually great in the first place (which is how the tone of those blogs came off to me) is not. None of the posts I read made of the case of "if this one thing had been slightly changed, the tone woudl have been better and it could have conveyed this cool idea". It was all "no one realized it at the time, but the dialogue actually implied this totally deep and layered message".
