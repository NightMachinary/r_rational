So you're against all commentary on a literary work? That seems a little excessive. Some works just can't be read without approaching them critically. Read The Wasteland and try not to read anything into it. True, the blog linked above is pretty much just reading patterns in the clouds, but I wouldn't throw out the baby with the bath water.
