Of course I'm not against all commentary on literary work, just the idea from "the author is dead" school of thought that no work has inherent literary meaning (or at least, that the intended meaning isn't the only one) and instead is free for any interpretation that a particular critic wants to give it. Lots of literary and artistic works have very deep and nuanced meanings that are completely worthy of analysis and critique, but I think that those are all intended by the author. I am, however, completely agaisnt the "reading patterns in the clouds" analysis as you put it.
