It's exactly this kind of literary analysis that so annoys me. Like I said in my first post, that can be an interesting game to play, but it says almost nothing about the work itself and instead talks only about the person doing the analysis, so what work they are analyzing is really not important at all. This is obviously a personal opinion, and I won't try to claim that I am objectively right or anything, but that kind of analysis seems utterly pointless and a complete waste of time, both by the person performing it and the people reading it. Especially for such long and comprehensive works as a movie, let alont a movie trilogy. For something like a painting or a sculpture, I can concede the possibility that a work, regardless of the original intent of the creator, can come to represent a particular idea or ideology or something on it's own, and can do so in a cohesive, self contained way. But when you come to longer works like novels or movies that tell a complex story, trying to make themes and ideas that the author did not intend fit into the story in a broad, consistent way is a fool's errand. Sure, it is possible, as this blog author did, to take individual scenes or a few sets of scenes and string together some plausible social narrative. But, if you put those scenes and ideas into the broader context of the work, they simply don't make sense because they were not originally intended to have those meanings. To make these just-so stories work, you have to either ignore specific parts of the work that contridict your post-facto rationalization or else you have to make the ideas so broad that they can be made to fit nearly any story. I'm sure that anyone who was interested in the effort could string together parts of the prequal trilogies that can made to directly contradict every theme he talks about in his blog post.

In summary, the death of the author type analysis, especially when applied to larger, more complex artistic works, seems pointless to me and adds nothing to the original work, since you can turn nearly any large, complex work to mean anything you want with enough motivated reasoning.
