  "this is what the prequels were saying and no one understood it and they are actually really great"
#+end_quote

I assumed that this tone was because it was written with a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_of_the_Author][death of the author]] type of mentality. From the blog's perspective, it doesn't matter what George Lucas or any other writer or actor originally intended.

In fact, reading some of the blog posts, it seems like unless George Lucas was aware of his privileged white male status and yet willing to portray privilege without addressing it, a lot of the social commentary this blog reads into the prequels in order to appreciate them is not something Lucas would have thought of.

[[http://prequelsredeemed.blogspot.com/2014/11/these-arent-tricks-youre-looking-for.html][From the post about Jedi mind tricks:]]

  The “Jedi Mind Trick” is class intimidation. You be clever and confident at someone who has lower status than you, and your sheer willpower gets them to puppet your words. This is a thing in the real world.
#+end_quote

This is a clever deconstruction of the Jedi Mind Trick as seen on screen. I am sure quotes from Lucas, the novelizations, and the Expanded Universe all contradict this interpretation, but again, death of the author means the critique can restrict itself to just the films. The blog post recognizes that Lucas may not be aware of this message.

#+begin_quote
  What if he did not? This recurrence would then mean that when presented with the tool of casual mind control, the primary way he sees to use it is “confident white men convincing relative aliens to parrot their words.” Which would be a reflection of the world Lucas was in, after all.

So I think you are just misreading the literary analysis style.

#+begin_quote
  "no one realized it at the time, but the dialogue actually implied this totally deep and layered message".
#+end_quote

Well yeah, but if Lucas didn't consciously intend the deep and layered message, and the analysis radically diverges from the intended message of Lucas, then in fact I would argue that the real nature of the analysis is closer to 'sightly changing one thing' in order to tell a better story. It's just with literary analysis writing, you are supposed to pretend your one slight change is actually in the source material the entire time, even if the original author isn't aware of it.
