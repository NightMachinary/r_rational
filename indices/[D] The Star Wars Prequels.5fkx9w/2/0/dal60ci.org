I only read the first few posts but that seems like the type of horrible over-analysis that made me despise highschool lit classes. You can overthink your way into imagining that any particular piece of garbage has deeper levels and layers, but in reality, it's just garbage. I'm not one of the really bad haters of the prequals. I don't think they have the quality or cultural importance of the original trilogy, but they are still fun, effects driven blockbusters.

Trying to convince yourself that they are these deep social commentaries however is pretty wrong IMO. It can be a fun game to play (which I was forced to do during my high school exit exams) but doing so says more about the person playing the game than it does about the work being analyzed.
