I agree that you can overthink anything and that often the core material really may just be flat garbage... but that is one of [[/r/rational]]'s approaches isn't it? Analyze a work, find world-building flaws or inconsistencies, and the reconstruct them to make them make sense in-universe, and then tell a more rational story in the resulting universe. To that end, if you read the blog with a focus on posts where the author is constructing high quality fanon to harmonize the inconsistencies of the prequels, it is pretty solid [[/r/rational]] material, even though it is more literary type analysis than rational world building.

minor disclaimer: Just read a few posts, so not sure about all of it or which ones you read but from the initial sample I read it seems okay.
