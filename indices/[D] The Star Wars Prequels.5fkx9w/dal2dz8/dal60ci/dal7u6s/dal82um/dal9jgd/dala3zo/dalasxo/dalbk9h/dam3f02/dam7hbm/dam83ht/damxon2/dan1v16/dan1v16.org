  Bradbury, a man living in the creative and industrial center of reality TV and one-hour dramas, says it is, in fact, a story about how television destroys interest in reading literature.

  “Television gives you the dates of Napoleon, but not who he was,” Bradbury says, summarizing TV's content with a single word that he spits out as an epithet: “factoids.” He says this while sitting in a room dominated by a gigantic flat-panel television broadcasting the Fox News Channel, muted, factoids crawling across the bottom of the screen.

I think that it is probably silly to tell an author what message /he/ was trying to convey. But it is symmetrically silly to say to a reader that the implications of your writing are strictly those messages which were deliberately and consciously encoded at the time of writing.

For an interesting analysis of why literature critique sounds so samey (and hard to believe) you might check out this essay about essays. It is written by the guy who wrote the "hierarchy of disagreement" article that floats around online sometimes. Link: [[http://paulgraham.com/essay.html]]
