That's a legitimate view, but remember that an author's intentions aren't always self-evident (and, in fact, rarely are) and that the author herself might not know her own intentions. In fact, author's statements about or analysis of their own work are notoriously unreliable, for a variety of reasons. (Take Goethe's stance on The Sorrows of Young Werther many years later or George Lucas's statements about the original Star Wars as two of many examples.)

There was a group of scholars in bibliography (the academic study of books as objects and also of the methods for reconstructing corrupted works) that emphasized authorial intentionality above all. They made special editions of works they called "eclectic editions" because they chose from every available copy or manuscript the parts of the text that they thought best represented the author's intention. These were often excellent editions, but they also tended to claim that bibliography was a science and that intentionality could be pinned down. They didn't acknowledge that these editions they created often said as much about themselves as they did about the author and they didn't acknowledge the place of the greater society in creating a literary work, that the author draws on many influences (conscious or unconscious), not just some well of genius. Eventually it was clear how unsupportable this approach was, and the reaction against it was something of a shame because of the actually really exemplary scholarship that this group did.

I didn't like Barthes' Death of the Author when I first read it, either, but he's really reacting against the tyranny of the author's reputation. With some authors, like Joyce, it's almost impossible to read the text without having your reading overly colored by the previous reception and his reputation. The immovability of these reputations is kind of a pain, some some (like Pierre Bayard) have suggested that it's almost pointless to read a text under these circumstances since the author's fixed position is so unmovable. Barthes pushes back against that in a mostly productive way, I think.
