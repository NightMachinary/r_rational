  But, if you put those scenes and ideas into the broader context of the work, they simply don't make sense because they were not originally intended to have those meanings.

What is the broader context?

#+begin_quote
  To make these just-so stories work, you have to either ignore specific parts of the work that contridict your post-facto rationalization or else you have to make the ideas so broad that they can be made to fit nearly any story.
#+end_quote

What specific parts have been ignored?

#+begin_quote
  I'm sure that anyone who was interested in the effort could string together parts of the prequal trilogies that can made to directly contradict every theme he talks about in his blog post.
#+end_quote

Cool! I'd like to see you do one of those.

  In summary, the death of the author type analysis, especially when applied to larger, more complex artistic works, seems pointless to me and adds nothing to the original work, since you can turn nearly any large, complex work to mean anything you want with enough motivated reasoning.

People keep throwing around "death of the author" a lot, even though Lucas is quoted several times. The problem is more that any other statement "by" the author (an interview, a speech before congress, a [[http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/starwars/images/7/79/Kelly_and_George.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20070902054422][t shirt worn on set]] ) is itself a piece of art that has to be interpreted. You can probably arrive at a reasonable conclusion about what the author believes and what ideological world they live in - but only /after/ doing the work of interpreting all their statements, including the piece of art they put 20 plus years in.
