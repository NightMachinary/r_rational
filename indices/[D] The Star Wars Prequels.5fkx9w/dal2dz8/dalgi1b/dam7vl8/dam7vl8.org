Thanks for linking that, it's a different take on literary criticism than I have heard before. I disagree on a few small things. He seems to think that there are only two types/purposes for criticism: understanding general story structure and criticism as a meta-artform. I think that there is a third use for literary criticims: understanding the themes and ideas of a specific story and how they fit in the social context of the time they were written. This is something that, like the TVTropes type, can be (IMO) factually correct, yet does not have any greater description for stories other than the one being described, and is not some kind of meta-artform. It's closer to art history really.

When it comes to the meta-art, author is dead type of criticism, I guess all I can say is that it is not for me. Which is fine. Lots of art isn't for me.
