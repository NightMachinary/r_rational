I believe they were headed for war anyway.

The Republic was in decline, their government ineffective at crisis and management, even without the Trade Federation blockading Palpatine's home planet of Naboo. They had no galactic fighting force, which some could say was a good thing, relying on Jedi peacekeepers and probably system-level and region-level military forces. They had peace, but it turned out to be fragile, with many systems joining the civil war led by Count Dooku, a former Jedi who had formidable willpower and influence even without Darth Sidious' hand on his back. War is about control of resources and money, even when ideology and religion play a part.

As for the Skywalker line, Shmi may or may not have had children by natural means without Plageus and Sidious' life-manipulation mysticism. If she had, they may have been gifted in the Force, though not to the extent that Anakin was. The Jedi may even have picked her offspring as Jedi padawans.

There is no denying human nature, though. There were dark wizards before Voldemort, and there will be more after. The same is true of the Sith.
