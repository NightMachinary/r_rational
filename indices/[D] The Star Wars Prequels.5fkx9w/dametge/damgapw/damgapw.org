Every single plot thread was initiated by Palpatine.

The Jedi Council was completely paralyzed because their pre-cognitive abilities were inhibited (Yoda said something about the Dark Side clouding their vision, which is probably due to Palpatine's own precog powers interfering).

Other actors were The Trade Federation, who it turns out were propped up by Palpatine, and Anakin Skywalker who would have remained a slave because the Jedi would have no reason to visit his planet.

So the Universe would mostly go nowhere, unless there was an outside threat between episodes 3 and 4 that The Emperor dealt with off-screen.
