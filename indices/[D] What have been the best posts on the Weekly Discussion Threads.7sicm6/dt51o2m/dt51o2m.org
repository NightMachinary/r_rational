Personally, my favourites are the long discussions me and [[/u/ccc_037]] often end up in when I post in the worldbuilding thread. His input and encouragement was instrumental in me deciding to spend 2017 writing up a first draft of the first volume of my vampire romance novel, and I'm hoping to polish it off this year (I have a coauthor who is vital to the process but is unable to devote the time I do, so no guarantees). I am not exaggerating at all when I say that without him, the novel would never have happened. So, thanks!

And I guess, more generally, I love the community the threads have built; whether it's trading ideas with [[/u/callmesalticidae]] or giving dating tips to [[/u/couteaubleu]] (how did that date go btw!?), there's always something interesting to read about.
