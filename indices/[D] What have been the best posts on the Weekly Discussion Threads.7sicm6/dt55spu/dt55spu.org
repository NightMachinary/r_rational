Eeee, I'm getting best-off quoted!

Alright, it just happens that I went through my posts and made a best off list a few weeks ago. Didn't expect to be reading it so soon. Most of these posts are mine, since I was going through my own history:

- [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7k08ef/d_friday_offtopic_thread/drairu1/][My rant on Net Neutrality]], and [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7lhyo4/d_friday_offtopic_thread/drmlngl/][more comments on Net Neutrality]].

- [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7j2qas/d_monday_general_rationality_thread/dr3l557/][Something about a cool Free Thinking course]]? I dunno, didn't check it out yet.

- [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7j2qas/d_monday_general_rationality_thread/dr3mk8b/][One of trekie140's last US politics posts before the ban]]. To be honest, I wasn't a fan of these threads, both because I disagreed with him and because we were pretty much going in circles. But I think maybe someone trying to get a pulse for US politics could find it useful, anecdotally.

- [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7j2qas/d_monday_general_rationality_thread/dr43bxt/?context=3][Some interesting discussion about n+1 models]].

- [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7ifirq/d_friday_offtopic_thread/dqzny4a/?context=10][On trust, dating advice, and communication]]. This is something I'm still trying to figure it out at the moment.

- [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7fvr80/d_monday_general_rationality_thread/dqfm7en/][Incompressibility]]? Maybe? I think it's an interesting concept, that just begging for a label or a philosophy to be put on it.

- [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/70vl9f/d_monday_general_rationality_thread/dnaxpta/?context=3][On consequentialism]], and the people to weak too pursue it (I'm kidding; but it /would/ make for a pretty cool title for a SSC post).
