Personally, if there's no spark I don't bother. I had a date like that once; no spark, but we've been friends six years now and he's a good bloke, just not someone I'd date.

Another guy we had a long interesting conversation with no spark, and then I found out he was a conspiracy theorist and we ghosted each other afterwards.

Meanwhile my current partner of 5 years, our first date consisted of me completely fucking everything up, but there was a definite spark. It was meant to be coffee for an hour but we kept talking and it turned into dinner so what was meant to be a quick meeting to touch base ended up as a first date with him driving me home because the buses had stopped running for the evening.

So yeah... I'm not really sure what to say. My two hypotheses based on your information are 1) "it's just not meant to be" and 2) give it more time and see where it goes. I don't think it means that because you don't like one woman you date, that you're just in it for the chase!
