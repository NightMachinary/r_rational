Ah, okay! Good luck!

If I may offer another platitude, "you might not have found the right person yet".

I could go further into clicheland and say "when you know, you know" but when I started dating my husband I thought it was going to just be a fling over the summer and it's been ten years and he still puts up with me, sooo.... if you're having fun keep dating them, you never know what will happen! (damn, that was another cliche... are those cliches in French too? /On ne sait jamais que se passerait/?)
