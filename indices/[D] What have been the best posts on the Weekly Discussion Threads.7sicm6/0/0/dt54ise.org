  or giving dating tips to [[/u/couteaubleu]] (how did that date go btw!?),
#+end_quote

You know, I had a lot of "assumptions", like best case or worst case scenarios in mind, but it really didn't go the way I think.

I dunno, I'm still mulling it over. I'm not really feeling the spark. It was a little boring, but not /too/ boring. Like watching yet another Marvel movie: you appreciate the things, and you have some fun... buuuut... yeah.

Maybe I need more time (it's only been one date, and I was tired). Hypothesis 2: I really am looking for the thrill or the chase, or a problem to solve, or a challenge, I dunno.
