I don't think there's any official support for it, unfortunately. At best, you can take screenshots and then copy/paste the text into the image metadata so they're searchable. Actually, that might be an interesting programming project-- a browser extension like RES that inserts a "save offline" button onto each reddit comment that generates a simple text file consisting of the post source text and the username download, and then a simple independent reader to render those textfiles and perform basic text searches...
