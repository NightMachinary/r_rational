I'd stopped at the end of book 1, reasoning that it could only go downhill from there (I mean, how can you up a singularity?). Of course, after having done the meteor stunt, antimatter, and all the other infinity exploits, you didn't really have any other way to climax the story.

As a hint, you may want to tone down your book-2 disclaimer (where you say it'll be radically different), that's what made me say , "the end!".

Of course, I may continue reading it going forward.
