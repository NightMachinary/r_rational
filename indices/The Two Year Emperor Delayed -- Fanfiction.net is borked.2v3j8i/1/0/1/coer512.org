I found book one intriguing with the munchkinry problem solving. Honestly book two has failed to connect with me so far, and if not for book one I would not have continued reading. To me book one read like an action adventure and book two is more of a character drama, and that just isn't as much my cup of tea. Your writing is excellent in both though.
