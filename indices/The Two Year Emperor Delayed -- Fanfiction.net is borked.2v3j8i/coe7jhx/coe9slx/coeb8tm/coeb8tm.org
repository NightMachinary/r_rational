I'm worried about Suze. I wasn't so worried about Jake, because as dire as things seemed, I thought he could make it through. Suze, while she is (or at least was) a wonderful person, I'm not sure she's got what it takes to be Death.

Given the previous mentorship role, I'm a little surprised Suze hasn't asked Jake for help. But I guess part of it is that this is her show, not his now.
