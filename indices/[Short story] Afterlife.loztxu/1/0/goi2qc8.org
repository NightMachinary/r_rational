Hey, thank you so much for this feedback! I love your suggestion to show a vulnerable "human" side of Ben, instead of cutting right to a weird "time jump" after which Ben suddenly figures out an arbitrary option. I also feel like cutting out the whole part about "virtues and sins", since on second thought I don't think it fits the goal of the story that well. I'll definitely do a rewrite to see if I can salvage this story.

By the way, if you're willing to share, I'm curious you interpreted the final paragraph/sentence. :)
