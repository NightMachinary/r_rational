You do need to have more a transition from "OH MY GOSH! AHHH!" to "Here is my intellectually reasoned sustainable afterlife."\\
It feels like the start and end of a conversation without the middle. I'd recommend Ben consider and nearly choose some more idealised options, before ultimately deciding that is a trap that would simply lead him into the same self-destructive cycle of running from consequences he has been living up until now. Have him realise that right here, right now, is his last chance ti embrace responsability for his own mind, if he gives in to a shortcut here, the version of Ben that could ever rise above his failings will be forever gone.
