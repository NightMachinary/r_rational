You should read /Coraline/, by Neil Gaiman. It's a children's story, but immensely entertaining when I read it, and a good case study for an intelligent horror story. Coraline's parents are taken by a mysterious thing, and the police don't believe her when she tries to tell them, so she equips herself before venturing into the evil lair where her parents are held.
