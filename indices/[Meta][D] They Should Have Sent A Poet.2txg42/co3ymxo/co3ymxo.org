I thought that part of the Rationalist movement was to get away from "Character does something stupid because they're holding the stupid stick." In some ways it's a wish fulfillment, like much fanfiction. "If I were superman I would just . . .<rational thing x>".

It does make me wonder: Is it even possible to have a "rationalist" horror movie? At least, something beyond paper clippers or MLP AI? It seems like the vast majority of horror movies depend on the characters being complete idiots.

Rationalist Horror Movie:\\
"Let's go into that haunted house were people were killed horribly and someone recently disappeared!"\\
"That seems like a really bad idea, let's not."\\
<Heroes Walk Away>\\
The End.
