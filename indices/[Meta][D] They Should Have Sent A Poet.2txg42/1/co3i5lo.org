Firstly, someone did something I encouraged, so [[http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/68616/1545245-gendo005.jpg][this is my face now.]] But now, here comes the argument.

#+begin_quote
  Fullmetal Alchemist is not about solving problems through the power of family molecular bonds. Fullmetal Alchemist is about grief. It is about redemption. The most significant plot devices such as Philosopher's Stones or Human Transmutation have jack-all to do with real-world physics.

That's right. They /do/ have jack-all to do with real-world physics. And this is one of the reasons such works need some level of literary critique from a "scientific" or "rational" perspective: quite often, [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceWhaleAesop][an entire work has its themes and its /emotional foundation/ built on bloody quicksand]].

Fullmetal Alchemist is about grief and redemption for tragedies and mistakes that we either can fix today in real life, or will someday be able to fix in real life. Ok, that last bit is a /little/ too transhumanist of me: death still happens and is still, quite often, horrible. Thing is, though, reality doesn't have [[http://fma.wikia.com/wiki/Truth][some /guy/ standing there, calling himself God, acting all Anti-Spiral and /dishing out ironic punishments/ to people who "trespass on God's domain"]].

Likewise, there are series such as /Harry Potter/, where anyone remotely clever can "Munchkin" the available "magic" (plot devices) into doing far more emotional/thematic work than the original author intended for it to do.

In real life, both the limitations and benefits of /our/ Applied Phlebotinum come from the natural consequences of using the Phlebotinum. Pollute the air, get acid rain. Spend money frivolously, wind up broke. Invent usable nuclear fusion reactors, get an immense supply of cheap energy. Organize teams, hit deadlines. [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_Earth_Catalog]["We are as gods and might as well get good at it."]]

It is the job of stories to tell us something, sideways and metaphorically, about our own actual lives. Anyone who examines the sociological effects of fundamentalist religion can tell about the danger of stories that "explain" why the world must always stay the same!

Anyway, I'm going to stop here before I start lovingly citing /Gurren Lagann/ and explaining about how we may need an entire subgenre of rationalfic for the purpose of explaining to the reader /just how much fucking potential we can squeeze out of a tiny bit of Phlebotinum/. Pretend that I've said something about [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalist_realism#Mark_Fisher]["capitalist realism"]] and the raw /power/ of being able to imagine how the world might be different than it currently is. Let me gesture at FMA and the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalanceBetweenGoodAndEvil][Balance of Good and Evil]] to show that yes, there are a great many stories that dedicate themselves to tying human potential down on a table, and to convincing the denizens of underground villages that there truly is no Surface above, and that all they will /ever/ have is rock over their heads. Have I mentioned I hate Gen Urobuchi?

Well, that attempt to stop totally failed. No longer sure what the point was.

#+begin_quote
  That is what rational fiction is about (to me anyway). Looking past Good and Evil and saying: What is the Real Problem here? What, when you get down to it, is causing all of this trouble?
#+end_quote

Secondary question: /is there/ any trouble, really, when you think about it from the perspective of real life?
