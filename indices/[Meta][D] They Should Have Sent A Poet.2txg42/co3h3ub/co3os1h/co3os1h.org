Lies. FMA is clearly an early modern world; there are guns and phones and cars and such. Tech level looks to be early 20th century, with the exception of some really awesome things like Automail (which are more advanced, not less!).

Delving into more complicated chemistry wouldn't be unreasonable. It's not necessary to the plot, certainly, but it would certainly fit the background of the world-as-presented.
