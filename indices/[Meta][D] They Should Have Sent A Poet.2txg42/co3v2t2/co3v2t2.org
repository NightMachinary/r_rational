  How much has Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres learned about magic since the start of HPMOR? Not that much.

/But/, he does use what he does know intelligently.

Rational fanfic isn't "scientify-the-original", but it /is/ "insert common sense and maybe even intellect into the character". It's not /just/ about being a better poet than the original author.

So, a rational Alchemist might not know chemistry, but what do we do about the niggling feeling in our head that the alchemists could make philosopher's stones out of the near-dying, the ability to bind souls to objects, body swap, create empty bodies, etc makes immortality really easy, why are there still poor farmers when irrigation is magically trivial, why do more people not open the Gate of Truth for the sake of catching answers to things despite the moral hazard, and /why is Ed so obsessed with getting his arm and leg back/ anyhow?

And by the end, we need to figure out what this "subjective value" of equivalent exchange is, and why no one has figured that out all this time. It's not about holes in the chemistry being replaced with /true/ chemistry so much as it is holes in the /construction of the world/ being replaced /somehow/.

(I don't know the FMA canon that well, so it's possible this is all addressed)

Even in HPMOR... shouldn't we be /more concerned/ that the time turner seems to be creating instances of sentient Harry's which exist outside of time? That time turners can basically influence events however they like, by choosing their favorite self-consistent scenario?
