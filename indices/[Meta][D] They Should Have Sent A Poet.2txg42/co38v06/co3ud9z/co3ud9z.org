  Harry Potter explores the theme of following authority being a great way to achieve success.
#+end_quote

Canon does insist that one follow the /right/ authorities though. There are plenty of wrong authorities that attempt to assert upon Harry, and he does not follow them.

So I'd say the canonical lesson is less about authority and more about commitment to being good, which includes obeying good authorities and not obeying bad ones. And then HPMOR goes further - commitment to being good /and smart/, which sometimes means ignoring both evil and stupid-but-well-intentioned authority while following the good and wise authority, which might sometimes be your personal self.
