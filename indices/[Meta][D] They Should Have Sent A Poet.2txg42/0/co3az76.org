I agree, for the most part. I think that where rational fic shines best is when it's playing some variation on the themes of the original, or making callbacks to the plot that was. Where some people go wrong (or go in a direction that I tend not to like) is when there's just a sequence of cool things that have been strung together. I don't think that every story needs to have a thesis statement, but a good author should at least be trying to make some comment on /something/ instead of just letting characters run amok. The books I like best are the ones that have been distilled down into the expression of a single big thought, or a cluster of related ones.
