[[/u/eaglejarl]] is writing a rationalist horror story called [[https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/213223018/pay-attention][/Pay Attention/]]. I haven't read it yet, since he's not done editing it, but his prior work /Baby Blues/ qualifies as rational horror for me. If there's ever a movie made out of it, then I suppose it qualifies.

Do we have anyone willing to make the stories into movies on this subreddit?
