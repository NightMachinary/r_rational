I'm sorry if I was unclear. I wasn't accusing the writers of pulling things out of their ass at all. I was just trying to communicate that if the only difference between your rational rewrite and the original is that yours contains excerpts from a chemistry textbook, /don't bother/.

I mean, of course you can if you really want to, but you won't make much of a difference to anything besides the combat.
