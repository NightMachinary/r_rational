It might help consistency, and suspension of disbelief. (Depending on how well it was done in the first place, and how well the new version worked.) It could also, potentially, serve the characterization.

But WRT the fights ... it depends what you /let/ it effect, right? If they never used that added chemistry knowledge during a fight, but to (say) keep a teammate warm, then the only effect would be to add a little characterization - it wouldn't change the fights at all.

I suppose it ultimately depends on your priorities, as well as your skill. So that is a good point; maybe we're not focussing enough on some aspects of storytelling.

But to be clear - I'm not saying you accused rationalists of pulling stuff out of their ass. I'm saying that /non/-rationalist writing, not thinking out those details in favour of more "important" things, risks creating ass-pulls.
