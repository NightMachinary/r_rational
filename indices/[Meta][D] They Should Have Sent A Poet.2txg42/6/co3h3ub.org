I just finished watching /Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood/, and I have to disagree with you there.

Yes, part of it is about grief and family. But you can tell stories about grief and family just as easily in the real world. Fullmetal Alchemist (or Brotherhood, at least) is about grief and family /in the context/ of magical science-sorcery and international politics. It's not just about the grief of losing people and how we cope with that; its also about being offered an opportunity to /bring people back/.

Which is something that never happens in real life. That's /why/ the story is fantasy/science-fiction.

It is /not/ set in a fantastical world so that the writers can pull some magic out of their ass to make the plot go in the direction of Real Issues". That is /bad writing/, and the show does actually do that in a few episodes, and it was extremely jarring.

That isn't "missing the point of the story". Worldbuilding is /also a part of storytelling/. That doesn't mean its the only element of a story that matters! But dismissing it entirely, to run on "Rule Of Cool", will result in less emotional engagement from your readers.

In the case of injecting "real chemistry" into the fight scenes ... well, it isn't strictly necessary; this is a medievalesque world and you can keep things simple. But it can also serve to show that the characters are experts in their field who have put thought into this, by drawing on a real field of expertise. (Or, hey, it could serve as a vehicle for Interesting Chemistry Facts. Why not? People like exploring interesting topics.)
