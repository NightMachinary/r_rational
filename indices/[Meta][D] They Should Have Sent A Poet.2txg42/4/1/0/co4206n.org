Dolores is a overtly bad authority because she tries to torture and tries to kill Harry. It teaches the lesson "Don't obey authorities if they literally attempt to murder you for trivial reasons beforehand" but not really a clear lesson about good and evil.

Plus Dumbledore is hardly especially good. He often lies to and manipulates Harry. For example at the start of the first book where he deliberately lies and says that Snape is protecting Harry due to a blood debt. He creates a lot of extra unnecessary tension between the two.

HPMOR does go more into the idea of commands and is better on that.
