While a decent rational story is going to explore various themes the original themes are not necessarily important.

Harry Potter explores the theme of following authority being a great way to achieve success. HPMOR explores the theme of the hero's journey.

Most rational stories I've seen have some of their own themes, often rational ones like immortality, shades of grey and black, transcendence, emotional decisions vs rational ones and such. They have the magic of the series which may run on awesomesauce. They also have science working as normal.

If you want to write a rational fic you may or may not care about the original issues of the plot. Often you don't, you like the magic system, don't care about the original themes, have your own themes you care about and like science.
