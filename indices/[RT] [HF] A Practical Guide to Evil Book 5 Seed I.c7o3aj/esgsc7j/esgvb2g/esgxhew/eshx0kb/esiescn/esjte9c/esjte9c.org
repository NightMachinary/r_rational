  they have the right to put their personal might to the task of conquering others.
#+end_quote

This is a fundamental belief of Below. Pretty much all Evil nations have this as a tenant, it's just /how/ they go about it that is different, and the scale of their efforts. However, no matter any of that, if your starving populace rises up in revolt or all dies off, leaving you either headless or with no one to rule, then you've got an existential crisis on your hands and you need to deal with it.

#+begin_quote
  this also is more or less my response to your third point and most of your fourth.
#+end_quote

It's not so much of a response as a statement of you view. It doesn't explain their actions in regards to the grain, just their general stance on others.

#+begin_quote
  he considers it mildly offensive that when Malicia had a need for a large scale doom weapon that she didn't simply ask him.
#+end_quote

Yes. He would have enjoyed coming up with some crazy world-breaking weapon using his own particular knowledge, if given the chance.

Creating mass produced rituals that establish a perfect pH balance in the soil, infusing it with the necessary chemicals and moisture, etc, etc, was not the sort of thing he was into. Remember his incredible disdain for Legion-style magic? Now do that with something that's just based around dirt. He wouldn't have liked it at all. Plus, it might not even be within his style. He does his /Imbricate/ thing and overlaps dimensions as a method of accomplishing most of his goals. I doubt there's a "Farming Hell" he could use, and overlaying a slice of Arcadia over the land is probably a bad idea as well.

  I'm not sure where exponential growth is implied
#+end_quote

Congratulations, you understand the underlying mechanics and are not Thanos.

#+begin_quote
  I was speaking about the implicit time say two or three generations after the cheap Callowan grain gluts the population of Praes leads to a population boom and then eventually outstrips Callowan capacity
#+end_quote

Looks like I was too quick in congratulating you. What is the birthrate in Praes? Is Praes a low-tier, underdeveloped nation where people have nothing to do in their spare time but breed? In a nation where everyone watches their back and 'iron sharpens iron', how common is it to see big families with 4+ children, and for those children to survive long enough to have such families of their own?

#+begin_quote
  hat they had never been able to do so before because they had never held Callow as far i can recall ever.
#+end_quote

No, but at one point they produced so much grain that they could /export/ it as a form of payment. They didn't have rapid exponential growth there that threatened them with self-destruction, so it's unlikely they would do the same if getting grain from Callow instead of the pre-Wasteland land.

#+begin_quote
  Most human populations would not hit the kind of explosive population growth
#+end_quote

Because humans are not viruses, yes.

#+begin_quote
  but most populations would not be as dependent and as historically dependent on another country to feed them while being able to economically sustain their own agricultural inadequacy.
#+end_quote

... You, uh, should probably read up on nations /in the real world/ then, and notice how many *have* to import food to survive, whether because their land is crap, their tech is bad, or they simply have too high of a population that focuses on other tasks than farming.

#+begin_quote
  Praes consumes all it's given indefinitely, their people have been arguably above their own fields carrying capacity since the formation of the Wasteland and that is what the problem is stemming from.
#+end_quote

They were above their fields, but not their nation. And /do note/ that sizeable portions of the grain was used as /currency/ with other nations. They were a bit of an exporter in that regard, from the money they could make with it. They didn't create the Wasteland trying to keep their population alive, they created the Wasteland /due to excessive greed and non-renewable farming practices/.
