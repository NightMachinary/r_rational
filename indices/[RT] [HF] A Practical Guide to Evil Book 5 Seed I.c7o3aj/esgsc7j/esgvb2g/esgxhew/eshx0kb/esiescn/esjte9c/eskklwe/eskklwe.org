Dude we have been explicitly told that Praes' population grows to the to point that they had to go to war with Callow for at least in part population control with consistency. We've also been told that every Dread Emperor/Empress that tried to implement any kind of population control didn't last a month, where is any kind of evidence that Praes has within recent memory been able to keep their population stable?
