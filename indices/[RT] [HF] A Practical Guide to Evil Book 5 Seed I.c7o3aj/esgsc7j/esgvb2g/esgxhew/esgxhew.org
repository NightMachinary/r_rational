Right, but do we have the kind of timeline to say make the causal claim that pre-wasteland Praes wasn't driven by that need to war with Callow for the victory or loss and the inherent population decrease? Also that it's kind of strange that he makes such a big point of the interconnectedness of Praes and Callow by the movement of grain that it feels strange that we don't see him say revolutionise Praes agriculture given that he has one of the greatest magical minds of his time loyal to himself personally. Because we later see Warlock experimenting on the inherent dragonness of a being by giving a pig fire breathing abilities and wings, so clearly there's an opportunity sometime between this chapter and current day in-story for some sort of non-overtly toxic magically engineered food plant(?) that if not bridges the gap, between Praes population growth and their actual agricultural capacity to feed them, then at least shortens it. I mean we see Black do a lot institutional changes and arguably logistical minded ones, the orphanages marking out potential heroes or the standardization of training, gear for the legions. To me there is this big issue of what happens when Praes reaches the limit of what Callowan agriculture can sustain, like Black's whole shtick was his planning and methodical nature and it's jarring for his plan to be just like setup successor to keep grain flowing end plan.
