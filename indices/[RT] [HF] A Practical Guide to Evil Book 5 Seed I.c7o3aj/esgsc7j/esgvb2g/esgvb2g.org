This one is long before that point. It shows the amount of production of grain /by/ Praes, how it went up and surged through numerous years until it began to fall in advance of the place becoming the Wasteland (at which point it hit zero). Kind of like the equivalent of magical stripmining, but crops instead of ore. The creation of the wasteland wasn't due to stealing weather or any other sort of mad sorcery gone wrong, it was just people being stupid and abusing the environment magically because it was so profitable, up until the point where it wasn't... and then the Empire would /have/ to attack other nations just to survive, because they had destroyed their own environment in their greed.

The one he shows Cat is the amount of grain production in both Praes and Callow, in relation to the Empire's population. Whenever the population reached a certain critical mass, Praes would declare war on Callow, with the goal of either eventually conquering them (which Black did) or reducing their own population to manageable levels through the attrition of war. The more modern examples showed /just how much/ the Empire imported from Callow in regards to how much they could produce and their population size. It was to show her that one way or another, Praes would /need/ Callow, either as a subjugated nation or a reliable trading partner. Thus "the grain must flow", but so long as the Empire got what it needed to survive, he didn't care which method was used. (He was telling her that her goals for a free Callow were fine so long as they still traded the grain to Praes, else they /would/ be invaded again as it was a matter of life and death for the Empire, not just them being greedy).
