  Right, but do we have the kind of timeline to say make the causal claim that pre-wasteland Praes wasn't driven by that need to war with Callow for the victory or loss and the inherent population decrease?
#+end_quote

Pre-Wasteland wasn't /as/ driven because there wasn't as much need. They attacked them because they were nearby and Praes was an Evil Empire, so that was expected. Post Wasteland, they attacked them from necessity.

  we don't see him say revolutionise Praes agriculture given that he has one of the greatest magical minds of his time loyal to himself personally

As the other commenter rightly pointed out, Warlock doesn't care enough to make new grain rituals when he has the universe to take apart, any technological advancements in that area will /quickly/ be put down by the gnomes, who are actively stifling any possible Industrial Revolutions by the more primitive (ie: not gnomish) nations.

  To me there is this big issue of what happens when Praes reaches the limit of what Callowan agriculture can sustain
#+end_quote

It doesn't, it hits carrying capacity and levels out. They didn't have overpopulation problems back in the days when they magically stripmined their fields. Anyone who believes a population (especially a human one) always runs into exponential growth until it hits apocalyptic proportions either has a really bad grasp of the mechanics involved or is Thanos.

  it's jarring for his plan to be just like setup successor to keep grain flowing end plan.
#+end_quote

His plan was much more than that. His plan was to permanently reform the Empire in such a way that A) No one alive for several generations had lived through the old system *and* B) The Empire would be stable and self-sufficient enough that it wouldn't have to go declaring war on other nations or making Bond Villain superweapons or the like just to survive. IE: A peaceful Evil nation that breaks the mold.

In this, he and Cat are very alike, as they are really only "using" Evil to accomplish their sane, reasonable goals. This truly makes her his daughter, heir, and successor much more than any affectionate relationship or blood kinship ever could.
