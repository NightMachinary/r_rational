Ok lot to unpack there, while it's true that there is an implication that post wasteland there was an inherent need to unload their population, the doing so, the warring the reaching as Ubua would say the Triumphants as much as any large scale failure, arguably the large scale failures were if anything more inherently Evil within the in-universe logic, was also training the aristocracy and the majority of the populace that they have the right to put their personal might to the task of conquering others. And this is if not the core to their cultures then it's at least a point that's close to it see the Dread Emperor/Empress position the perpetually looking for weakness Chancellor, or their phrase iron shapes iron. this also is more or less my response to your third point and most of your fourth.

I think that it's really strange to have Warlock's not caring to make new grain rituals the rationale behind him not doing when he considers it mildly offensive that when Malicia had a need for a large scale doom weapon that she didn't simply ask him. I think that that trust and personal relationship is more than enough to make that argument that they either Black or Malicia could have easily made more efficient or larger scale grain rituals. He goes off to defend a town and one of his last thoughts is that while he doesn't care about the Dread Empire that he did care about both Black and Malicia personally.

I'm not sure where exponential growth is implied, given that there is a set amount of people that any parcel of land up to and including our personal planet, while there may be ways to expand it, i.e. chemical fertilizers, in our world, or the grain rituals of Praes, there are limits to how many people can be fed. I was speaking about the implicit time say two or three generations after the cheap Callowan grain gluts the population of Praes leads to a population boom and then eventually outstrips Callowan capacity that they had never been able to do so before because they had never held Callow as far i can recall ever. Most human populations would not hit the kind of explosive population growth, but most populations would not be as dependent and as historically dependent on another country to feed them while being able to economically sustain their own agricultural inadequacy. Praes is like a person's stomach without the regulatory systems of normal hunger, Praes consumes all it's given indefinitely, their people have been arguably above their own fields carrying capacity since the formation of the Wasteland and that is what the problem is stemming from.
