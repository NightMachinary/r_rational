  To me there is this big issue of what happens when Praes reaches the limit of what Callowan agriculture can sustain

The assumption is that the population of Praes increases so that it can conquer Callow (since that is the story of Praes), not the other way around. So when Callow no longer needs conquering, it will be possible to keep the population in check.
