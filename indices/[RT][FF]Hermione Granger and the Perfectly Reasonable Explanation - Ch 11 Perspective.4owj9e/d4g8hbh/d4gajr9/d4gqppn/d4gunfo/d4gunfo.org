It's a good notion in principle. Though in practice, the government of magical Britain being what it is, I suspect the signal-to-noise ratio even measured only over /genuine/ laws is depressingly low, so it'd be hard to reliably distinguish Obscured sections from actual legislative inefficiency and/or nonsense.

Of course, there might well also be a law prohibiting attempts to defeat Conditional Obscuration that only pops up once you learn about Conditional Obscuration... ;)
