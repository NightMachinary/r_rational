(It's been a while since I read the story, so if I get anything wrong that's why.)

You can have as many magic systems as you want. They just have to be good.

Do your magic systems play a role in the plot? Do they influence the characters actions? Do readers look at what your magic systems do and say "That's really cool?". Do the interactions between your systems result in fascinating and clever outcomes?

I would say yes to all these questions. Ritual magic forces you to put explicit value on normally taboo subjects like the value of a human life, and this is interesting and develops the characters.

Oathkeeping asks at what point does the price of sweet magical powers become too much to bear, and how much suffering are people willing to endure, and this is interesting and well done.

I'm a sucker for mentalism. I love mind-reading and control, I love cool mental battles, and I just like mentalism. It doesn't bring up the moral or character questions of the previous two magic systems, but that's alright, you've already got two magic systems for dealing with weighty moral and philosophical problems, having a magic system that encourages and allows being clever, and being sneaky, and knowing impossible things, and secretly subverting people's minds, and the horror of discovering your ally is secretly enslaved to your enemy, and having incredibly kick-ass mental fights, means that mentalism earns its keep.

Spirit calling is okay, but the idea just doesn't catch my attention the way the others do. There are no moral or philosophical questions to explore. The power earns one coolness point for the spirits themselves, because glass lions and the like are neat, but otherwise the power doesn't really interact with the characters. It's just a tool for accomplishing things, rather than a catalyst for character growth, or a source of angst/horror/fascination.

Purely as a thought exercise, I'll tell you how I'd make Spirit Calling more interesting. The first change is that I'd make the spirits more inhuman. They'd be deathless creatures with strange, bizarre obsessions, whose bodies exist primarily to reflect and better enable their inhuman preoccupations. The second change is that the more the Spirit Caller calls on their spirits, the more they begin to think and behave and look like the spirits they call most.

This would mean that the spirits weird bodies become relevant, and provide a deeper insight into how the spirit behaves. And also, it would mean that the spirit caller would have to think very carefully about which spirits they choose to call, and it would put an explicit price on using this magic. It would interact with existing magic systems; Mentalists could protect themselves from this mental alteration to some extent, or encourage it. And lastly, I really, really enjoy reading about and brainstorming what profoundly inhuman intellects are like, and I think you might too, so there's that.
