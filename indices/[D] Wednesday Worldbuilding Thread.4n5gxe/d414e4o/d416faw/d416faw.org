Well, I was looking for an excuse to re-read it :) But, although I may be slightly behind, I didn't feel like it was too much.

The main problem I feel comes with too many systems is when one massively outranks the other, but it seemed like each system presented so far was pretty well balanced, with a fairly equal amount of pros and cons.

As far as execution goes, one of my favorites was in Worm where, as we heard from characters with unique powers, it shaped their worldview, such as [the guy who could switch similar sized items, though I'm blanking on his name]. Additionally, one of the Worm fanfictions ([[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/legacy-worm.345448/][Legacy, the follow up to Cenotaph and Worm)]] had a perspective from Fenja's perspective, where sizes of openings, buildings, etc, dominated her worldview, which I really enjoyed.
