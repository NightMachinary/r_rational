I've often wondered why people don't blend the powers into an actual magic system more often. It's common for powers to all result from the same source (see Smallville or Static Shock), but they rarely take it a step further and integrate them. One of the things I really liked about /Fullmetal Alchemist/ was that everyone had their gimmick and unique style, but it was all centered around the same magic system. I'd really like to see that applied to superheroes.
