Well, you /can/ turn people into vampires, and you /can/ kill a vampire by killing their progenitor. You can therefore use physical force to turn multiple billionaires into vampires and force them into compliance by threatening the lives of their progenitors. So if phase one is "get more money" then sub-phase one might be "forcibly turn people".
