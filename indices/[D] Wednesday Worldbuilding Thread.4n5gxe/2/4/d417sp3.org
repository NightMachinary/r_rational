I honestly don't think they could. Physical prowess isn't really relevant in the modern government. Lots of people, including the ones already "in control" of the government, have gobs of money. Fortune 500 companies are the top 500 companies in the US, controlling 6 of them could vary wildly based on what their rank is. Having six in the 400's isn't even on the scale of what you would need to control a government.

Most importantly, control in this case is relationships. If you're friends with all the important people, you have a lot of influence over their decisions. Basically the only way to make these relationships out of nowhere is to give them lots of money. And lots of really rich people are already giving these people lots of money, so you would a heck of a lot of money.

Mind control or compulsion of some sort would make things a lot easier, or a history of existing relationships.
