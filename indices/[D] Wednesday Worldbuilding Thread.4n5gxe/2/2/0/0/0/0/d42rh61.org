War does terrible things to people. I'm thinking from the 'evil vampire' perspective here. And war lords in Africa use child soldiers - shouldn't be hard to find enough sociopaths to form the core and enough people who just want to live and receive awesome powerups and immortality.

And it's all for humanity's own sake anyway. They clearly aren't capable of running themselves without killing the Earth. We will offer them stability and security and peace. And all it will cost them is a small war of extermination of any dissenters and a bit of restructuring of their society.
