That's hellish, it's like a vast fractal pattern of fucked-up-ness.

For example, those child soldiers and sociopaths who you were able to convince to wipe out most of humanity, they're not going away. They're immortal. They're going to stay around until someone kills them, and if you're not quick about it they'll have turned people of their own, so if you do kill them you'll be killing a bunch of innocents as well. But if you keep them around then a populate demagogue might convince them to follow another cause, and they're the core of your military right there.

And that's just one aspect. We're essentially selecting for an elite of people who are willing to literally watch the world burn so long as they can rule the ashes, and these people are going to be in power for all eternity, because they're going to keep people just one or two steps down the sire-line from them on hand and if the people rise against them, they have the threat of just straight up killing all those people with a single blow.

This is like 1984 on steroids with vampires ruling over everything and the sky black with soot. Shit, if I wanted to write grimdark then /this/ would be the setting to do it in.
