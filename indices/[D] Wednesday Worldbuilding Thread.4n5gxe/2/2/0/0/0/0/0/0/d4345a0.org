Oh yeah, good point. When we build our army, we do it using intermediate expendable vamps, who don't know much, and if a particular group of soldiers turn on us, we kill the intermediate, whom we held in comfort and captivity just in case.

Also, there are no innocents, only collateral damage.

I do like the atmosphere though. Rather a lot.
