It does rather lend itself to story, doesn't it. Plus it allows excuses for all kinds of otherwise unreasonable fortresses, features and such. "Why did they build such an unrealistic thing in such a strange inhospitable location? The local Vampire Lord wanted it, and no-one could say no."

The storyline could focus on a group of rebels trying to sneak in and steal back enough intermediates that they don't have the threat of death over their heads (and possibly capture and imprison the Vampire Lord who is sire-of-their-line). Or there's plenty of other stories that could be told in that kind of setting. There's potential there.
