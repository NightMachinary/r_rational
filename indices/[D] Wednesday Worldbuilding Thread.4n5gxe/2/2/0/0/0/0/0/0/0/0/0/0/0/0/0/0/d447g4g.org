Hey, best of luck with that! Even though my own world is original, I still couldn't help but include an overpowered self insert. They are just so much fun. Although I did make him a possible bad guy, so hopefully it's not /too/ obvious it's teenage me with a couple of winning tickets for the super power lottery. I haven't seen/read Naruto, but I'm a big fan of Japanese cartoons in general. If I ever do watch Naruto I'll be sure to give it a shot.
