  Amusingly I've not read most of it myself. I know, that sounds like an unforgivable sin, but there you go.

Supposedly Eliezer didn't read much of Harry Potter before he wrote HPMOR, so I wouldn't worry.

  What world are you working on at the moment?

So, for me there is only one world. It's been growing and changing in my head since I was 12, and I'm now 27. Almost nothing remains as it was back then, but the process was very gradual, and for me it's always been one and the same world.

Long ago there was an /evil race of demons/, which the readers don't need to care about because they are all dead now (Yes /really/), but they were once very strong and hell bent on taking over the medievalish human world. The 'Good' Empire (Think Christian Rome) couldn't stand against them, because magic can do some really fucked up shit, and the dominant religion didn't particularly approve of things like messing around with time and space, body horror or lowly /commoners/ using magic. It became painfully clear that the demons were going to win. So. Some real tricksy people got together and decided that if 'Good' couldn't save the species, maybe 'Evil' was worth a shot. There are no actual forces of good and evil in my world, but, you know... Imagine the aliens have wiped out the US and Russia and only Nazi Germany remains to defend the species. So the Bad Guys save the species, annihilate the race of demons, and conquer the world. At this point, they refuse to step down. They feel like they would rather like to /continue/ to rule the world. Only they don't want to share power with the /other/ bad guys. So you get a few more decades of war and endlessly escalating magical research, a few strategic genocides and one or two apocalyptic Wrong Turns... And then a magical superweapon goes too far and obliterates everyone within ten fifteen ranks of the rulers and burns all the cities and towns and villages and lonesome houses and /especially/ schools and libraries to the ground. The humans that survive are the weakest in magic, the least educated. And they rather feel like the whole magical science thing maybe wasn't a good idea. So magic is heavily restricted again, and they try to rebuild civilisation without any of that industrial revolution or magical science stuff. 200 years pass, humans are petty cunts, and then a bunch of escaped slaves wander into the ancient (Well, 200 years old) ruins of Evil Capitol. And that's where book one begins. With people who know nothing of their history and are deeply suspicious of the skull architecture and the manuals and machinery and oh look, the neighbouring kingdoms don't like it that they settled in Evil Capitol, and now they have to learn magic so they can defend themselves and oh look it's making even /more/ kingdoms want to gang up to attack them and now they need to learn even more of the spooky old evil magic and technology and-. Well, I should finish writing book one first. Anyway, the whole series is fairly well mapped out in my head, and I've basically finished one book, but it was the first thing I wrote so it sucked, and now I'm writing a new first book, about the slaves who wander into Evil Capitol , and it's looking promising.

...I can talk about the world forever. Actually writing on the damn book is tricky. Discipline is hard.
