  Maybe with a few hundred billion dollars and the finest scientists in the country you can deliberately cause the Yellowstone Supervolcano to errupt and shroud the Earth in a volcanic ash cloud that lasts for years, allowing your armies to march openly and destroy all military threats.

You were doing so well, and then you went and wiped out your food source.

Edit: I wonder how long it would take to clone/create a race of brain-dead humans with super bone marrow to provide a constant source of blood. A pint of haemoglobin rich blood averages out to only around 300g of solid matter and slightly more water. That's more than a current human needs in a day, but not /too much/ more. Theoretically I don't see any particular reason why it shouldn't be possible to create enough blood-factories to convert over large percentages of humanity to vampirism, giving them immortality and all those other bonuses. You'd want to keep some natural humans to do daytime stuff and avoid crippling overspecialisation of course.

Now granted, the sire dynamic where if the sire dies they all die would lead to some kind of fucked up situations, but I think it would still be a net improvement.
