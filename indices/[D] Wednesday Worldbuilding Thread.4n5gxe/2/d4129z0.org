Let's say that you're a member of a group of vampires numbering in the low hundreds which has been successfully running a masquerade for the last few millenia. How difficult is it to take over the United States, given the following and complete buy-in from all the vampires?

** Vulnerabilities
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: vulnerabilities
   :END:

- Direct sunlight is almost immediately deadly to vampires, but only sunlight, not UV rays. Indirect sunlight stings but doesn't harm.
- Vampires have a few psychological quirks like an aversion to mirrors, inability to cross running water, etc. These are compulsions equivalent to OCD. Basically, most of the weird vampire stuff falls here.
- Vampires are vulnerable to wooden implements of any kind.
- Vampires need a pint of human blood every day to survive, though you can go around with up to fifteen pints of blood sloshing around in your belly.
- Killing a vampire kills all of the vampires they created.

** Strengths
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: strengths
   :END:

- Vampires are as strong as twenty men and as fast as a man sped up twenty times.
- Vampires are invulnerable to small-arms fire unless the bullets are made from wood.
- Vampires can turn anyone into a vampire with about half an hour, if you have access to their body and some preparation.
- Vampires don't need to sleep, eat, or drink (aside from blood).
- Killing a vampire kills all of the vampires they created.
- You have gobs of money, control of six Fortune 500 companies, and a covert delivery system that reliably delivers blood to vampires.

For the purposes of this exercise, assume that "control of the United States" means all three branches of government either consist of vampires, or vampires have ultimate authority of them, and this is expected to be the case into the foreseeable future.
