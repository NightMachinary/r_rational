  If you only turn self-interested rational sociopaths (so they're only motivated by self-interested)...that's easier in terms of understanding their incentives, but there aren't many sociopaths who are smart enough to be useful and have enough self-control to be useful, since sociopaths are often very impulsive.

A very high percentage (around half) of politicians are sociopaths, and they coincidentally control everything. You turn everyone in power quickly, before the secret gets out.
