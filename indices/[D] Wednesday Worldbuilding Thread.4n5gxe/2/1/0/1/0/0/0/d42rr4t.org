25-70 mph. Depending on terrain, and that max speed only in bursts

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running]]

~3 to 10 m/s, or ~6 to 22 miles per hour, depending on distance. Times 20 for 120 to 440mph. What can I say, tanks are pretty slow.

That said, vampire stamina wasn't specified, so maybe they wear out really fast, or maybe they can go 400mph constantly.
