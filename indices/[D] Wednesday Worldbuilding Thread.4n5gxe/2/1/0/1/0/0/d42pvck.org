Eh, I don't know. Not sure vampires could draw an army big enough to take over the world that way when they're clearly evil AND alien to human society, which makes them a clear outgroup. On the other hand, you only need to recruit extremists, not a representative sample of the population.

Also, 20 times faster than a human being sounds about right for a tank? Depends on how you count, I guess.
