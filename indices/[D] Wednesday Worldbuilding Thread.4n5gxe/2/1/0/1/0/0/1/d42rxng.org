An 8 minute mile isn't terribly astonishing for a human; this is close to [[http://www.military.com/military-fitness/army-fitness-requirements/army-pft-two-mile-run-score-chart][the army's requirement for their PFT]]. That's 7.5 mph, which for a vampire would be 150 mph. The M1 Abrams has a top speed of [[http://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/land/m1.htm][45 mph]]. So a vampire would be able to move at maybe three times the speed of a tank, which they could sustain for maybe twenty minutes (realistically, they'd be a bit slower because of how air friction dominates at those speeds).

If we're talking about sprinting, double the speed (but don't, because again, friction).
