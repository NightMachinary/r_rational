Well... 4-10 times faster than a tank, but I get your point.

Nah. You use a disposable middle-sire. If the enemy tries to go vampire, you execute the mid-sires, making their entire efforts in training their own vamps a waste of time.

Also I think you're vastly underestimating the efficacy of radicalization. Again, you forcibly convert nobody. You use the /current/, /proven/ recruitment methods of modern terrorists, and back it up with the fact that tons of people already idolize the idea of vampires.
