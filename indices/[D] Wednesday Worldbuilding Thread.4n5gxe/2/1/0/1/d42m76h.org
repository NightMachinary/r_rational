The increased speed still doesn't matter against militaries that use airplanes and killer drones. I mean, sure, you're as fast as a tank, as resilient as a tank, slightly harder to kill than a tank, and if you carry a cannon at all times you might have the offensive power of a tank (though clearly not the ammo count). So your vampire military will be mostly equivalent to a bunch of tanks who can only move at night. Nowhere near enough to threaten an actual modern military.

Otherwise, they'd be pretty efficient at guerilla and asymetric fighting (can easily sneak in population centers at night and start killing or infecting people), but I don't think they'd be that good at getting converting lots of people. "We are the superior race and will exterminate / reign other all others" doesn't seem like a compelling ideology for someone forcibly converted, who probably still identify as human. Plus, every time you're converting someone, you're giving a potential enemy superpowers, and it's hard to do background checking in the middle of a war where you need armies of convicts.
