The weakness would appear to be that converting someone to a vampire doesn't do anything to alter their values. So the assumption that they're going to act as a monolithic group on anybody's say-so is probably wildly off base.

If someone comes up and puts the whammy on me and tells me "You're immortal now but if I die, you die, so you have to be my soldier" I am going to immediately begin work on a plan to place them in a steel case at the bottom of the ocean, after which I will go about my business.
