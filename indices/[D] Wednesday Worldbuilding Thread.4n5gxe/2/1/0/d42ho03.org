  Physical strength and resistance isn't really a factor in a world of killer drones and armor designs/armor-piercing designs that get outdated faster than summer dress fashions. Unless vampires are immune to anti-tank shells, they're screwed.

Twenty. Not just 20 times strength but /20 times speed/.

Vampires can reproduce faster than humans, sprint at 400 m/h, and can have 20 times as much body armor and weaponry before becoming burdened. Say what you will about ground infantry being less useful in modern warfare, but when all your infantry are disposable mobile tanks, I think that changes the game a little.

And that's conventional warfare. Get one vamp in a population center and tell him to go berserk. You think terrorism's scary now? Hah!

Furthermore, it's easy enough to get people invested in radical ideologies already. Build an ideology around a condition that legitimately grants immortality and super strength and toughness... You'll have no end of recruits primed for conversion to loyal ideologues, ready to give their lives for the cause of vampire utopia.

The only real weakness of the vampires is the failure point of the sires. Cutting off the head actually does kill the beast in this case.
