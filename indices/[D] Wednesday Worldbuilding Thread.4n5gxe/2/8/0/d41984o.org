In this case, I don't want other ways to satisfy their terminal goals, I only want to see how (or whether) this instrumental goal could be accomplished. In other words, if the solution is "don't take over the United States", that's a different story than the one I want to tell.

Terminal goals, in this case, are largely existential. The masquerade can't last forever, not with the expanding internal intelligence agencies and improving technologies. Every decade that passes expands what's required to keep the masquerade going, and that in turn expands the surface area through which the masquerade can be detected. A broken masquerade is (perceived as) an enormous threat to the vampires if it comes without a sizable increase in held power. A second terminal goal is power for the sake of hedonic satisfaction; it feels good to have unconditional power over other people and it feels bad for other people to have power over you.

I agree and disagree with your point about the United States no longer being the United States. The United States with Constitutionally-required blood donations and a Vampire-in-Chief is different from the United States that we currently have. But if pretty much nothing else needs to change -- people still wait in line at the DMV, there's still Superbowl Sunday, a free press, etc. then I don't think that you can go quite so far as calling it "not the United States".
