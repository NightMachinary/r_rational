What's the goal in "controlling of the United States"?

If they want to make major changes to how the country works, it will shortly be something other than "the United States", at which point why use the conventional levers of power to do so?

If they want to funnel power to vampires, there are more effective and less risky ways outside of federal government channels, at which point why bother subverting thousands of government employees?
