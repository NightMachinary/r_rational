Had this conversation a few years ago. Prions would likely play a significant role in the long-term stability of vampire organizations, in that sometimes a vampire would slowly start going completely crazy. Build-up of amyloid plaque, wasting diseases, and other prion-derived ills would be of serious concerns.

You can hand-wave this by giving them a healing factor, but that will change your setting; so, either incorporate prion-related historical disruptions to your world's backstory, or add a healing factor. If the former, a powerful vampire of crucial logistical importance manifesting a malady during the attempted take-over of a human country makes for great conflict.
