That actually works even better in a superhero setting for explaining [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffscreenVillainDarkMatter][Offscreen Villain Dark Matter]]. Supervillains keep getting more minions just by franchising their criminal enterprise. Even loose cannons like the Joker have a recognizable brand that some other criminals would latch onto and franchise for him. They supply him with what he needs as the face of the brand, and they get to keep the money he would otherwise burn.
