I definitely agree that at a certain point, you start to make the system feel less real. I was working on a magic system a few years ago ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/16elxu/help_break_my_magic_system/][this one]]) and the deeper in I went, the less grounding it felt like it had. I don't necessarily think that this is unique to magic systems, since I feel the same way about real life physics; once it gets to the quantum level, I have no grounding and I get turned around easily.
