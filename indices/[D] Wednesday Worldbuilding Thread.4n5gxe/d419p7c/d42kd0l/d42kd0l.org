There are fewer women than men. Women look a lot more like each other than men do, and they must either die young (from all that serial crime) or age less because there are even fewer in the older age brackets.

There is very little overt racism and it is always challenged. On the other hand black people are rarer and more likely to commit crimes, and possibly less likely to form mixed race partnerships.

Homophobia is all but nonexistent. Sexism still exists though.

Some small towns are absolute murder hot spots (Oxford, for instance).

Almost nobody smokes. Especially almost no Americans smoke.

American women have the magic ability to glue the duvet just over their breasts however they move in bed. All men wear underpants in bed.

Twelve step programmes usually work. Few people are overweight, and when they diet that works as well.

There is a disproportionate chance of getting pregnant the first time. An ordinary car door provides adequate cover from a hail of bullets. So does an overturned desk. Nobody ever get hit by stray bullets going through walls.

All encryption is easily broken. Computers are way better than in the real world, but only work for specific geek types.
