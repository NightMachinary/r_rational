Shenanigan: The Epsilon layer is out of reach to ships, as it requires massive energy to open the portal and anything big enough to generate the portal will be torn apart. It is, however, not out of reach to a really, really big generator that opens a really tiny portal and shines a communication laser through it. Aim at another really tiny receiver portal, and you can get news and other information across the galaxy faster than anyone else.
