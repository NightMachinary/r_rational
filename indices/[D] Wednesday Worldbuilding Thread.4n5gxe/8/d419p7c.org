If you were to amalgamate a logically consistent TVLand version of our world, what would it be like? What would you leave out and add in?

You have lawyer type show, which mainly involves defensive lawyers. So the court is cogged up with hyper competent defense lawyers.

But at the same time, you have cop drama with lot of violence and hypercompetent policeman and amateurs of every stride.(Think authors, psychic, immortal, anything under the sun.)

So, if you send a criminal case to trial, you would have hypercompetent defense lawyers on one side, and a necessarily hypercompetent prosecutors to ensure that the case remains open and shut.

What about shows XFile and Fringe? I would say the Fringe Division is a successor to the XFile. The masquerade had already been blown, so if you got something very bizarre and strange, you call them in.
