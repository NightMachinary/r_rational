/As for TVTropeLand ... it depends on how far you want to push it. If there are protagonists and antagonists but no extras, and the tropes are just the ones used in television:/

Somebody did a story about this, but while it was interesting and fun, it wasn't exactly the approach I would want to use.

It would be a totally serious story, with a focus on how all the various elements of TVLand fit with each other, with culture shock if we want to throw in a few trans-dimensional traveler from an otherwise totally mundane Earth.
