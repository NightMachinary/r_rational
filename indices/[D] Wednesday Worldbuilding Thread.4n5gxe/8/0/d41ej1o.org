I recall seeing a hilarious erotica version of this a while back, to the effect of "all men have large penises, all women are able to enthusiastically accommodate them in any hole, no one uses condoms but there are no STDs, everyone is open to trying a new kink and will instantly love it, etc.". It went on for a few pages.

As for TVTropeLand ... it depends on how far you want to push it. If there are protagonists and antagonists but no extras, and the tropes are just the ones used in television:

- School is dominated by extracurricular activities.
- Work is dominated by interpersonal relationships.
- All problems are solved at the last possible second by a brilliant insight.
- Murder is much higher than in reality, but crime in general is low.
- There are far, far more serial killers than in reality.
- Criminals tend to admit to their crimes right away when caught, so there are very few long trials.
- Underdogs sometimes lose, but not when it really matters.
- Physical maturity happens much sooner. Teenagers look like they're in their twenties, while college students look like they're in their thirties.
- Once physically mature, people age much more slowly. A man in his sixties will look often look like he's in his forties.
- Good people tend to be pretty, while bad people tend to be ugly.
- The world is a fantasy kitchen sink, but they're all kept secret from the public and from each other. It's not uncommon for a werewolf, vampire, alien, psychic, witch, and superhero to all be working in the same office, unbeknownst to each other.
