For me, a variety of magic systems makes a story feel more like reality. There are an assortment of disciplines and practices whereby one achieves power and success in life. Having a single method whereby all is made possible makes one wonder why anybody doesn't pursue it, even if the costs are dire. That's one of the big sources of much silliness in rational fanfics: exposing just how simple it is to access godhood when there's only one, exhaustively documented way.

With a variety of weaker, more complex magics available, there's room for people to explore a variety of unique paths unavailable to us readers.

Theoretically a single magic system could be complex and fiddly enough to rival a real discipline like (for example) chemistry. I also imagine it would be just as hard to use for anything other than the relatively mundane, and just as much hard work for limited reward.

More fun to have a bunch of dueling sources of power, competing with one another on an axis neither parallel nor perpendicular.
