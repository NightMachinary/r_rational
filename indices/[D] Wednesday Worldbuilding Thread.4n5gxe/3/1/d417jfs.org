If you have multiple systems of magic, they should either be unified under some common metamagic or sufficiently distinct as to not be confusing.

Going from what I remember of TDWoD (up to the chapter where the kids summon the household-object spirit, I think), I'd say they're all distinct enough, with possible hints of some unification (e.g. spirits might arbitrate oaths, watch for rituals, appear when called).

Though if done poorly it could overcomplicate things, I think that defining the interactions of the systems can sometimes give a picture of how they relate.

TWDoD examples: are there any rituals that involve the sacrifice of a spirit? What about sacrificing somebody who has kept an oath for ten years, or who keeps twenty oaths? Can spirits take oaths, or interact with the mental realms? Are there any sacrifices that can take place in a mind? Can you take an oath to improve your mentalism?

In general, I'd say you have too many magic systems when a reader can't recall the overarching details (and specifics, if relevant) of each system when it is referenced. Theoretically there can't be "too many" as long as you provide refreshers when you think they might be necessary (though at some point it might strain credulity with no unifying theory).
