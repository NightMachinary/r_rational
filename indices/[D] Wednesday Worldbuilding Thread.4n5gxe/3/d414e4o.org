How many magic systems is too many?

/The Dark Wizard of Donkerk/, one of my WIP, has roughly four (oathkeeping, spirit calling, ritual magic, mentalism) presented to the reader with another three off-screen (eloists, elementalists, binders) for the sequels. This doesn't feel like too much to me, but if you're one of the ~3 people who have read up to the current point, let me know if it is.

/Glimwarden/ currently has two or three magic systems in it, but I'd like there to be more. Here's where you might say "it's all in the execution, stupid", and I ask you for some examples or some theory on what makes for good execution. (Alternately, I'd also like to know if you've come across examples where a setting was uncomfortably full of stuff.)
