Ahh, Trickster. Thanks.He doesn't feature in many of the worm fanfics I've been reading and I blanked.

You make a good point re: powers vs. magic systems. However, the concept still applicable to systems, though more generally and with greater difficulty (see, e.g. the etherealists in /The Aeronaut's Windlass/ by Jim Butcher, whose contact with the spirits makes them a little bit detached from reality, and as they get more advanced, simpler tasks become more difficult for them.)

Also, /The Seven Towers/ had a really great society based on the core concept that everyone traded their shadow for a shadowy-type demon, and everyone had one, and the implications of that and so forth. I realize that's not exactly on topic, but it reflects a system-wide focus.
