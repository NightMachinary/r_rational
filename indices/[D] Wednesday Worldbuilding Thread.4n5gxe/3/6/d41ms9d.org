Master of the Five Magics (Lyndon Hardy) does what it says on the tin. It's proven that you can at least fit five into a typical ~300 pg paperback and have it work. It's probably the most 'distinct magic systems per page' I've seen attempted and completed successfully, but I am not sure it's an upper limit.
