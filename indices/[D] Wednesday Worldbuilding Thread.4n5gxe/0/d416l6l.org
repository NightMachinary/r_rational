[[http://www.begoodenough.com/the-great-filter/][The Great Filter]] does such a great job at explaining the problems with keeping a secret from science that I find it difficult to ignore how easy it is in other fiction. Anything that science can prove to exist will eventually be discovered and preventing that discovery only becomes more difficult over time. Stories like Doctor Who and The Dresden Files only seem to get away with it by deciding humans are just in denial that the extraordinary exists, so mainstream scientists are too biased to study it rationally.

I started binge-watching Fringe lately (think The X-Files meets CSI with Altered States-esque mad science) and it doesn't make much sense how sci-fi tech used by terrorists and criminals are a secret. Presumably the conspiracy they're building up to will justify it, but it still seems like regular scientists should know something about these bizarre phenomena. For some reason only terrorist cells, insane scientists, and one corporation that might work with the military know anything about these world-changing technologies being used to kill people.

TL;DR Even if you can justify the rationale for keeping scientific information a secret, how do you actually go about ensuring discoveries are never revealed? If you say conspiracy, say how a conspiracy could do it.
