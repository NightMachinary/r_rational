The only story I know of a scientist's work being initially rejected and later vindicated was Jon Snow, who discovered that cholera was spread through water instead of "miasma". However, his paradigm-defying theory did lack hard evidence at first so of course his colleagues doubted him. Were any of these people called quacks for more dubious reasons?
