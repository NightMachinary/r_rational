  Were any of these people called quacks for more dubious reasons?

Having had a quick look over the list, all the discoveries mentioned are either ones that I have no prior knowledge of, or ones that I know (in hindsight) to have been correct (or at least to be currently accepted).

Example: the Doppler effect (described as derided because it ran counter to the then-accepted Luminiferous Aether theory re the propagation of light).

By and large, it seems that /most/ items on that lit were described as ridiculed for running counter to then-current ideas and theories.
