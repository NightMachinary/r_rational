I think the only way you could make it happen is with some sort of mind control/memory wipe and it would have to be more widespread than requiring you to actually seek out the person. It's also worth mentioning that small things are a lot easier to hide. Things like stardust and it's magical kingdom behind an innocent looking fence doesn't take much to keep hidden as compared to Harry potter with maybe 0.001% of the population as wizards.

You'd still need to some sort of conspiracy to keep the village of Wall under wraps, but it would be a lot easier and could probably be done with a conventional conspiracy. Everything works the same unless you go to one particular place on Earth so it just requires keeping people quiet and containing any leaks that do come out. Who's going to believe them anyway?
