A 4000 page treatise in which brilliant civil engineer Mario and his cunning and ambitious brother Luigi argue about the economic implications of floating gold coins, occasionally segueing into long, gratuitous discussions of the purpose of the enormous pipe system that covers the entirety of the Mushroom Kingdom. Together, they concoct a scheme to take over the world and make everyone immortal, which hinges on the thermodynamics-violating properties of Super Mushrooms. Princess Toadstool rescues herself.
