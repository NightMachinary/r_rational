It's a shame to dismiss the subspace layers so quickly. If the energy and stress requirements to travel between universes increase as you go further "in", then subspace travel should be nearly effortless. Particularly if subspace portals are similarly efficient.

Only application I can think of at the moment is stealth: if you hide something ten layers down, and you don't leave any traces in the intermediate universes, it'll be impossible to find even if you can pinpoint it down to the square metre in the base universe. Because your margin of error will become galaxy-sized at those depths. All you can do is wait for it to pop back into normal space of its own accord.
