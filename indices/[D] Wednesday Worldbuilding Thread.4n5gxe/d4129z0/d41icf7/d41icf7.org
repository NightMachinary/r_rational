Assuming we're talking about the military coup at the end of Contratto: first off, taking over the USA alone would be impossible, because other countries would get involved, and easily overwhelm the vampires through sheer numbers and industrial power. Your vampire army needs to take control of (or at least take out) a sizeable portion of the world's militaries, or else they will keep facing foreign countries which aren't sold with the whole "superhuman species declare themselves overlord of the squishy sacks of blood" idea.

Then... it depends on the number of vampires. Physical strength and resistance isn't really a factor in a world of killer drones and armor designs/armor-piercing designs that get outdated faster than summer dress fashions. Unless vampires are immune to anti-tank shells, they're screwed. Even if they are immune to high-caliber weaponry, they're still screwed, actually, because manufacturing wooden rockets probably isn't that hard.

I'd say the vampires' best hope would be to turn a significant number of humans quickly, with as many high-placed converts as possible, and leverage the "if your father dies, you're dust" thing. Even then, lots of new vampires would probably refuse to cooperate, and the vampires would have to exterminate a lot of people before the entire industrial capacity of human kind is no longer capable of sustaining the fight against vampires and the remaining people would lose the will to fight back.

And that's leaving aside strategies like "capture vampires, torture the location of the elders out of them, capture the elders (easy enough, you just have to threaten to nuke their location and their cronies will turn on them), congratulations, the entire vampire population is now in your power".
