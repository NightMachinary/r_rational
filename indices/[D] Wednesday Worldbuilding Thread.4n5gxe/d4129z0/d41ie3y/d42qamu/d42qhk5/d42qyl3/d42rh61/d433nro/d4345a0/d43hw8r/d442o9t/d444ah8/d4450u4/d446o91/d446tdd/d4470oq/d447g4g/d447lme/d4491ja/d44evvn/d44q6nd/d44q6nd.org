It does have some similarities with WoT, which is a really great series. They both have a lost old 'golden age', then a total societal crash, restrictions on who can learn magic (Although in WoT it's partly genetic, partly the Taint, whereas in my world it's all the nobility hoarding power), and you have a bunch of 'dead' (sure) old rulers who were way scary and good at magic.
