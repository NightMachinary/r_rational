Roll the Dice on Fate. I'm afraid it's a Naruto SI, but one I'm much enjoying. Looking back, it straddles the line between crack and serious for much of the early chapters, which will probably make the rather harsh introduction to proper missions that I'm planning at least a bit jarring. Hopefully I can use that jarringness productively to show that the elemental nations are nothing to fuck with, but time will tell.
