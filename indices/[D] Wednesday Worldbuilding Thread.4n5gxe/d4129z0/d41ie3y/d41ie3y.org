Alright, a few hundred. All the money we need. Big Businesses.

It's not practical to have, say, all senators always be vampires. But you definitely always want some. You also want some of the people with a lot of power in each party. The ones who can influence other well known politicians. And of course, every few decades you need to replace your 'older' politicians with 'new' faces, even if they are all ancient vampires with makeup. But you probably don't need that many vamps. Instead you make a concerted effort to open up politics to influence from your enormous money reserves. Through the sinister, supernatural magic of the current campaign finance system you are able both to extract favours from vanilla mortal politicians and to make sure that people already friendly to your agenda have an easier time running. They don't know about vampires, of course, they just feel that since half a dozen top donors from the Fortune 500 seem to care so much about who is appointed Director of the FBI, there is no point in going against them. There's another election next year, after all.

So through money you get soft power over the legislature. You also get /some/ influence over who they appoint to the executive. That money also goes a long way toward steering nominations for the supreme court - the president got his job with your help, and the Senate can shoot down a Justice every now and then. You won't have all the Justices on the Supreme Court, but you will always have someone on it, maybe even the majority if you put enough money into it and have your politician vamps fight hard enough.

Vampire presidents though are a tough sell. The president has to do lots of ceremonial crap in the daytime. But you can have a few people in his cabinet because you control his party, and probably a few White House staffers too. As with the president, governors also have to do so very many ceremonial appearances, so you aren't going to have those either. However, you can get into the Senate and the House without having been a governor, so that's doable. And you do have so very much money to spread around, and party insiders to give you a boost.

Every now and then a powerful mortal politician will look like a potential threat and or good candidate for conversion. Take them somewhere safe and turn them. Have your vampire psychologists and FBI behavioural analysts observe. See if they seem amenable to joining you. Give them a good deal; accept them as a proper member of the conspiracy and give them wealth and power. If it looks like they might betray you, kill them and make it look natural. Who's to say a 60 year old politician can't have a heart attack? Not a mortal forensic expert, that's who not, because you'll have someone pull strings to make sure nothing unusual is found.

The hardest one is definitely the executive. You can make sure some vamps are appointed as top bosses, sure, but it will be pretty hard for any vamps to rise up organically through most of the departments, unless you want to focus on a few and have many vampires helping each other/sabotaging non-vamps in the battle for promotions.

The path forward seems to me to be "Make more vampires. Slowly take over everything." In some ways that's easier than maintaining the status quo with only a few hundred vamps. Probably focus on law enforcement rather than the lower courts (Though you need /some/ lower level judges so you have a pool of people who can one day sit on the Supreme Court), and agencies like the FBI and CIA and /definitely/ the NSA. Take over businesses. Convert CEOs who seem to be power tripping sociopaths. That's probably the easiest to turn group in the country. Offer them immortality, more wealth and more power. Make vanilla politicians more and more reliant on your money. Control more and more appointments. Build an army. Better yet, take over the US army. Vampire +Nazi+ Patriot armies are a staple of vampire world conquest schemes. Turn diplomats, Americans and foreign ones. Spread the faith. Have scientists. Secretly develop a plan for blocking direct sunlight on a massive scale. Maybe with a few hundred billion dollars and the finest scientists in the country you can deliberately cause the Yellowstone Supervolcano to errupt and shroud the Earth in a volcanic ash cloud that lasts for years, allowing your armies to march openly and destroy all military threats.
