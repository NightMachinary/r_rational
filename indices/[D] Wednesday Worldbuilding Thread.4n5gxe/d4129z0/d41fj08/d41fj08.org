A big human tendency you need to take into account is spite. If you turn someone into a vampire, even if they know you can kill them by killing their progenitor, they may very well reveal you or work against you out of spite or some strongly held beliefs.

if you turn someone who is very patriotic, and don't keep a close enough eye on them, they might go to enough media outlets and police, present enough evidence, etc. knowing that they're dead as soon as they're found out by vampires, but doing it out of devotion to country.

or someone who is very spiteful gets turned to get control over them reveals the whole masquerade out of spite, etc.

If you only turn self-interested rational sociopaths (so they're only motivated by self-interested)...that's easier in terms of understanding their incentives, but there aren't many sociopaths who are smart enough to be useful and have enough self-control to be useful, since sociopaths are often very impulsive.
