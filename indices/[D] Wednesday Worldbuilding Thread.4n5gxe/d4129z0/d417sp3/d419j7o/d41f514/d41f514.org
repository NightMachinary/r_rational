That's still thinking in the lines of using force. Threatening the lives of billionaires probably won't get you all that far. And of course you would turn a bunch of rich people into vampires. All they would have to do is get control of their progenitors and they would be on exactly the same level as the first set of vampires.

Plus, all it takes is one of them going public and the jig is up. If anything, the one way to get absolutely prevent someone from controlling the common US populace is to tell that populace you're going to do it. The system still works at some level, politicians still have to get people to vote for them. And if everyone thinks vampires = bad, then no politician is going to want to be seen associating with vampires, which makes things a lot harder.

One question, are vampires immortal? At least in the sense of not dying of old age. If so, you could create a secret vampire culture of offering the reward of immortality to accrue political favors. I remember reading at least one book that did something like that. Though they had been doing it for quite some time already. So that's another question, what political and social platform are the vampires starting from? If they are the equivalent of a bunch of chinese businessmen buying six fortune 500 companies and moving to america, that would be hard. But if they are immortal and have already been doing this for the last 200 years, you could make an interesting story out of modern problems they are encountering expanding their political influence.
