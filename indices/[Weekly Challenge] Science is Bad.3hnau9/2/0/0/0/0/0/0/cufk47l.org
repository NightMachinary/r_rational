To me, it's thought process looked something like this (although this is heavily simplified):

Salvage refuse -> what's the goal of salvaging refuse -> preserve Earth -> what's the point of preserving Earth -> to provide humanity with a home to live on -> what's the point of this home? -> to fulfill their needs -> what are their needs? -> (insert fancy week long robot debate) to be happy and content -> what makes them happy? -> (insert chemicals that incite "good" feelings in humanity->how can I administer these chemicals -> (insert more robot debate, output of which is super happy drug) -> how can I administer this to all humans at all times -> (more debate) how will I keep them alive if happiness and pleasure is overriding their basic survival needs -> Integration Plan
