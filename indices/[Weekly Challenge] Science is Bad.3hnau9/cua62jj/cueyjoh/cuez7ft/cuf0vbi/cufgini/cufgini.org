I'm not fully certain. It's the type of conclusion I could see a rational mind that has goals and utility functions making this sort of choice, especially if they're lacking things like empathy or respect for the sanctity of the human mind. A cold AI with the goal of "preserve humans" as opposed to "preserve humanity in a form matching what they would like to be preserved as" could do something like this, from my perspective anyway.
