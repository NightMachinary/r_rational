  After all, it wasn't all in his head.

But doesn't Nick Bostrom's [[http://www.simulation-argument.com/simulation.html][famous essay]] already presuppose intelligent people would believe this already. So that even if you think you are in ...conclusion of that essay... then there's really no extra evidence and the conclusion of said essay isn't to do what's in your black box warning.

So then I don't understand how you can estimate likeliness from that kind of position. I still agree with your black box warning I just think the conclusion might not follow.

I feel like the chances of anyone reading this at this point who is worried about spoilers is small but oh well.
