I believe the ending is true to what what the main character believes... and what the author intended.

After all, it wasn't all in his head.

However, following the same line of thinking that other rational redditors have, when they are skeptical of threads with "you suddenly believe you have X superpower" as the truth, I put a filter of doubt on the scenario and would advise going to a psych ED if you ever found yourself in a similar situation.
