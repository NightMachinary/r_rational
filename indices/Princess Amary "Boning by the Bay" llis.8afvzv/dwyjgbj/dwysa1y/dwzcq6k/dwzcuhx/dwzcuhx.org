This is true, but the story definitely treated it more with respect to harem tropes rather than actual poly relationships. And did a good job of dealing with it without being unfair to the idea of poly relationships in general - just to relationships among these characters in particular.

Edit: correcting wording, I mean that the text does not support the idea of relationships among these various characters and Joon, except for the obvious exception.
