I know nothing about Eliezer's writings on Timeless Decision Theory (haven't gotten to that sequence yet) or very much about Game Theory, but I would LOVE to see Timeless Decision Theory and Game Theory explained via a Choose-Your-Own Adventure Book. I'd make a choice and then read the mathematical/logical implications of that choice afterwards. Maybe throw in some situations involving clones or being part of a swarm intelligence where you are part of a crowd who all make the exact same choices as you do.

I'd also would like to see a story of a person using catchy techniques to deal with akrasia written as a story for children. Teaching kids how to be motivated to do things they don't like through a good story or a song would be huge.
