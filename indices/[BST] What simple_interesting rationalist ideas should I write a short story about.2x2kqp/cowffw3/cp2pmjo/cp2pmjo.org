You and an accomplice rob a bank and steal a car to get away in. The police catch you in the stolen car, but you've already hidden the money. They're pretty sure you're also the bank robbers, but they have no proof that will stand up in court. You'll both get a year in prison for stealing the car, and you'd both get ten years for the bank robbery if you were dumb enough to talk.

The police would much rather get a conviction for the bank robbery though, and they're smart. They offer both of you a plea bargain - claim the other person is the bank robbing mastermind that led you astray, and you'll get a light probation while your accomplice gets 20 years in prison. However, if you both do this, they'll have enough evidence to put you both behind bars for 10 years. They're holding the two of you separately, so you can't discuss this.

That's the classic prisoner's dilemma, and you've probably heard it before. To summarize:

#+begin_quote
  Both stay silent: 1 year prison for both of you

  You rat, accomplice stays silent: light probation for you, 20 years for them

  Your accomplice rats: 20 years for you, light probation for them

  You both rat: 10 years in prison for both of you
#+end_quote

You can't control your accomplice's decision here. If they stay silent, you can avoid a year in prison by ratting on them. If they rat on you, you can avoid ten years in prison by ratting on them. So, regardless of what they choose, the action that helps you is to rat. Unfortunately, this is the same logic as your accomplice uses, and you both get 10 years in prison, instead of the both getting 1 you'd have preferred.

That's a classic problem in game theory, and there are various solutions to it, some more satisfying than others.
