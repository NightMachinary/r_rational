The deer is the king of the forest. He marches around to make sure everything is alright.

The bear is angry as the deer's march wakes him up in the morning. "You stupid clumsy oaf! Trample away!" They got into a fight. Eventually, the sour bear left the forest.

The beaver was desolate as the deer trampled down his dam. Again and again the busy beaver built it up, because the deer was too heavy. As the winter came, the beaver had gathered too little food and starved.

The deer trampled down the hedgehogs house of leaves. The hedgehog complained, "Oh king, why do you have to march right here?" "On the left there is a moat and on the right a rock," answered the deer. "You demolish my house here." The deer worried about the hedgehog, but he could not march another path. So, together they built a new house for the hedgehog on the hill. It was bigger and nicer than the old one.

Moral: have a constructive talk instead of escalating or silently suffering.

It sounds so trite, yet I fail so often myself.
