I can't remember the formal name for the bias, but we have a tendency to think that, if we see a new weird thing, it's a special case of what we know, and usually completely miss the possibility that what we know is a special case of the new weird thing. I'd like to see a story that deals with that directly.

We can find an example of this in HPMOR. Harry finds out about magic, and one of the earlier things he thinks of is that someone built a source-of-magic machine (using standard physics or close to it) and it's responsible for the new weird thing. He doesn't consider the idea that magic is normal, and someone did something special that caused the low-magic environment he's used to. One of many ways this could have happened is if the true physical laws are dangerous, and our precursors added safety mechanisms like conservation of energy with limited specific exceptions. Any specific story like that is unlikely, but despite that, the fact that magical physics is clearly less limited than muggle physics should be a flashing red light saying that muggle physics is the special case.

I wouldn't be that surprised if Eliezer intentionally wrote that blind spot for Harry, and this bias is part of one of the last plot twists of the series. But I wouldn't be THAT surprised if even Eliezer missed the magic=normal case being the most likely one, so I'd still like to see a story explicitly about this bias.
