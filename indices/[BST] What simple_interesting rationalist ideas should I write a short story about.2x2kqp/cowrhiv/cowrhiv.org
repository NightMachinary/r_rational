"Admitting your wrongness and uncertainty is not inherently virtuous, at least not by my reckoning, but they're necessary because it's awful hard to stop being wrong if you never admit it and change your mind." ([[http://lesswrong.com/lw/i9/the_importance_of_saying_oops/][The Importance Of Saying Oops]])

Don't forget what's important! If you're going on a long trip, you will probably forget a towel, or extra socks, or some other trivial thing. Don't worry about that. But do double-check that you have your wallet, and working transportation! ([[http://lesswrong.com/lw/dm7/magic_players_how_do_i_lose/][How do I lose?]])

We (fictional characters included) often make the mistake of arguing for really stupid reasons. So I'd love a story to try to get at [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/wj/is_that_your_true_rejection/][true rejections]]. Perhaps someone doesn't want to do a thing because of Reason X, and someone points out that there is in fact a patch to Reason X, but then they still don't want to do the thing, and so what's really stopping you?
