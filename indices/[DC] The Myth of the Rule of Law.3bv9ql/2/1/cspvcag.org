  Nobody is actually shocked. Feigning shock and horror just makes for good rhetoric in favor of changing policy: we are all used to the world being wrong, but we also carry an inner sense that we ought to be shocked and appalled, that however cynical we may be, the right thing is still that a Clean Air Act ought to clean up the air.

So you shouldn't have done that.
