  Now, in a case such as this, one might be tempted to "interpret" the overreaching and unfair sales practices of the studio as fraudulent (28) and allow Agnes to recover her money. However, this is precisely the sort of solution that our reformed, determinate contract law is designed to outlaw. Therefore, it would seem that since Agnes has voluntarily contracted for the dance lessons, she is liable to pay the full amount for them. This might seem to be a harsh result for Agnes, but from now on, vulnerable little old ladies will be on notice to be more careful in their dealings.

Or you could simply say: upholding the sale requires imposing the larger optimization burden on the weaker agent, thus resulting in a state with a greater mismatch between imposed duty and ability. A greater mismatch between imposed duty and ability has a much lower expected utility, a much higher expected unpleasant surprise, and this fact is only hidden in common legal speech by dragging out the concept of punishment /as if punishment for failure could retrocausally make the obligations more tractable./

  But the myth of the rule of law does more than render the people submissive to state authority; it also turns them into the state's accomplices in the exercise of its power. For people who would ordinarily consider it a great evil to deprive individuals of their rights or oppress politically powerless minority groups will respond with patriotic fervor when these same actions are described as upholding the rule of law.

Duh.

  The same is true of the violence directed against the nonviolent civil rights protestors in the American South during the civil rights movement. Although much of the white population of the southern states held racist beliefs, one cannot account for the overwhelming support given to the violent repression of these protests on the assumption that the vast majority of the white Southerners were sadistic racists devoid of moral sensibilities.

A couple more decades on, I think we actually /can/ go ahead and say that the vast majority of white Southerners were sadistic racists and morally wrong. It's just unproductive, and therefore impolite, to say this to their faces.

  Although they have been subjected to much derision by mainstream legal theorists, (33) as long as we continue to believe that the law must be a state monopoly, there really is nothing wrong, or even particularly unique, about the Crits' line of argument.
#+end_quote

Actually, there /is/ something particularly unique about them: they argue that the law is /radically/ indeterminate, that we cannot even have /measurable, quantified/ uncertainty about it, but must instead regard everything from contract law to no-ax-murder-law as the unilateral imposition of the powerful, no matter how participatory or democratic the electoral and legislative processes may have actually been.

We can also see, quite obviously, that these "critical" interpretations of law are often used to apologize for violence wielded by groups who happen to be supported by the Left: for instance, the Manson cult and various "brown people" ethnonationalist movements (Black Power, La Raza, the PLO, etc.). Since everyone /not/ in direct support of /all/ kinds of left-wing violence can see that the law (ie: the heuristic embodying society's political consensus) overwhelmingly prohibits mass murder of civilians (ie: the political consensus is very broad and clear, and thus the law can be read one way with high measure), we can adequately sum up the matter as, "Terrorism is a crime."

  Although only the Crits may recognize it, all are engaged in a political struggle to impose their version of "the good" on the rest of society. And as long as the law remains the exclusive province of the state, this will always be the case.

Yes, and?

  After this experience, Socrates came to realize that there was no place for him in the political realm. As a result, he went off to college where he took up the study of philosophy. Eventually, he got a Ph.D., became a philosophy professor, and was never heard from again.

Bottom kek. You mean he /didn't/ go off to design a superintelligent robot that would understand what shoes are for?

#+begin_quote
  What if law is not a unique product that must be supplied on a one-size-fits-all basis by the state, but one which could be adequately supplied by the ordinary play of market forces? What if we were to try Socrates' solution and end the monopoly of law?
