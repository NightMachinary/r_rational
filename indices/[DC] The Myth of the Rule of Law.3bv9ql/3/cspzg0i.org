The proposed solution sounds horrendous - an overlapping patchwork of different jurisdictions with different rules and not even any attempt at high-minded universal application.

Union rules and HOA rules were cited as model examples when the impression I get is that they're both prone to a potential failure mode where you get petty-minded people making narrowly biased judgements in favour of a small segment of the population with little opportunity to appeal to any sense of universality... although, even as I write that I'm mentally hearing the response "Same goes for The Law as it is now, just with a different demographic bias". That said, when the same law applies to everyone, everyone has a stake in making it fair; with HOAs especially there seems to be a tendency towards apathy on the part of everyone who isn't a sociopathic little tinpot dicatator, seeking to exert any small measure of power any way they can get hold of it... and they're the last people I want to be subject to.

Separate underlying flaw that occurs to me; if there's a "market" in different courts and resolution processes to choose from, how exactly do we resolve the question of which one a case should be brought before? Surely everyone will seek to move it to whichever jurisdiction favours their own interests (and whoever wields the most influence will win out). There was a mention of medieval law where you had "village, shire, urban, merchant, manorial, ecclesiastical, or royal courts" and not a word on how they decided where to hold a trial or what recourse you had if the choice of venue was unfair to you; just moved on to "and in the modern world we could have so many more options than that". I'm imagining getting a notice in the post saying I'm being sued (or rather, invited to negotiate a dispute resolution) under the jurisdiction of "Discount Jim's Legal Services and Auto Parts"... how do you even respond to that? I guess just by ignoring it, and hoping we haven't also crowd-sourced the part of the Law that goes around arresting people for non-attendance.

Also, you can try to push a "compositional" model where social pressure from the community compels participants to resolve their dispute via negotiation and compromise, and that /sounds/ vaguely nice, but I have to question whether that kind of close-knit community still exists, that could exert that kind of solidarity and make the consequences of being uncooperative and adversarial sufficiently bad to dissuade people from it.

And even if it does still exist, I'm back to the pit-of-stomach feeling of dread saying that a little local court is going to be hideously unfair to any outsiders that the community decides to gang up on. Would make your equality before the law subject to your social standing in your local community and that's just never a good idea.
