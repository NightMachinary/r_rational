had to downvote. regardless of whether or not the point being argued is "correct" or not, this is a sub for /rational fiction/, not political screeds. off topic posts, imho, are appropriate only insofar as they match the theme of the subreddit. this seems more like a half-assed attempt to push one's own political agenda than anything to do with fiction.
