  citizens understand that the laws under which they live are a product of political forces rather than the embodiment of the ideal of justice
#+end_quote

Since when were political forces not an inherent part of the ideal of justice?

#+begin_quote
  This, however, in no way prevents people from simultaneously regarding the law as a body of definite, politically neutral rules amenable to an impartial application which all citizens have a moral obligation to obey.
#+end_quote

Sighh..... Another good thinker lost to the wiles of propositional logic. The real world doesn't have Boolean truth-values! It has real-valued measurements. I'm sure everyone on this subreddit has heard the term "probability" before.

Well, the law is no exception. Many parts of the law are so clearly agreed-upon (to the tune of "ax murder is bad, mmkay?") that we can, in practice, treat them /as if/ they were definite, politically-neutral rules amenable to impartial application and moral obligation. We can do so precisely because they are not politically /neutral/ but in near-total political consensus. The Left doesn't like ax-murderers, the Right doesn't like ax-murderers -- /mostly/ (see: horseshoe theory).

  Thus, they seem both surprised and dismayed to learn that the Clean Air Act might have been written, not to produce the cleanest air possible, but to favor the economic interests of the miners of dirty-burning West Virginia coal (West Virginia coincidentally being the home of Robert Byrd, who was then chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee) over those of the miners of cleaner-burning western coal.

Nobody is actually shocked. Feigning shock and horror just makes for good rhetoric in favor of changing policy: we are all /used to/ the world being wrong, but we also carry an inner sense that we /ought/ to be shocked and appalled, that however cynical we may be, the /right thing/ is still that a Clean Air Act ought to clean up the air. Unfortunately, we are indeed cynical: there are indeed so many moral problems that we can't /actually/ experience them all in a "smack on the face" emotional way without burning out half our brains.

So instead, good rhetoricians find ways to summon up the "smack in the face" emotional effect of wrongness /temporarily/, use it to rally people for improving matters, and then let it fade back into the general Cosmic Background Bleckness of daily life that we stay sane by (mostly) ignoring.

This is also what makes candidates like Bernie Sanders or Rick Santorum effective: people are /genuinely/ pleasantly surprised, and more than a little interested, to see a politician who appears to /actually believe what he says/ (even if it also genuinely shocks and appalls 50% of the population).

  And, when the Supreme Court hands down a controversial ruling on a subject such as abortion, civil rights, or capital punishment, then, like Louis in Casablanca, the public is shocked, shocked to find that the Court may have let political considerations influence its decision.
#+end_quote

Were they really shocked, /shocked/, in 1995, to find this out? Because I'm pretty sure everyone knew damn well what was going on. People weren't substantially stupider in 1995 than they are today.

  the amazing degree to which the federal government is able to exert its control over a supposedly free people.
#+end_quote

The what now?

  I refer to the myth of the rule of law because, to the extent this phrase suggests a society in which all are governed by neutral rules that are objectively applied by judges, there is no such thing. As a myth, however, the concept of the rule of law is both powerful and dangerous. Its power derives from its great emotive appeal. The rule of law suggests an absence of arbitrariness, an absence of the worst abuses of tyranny.
#+end_quote

Certainly there is a great absence of, for instance, beheading women you don't like on accusations of sorcery in the United States, so I'm actually inclined to say there /is/ an absence of arbitrariness and the worst abuses of tyranny.

Of course, on the local scale, things can be much, much worse. A policeman can openly say, "!@##$%, I'll /make/ a reason to lock you up!", and perform other such deeds of arbitrariness and tyranny. But these are not at the behest of a federal government, under a pretended auspice of rule-of-law, but instead at the behest of locally powerful individuals, under a non-pretended auspice of personal authority that stands sovereign /against/ the centralized, rule-governed state.

#+begin_quote
  I have suggested that because the law consists of contradictory rules and principles, sound legal arguments will be available for all legal conclusions, and hence, the normative predispositions of the decisionmakers, rather than the law itself, determine the outcome of cases. It should be noted, however, that this vastly understates the degree to which the law is indeterminate. For even if the law were consistent, the individual rules and principles are expressed in such vague and general language that the decisionmaker is able to interpret them as broadly or as narrowly as necessary to achieve any desired result.
#+end_quote

I'm so sorry that you can't dispense with the need for human beings to possess a sense of morality just by writing words on paper /s!

  Following oral argument, the judges retire to consider their ruling. Arnie, mindful of his agreement with Ann, is scrupulously careful not to let political considerations enter into his analysis of the case. Thus, he begins by asking himself why society needs contract law in the first place. He decides that the objective, nonpolitical answer is obviously that society needs some mechanism to ensure that individuals honor their voluntarily undertaken commitments. From this perspective, the resolution of the present case is clear. Since the professor is obviously threatening to go back on her voluntarily undertaken commitment in order to extort more money from the FRA, Arnie characterizes the case as one in which a promise has been made to pay more for services which the professor is already contractually bound to perform, and decides that the promise is unenforceable. Hence, he votes to overturn the trial court's decision. Ann, also mindful of her agreement with Arnie, is meticulous in her efforts to ensure that she decides this case purely on the law. Accordingly, she begins her analysis by asking herself why society needs contract law in the first place. She decides that the objective, nonpolitical answer is obviously that it provides an environment within which people can exercise the freedom to arrange their lives as they see fit. From this perspective, the resolution of the present case is clear. Since the FRA is essentially attempting to prevent the professor from arranging her life as she sees fit, Ann characterizes the case as one in which the parties have simultaneously rescinded an existing contract and negotiated a new one, and decides that the promise is enforceable. Hence, she votes to uphold the trial court's decision. This once again leaves the deciding vote up to Bennie, who has no idea why society needs contract law, but thinks that the professor is taking advantage of the situation in an unfair way and votes to overturn the trial court's ruling.
#+end_quote

Of course, one of these lines of reasoning is virtue-theoretical and deontological in nature, while the other one is consequentialist. Thus, Ann is closer to being correct here, although I would certainly say you need to finely parse which decision will minimize the total unpleasant surprise of society.

  This is because the law is always open to interpretation and there is no such thing as a normatively neutral interpretation. The way one interprets the rules of law is always determined by one's underlying moral and political beliefs.
#+end_quote

DUH! Law is only ever a heuristic for morality!

#+begin_quote
  Unless your responses were: 1) False, 2) True, 3) True, 4) False, 5) True, 6) True, and 7) True, you chose to interpret at least one of the words "Congress," "no," "law," "speech," and "press" in what can only be described as something other than its ordinary sense. Why did you do this? Were your responses based on the "plain meaning" of the words or on certain normative beliefs you hold about the extent to which the federal government should be allowed to interfere with citizens' expressive activities? Were your responses objective and neutral or were they influenced by your "politics"?
#+end_quote

Actually, I have to say, my responses were colored entirely by what little I know (ie: what they taught me when I volunteered with a Civil Liberties Union once) of how the Supreme Court has ruled on these matters before.
