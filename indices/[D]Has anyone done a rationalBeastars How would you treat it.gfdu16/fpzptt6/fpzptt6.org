Mandatory teeth and claw filing. Pepper spray or equivalent carried by prey. Pepper flavored soap and shampoo for every prey. Tasers for preys. School classes on how to detect and determine when a predator is likely to attack, locations with highest risk, behaviors you can use to tell with high accuracy when a predator is near losing control.

​

Basically any remotely socially capable group of prey would have a big advantage over any predator ever in politics and pretty much every other situation where proper social behavior is desirable.

​

They can anger predators then accuse them of attempting an attack, bait political enemies implying they are going to attack them, use specific scents that increase the likelihood predator attacks, and infinite variations of this to the Nnth degree. Basically either predators or prey would be second class citizens, or their society wouldn't work.

​

PS. It'd be very VERY difficult to beat millions of years of evolutionary psychology to make these 2 groups safely live together. Probably impossible in a manner that even comes close to our modern ideals of equality.
