It's not been clear, what you want to discuss from the start. So I'm assuming you want examples of paperclip optimizers that are harmful and yet can still get what they want consistently without getting caught.

It so happens that I know an example, the group of people that has the highest number / percentage of serial killers that are probably on the loose and not even suspected are truck drivers.

It's the perfect job for them, they can pick up some hitchhiker, do their paperclipping, deal with the evidence and be virtually scot free. They aren't suspects because they don't know the victim, work alone, have no oversight, are in remote places often, and never stay in the same place for long.

What they should do depends on their specific sense of morals. Ideally they'd turn themselves in, and opt not to reproduce and pass on their genes to anybody else.

Since that's not likely an option, cause the least amount of harm they can, avoid victims that have close families, focus on causing the least amount pain overhaul, that kind of thing.

Hopefully this is what you wanted..
