  There's no imposition on men to be less of a physical threat.

Men aren't 90kg, 6th tall wolves or bears with sharp teeth and jaws strong enough to break and gauge necks in a single bite. Nor do we have sharp claws. Both of which serve no purpose in their modern society.

  Only few women carry pepper spray and similar.

I'd argue the comparative danger / risk here is much higher than our own. We are talking about big beasts trying to eat you alive, and no irl people don't pass out from pain. And actual people without anime constitution, healing and lasting damage dismissiveness.

  No women use repulsive scents or similar.

There's a lot of scientific literature and evidence that many women that have been abused become overweight as a defense mechanism.

Even when they participate in studies and diets that actually work and make them lose weight they tend to relapse and regain their weight when they start noticing signs of male sexual interest.

It's often sited in psychology circles, and a lot of scientists are trying to develop treatments. So maybe not "repulsive scents", but plenty of women consciously adopt an 'unappealing appearance' for most males to decrease the risk of sexual assault.

  The lack of those things in the real world implies that either that either there are rational reasons for why 'prey' don't take those precautions or our current behavioural system is fundementally irrational.

My point is these are very different scenarios. Most women are plenty careful when in dangerous scenarios and situations, and are very likely to avoid those situations entirely. It's one of our male privileges to not notice it very often.
