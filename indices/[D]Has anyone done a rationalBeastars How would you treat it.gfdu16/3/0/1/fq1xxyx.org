I'd expect the herding instinct of many herbivores to give rise, in an uplifted herbivorous species, to a strong desire for at least one member of every family (if not more) to become a bodyguard; such that in any mixed-species setting, there's always, like, ten herbivorous bodyguards just standing watchfully at the back of the room, hands on firearms, waiting for anyone to make a move. Also, obviously, a complementary strong urge in those who aren't the bodyguards, to have those bodyguards around, and to never go anywhere without them.
