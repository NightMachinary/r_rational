Hmmm, I can't really think of a good way to ratfic Beastars in a way that would be actually meaningful. Setting is already pretty rock solid, to be honest. Legosi & Company grappling with their Inner Animals and the societal pressures surrounding him is kinda the whole point too. What problems with rational!Legosi be more equipped to deal with? Genetically modifying instincts out of people? If it's trying to effect social change, then Louis is kinda already following a very precise path towards gaining the prestige necessary. The Panda guy filling the market's need for actual meat by using ethically sourced hospitals and such to run his Black Market is another great example of dealing with a very thorny societal problem in the most ethical way possible.

I just don't think this is a source material that is conducive to a ratfic story. You could have an interesting time brainstorming worldbuilding tidbits, such as self-training methods to smother the carnivore instinct, but making bigger changes besides "it's Legosi but he is smarter" would erode the source material too much for me.
