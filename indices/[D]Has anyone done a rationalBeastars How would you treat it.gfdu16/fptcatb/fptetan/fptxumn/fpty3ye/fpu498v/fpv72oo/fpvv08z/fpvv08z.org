I think that's a fair inference, but to me it reads more like an inconsistency - if carnivores had that much power, I'm not sure there would be so much pretense of equality in the schools (e.g. carnivores getting bullied by prey animals). I would also expect the story to take place amidst herbivores agitating for their rights (again, unless they're explicitly oppressed and just live at the sufferance of carnivores).

E.g., it's "oh no, another devouring, how horrible!" Rather than "another devouring, maybe the [equal rights group] has a point about herbivores being allowed to own weapons", or "Another one. Fucking carnivores". Also, the meat market probably wouldn't be so secretive or taboo if things were more carnivore controlled. Plus Louis gets a gun somehow and clearly knows how to use it.

It just seems like canon beastars is much more concerned with telling its coming of age and star crossed romance story than it is with following through on its setting and social commentary.
