Hmm. Maybe carnivores-as-subclass because when guns were invented, herbivores were more effective at working together effectively and won the war. Carnivores were sanctioned heavily, essentially as vengeance for their historical depredation. Now carnivores are permitted to live, but are heavily discriminated against and kept subordinate by threats of force, and are not permitted to own weapons or organize significantly.

​

If you're okay with it being different, you could give it japan-occupied china vibes like Ip man, or pull on post WWI germany for the simmering resentment. It could be an interesting "will it end in fascism or will they win civil rights" dynamic.

If you want it to be a little truer to source, you could play it like a Ruby Bridges scenario where Legosi is an experiment with reintegration of schools, and he was picked because he's more docile than many wolves, but puberty and being physically bullied by herbivores is a struggle for him. There would also still be room for the love subplot, but now it's super forbidden and the basis for further conflict and discrimination.

​

For either option, a layer of complication which you'd probably have to add for the setting to be cohesive would be the role of omnivores and carrion eaters in the historical conflict - which side of the tenuous peace were they on, and where do their sympathies lie? Could have carrion eaters who were on the herbivore side because they saw how the wind was blowing, but dislike that everything is meat substitutes now and sympathize with the losing carnivores. Or you could have omnivores who were unfairly lumped in with carnivores and have a superiority complex over them, maybe occupying a middle social stratum. Extremist carnivores would see them as traitors, extremist herbivores would still look down on them.
