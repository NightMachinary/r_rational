You just don't notice the degree to which you're controlled by your instincts because you're a human! I'm sure a sentient rabbit would have all sorts of observations about your behavior and correctly attribute them to your human instincts.

In general, I think there's definitely people in this world who would not refrain from certain actions which significantly improved their quality of life, even if it meant killing people (even if they morally believed it wrong, even if their society put a taboo on it). If you don't agree with the point when it comes to meat, just consider the general case.
