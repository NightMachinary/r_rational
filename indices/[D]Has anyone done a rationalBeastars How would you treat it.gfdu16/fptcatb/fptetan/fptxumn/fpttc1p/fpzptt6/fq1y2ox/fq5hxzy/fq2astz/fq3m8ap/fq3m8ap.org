  the OP says it's undesirable, specially when they are supposed to be living in a relatively modern society setting.

Well, yes, it's undesirable, due to the consequences. Presumably the people who do it anyway are people with impulse-control problems. But people who /know they have/ impulse-control problems, can plan around those.

Let me put it this way: if you know you're inevitably an arsonist, i.e. someone who has a /compulsion/ to set things on fire, then---presuming there's no clear way to just /preclude yourself from being an arsonist/---wouldn't you rather be an arsonist who 1. (even if you're a sociopath) avoids long-term personal consequences for your actions; and 2. (if you're not a sociopath) causes the least global-utility harm in the course of your arson? Maybe by, say, going into demolitions as a career?

  I'm assuming they have other animals that aren't actually sentient they can eat for sustenance.

Again, having not watched the show---I've been assuming the whole problem with the "urge to kill+eat prey" in the show, was because the carnivores were being forced to eat only vegetables/grains mixed with alternative protein sources (i.e. how cheap cat food is made), and so were in some sense feeling this unsatisfied instinctual drive.

I feel like the whole premise of the show would be defused if there were non-uplifted animals, because if they existed in the setting, there'd be absolutely no (diegetic) reason that carnivores couldn't just get their ya-yas out by /hunting live specimens/ of those species. It's not like they're obligate-humanivore vampires; the death throes of a pig/rabbit/etc. as they eat it alive are presumably /just as satisfying/ as those of a demihuman.
