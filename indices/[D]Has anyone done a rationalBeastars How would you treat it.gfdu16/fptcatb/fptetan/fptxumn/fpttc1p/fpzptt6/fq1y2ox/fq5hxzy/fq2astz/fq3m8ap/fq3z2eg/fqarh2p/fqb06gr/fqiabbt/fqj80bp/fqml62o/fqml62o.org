  If they are different species it'd have to be some really elaborate scenario where they developed at the same rate or met at the exact right time where their technology levels were identical.

The usual assumption with any story with intelligent demihuman animals in a hard sci-fi setting is some sort of bioengineered "uplift virus", which, over a very short period of time, mutated both the bodies and brains of all animal species it could infect, into their present forms. They all just wake up sentient one day.

The other assumption some settings make, is that some precursor species (humans, usually) uplifted all these animal species within a bioengineering lab as test subjects; and they escaped, revolted, and banded together through a shared hatred of their captors to destroy the entire precursor species. This isn't implausible in terms of effort/impact, if this is happening on a recently-terraformed or colonized planet, used as an isolation environment for such experimentation, with no native fauna, and the only humans being the workers at the lab.
