Even then you wouldn't expect it to last. In the long run natures optimization processes would take over and equality would disappears.

You'd still expect there to be a most optimal, or fit species that'd end up on the long run becoming the dominant and eventually only relevant species in that environment.

If not species, then it jumps to something else, i.e culture, religion, society. Just look at earth, non optimal groups were replaced, not necessarily via death, but often so.

It's just how 'Life' as in biological life, rather than our life, works. It's an optimization game, that's basically what evolution is. It just so happens that it extends past species when there's isn't another species to compete with and other selection methods become available, i.e societies and it's customs, and eventually ideas.

It doesn't mean the replaced species in a multi species society would disappear, just that they'd become a powerless minority which ends up meaning inequality.
