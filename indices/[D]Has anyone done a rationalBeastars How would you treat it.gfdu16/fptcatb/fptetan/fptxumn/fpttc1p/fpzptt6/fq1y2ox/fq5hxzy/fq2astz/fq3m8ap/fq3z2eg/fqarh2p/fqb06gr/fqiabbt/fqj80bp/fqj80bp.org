You see my point of view on this is that it's not possible. Evolutionary psychology wise, it's just not a thing. That society couldn't work in an equality manner similar to one we'd find pleasant, given those two groups.

They could potentially live together with the prey in power and the predators as second class citizens. If the predators were in power I don't think they'd bother keeping the prey around, maybe for labor, but if these animals grow at a rate similar to humans, which seems to be the case given schools, they just aren't viable livestock.

The predators could keep the prey in reserves, similar to the native american ones around. Or give them a country / island and leave them be as a more humane option.

i.e I don't think it's possible without too much authorial bs, to the point that I'd even bother consider it.

Between aliens, sure they could coexist, between 2 sentient species that evolved together with one preying on the other, no. Maybe with genetic manipulation to a degree nobody would be comfortable with otherwise, never.

We are talking about millions of years of evolution, which curiously doesn't just affect our bodies without touching our brains or psychology. It's too much.

I presume you know why we have rapists, psychopaths, and every other kind of criminal imaginable ? If not, it's simple for a long time, enough for these tactics and adaptations to evolve and be selected for, those strategies worked, they gave them enough advantages to be passed on repeatedly.

It's not to say those people can't be helped or treated, but it's very difficult and costly and often not worth the effort, even in our own world where there are very feel of them.

With aliens it's a very difficult and complex subject. People are really uncomfortable assigning differing levels of intelligence to different types of sentient beings. Generally in a same planet basis, it's very difficult to come to a condition that ends in equality.

If the species have the same origin generally the most optimal one will take over to a point where everything else is replaced as happened here with the different human species that coexisted.

If they are different species it'd have to be some really elaborate scenario where they developed at the same rate or met at the exact right time where their technology levels were identical.

In space it'd be very similar, either a very elaborate scenario is required or there'd need to be a very powerful and influential species that forced every other species to treat each other with a semblance of equality.

Even within the same species equality is almost impossible, among different species with different intelligence and technology levels it'd need to be enforced by some higher entity to happen at all.
