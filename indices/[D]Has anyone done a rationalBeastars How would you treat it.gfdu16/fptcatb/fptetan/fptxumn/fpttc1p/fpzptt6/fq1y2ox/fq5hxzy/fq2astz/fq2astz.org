  Pepper? Can carnivores mostly not eat piperine? I'd expect denatonium

Specifics and optimal chemicals are beyond the scope of my 1 line possible option.

  I'm assuming here that predators want to eat prey species, not just need to; and so they actually would prefer, if possible, to eat them before going into a berserker rage, since then they have more control over the situation and can potentially "get away with it."

I'm assuming that's not the case seeing that the OP says it's undesirable, specially when they are supposed to be living in a relatively modern society setting.

Food consumption is not an issue brought up. I'm assuming they have other animals that aren't actually sentient they can eat for sustenance.

If some fraction of them enjoys or wants to eat sentient animals in a criminal manner that's beyond the scope of my comment.
