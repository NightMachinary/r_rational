I'm not talking about what should be done /to/ them; I'm talking about what /they/ should do.

What we're basically talking about is a set of interacting societies/species, where the societies' members have incompatible preference-functions. Like in [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/HawFh7RvDM4RyoJ2d/three-worlds-collide-0-8][Three Worlds Collide]]. Or like Crystal in the [[http://crystal.raelifin.com/][Crystal Trilogy]].

It sort of sounds like you're suggesting that the best course of action, if you're a /eusocial/† paperclipper-agent that arises on Earth, is to submit yourself to the human authorities for the good /of/ humanity. But that certainly doesn't sound like it'd produce very many paperclips.

† eusocial = one that wants to see /other paperclipper-agents/ thrive, and therefore may have generalized mirror-neurons that allow it to /somewhat/ empathize with humans the way humans /somewhat/ empathize with animals

And, if fully half the population of a shared world were such eusocial paperclippers...
