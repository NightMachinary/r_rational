/Pepper/? Can carnivores mostly not eat piperine? I'd expect [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denatonium][denatonium]].

Wouldn't this be an arms race? I'm assuming here that predators /want/ to eat prey species, not just /need/ to; and so they actually would prefer, if possible, to eat them /before/ going into a berserker rage, since then they have more control over the situation and can potentially "get away with it." If that's true, then predators would be all about figuring out ways to get prey-species people to /volunteer/ themselves to be eaten.

Like, say, drugging people with chemicals that cause depression and suicidal ideation in hopes that they eventually decide life is not worth living, at which point they can jump in and offer to eat them as a means of assisted suicide.

Or, like, creating extreme sports (think BASE jumping) with high chances of death, and heavily marketing them, while also setting up certain predators as the instructors [probably because they paid for the privilege], and making the participants sign a participation waiver with fine print that says that in a remote wilderness environment, the instructor has final say on how to dispose of their body in the event that they die in an accident and are unable to be transported home.

Or, a more "interesting" case: I'd presume that carnivores would run all the abortion clinics.

(Tangent: do egg-laying demihumans exist in this world? Do they sell their unfertilized eggs on the open market as a foodstuff for carnivores and obligate ovivores to eat? Would it be unusual for a snake-man to date a chicken-woman under the expectation of being able to eat her eggs?)

--------------

I would also point out that, in reality, carnivores don't only eat herbivores. /Most/ carnivorous species eat other carnivorous species! If that dynamic persists in this setting, then I'd expect carnivores to /maybe/ maintain some sort of blas√© "if you can beat me, you deserve to eat me" kind of sentiment when in the company of other carnivore species---sort of like cultivators in the more cruel Xianxia stories; and it'd only be in interactions with herbivores where this dynamic would be called into question.

Also, I haven't watched the show: do non-uplifted animals not exist in this setting (any more)? Can carnivores not, in fact, just eat the cow-cows, instead of the cow-people? Can society not just keep livestock around for carnivores to preferentially attack in case of a sudden rage (much like one would imagine a werewolf would)?
