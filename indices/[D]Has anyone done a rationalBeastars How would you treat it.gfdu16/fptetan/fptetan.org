I've only seen the anime, but... How the hell did their society come into place? It would take something incredibly unlikely for a bunch of of different evolved species to integrate their societies like that, even without the fact that half of them have an instinctual desire to kill and eat the other half. What I'm saying is that I would want to see the epic, world-changing series of events that could lead to a story like the one portrayed in the manga where wolves and rabbits go to the same late-20th century/early-21st century high school.
