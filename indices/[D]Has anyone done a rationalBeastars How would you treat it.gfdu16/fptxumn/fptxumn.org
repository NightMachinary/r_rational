The thing which killed me about the setting was that modern guns exist (automatic handguns imply automatic rifles imply machine/submachine guns). It felt like it really kicked the legs out from under the "but carnivores are so much stronger" thing which is so core to the series.

If someone ratfic'd it I think it would have to be with a reimagining of the setting.
