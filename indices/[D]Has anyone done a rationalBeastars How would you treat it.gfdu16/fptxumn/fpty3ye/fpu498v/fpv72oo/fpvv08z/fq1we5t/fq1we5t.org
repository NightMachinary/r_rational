  if carnivores had that much power, I'm not sure there would be so much pretense of equality in the schools (e.g. carnivores getting bullied by prey animals).

What if it was that carnivores are elected by a mostly-herbivorous base? Because, y'know, food web---fewer of each species as nutritional demand goes up. (Now it's essentially a class allegory: 99% of voters are in, well, the 99%, but almost all candidates come from the wealthy "political class", because you get taught politics at your daddy's knee.)

Also, what if this dynamic was only stable for international-realpolitik reasons? (I.e., if herbivores elected carnivores to represent them, because they think carnivores are better at intimidating /other countries'/ also-mostly-herbivore populations into cooperation/trade concessions/etc.? Or also, that the richer herbivores that run PACs, would think that carnivores would make more effective leaders in potential wartime---which might always be simmering in such a world---due to their ability to intimidate /their own/ populations [and their appropriations committees] into a high-budgeted war footing more quickly?)
