The food chain aspect isn't fantasy. Most of us already eat sentient beings as it is, and those of us that don't often have to override significant instincts and cravings (and perhaps even a degree of vitality, depending on which nutritionists you believe) to do so.

At the same time many of us maintain close emotional inter-species bonds, often with creatures that would ordinarily be our prey in another context. And we are happy to condemn people who eat what we consider pets, so we even have the same taboo aspect here.

So how do we deal with it? That is how it would be dealt with in a realistic story. The fact that it's a taboo yet still super common isn't unrealistic at all. (Inb4 "but it would be different if the prey were intelligent" it would be good to remember that slavery was a historical default.)

I think if we actually had multiple sentient species, the story would be about a lot _more_ than just predator prey relationships. That's really just one aspect of inter species interaction. Consider different physical capabilities (some people can fly!), different mental aptitudes, etc.
