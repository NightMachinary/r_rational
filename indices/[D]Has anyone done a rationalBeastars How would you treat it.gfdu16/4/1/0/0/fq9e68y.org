  Mandatory teeth and claw filing
#+end_quote

There's no imposition on men to be less of a physical threat.

#+begin_quote
  Pepper spray or equivalent carried by prey.
#+end_quote

Only few women carry pepper spray and similar.

#+begin_quote
  Pepper flavored soap and shampoo for every prey.
#+end_quote

No women use repulsive scents or similar.

#+begin_quote
  Tasers for preys
#+end_quote

Almost no women carry tasers.

And so forth.

The lack of those things in the real world implies that either that either there are rational reasons for why 'prey' don't take those precautions or our current behavioural system is fundementally irrational.
