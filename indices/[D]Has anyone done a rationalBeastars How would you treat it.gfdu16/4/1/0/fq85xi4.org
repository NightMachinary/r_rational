  I think you're making very strong assumptions. The predator prey is clearly an allegory for sexual assault and we don't see the tendencies you describe in our world.

Can you elaborate ? What tendencies ? Please be more specific, quotes would be appreciated.

Yes I know it's almost certainly an allegory for sexual assault, I state it in other comments on this thread, I speak this way because almost nothing is 100% certain.. We are on [[/r/rational][r/rational]] it's normally how we talk here.
