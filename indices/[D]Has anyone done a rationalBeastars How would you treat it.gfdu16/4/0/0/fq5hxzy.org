Not watched the show, but read the manga-

  do egg-laying demihumans exist in this world?
#+end_quote

Yes, and they sell unfertilised eggs on the open market. There's a side chapter from the point of view of a hen who does this, and takes pride in producing high-quality eggs for people to eat. This is considered fine and non-taboo; however, at one point an egg is found to have somehow been fertilized and there's a stillborn/(premature?) chicken, i.e. child inside. The group of carnivores who are eating lunch at that moment have to deal with this, with some of them wanting to treat it as a rare opportunity to eat real, live meat and some of them (protagonist) horrified because of his social upbringing.

  do non-uplifted animals not exist in this setting (any more)?
#+end_quote

No. The only non-sapient animals are insects, which are legal to eat, no smarter than real-life insects, and mulched for meat substitutes. (Though the main character does, eventually empaphize with even them in a way somewhat analogous to real-life vegetarianism, leading to an interesting, yet somewhat comedic scene where he ritualistically consumes a grub after fasting for a week in a manner reminiscent of ancestral tribes worshipping the spirit of the animals that fed them, metaphorically absorbing its life force. He's later visited, in a dream, by the spirit of the insect the grub would have become.)
