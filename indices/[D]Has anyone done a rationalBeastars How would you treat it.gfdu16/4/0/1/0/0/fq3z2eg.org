  Presumably the people who do it anyway are people with impulse-control problems. But people who know they have impulse-control problems, can plan around those.

Let me put it this way, if someone has weak impulse control and harmful / dangerous urges they need to be put away. They are not fit to live in our society, it's why we have prisons and hospices.

Some might be able to avoid it by being very capable of hiding their actions but that still doesn't change what should be done to them. If they can find a workaround or channel it in a non harmful way they don't necessarily have weak impulse control.

  I feel like the whole premise of the show would be defused if there were non-uplifted animals, because if they existed in the setting, there'd be absolutely no (diegetic) reason that carnivores couldn't just get their ya-yas out by hunting live specimens of those species.

There's still fish and crustaceans. I don't see the problem the analogy is from what I can tell just an instinctual urge the predators have to kill prey. Not something related to hunger or an inherent need, just their brain going that'd be an easy target, go get it. That's why I implied it was a japanese allegory for rape apologists, which it likely is.
