I started to write my own post but realized I was mostly reiterating what you said.

Add to your points:

- They ran out of non-violent creativity in a measly ~40 years?" I'm pretty sure I have more than 40 years worth of stories to write even if I never read or learned another thing, and...
- ...they couldn't fill time learning? There's an infinite amount of math to be learned / invented. Dance, language, sports, martial arts, juggling, acting, music composition, painting, pottery, rock climbing, astronomy... Seriously, if you're bored in the modern era then it's your own darn fault.
