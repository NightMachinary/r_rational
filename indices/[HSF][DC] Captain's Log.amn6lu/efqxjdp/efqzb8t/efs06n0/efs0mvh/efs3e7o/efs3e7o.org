It's not exactly clear that one's latest memories should disappear (and in such a fashion) as opposed to the more logical erasure of the past. (Which means, instead of a crew that repeats a day/week/however long, over and over again, one could have a crew that doesn't know remember where they came from, but can make progress; an analog of a generation ship. (Except the youngest remember the furthest back.))
