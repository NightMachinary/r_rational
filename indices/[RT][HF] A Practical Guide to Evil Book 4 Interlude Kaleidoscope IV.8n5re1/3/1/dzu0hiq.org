  There a single silhouette rode a winged steed stolen from Arcadia, cloak of many colours streaming behind her.

While we've never had a full description of what an artefact is and what makes it different from 'normal' enchant, we know they can do things normal spells can't (the scrying stone captured from Akua), are very hard to damage (sorcery off a ducks back) and seem to gain power through involvement in epic deeds. From this I would guess that artefacts are the object form of Named. That's why the cloak is so tough
