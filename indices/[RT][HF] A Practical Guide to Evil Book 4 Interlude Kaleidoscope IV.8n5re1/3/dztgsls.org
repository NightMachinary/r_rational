I always wondered how that cloak has not been cut to ribbons in all the fighting that Cat does, and now I think I know.

I think narratively, the cloak is part of the Black Queen so it is also part of the "creationally fixed body" which would create the necessary link between Cat and Akua that would allow her to take over.

Otherwise it makes no sense (to me) that a soul imbued to an object would be able to jump out like that.
