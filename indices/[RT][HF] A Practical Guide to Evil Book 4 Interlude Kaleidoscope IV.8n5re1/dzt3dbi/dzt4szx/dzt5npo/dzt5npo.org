If Cat knows the safeword, then that means this is only a check against possession by Akua or some other external force. It wouldn't work against a Cat that's gone too deep into Winter, which you would normally think is the more pressing reason to have this precaution at all. Well, Winter Cat is pretty dumb and couldn't remember the details of the plan during the raid, so it might work.

Maybe all of the Woe know the safeword, so if Thief betrays Cat, any of them could undo the binding.
