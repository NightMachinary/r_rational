I'm curious as to what exactly Akua hopes to accomplish with this. Does she still want to play the villain? Or does she want to set up her clone body for herself?

Also, Catherine has quite a lot of trust in Vivienne to give her the passcode for full body lock

Or maybe she's just into that and Aqua doesn't know the safe word ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
