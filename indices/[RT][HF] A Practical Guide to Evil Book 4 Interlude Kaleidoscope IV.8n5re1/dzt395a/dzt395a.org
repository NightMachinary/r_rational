How many narratives do we have stacked up on top of one another in this battle? Good vs. Evil, repelling the foreign invaders, big army vs. small army, last minute wake up, and now overcoming possession? And is this turning out to be a Batman Gambit, a Xanatos Gambit, or is actually just total random happenstance?
