You know, I realize that the Heavenly fences don't see much use in melee, that the army of Callow now has a counter for them and that it didn't move enough for them to be feasibly deployed for denying retreat, but it's kind of strange not to see /any mention of them at all/. It's partly Malanza's own fault, for letting the siege engines meet the only force that couldn't be easily covered by the panes and seemingly leaving the other flank with no priests at all, but still, not trying to box the enemy ranged units in is questionable at the very least.
