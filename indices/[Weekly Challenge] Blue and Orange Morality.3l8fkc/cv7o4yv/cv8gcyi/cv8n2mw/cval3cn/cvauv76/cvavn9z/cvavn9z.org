Well, we don't "value" ultraviolet light and other frequencies either. I don't know if value is the right word. Other than that, we don't value their lives because we didn't notice they are sentient. Just like they probably don't value the "lives" of proteins or whatever. All a matter of scale as opposed to /actual/ unbridgeable value differences like Baby-Eating.
