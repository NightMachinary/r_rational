It annoys me when people say people are less than animals. You don't torture animal families to punish an animal, why would you do it to those less than animals? The things that suffer the most are always "above" animals.

Especially fae would they even think of animals as below them? Depends on what Fae you have I suppose.

Also I liked the references to old stuff that the King didn't know as it cements the fae longitude but I would have liked the champions spurned to have been the King's fathers decision.
