Not exactly. The person being an oathbreaker invalidates their ability to request oaths period. When Rikkart swore his vows to the King, he wasn't swearing oaths. He was speaking empty words, as the Fae don't believe in making oaths with oathbreakers. In addition, the oaths for human king guards are /human/ oaths. The Fae don't have much respect for oaths of that nature, it's barely considered an oath to them (part of what makes it so blue and orange. The Fae aren't being hypocrites in their eyes. They just don't understand how you can swear important oaths without things like spiritual observance, herb burning and family input. A human oath, to them, is like if you told the average Westerner that culture A gets married by standing in a drum circle and swearing to the moon, and the newlyweds then go off and sleep with their spouse's parent as a sign of respect. The average person would be hard pressed to understand such a marriage, let alone take it seriously, as it's so alien to what you consider a "proper" marriage to be.)
