Ah, I see what you mean. Well, it's not an honest request, as you noted. It's intended to be sarcastic and mocking. Despite saying the words, he didn't put any real intent behind them. The Fae aren't above lying, at least not to those who've committed such sacrilege.

Edit: by intent, I meant that he had no intent to actually request such a thing, so the spirits would ignore what he said.
