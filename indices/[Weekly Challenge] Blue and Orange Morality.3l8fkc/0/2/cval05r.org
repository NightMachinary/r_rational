From the very beginning they are described as having ships whose navigation is disabled through light but in the end Atlas is described as a bug himself. Also they have varied roles yet all seem to be night active. Are the characters the bugs or are they piloting the bugs and, if the second, is each one just piloting a single bug? With their ignorance of any type of vertebrae I was actually thinking that they may be some kind of micro-organism within said bugs.
