Who are the guys actually talking? Subsystems of one single bug? Wouldn't make sense with how Pepper is observing as Atlas flies away. The confusion mostly comes from the fact that in the last paragraph everything points to Atlas /his/ wings and antennae and stuff as if they were parts of Atlas himself rather than of his vessel. On the other hand the amount of "people" in the conference and them having roles like Experimenter, Scout, Biologist, Gypsy, Trader and Carrier (and not just one guy per role) points away from the idea that each of them is one bug of the same species.

Regarding "Navigation", it seems to be something that the "people" /use/ not are. So Navigation is one of the interface systems of the ships? What do the users represent?
