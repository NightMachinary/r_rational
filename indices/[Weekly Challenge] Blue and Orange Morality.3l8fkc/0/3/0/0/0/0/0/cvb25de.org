Our willingness to kill bugs for light looks unbridgeable to them. I must concede that the differences between us and bugs from our planet are smaller than the differences between the Baby Eaters and humans. I also had to make them behave much more like humans to tell the story effectively; similarly, I had to minimize the human presence. If bugs are aware of lights, they probably see the correlation between lights and humans. Irl, I mean.
