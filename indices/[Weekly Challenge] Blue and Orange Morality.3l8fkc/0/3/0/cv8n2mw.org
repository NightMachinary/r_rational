Ah, I'm glad the story had that effect. I wanted it to be a very plausible difference in values, so I used something from real life. Don't worry, I imagine that you'll recover quickly--I don't think I feel more sympathetic for having wrote it, heheh. The nature of the alien element in the story is a twist, though, so spoiler tags would probably be good.
