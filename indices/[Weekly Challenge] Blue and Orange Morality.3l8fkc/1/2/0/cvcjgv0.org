Well, do you think the emissaries to our current King were the only ones sent? It depends on how old you think our King is and how many decades ago the trespass occurred. I can guarantee that if it happened when the former King was in power, he did his share of turn aways. The Fae sent out one every few years, with decreasing frequency as the years past and their ire grew.

And you torture people's families because they have the capacity to be hurt by the suffering. While most animals will instinctively fight to protect their young, there's little observed empathy. A dog won't suffer because you beat it's kids. It might bite you, but it won't suffer for it. At least not that we can tell.

And the Fae consider oathbreakers less than animals in the same way a person may consider a pedophile less than an animal. It's a crime that surmount the fundamental value that being has as a sentient intelligence.
