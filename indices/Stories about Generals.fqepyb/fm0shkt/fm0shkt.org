  Focus on the broader war from a general's point of view

You want the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honorverse][Honor Harrington]] books. Hard-ish sci-fi space-navy war tightly recapitulating the Napoleonic wars (i.e. you've got one colonizer star-system representing historical Britain and one colonizer star-system representing historical France, and they fight over systems representing colonies.)

Told from the perspective of, at the start, a fresh space-navy captain; who rises through her efforts to higher ranks (eventually an admiral, and then Minister of War), with all the steps in between hard-earned. (There are 14 books in the series; there's time enough to earn all of it.)

As the series progresses, and the protagonist is less directly-involved with military affairs and more directly-involved with political affairs, the lens through which the story is told becomes increasingly political, switching from mostly being an accounting of the battles the protagonist is participating in (and her progress of whipping a ship crew, then task group, then fleet, etc. into shape to face them) to being an accounting of what all the governments are plotting. But, even in the later books, you still get, at the end of each book, a round of space battles that “ensue” from the round of political plotting the book went through; and most of the time the author finds a way to have the protagonist “lead from the front” in them, which is fun.

I call the story “hard-ish” sci-fi because the battles seem to always come out according to some hard war-gaming math the author is crunching based on every logistical+strategic+materiel fact they introduced up until that point. I assume this implies that if the battles come out the wrong way, the author doesn't fudge the outcome, but rather goes back and adds more logistical/material support to one or the other group, to pump up their input numbers so the battle will come out their way “by the rules.” (They're also mostly having the space-battles return the same outcome as whatever Napoleonic-war historical sea-battle or land-battle they're analogous to, which probably helps a lot.)

The fact that everything seems so rule-bound, means that books in the series can often build suspense just by giving you a set of facts that, if you game them out in your head, imply that the protagonist's force is going to lose. Because that probably means that the protagonist's force /is/ going to lose in a tactical sense, if not in a strategic sense. There's no plot armour for characters in dangerous situations; there's just characters ensuring through their efforts that they won't be in danger in the first place.

The battles, as told, always “zoom in” to focus on encounters between individual space-naval vessels, and further, to the individual human stories of their crews (the author is /very/ good at making you care about some just-introduced crew who's either about to die or make a name for themselves, over the span of a single chapter.) On the other hand, the /reasons/ any given ship/crew will come out on top clearly come down to larger-scale effects of technological superiority (save for when someone plays a /really/ clever tactical gambit); and the logistics of supply and build-up, i.e. the ways in which the superior war-fighting technologies aren't able to be evenly or instantaneously distributed. Oh, and the interplay of politics and war through e.g. the inability to raise money for certain projects that are obvious wins; or the need to do things cheaply because you're keeping them a secret from your own people because they'd be PR disasters.

All sides of every conflict are portrayed with empathy; you don't want anyone to lose, really. (Eventually---which should become clear if you know your history---nobody really /does/ lose. You get to keep all your favourite characters on both sides, because the war is not a Total War nor a war of attrition. It's a strategic war.)

Besides the military stuff:

- The protagonist is kind of lovable. (A weird parallel I've always wanted to draw: the protagonist is essentially Paris Geller from /Gilmore Girls/, fused with a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Komi_san/][Komi-san]]-like /yamato nadeshiko/ aspect. Someone who secretly cries because they try too hard, and who has to overcome their own shy awkwardness to berate you for not doing your job.)

- The alien species of “treecats“---besides being fun, cute, and a silly analogy to “ship's cats”---are a very thorough bit of worldbuilding that have /surprisingly/ more impact than you'd expect, given how small a role they play in the first book. It's as if the telepathic aliens from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_(Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation)][TNG S01E25]] were cute, cuddly, and symbiotic rather than parasitic.

- It's a romance, and actually... good at being one? Honor's relationships---especially the second one---are the closest I've seen a military-genre author come to writing a romance arc of the quality level you'd expect from an actual romance-genre author. There's no male gaze in these books (from what I remember.) In fact, there's enough /female/ gaze that I'd swear the author isn't quite 100% cis-straight-male. (Or maybe that just means they're very good at modelling minds unlike their own.)

- There's, uh, a lot of religious stuff at some points---most of it /specifically/ Christian, though of fictional denominations with their own backstories. (No, surprisingly, the author /isn't/ one of the many Mormon sci-fi authors.) The religious parts are /mostly/ setting-justified. The +British+ Manticore Space Empire is not particularly religious. But there's an individual star-system loosely allied with it that really /is/ religious†, and the protagonist protects that star-system from invasion and is made a titled noble of it, before she has much political power anywhere else. So it stays kinda relevant for a while.

† Anyone who has read the series care to guess what real-world country Grayson is made to parallel? I can't quite manage it. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk%3AHonorverse#Real_World_Parallels][Some Wikipedia editor thinks]] it's Portugal. My guess was the US, but the timeline doesn't work out. What country in the 1800s was known for their intense Christian faith, paternalism, and lack of arable land?
