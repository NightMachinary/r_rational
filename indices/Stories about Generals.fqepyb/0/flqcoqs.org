The Ender's Shadow series has lots of this. Most of the main characters are military leaders of some form or another, and it covers both the ground-level view of a commander leading a platoon of soldiers, and the macro view of strategically planning an invasion (or defending against one). The story focuses less on tacticool guns and more on logistics, less on action and more on how an effective leader motivates and empowers their followers. The series also routinely contrasts civilian leadership with military leadership, so the story isn't just about "generals as leaders," but how generals differ from politicians in the scope of their planning and the way that they lead and maneuver.
