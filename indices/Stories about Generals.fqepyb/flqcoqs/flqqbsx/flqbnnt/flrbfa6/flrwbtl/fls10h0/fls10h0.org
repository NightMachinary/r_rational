Having just read the first and third books, I'd say my opinion on it is a little more negative than positive. The author throws plot threads into the air at crazy speeds (especially the first novel, it took me multiple tries to get through the prologue and first chapter), the character voices tend to blend together a bit, and the magic system is rather soft by [[/r/rational][r/rational]] standards (and this does lead to solutions being pulled out of mid-air, like a never-before-mentioned plant species that eats ghosts popping out of the ground to defeat the ancient evil wizard when no one else could).

That said, Malazan does have its strengths- the world building is excellent (I really enjoyed the realization that the progression of ancient civilizations in Malazan kind of mirrors the real world, with ancient dinosaur people giving way to an ice age created by orc magi, and then the orcs being replaced by undead neanderthals, etc.), and the integration of magic into warfare is seamless and fun to read.

I'm personally on the fence about continuing the series myself, but if you enjoy military fantasy like the others I mentioned there's decent odds you'll enjoy Malazan as well.
