Then, let me add my vote of confidence. As someone who [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/698h61/rt_the_promised_neverland_037/][did it myself]] one week when nobody else did, this story is both entertaining and well within the bounds of rationalesque fiction.

Edit, except in a new comment to make sure there's a notification:

Can I humbly request these chapters use the spoiler tag feature, just to hide the thumbnail? Seeing an ultra-low resolution version of the first page is... not a spoiler exactly, but it feels like an annoying head start.
