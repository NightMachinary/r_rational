Good heavens, this killer guide dynamic is entertaining to watch. Not just a former villain who is begrudgingly going along with their antics, but who is actively conspiring at all times.

Other than that, it's interesting to finally see someone with an outside, but in-story perspective confirm that these kids are unnaturally, or at least unnervingly, clever.

Edit: Actually, I wonder if at some point Emma will be about to die to some danger, the guide refusing to save her, and Ray threatening to shoot himself if Emma dies, forcing him to save her lest he be forced to return without either.
