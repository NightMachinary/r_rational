I think that, in the future, as the need for any particular job decreases, your time will be primarily valuable because you're /human/, and computers aren't. It's like the Analogue vs. Digital debate for synthesizers-- there's nothing inherently better about analogues, and they don't even sound better or different (compared to good simulations) but people just like the /idea/ of analogue.

So the obvious consequences are twofold-- first, the wealthy will hire humans as status symbols, so as to show off. Second, in virtual reality, people will pay a premium for custom human-designed items, regardless of quality, because of the status associated with them.

And on a somewhat related note, I also expect the popularization of human-only MMOs, where real people are hired to be the NPCs and enemies. So maybe you get hired to be "Dungeon boss Hlozgrog the fearsome" and get paid for beating down people who enter your domain. Of course, AI could do the same job better, in a way that's probably more entertaining for the player, but the players who pay to fight you will derive utility from the fact that they just beat a real human, rather than a computer program.
