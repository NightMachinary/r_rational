There is an enormous amount of military doctrine stuff i've thought about this. The short version:

Humans are needed on the battlefield more as a kind of 'hearts and minds' gesture. Committing actual humans to the field means peace and 'diplomacy' is still on the table, or there is a demographic or group in the territory that you want to show friendly faces too.

This leads somewhat sideways into the only real reason for a HUMANOID drone to be fielded, is as a kind of 'half-way to a human soldier' gesture.

In addition the military version of the 'general purpose factories' is a wonder to behold being fully utilized, literally from moment to moment if not battle to battle an army can completely reconfigure it's capabilities, armaments, effective soldiers and munitions.

To a lesser extent emergency response services and police forces ALSO have these capabilities but generally they are not as versatile or as free of 'restrictions'.

But yeah, not only do you program drones during or prior to battle, you can fabricate custom drone swarms or loadouts or even have several kinds of drone/munition mission payloads on demand.

The kind of things soldiers/officers do in this future is pretty extreme and cutting edge.

And then there are diplomacy grunts for boots on the ground and photogenic peace offering shows of solidarity.
