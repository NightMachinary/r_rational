Well, hopefully the concept of a job goes the way of the dodo - because if we cling to it in the face of an economy that actually doesn't need labor, the only jobs that are going to be available is going to be either "Guillotine operator" or "Poor people shooter". Not a desirable outcome. If you mean what people will do with their lives once Marx has been proven very belatedly right? Read and love and play.
