Oh yeah that is definitely the way that this world in my setting is going, there is an enormous percentage of people on 'automation welfare' which essentially is a pretty decent living. But the transition is incomplete so the world still has economic inequality via the 'employed' and the 'unemployable'.

Different countries handle this differently.
