Software already involves layers of virtualization, software virtual machines (like JVM or CIL), frameworks, and emulation of old frameworks... and sometimes literal processor emulation (eg, running Android apps with native ARM code on Intel Android tablets). In some cases replacing old control systems is done by building a software emulator for 30 year old hardware.

This is only going to become a bigger deal in the future.
