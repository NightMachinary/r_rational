A lot of new government jobs to manually approve or disapprove ML/computer proposals. As result government could become even less efficient then now, because those new government workers would be less educated, less motivated and have ironclad job security. More police and security jobs with similar functions - watch screen and press button on prompt by computer to order an action, or ignore prompt. More lawyers (laweyring would become pure performance art on computer generating script before panel of jury). A lot more person-to-person, door-to-door marketing, again with performance act background and computer-generated scripts. 10-20% of population in prisons, as both crime and illegal immigration spike and laws become more and more convoluted for above mentioned reasons. Prison stays, arrests, searches become part of everyday life for most of people, like parking fine now. "Entertainment wars" - to escape rigid framework of society people take vacations in low-intensity civil wars which spark all around the globe, with tacit permission of bigger political powers.
