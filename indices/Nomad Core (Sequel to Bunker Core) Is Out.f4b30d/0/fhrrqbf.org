Note: the author had previously been posting Bunker Core/Nomad Core on SpaceBattles [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/bunkercore-post-apocalyptic-dungeon-core.622189/][here]], but it's all been taken down to satisfy Amazon's publishing requirements. (I guess.)

Can anyone tell me if there's more than 27 chapters? I want to double check to make sure that there's no new content I've missed, or something like that. Last thing that happened was W killing that enemy, whose name I can't remember.
