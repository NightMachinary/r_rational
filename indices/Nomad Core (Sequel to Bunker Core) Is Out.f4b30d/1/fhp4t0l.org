Bunker Core was a story posted here before by the author of Threadbare that people here liked.

It's a rare sci-fi example of the dungeon core stories where the protagonist, Wynne, is an amnesiac human turned AI with dungeon core mechanics in a post-apocalyptic setting.

He has to deal with self-improving his 'dungeon', missing memories, and an untrustworthy boss/assistant while quickly learning about just what happened to the world in the first book.

The sequel appears to be about escaping from his enemies in the first book and becoming mobile, but I'm not too sure since I haven't read the book just yet.

PS The protagonist's name is meant to be a reference to Winne Pooh.
