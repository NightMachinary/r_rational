Yeah, I love talking about the subject, because it's a fascinating look into what makes a meme so good at replicating itself into other brains. By using ironic processing (attempting to not think about something makes it harder to forget), the concept becomes self-reinforcing and nearly impossible to forget.

The best way I have ever learned to 'win' by forgetting is to use the same advice people are given for emptying the mind in meditation. Don't get upset when you are focusing on a thought or try to force yourself to stop thinking. Treat the thought like a butterfly. Let it linger in your mind and allow yourself to continue thinking about the game. Without over focusing on it, your mind will naturally shift to other topics (or empty itself) in due time.

Also the real rationalist in my story is never given a speaking role. She's contestant #42's best friend and told him to ignore the instructions and guided him into 'accidentally' winning the game. After all, if you don't know what the game is about, how can you ever lose?

Food for thought, game theory works by writing pay-off matrices of the rewards/punishments of different moves and using the matrix to calculate the best strategy to use. However, how can a pay-off matrix be created for the game?
