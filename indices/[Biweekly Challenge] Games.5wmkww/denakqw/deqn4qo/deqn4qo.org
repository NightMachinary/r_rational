Interesting concept, decently executed. My only serious complaint would be that it should be more fleshed out, but considering the venue you get a pass. Two minor quibbles: there's a confused gender in the second Thailand section, and it's SoD breaking that anyone, no matter how "promising" would be allowed in on some high level government meeting in a novelty tee shirt.
