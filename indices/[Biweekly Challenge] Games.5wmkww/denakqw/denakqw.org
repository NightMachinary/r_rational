Ok, quick .readme.

I've been lurking for...well, for quite some time. Almost all of my reading material comes from this sub, so I just wanted to thank everyone involved in the community for countless hours of thoughtful entertainment.

I've bandied about ideas for stories for years, but upon writing this I realized that this is actually the first thing I've written. Ever. (discounting essays for school back in the day and such like) So. Feedback appreciated - criticisms, praisisms, you name it.

Yup.

K.

Toodles.
