I'll agree that keeping as much of this as possible secret has pragmatic advantages, no question about that (except maybe a risk of blackmail in the future, but we know this won't happen, because this is the end of the story already). But is it the /right thing to do/ for a hero? For a /rationalist/ hero? Keeping everything secret as much as possible because it's convenient, and you know what's better for everybody anyway? You can't even spin the usual tale about dangerous knowledge in this case. It's just /personally inconvenient/ for Harry and his goals if the true story sees the light.

Edit: It's strange to say that, but Canon!Harry did a better job from my point of view after the graveyard. He sticked to the truth even if it was politically damaging for him.
