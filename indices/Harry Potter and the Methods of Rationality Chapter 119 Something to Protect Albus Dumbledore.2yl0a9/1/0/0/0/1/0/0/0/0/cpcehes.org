The problem is that revealing the truth would introduce some significant risk to his plans. Satisfaction of telling the truth is just not worth it. A rationalist hero has to do what he thinks will lead to the best expected outcome, even if this entails sacrificing his personal integrity. One reason this is a bad idea in the real world is that human hardware is treacherous. Systematic reasoning along the lines of "minor evil is worth it, because the good I will achieve with this political power will outweigh it" is especially vulnerable to subversion. At the same time, some ends really do justify the means. There is no easy rule you can use to actually achieve optimal outcomes. In this particular case, I think lying is an obviously right choice.

Personally, I have a great aversion to information warfare (lying, restricting access to information, propoganda, etc.). At the same time, I acknowledge the fact that sometimes pretty much everyone is better off if the truth stays hidden. In these cases I consider the decision to lie/obfuscate a moral one even if it feels evil to me.
