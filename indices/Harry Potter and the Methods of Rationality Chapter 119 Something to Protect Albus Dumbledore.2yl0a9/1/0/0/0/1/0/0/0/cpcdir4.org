First, I thought this story was supposed to be didactic among other things and teach people proper ways of thinking. So why contrive a situation to sorta kinda justify the hero doing a thing that you probably shouldn't do it the real life, and present it as the right thing to do? Seems questionable to me.

Second, Harry has the Line of Merlin, the Stone, Hogwarts, the Order and almost-immortal Hermione at his disposal. He doesn't necessarily need to be a lying bastard to follow through with his "Philosopher's Hospital" plan.
