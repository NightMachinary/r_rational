Well, they still think that Monroe is a hero, and this one is not an obvious deduction. And then there's the end of the world prophecies (this one is much more reasonable to keep quiet, I'll grant him that).

But really, my main issue is not with the extent of this revelation, but with the coverage. The general populace still has nothing, but fairy tales and fake heroes to worship (but Harry still gets all the material prizes from the victory). Especially objectionable with Hermione, whose true achievement of killing off the Dementors (if she really does that) would be totally overshadowed by Harry's fake.
