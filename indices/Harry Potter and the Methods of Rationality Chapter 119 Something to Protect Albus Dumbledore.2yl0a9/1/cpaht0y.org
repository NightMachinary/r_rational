Well, it looks like the truth has out afterall.

Edit: On a related note, [[http://my.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2yd1ye/chapter_harry_potter_and_the_methods_of/cp9carc][Called Harry being master of the Elder Wand]], but in retrospect that was pretty obviously going to factor in. Hoping he finds the Resurrection Stone and figures out what was up with the Peverell's graves somehow in the next three chapters, but without a timeskip, I'm not hopeful.
