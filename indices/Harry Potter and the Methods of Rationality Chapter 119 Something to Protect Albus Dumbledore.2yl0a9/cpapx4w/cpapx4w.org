Next up: Leadership. Harry Potter figures out that the world not having blown up was due to total incompetence in teaching Muggle Studies. Muggle science is ruthlessly suppressed to keep anyone from transfiguring anything that would end the world or everyone capable of magic is forced to take the "I must not destroy the world" unbreakable vow in a sweep of well meaning totalitarianism.

Also Harry now has the tool to cripple or even destroy modern capitalism. The gold standard can be made worthless at any given moment. It's still handy to keep around to have access to carrots and sticks, but the end of money is within sight. When you can transfigure anything physical objects no longer can serve as money. Adoption of the reputation economy to follow.

Death from old age is pretty much over now as a thing for wizards and as has been demonstrated on Hermione, death from anything save for avada kedavra or fiend fyre is now impossible. Death is no longer permanent as long as you have an in-tact brain. The whole needing an in-tact brain thing will probably be solved at some point too.

Other advancements will rapidly follow as Harry gets his PHD's or their equivalent. This will probably happen rather rapidly as he magically bootstraps himself into godhood. It'll just take some sort of tipping point that will cause him to learn things faster. We'll save that for year two.

Welcome to the magical singularity.
