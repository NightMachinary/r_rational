  Also Harry now has the tool to cripple or even destroy modern capitalism. The gold standard can be made worthless at any given moment. It's still handy to keep around to have access to carrots and sticks, but the end of money is within sight. When you can transfigure anything physical objects no longer can serve as money. Adoption of the reputation economy to follow.

No /modern/ capitalist economy after 1969 ever even followed any kind of gold standard. Not if they weren't blatantly on crazy-stupid pills.

Besides which, any kind of economy based on being able to conjure or copy /all mere commodities/ (as Transfiguration is explicitly noted to be able to do: multiplying food and such) is already an economy where marginal cost = marginal labor input, which is /radically/ different from recognizable capitalism.
