That's putting the cart before the horse. You're talking about counterfeit protection, not value. Coins are valuable because you can use them to purchase stuff. The coins themselves aren't inherently valuable. People need to have a sort of faith in them that they're worth something. Originally coins were made of particular mixes of precious metals. Then they were backed by precious metals. The US moved to a faith based economy. Just throwing coins out there doesn't really mean a lot unless the goblins have something that is universally desired, like gold. People need to buy into the idea that the coins are worth something.

In short, money is valuable because it can be used to purchase many other valuable things. If there is nothing to back the money then those coins won't be worth much.

Also goblins don't do magic. They do superior goblin forging, which is their particular shtick.
