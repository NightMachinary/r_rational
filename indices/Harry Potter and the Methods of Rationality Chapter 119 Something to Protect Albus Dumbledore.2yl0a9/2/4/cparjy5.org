  Also Harry now has the tool to cripple or even destroy modern capitalism. The gold standard can be made worthless at any given moment. It's still handy to keep around to have access to carrots and sticks, but the end of money is within sight. When you can transfigure anything physical objects no longer can serve as money. Adoption of the reputation economy to follow.

Nah, they'll just move to the goblin standard - each coin will henceforth be stamped with goblin magic (if they're not already), Gringotts will stop accepting gold for currency (except at market rates, which the Philosopher's Stone will destroy), and everything will continue on mostly as it was before. Because the Stone shouldn't let you counterfeit the magic attached to the coins, the economy is safe to keep on running.
