Well, sort of.

It actually should be plenty for wizards, after the first few months.

Think about it for a minute - it restores you to perfect health and youth. So, even with the risk of violent or accidental death, a single person should not need to go through the process more than once every 30 years at least on average.

So, if it can be used 369 times a day, it can be used 134,685 times a year.

That's more than 40 million times in 30 years, which should be plenty to deal with the entire wizarding population even taking into account accidents and violence (which can be reduced by having as an added punishment for violent crime the denial of Stone treatment).

The only real problem is the triage at the beginning, in deciding who gets the first set of treatments. After all wizards have gone through at least once, there will be plenty of usages left not needed for upkeep.
