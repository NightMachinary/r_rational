Of course, the use of the Philosopher's Stone for trivial purposes like wiping out the world's economy or flying to Jupiter comes at a price.

It can be used 369 times per day, which is way below the world death rate. If we disregard Muggles, then given standard fanon estimates of the world population and death rates of wizards, house-elves, centaurs, and goblins, it could /barely/ keep up. Adding the families of Muggleborns and half-bloods pushes it over the limit.

Every use of the Stone of Permanency comes at the opportunity cost of one sentient life. Plan accordingly.
