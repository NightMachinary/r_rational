I noticed there are seven people at the Comet King's [[http://unsongbook.com/chapter-17-that-the-children-of-jerusalem-may-be-saved-from-slavery/][seder table]], and seven sails on /All Your Heart/.

- red: normal wind, Uncle Vihann
- orange: placebomancy, ??
- yellow: Names, Sohu
- green: singing, ??
- blue: priest, Father Ellis
- violet: angel, ??
- black: ??, Comet King

The other three people seem to be the Comet King's children, one of whom is Nathanda. TCK could have sent two of them to learn about placebomancy and singing, like he sent Sohu to learn kabbalah from Uriel. This doesn't explain where he gets an angel.
