You could have your explanations come from an in-universe source that is proven wrong about some other claim (of a significance for you to determine) early on in the story to establish that source as fallible.

Then, having built the rules based on that source, have the magic, as described by the narrator rather than character, start to deviate from those rules. Subtle at first, but an attentive reader should start to notice. These seeds should also be laid early so it does not run the risk of looking like an asspull later. Try to get the character to notice shortly after the reader has.
