If you're having problems with the audience not accepting the core premises of your fiction then the problem is probably with the audience. Because the fiction as a concept relies on people being able to readily accept a fantastical premise to be told a story, and if they can't do that they're placing a pretty heavy weight on the storyteller to meet their unknown and probably contradictory standards.

The best advice you can be given on this subredddit is to just plow ahead with whatever ideas make sense to you, because if rationalists find your universe rational they will interact with it, and if not rationalists are not the only audience in the universe.
