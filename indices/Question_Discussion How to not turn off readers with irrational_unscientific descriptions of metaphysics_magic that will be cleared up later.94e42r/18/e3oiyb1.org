(The replies to this have been really interesting to read!) Throwing out an idea that I didn't spot elsewhere: if it's acceptable/intended to have a disconnect between what the protagonist and reader think is true about the world, then at the very beginning there could be a short passage where the(/a, if mostly first-person, or even the future narrator if first-person) narrator introduces the world and/or protagonist, perhaps directly commenting on the misguided nature of what is thought to be true.

Third-person narration could be something like 'Far, far away, in a land where they still think that men were fashioned by gods out of clay...'; first-person narration could be 'I sigh as I remember all the things that seemed so normal to me then that seem patently absurd today', though of course that would give away the protagonist's survival, unless it's set in a moment of reflection/conversation partway through the plot and/or right before a climax, to which the plot catches up and then carries the protagonist along in another life-risking.
