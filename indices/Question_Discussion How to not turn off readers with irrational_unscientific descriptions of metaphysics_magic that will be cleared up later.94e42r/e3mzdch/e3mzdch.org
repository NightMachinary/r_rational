Like everyone else said, having multiple contradictory explanations presented by characters is probably the best, but if you're still worried about this consider just putting it explicitly in an author's note before the actual book starts? Basically the same idea as a trigger warning. This does sacrifice some immersion and is a bit of a spoiler, but might still be worth it.
