Right, that's part of the struggle I was trying to describe in the OP. I don't have a character who's conveniently "rational" from the beginning with a bunch of study-based knowledge. For HJPEV, it's easy to say "that doesn't sound right" or "there's no way that's the way it works" or "that violates all principles of ______!" and we as the readers instantly know that there's now a metaphysical question: does the science prevail here, or does magic mumbojumbo override the science in this case?"

That's a lot less easy to do when your MC is a preteen going through his initial education and has no reason to distrust his teachers who are misinformed about a lot of things (just like most teachers were 300 years ago in our society).
