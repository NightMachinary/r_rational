You could have the protagonist see *something that conflicts with one or more of the explanations they've heard, or is outside what they've heard about* - someone from a place where it doesn't snow would be surprised when they discover ice/snow/related magic for the first time. Water magic might be 'unthinkable' to someone from a desert.

*Conflicting explanations* might do the job as well - the mages say magic comes from outside of you, the druids say it's within, other people say everything is made of magic, and you can use that connection to affect things. /If the characters understand that there's more than one way to do magic, then they might keep an open mind about how many types there are./
