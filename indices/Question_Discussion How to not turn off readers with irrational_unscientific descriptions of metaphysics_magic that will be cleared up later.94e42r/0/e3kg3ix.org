I think you're overthinking this a little bit, but then again, I'm perfectly fine with non-reductionist worlds where the magic is kind of vague and unexplained, and its bounds aren't explicitly described (eg Practical Guide to Evil, Glimwarden), so I'm probably not your target audience.

One approach you could take would be to have the character be told about several conflicting theories of magic, and have multiple characters debate on the merits of each one. For instance, Person A believes that sentience is the result of magic accumulating, Person B believes that sentience is a discrete quality (you either have it or you don't) that can only be granted by the gods.
