I endorse this answer. Even if it isn't quite the way things played out on medieval Earth, having a character think about two conflicting explanations is a much stronger signal that a third explanation might be true. Even if both conflicting explanations sound tropey or irrational, having two different explanations is a much stronger hint, verging on a literary promise, to provide a good explanation down the road. Tropey bad explanations are meant to just be accepted. A character not knowing which of two tropey explanations is true, and analyzing both of them unskillfully and wrongly, is a much stronger invitation to the reader to reject both explanations and both lines of thought, even if the character doesn't think of that... though, alas, not every reader will pick up on your strongest invitations even so.
