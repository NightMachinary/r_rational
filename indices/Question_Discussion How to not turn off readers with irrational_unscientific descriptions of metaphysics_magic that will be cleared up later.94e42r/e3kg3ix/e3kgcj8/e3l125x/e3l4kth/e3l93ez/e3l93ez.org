Essentially, you're trying to create an expectation that there's more to the world than the face value presentation. There's several ways to do it, I'll list them in an order of what I consider to be most effective.

1. Have the protagonist question or remain uncertain with regards to the presented facts. This is easiest and most effective tool of introducing doubt as everyone sympathizes with the MC.
2. Establish the information comes from an unreliable source. If an old man living in the middle of fuck-off nowhere tells the protagonist elves are all evil, than an average reader will pick up that this is mostly racism. This is extreme but keep in mind most institutions have their own agendas.
3. Present many possible answers using characters. If something is not understood well, there will be debate about it. Different people might believe different explanations - this would make exposition more interesting and could tie into your characterization.
4. Contradict the face value facts with your worldbuilding. This is analogous to the point above, only instead of characters articulating different possibilities, you let the world do it for you. If an oracle is said to be an all-powerful seer but their nation is losing the war, an acute reader will realize that something is afoot.
