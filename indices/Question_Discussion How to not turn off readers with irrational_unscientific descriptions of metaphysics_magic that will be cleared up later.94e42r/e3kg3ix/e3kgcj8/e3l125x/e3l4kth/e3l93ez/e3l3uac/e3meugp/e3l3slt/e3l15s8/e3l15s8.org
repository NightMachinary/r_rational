I don't think there's anything wrong with having such things. It should be normally understood that of course every world will have wrong beliefs. Sometimes people will be /absolutely sure/ of their wrong beliefs. Ask any astronomer of 1000 years ago, they would have told you the Earth was the centre of the universe.

Anyone who reads fantasy should be aware that the rules /may/ be different, but that doesn't mean everything a character (or even an in-universe narrator) says is trustworthy. If you want to hint at the existence of other/deeper truths, you may do so by having someone ask a question that challenges the commonly held paradigm and receives a blatantly unsatisfactory answer, or by referencing some minor 'heretic' belief that is considered absurd but actually sounds sensible to our modern ears.
