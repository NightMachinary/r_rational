I wouldn't be personally turned off by a story where a character stated "x was made by gods" only to be later proven wrong.

if you give hints that rational explanations are being *sought* this is probably sufficient. HPMOR has plenty of characters that believe goofy things, and in fact the world itself doesn't conform to physical rules we'd expect, but harry's pursuit of a rational explanation is sufficient.
