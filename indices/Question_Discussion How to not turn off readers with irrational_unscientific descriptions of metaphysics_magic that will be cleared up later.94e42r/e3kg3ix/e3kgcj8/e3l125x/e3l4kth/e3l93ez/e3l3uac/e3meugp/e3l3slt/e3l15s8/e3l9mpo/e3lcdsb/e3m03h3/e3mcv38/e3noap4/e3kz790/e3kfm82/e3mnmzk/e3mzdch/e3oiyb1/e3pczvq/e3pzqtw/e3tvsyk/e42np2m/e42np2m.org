If you're as funny as Douglas Adams, this is what a /subjective/ third-person omniscient narrator is for: saying the smart thing (or hanging a lampshade) when it wouldn't make sense for any actual character to do so.

Come to think of it, /is/ there any ratfic in the Doug Adams narrative style? Everything I've read so far seems to keep to a third-person limited-omniscient narrative style, where "narration" is just the viewpoint character's thoughts interjected as they experience or recount a scene.
