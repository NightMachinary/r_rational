I think you will get a surprising amount of milage out of having your MC cite their sources, even in their internal monologue.

For example, instead of writing "The mage was referring to the four elements which make up all things" write "The mage was referring to the four elements which Aunt Mertle taught me make up all things" or "as anyone who went to school would know those were the 4 elements which make up all things".

This will establish the epistemological provenance your MC's common knowledge, which both foreshadowed that source being relavent later, and implies that the knowledge may not be as common or correct as the MC believes. It is not after all "word of god" exposition if it's actually just "word of Aunt Mertle, who later turns out to also think all rivers flow south", or "word of some one who probably has an agenda".
