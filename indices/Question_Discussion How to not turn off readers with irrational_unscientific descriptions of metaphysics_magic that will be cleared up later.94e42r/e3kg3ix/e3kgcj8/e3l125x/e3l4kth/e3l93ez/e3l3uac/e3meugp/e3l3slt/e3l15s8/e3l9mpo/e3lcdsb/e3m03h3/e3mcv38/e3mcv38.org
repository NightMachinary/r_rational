Maybe have a setting element where people are fanatical about citations? So any info-dump is prefaced with "As the great sage Notaristotle wrote 700 years ago...". Make it clear that all this setting info the protagonist is getting is just "what some ancient person said". Throw in one or two early examples of conflicting beliefs ("Sure, Notaristotle said that, but Unkant said it was actually...") to get the ball rolling and plant the seed of the idea that the Lore of the Ancients can be improved on.
