  Everything I've read so far seems to keep to a third-person limited-omniscient narrative style, where "narration" is just the viewpoint character's thoughts interjected as they experience or recount a scene.

This is called [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_indirect_speech][Free Indirect Speech]] and yes, it does seem that pretty much all ratfics use it in place of having a subjective narrative voice.

  Come to think of it, is there any ratfic in the Doug Adams narrative style?

I don't know any ratfics that use it, but one of the non-ratfic webnovels I'm following has a distinct, and hilarious, narrative voice and perspective: [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/8894/everybody-loves-large-chests][Everybody Loves Large Chests]]. (Note that the fic name is a pun and isn't actually referring to breasts, though the fic does indeed contain lewd content) While not a rational fic itself, it's very good at playing by a lot of the rules that rational fics do: Magic A is Magic A, everyone has a good reason for doing the things they do, the things that happen in-setting happen for reasons other than just plot convenience, etc. It follows the story of a semi-sentient monster that gains intelligence and cunning throughout the course of the story. Oh, and the worldbuilding is fantastic. I definitely recommend it.
