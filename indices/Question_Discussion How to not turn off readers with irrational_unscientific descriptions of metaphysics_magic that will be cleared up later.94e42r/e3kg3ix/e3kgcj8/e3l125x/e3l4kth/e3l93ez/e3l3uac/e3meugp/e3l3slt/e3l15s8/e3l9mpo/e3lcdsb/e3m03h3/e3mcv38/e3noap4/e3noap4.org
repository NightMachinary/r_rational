A lot of people said that you should not worry about it, but you have reasons to. I, for example, am exactly the sort of person who would stop reading your book at page 30 if I don't like your metaphysics.

More general solution, compared to everything already said, would be just trying to build up readers' trust in you as fast as possible: find the smartest thing you could show on the first 30 pages and do it. It does not necessarily have to have anything to do with metaphysics or explanations for magic or main character, it just has to be original, intelligent and awesome. Once I know you can pull off something like that, I will read everything you have written.
