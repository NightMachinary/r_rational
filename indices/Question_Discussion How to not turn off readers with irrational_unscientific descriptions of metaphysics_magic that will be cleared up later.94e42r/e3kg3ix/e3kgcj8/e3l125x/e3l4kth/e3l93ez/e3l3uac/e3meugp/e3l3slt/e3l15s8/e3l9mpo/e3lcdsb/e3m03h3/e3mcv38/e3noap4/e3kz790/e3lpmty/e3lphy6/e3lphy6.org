I'm not so sure that the problem is with the audience in most cases where the audience won't accept the core premises of the setting.

This could be used to excuse basically any setting where the core premises aren't remotely consistent and are constantly contradicting each other and displaying massive differences between what we are shown vs what we are told, with none of the characters seeming to notice the disrepancy.

Most disrepancies are fine, so long as the characters in question would notice any disrepancy that is obvious to a layman.
