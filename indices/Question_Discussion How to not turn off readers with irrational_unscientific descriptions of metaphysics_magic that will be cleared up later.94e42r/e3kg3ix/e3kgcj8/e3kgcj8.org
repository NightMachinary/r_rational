Since your main character is not rational to begin with, but you want to give off the feel of rationality, perhaps you could give rational traits to a (perhaps single story arc) side character. In setting you've given, they won't analyse the faulty assumptions about the world, or even consider them as a problem, but they can act rationally towards other things, more common problems. If you can convince your [rationality-loving] reader that this story has rational elements, then they are going to be a lot more willing to see it through.

I actually really appreciate that you are going to have incomplete answers given to the main character on purpose. I was once considering a world idea where each nation/culture has a different science to explain and control magic, and they all work. One of the main character's quests would be to figure out how all the forms of magic are compatible with each other and find a universal explanation. Unfortunately that idea never got crystallised, along with the countless others.

I'm getting this odd feeling from your own suggested solution.

  "we used to think the world was made up of four elements: wind, water, fire, and earth. But now we know that's not the case. Earth is actually made up of many different components."

It doesn't really give off the rational/ist vibe that I think you are trying to give off; it just seems like some idle worldbuilding and seems a bit out of place in this scenario. I wouldn't expect a teacher/lecturer to talk about outdated models in [I assume] an introductory lesson quite like that. If I were in the teacher position, either I'd save it for a later lesson or try to make a point about it when talking about the development of science. I'm considering a different situation and phrasing where I feel like it'd have more effect: "You're acting like someone who still believes in the four elements!". Here it's used as the focus of an argument and gives the impression that the speaking character feels hubris about the advance in knowledge. This is something I haven't spent enough time on, so there might be an even better place to put it.
