Don't worry too much about it. It's quite possible to write from a character's viewpoint which might include many unscientific beliefs, while still having the world be rational. It could come across as being something like historical fiction with characters who were not scientifically educated - i.e. most of them.

One way to do it may be to drop in things in the background, or what the character sees, which are indications that this world of yours is not 100% Earthlike. The character may be completely familiar with them (elves run the local store), or they may consider them rare enough to be noteworthy ("Saw one of the Fair Folk today in the square; they attracted quite a crowd, and not unexpectedly.") or even completely strange and inexplicable ("The necklace glowed! Like a star, like the Northern Lights, like a beacon of holy promise!"), but the point is that it's being experienced by the viewpoint character; it's not something they've heard about from another person.

If you have multiple wrong interpretations of the world, introduce multiple characters who each hold one of those views. It generates an interest in the reader as to which of them (if any) will turn out to be correct, and provides a basis for character depth - can they work alongside or be friends with those of opposing views? Are they unable to countenance any challenge to their own beliefs? In addition, are the people holding those opposing beliefs in a position of teacher, sage, or other semi-official information source for the main character? That makes it more important to the character and plot: if Parent 1 says the world is like this, but Teacher 2 says it's like that, and Wise Sage 3 says it's something else entirely, who is right? One of them? All of them? None of them? The character needs to go out into the world and find out for themselves. And perhaps they may get ahead by applying investigatory techniques from all those sources...
