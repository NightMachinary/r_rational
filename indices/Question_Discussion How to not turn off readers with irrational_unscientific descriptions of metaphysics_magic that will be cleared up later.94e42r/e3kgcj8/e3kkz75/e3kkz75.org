Cool, thanks for the input. I've been thinking I'd probably have to use another more experienced and knowledgable character to introduce the seed of doubt early on. I already have a good candidate.

  It doesn't really give off the rational/ist vibe that I think you are trying to give off; it just seems like some idle worldbuilding and seems a bit out of place in this scenario.

Right, this is totally out of context and is not a direct quote either. It's not even brought up in a discussion about whether current theories are right or not---it's actually part of a discussion about reductionism, physical quantities, and the different "layers of reality" at which you can do math/physics, because that's the basis for systemic magic in this world. But old-school magic based on "the elements" also worked to some extent, and that's important to magical theory, so there's a reason for discussing it early on in magic training.

Thanks!
