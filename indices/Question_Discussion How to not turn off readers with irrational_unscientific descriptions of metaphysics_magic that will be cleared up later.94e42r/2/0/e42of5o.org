...as long as you tear it down on the right story beat. In the Hero's Journey model, that'd be about 1/3rd of the way through the story. Any further, and it starts feeling like a Deus Ex Machina (if that new knowledge allows the protagonist to solve a problem.)

On the other hand, if the new knowledge /causes/ problems, you can introduce it as late as you like. Brandon Sanderson's /Mistborn/ series /ends/ the first book with a reveal that the heroes' beliefs about how the setting works were flawed. Works fine!

And then there's a whole 'nother kind of timing for world-building reveals in mystery fiction.
