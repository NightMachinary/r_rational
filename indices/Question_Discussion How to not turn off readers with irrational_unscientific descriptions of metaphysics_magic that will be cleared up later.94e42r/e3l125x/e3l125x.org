You can't be too timid and embarrassed when you're writing your false explanations about things created by gods and such. You must write it in a way that makes me want to believe it, /then/ tear it down. It will have all the more power that way. It may turn the reader off if you set up a pathetic straw-man of a belief, but if you set up something compelling the reader won't care if it's wrong.

Readers aren't turned off by bad metaphysics, they are turned off by bad writing. Write well, create compelling characters and a compelling world, and let even your false explanations be compelling and seem as justified convictions, and it won't matter what your metaphysics are.

Check out pretty much any of the great fantasy novels for good writing with non-scientific metaphysics.

Look at for instance the Chronicles of Narnia. The metaphysics is laughable. The morality is bad. It veers into outright bigotry and racism at times. Frankly the whole thing is downright offensive. Yet it's a very compelling story. His truths were wrong but he wrote them beautifully, and by the end, you can understand why he believes them.

  "we used to think the world was made up of four elements: wind, water, fire, and earth. But now we know that's not the case. Earth is actually made up of many different components." This will give hints that "common knowledge"

The problem here is that it makes us think "lol what idiots, why would they just pick four random things and think things are made of that"? There is actually a perfectly compelling reason why people thought that - gas (wind), liquid (water), solid (earth) are the three phases of matter, and "fire" is another common thing we commonly encounter which clearly isn't anything like any of the first three.
