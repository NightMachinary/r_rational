This is reducible to the unreliable narrator problem, I think. IANAA, but I'd approach it by giving a "common knowledge" explanation that was really obviously flawed and produced by common biases, early on. Discover strong evidence that it's false soon after; and right after that, encounter a somewhat less obvious example that hangs around for quite a while before being re-examined.
