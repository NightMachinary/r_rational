Hard to get into detail without knowing a bit more about the setting, but generally you could have the MC learn from asking a lot of questions growing up that the explanations he's hearing aren't solid, even if he can't think of any better ones.

If the wrong explanations extend to his teacher(s) as well, you could mention that there are other fringe theories out there that generally aren't accepted but can't be proven wrong either. Just enough to allow doubt in the main theory.
