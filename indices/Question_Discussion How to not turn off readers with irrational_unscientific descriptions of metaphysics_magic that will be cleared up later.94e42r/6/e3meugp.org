You can get a lot of mileage in the execution, with the word choice and demeanor of the various characters. If the mentor figure is teaching about elements and describes how people figured out the truth, and then the next thing they talk about sounds more like they're reciting something they heard from someone else, the contrast will heighten suspicion of the second concept.

To make it even stronger, you can play off of the characters' personalities themselves. If the MC is asking the local priest about the mysterious divine artifacts and the priest gives a non-answer with a tone that brooks no argument, readers will notice that the priest is an unreliable source, not acting as your hand to send information to the reader but as a stubborn closed-minded old man, and that can cast a measure of doubt on what he's talking about.

If you want a really strong case for doubt though, you can connect the theory to something the readers already know is false. Imagine, for instance, a teacher incorrectly saying that magic is stored in a person's blood. It's /plausible/, in a fantasy world, but he then goes on to say that the purpose of the heart is to purify magic, and your heartbeat is your body's magic resonating with the purification happening in the heart. Readers will see that as a red flag, because we all know that hearts pump blood so that it can bring oxygen to the rest of your body. Either biology works very differently here than IRL, or the professor doesn't really know what the heart actually does. From here, execution (word choice, context, etc.) can tip the scales and make it sound like the professor's wrong about hearts purifying magic, and if the reader doubts that hearts purify magic, that doubt seeps into the idea that magic is stored in the blood.

There's honestly a lot of room for you to signal that a theory shouldn't be trusted, but the line you have to straddle is getting that across to the /reader/ clearly while still sounding plausible for the person teaching it to believe. An old priest can easily hold any religious-based teaching as dogma, but you have to take a subtler hand with your open-minded mentor who's excited about stuff like the periodic table overturning classical thought (unless it's on a topic /he's/ zealous about, in which case he can be a lot more uncritical of bad theories)
