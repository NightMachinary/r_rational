Just like in real life? ;)

I'd make it sound like a real unscientific idea, you're not wanting for inspiration. Maybe have your character think it sounds a bit odd but rationalize it away, or mirror real life institutions and movements relevant to the idea. Have some old wise man spewing profound sounding things that don't actually have any substance. If you don't want your character to pick up on that, show them having difficulty understanding what is trying to be said and not being able to work out the problem. That will show to your readers that those ideas probably aren't part of the canon of the world.

You could have it fit the [[https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Pseudoscience#Characteristics_of_pseudoscience][characteristics of a pseudoscience]] and see if readers pick up on that as well, but a lot of those things are something you'd see in a work of fiction with magical elements anyway since writers tend not to be very scientifically literate.

If the story is engaging people will overlook that sort of thing until you get into the deep explanations, and if it's not engaging it won't matter anyway. Don't worry too much about it.
