I'd start out (it sounds like your character is in an educational institution where this would be applicable) by having the character attend a lecture in which one of the teachers outright /tells/ the class that what they are teaching is less than perfectly correct. ("Half of what is in your textbooks is wrong. However, we don't yet know which half.")

After this, present everything in terms of dialogue or opinions, so that it's clear that this is just how someone /thinks/ it works, not how it really works. (Even better, have characters disagree about how it works in minor ways - e.g. one character says it's a cat spirit while another insists it's a dog spirit, suggesting that neither can be sure). Save omniscient third-person narration for things that actually work that way in your world. (Depending on your tone, you can even have the omniscient third-person narrator point out that characters have got certain things wrong - but never (or almost never) use it to explain what the right thing is, unless the hero also finds out in a nearby scene.
