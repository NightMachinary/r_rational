I've noticed this is a repeated theme in many stories...predator is super hungry, captures someone to go eat them....and then locks them away and takes a nap or some other /extremely/ drawn out lead up to actually eating. At least in the Hobbit, Gandalf got the trolls arguing about how to cook the dwarves, justifying the drawn out wait.

Actually, there's your hook, maybe. Baby bunnies get snatched, protagonists get the badger all tided up trying to figure out how to best eat them, while another lures back the fox to enable grabbing the babies when both predators are distracted with each other.

I also want to see Mr Fisher's aquaculture system, to avoid dangerous fishing trips out on the open water.
