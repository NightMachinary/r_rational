Uh. Let's start with the opening part.

1. A rabbit is speaking with a badger, who is known to eat rabbits when hungry.

2. The badger complains of extreme hunger.

3. The rabbit invites the badger inside, where his children are sleeping.

4. Then smokes a lot and falls asleep.

5. The baby rabbits are taken as a snack.

(I don't have enough emphasis tags to express my opinion of this... idiocy)

Fundamentally, a rational story is going to work a *lot* harder to set up #1 through #4 than to justify a fight between the fox and the badger.
