  My money is that it's not the librarian, but a different demon. Maybe even the demon that possessed Nic before (who became a dragon and got eaten etc.).

Also, I've found prior chapters to be confusing but this one seems straightforward finally. The crazy demon is finally revealing what she wants (to /not/ change, unlike all other demons) and part of Winnum Roke's motive is revealed to save the Earth (though she seems more motivated by spite, and I'm sure she has other motives too).
