- Nick wants to see this new creature, but also not to fall into an obvious demon trap. He also wants to control his own destiny and be important (but those are at odds). And of course he wants Dizzy.
- The crazy demon wants to stay the same instead of changing, which is what will happen if the demons win.\\
- Winnum Roke wants to spite the demons (and maybe save humanity). She's already closed the door, but perhaps isn't strong enough alone or is worried there's an alternate power the demons might use.\\
- The High-Father wants Nick to activate this new creature, since it is a new power and may be the solution to opening the door.
- Dizzy wants the D.
