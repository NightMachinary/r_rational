Real talk, I'm 100% serious when I say that her wanting Tutt is by far the primary motivation of her character now. She's driven and capable, but she has no actual direction in life. In HPMoR, there's a line where Quirrel says to Tracy Davis, "You are ambitious, but you have no ambition," about her being capable of achieving anything, but not having any /particular/ great thing she wants to achieve. That's Dizzy.

She doesn't want to be a hero. She didn't even know that was an option, until Nick turned out to look like one ^{if} ^{you} ^{squint.} Hell, there arguably are no heroes in this story; certainly not Nick who's just a pawn. She (thinks she) sees what Nick has and she wants it for herself, but that's just like Tracey Davis adding on bullet points to her "ambitions list." She /is/ heroic, and thus implicitly believes that if the 'hero' role exists it should belong to her, but that's what I'd call a driving motivation.

The only thing she's certain on is that she wants to be by Nick's side. This is probably the truest thing we've seen in the fic from her -
