Well said. And that's what makes her an interesting parallel to Nic; conceptually, Nic is floundering with only his feelings for a girl to hold onto, but in practice the thirst for understanding he acquired along the path of pursuing the girl gave him the inner spark he needs to tell his own story.

While despite her attempted brusque definiteness, just below the surface Dizzy is truly the one floundering because she has no idea how to become what she desires. You can tell from the story she tells the librarian about being a warrior who slays the evil monster. She doesn't get that protagonists aren't a real thing that you can become, but a framing for telling a story about a series of events. So at 16 years old, she's been quietly exceeding expectations while waiting to grow up and become a real contender for the title of Demon Slayer. As if school was ever designed to facilitate that kind of story for people. smh

But then Nic showed up and bam, he started cooking up adventures right away by following his gut and breaking rules, and somehow getting away with it. Not to mention drawing the favor of her own father, the archmage, and the country's secret service.

So it's more that I feel a quibble about which part of Tutt she wants most. I think if she got to make a choice between a relationship with the person who is Nic on the one hand, and magically taking over his mind and/or body in a desperate bid to take his mysterious protagonist sauce for herself on the other, all her social programming and self image up to this point would compel her to justify the latter. Even if she had romantic feelings contradicting it, her self image is to deny herself in what she feels is duty to her family and her country. But actually now that I think of it, her opinion of Nic's competence does seem to have gone from unreasonably low to unreasonably high...

I wonder if Nic is the only answer she has when considering how to constructively go beyond what she previously saw as her duty because Nic was the most important thing her duties meant she couldn't have. She built a dichotomy in her head that she has trouble seeing outside of. That's why she keeps imagining that Nic has complex plans and hidden abilities underlying his success and justifying her pursuit of him; she doesn't know how else to frame the story.
