Don't pretend to actually explain what everyone wants then finish with an unfunny joke. Dizzy wants to be the very best hero candidate that no one ever was, so that she can be the Savior of Ranvar. Or, failing that, she wants to at the very least have been a better hero candidate than Nic. But her desire to be the hero means she isn't really right for this job; so, despite her initial intention to belittle Nic and wash her hands of him, she finds she doesn't have any better way to become a hero than through Nic.

She attempts to capitalize on his relatively higher status by stalking/trying to protect him. BUT her ravenous desire for the D, and consequent frustration with herself and with Nic, means she can't help but act like a total retard around him. Which makes her want to spend as little time as possible in his presence, because spending time with him means feeling the unheroic feelings of a normal, awkward teenager. Even though what she /really/ wants is to spend all her time with him, because teenagers.

But the point is that if she didn't want to be a great hero more than she wants the D she would already have served herself, so any explanation of her character is incomplete without taking that into account.
