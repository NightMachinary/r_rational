One thing I think [[/u/mooderino][u/mooderino]] does incredibly well is express frustration in his writing. I always feel incredibly frustrated on Nic's part because there is always a sense of being used. It isn't one of those stupid plotlines where the protagonist is oblivious to clearly being manipulated by other people nor is it something where the protagonist is the real puppet master all along.

I think it fits in with this chapter. Nic is of adequate intelligence and skill to know that there is something going on and that he is being used. However, he is unable to do anything about it. He could completely ignore the direction they are pushing him but then he won't be involved (which he wants to be despite his protests) and his curiosity wouldn't be satisfied. Plus, what if the world WILL end if he does nothing? Nic is stuck on following their directions despite his extreme frustration of being unable to do be at the helm of his own fate.
