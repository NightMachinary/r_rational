Higashino's work highly showcases the logic of "Hold off on proposing solutions".

If I had to paint a high-level picture, think of how an engineer would try to reverse-engineer a device they were not allowed to look into. What tests they would perform. His greatest ability is knowing precisely what the test results would yield and then work backward to the inconsistencies.

If I had to reverse-engineer a Higashino, I guess I'd first try to come up with the perfect crime, and then prove that a perfect crime is not really possible based on slight giveaways that are inherent to solving any problem. The inverse of the rule: "Don't come up with any plan which depends on more than three things to go in your favor". Any further discourse and I might be giving away spoilers.

If you had to start, go with the three Detective Galileo novels:

1. The Devotion of Suspect X
2. Salvation of a Saint
3. A Midsummer's Equation

Then go with the Detective Kaga Series:

1. Malice
2. Newcomer

And at last, you are left with two more English translated works:

1. Journey under the midnight sun
2. Naoko

Naoko is a different breed of suspense. So, I'd say you should keep it till the end.
