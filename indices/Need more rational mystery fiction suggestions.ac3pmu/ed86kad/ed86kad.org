For me, the ultimate mystery and meta-mystery deconstruction would be the Visual Novel [[https://store.steampowered.com/app/406550/Umineko_When_They_Cry__Question_Arcs/][Umineko no Naku koro ni]] . I highly recommend it, especially if you're willing to engage with it despite its crazy blend of rational and irrational elements. I can say more if you're interested, but I'd suggest going in as blindly as possible to preserve the integrity of the experience!
