/If on a Winter's Night a Traveler/ by Italo Calvino is a magnificent metanarrative mystery about the act of picking up a book called /If on a Winter's Night a Traveler/ by Italo Calvino. Extremely beautiful and good.

Also check out [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6178036/chapters/14154868][/CORDYCEPS: Too Clever for their Own Good,/]] which I think has the honor of being the only member of the epistemological mystery genre.
