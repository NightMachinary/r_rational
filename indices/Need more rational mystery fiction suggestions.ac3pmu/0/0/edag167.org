  If on a Winter's Night a Traveler by Italo Calvino is a magnificent metanarrative mystery about the act of picking up a book called If on a Winter's Night a Traveler by Italo Calvino. Extremely beautiful and good.

I should try it again. I remember starting reading it when I was pretty young and all I felt was frustration at how often I was left hanging by a new story that I had just gotten engaged by. Which... I guess... was the point, so mission accomplished XD?
