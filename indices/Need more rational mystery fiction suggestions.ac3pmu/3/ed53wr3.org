Could you explain a bit more about what Higashino's work does in terms of deconstructing plot, without spoiling the books? Which one should I read first?

In terms of deconstructing mystery/detective/thriller conventions, I would suggest:

The Chain of Chance and The Investigation by Stanislaw Lem

The Name Of The Rose and Foucault's Pendulum by Umberto Eco

The Death of the Author and A Closed Book by Gilbert Adair. I haven't read his Evadne Mount trilogy, but it is apparently a deconstruction of Agatha Christie's work, so might be relevant to your interests.

I couldn't get into it, but maybe also The Seven Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle by Stuart Turton (protagonist keeps experiencing a murder mystery plot, waking up as a different person involved each time).
