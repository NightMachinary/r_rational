- The power of the gods doesn't scale with worshipers, but their base identity shifts with the expectations of those worshipers, maybe being the average of their understanding of that god. A god doesn't get weaker with fewer worshipers, they get less coherent, more subject to individuals. Structured worship and structured religion is a way for the gods to maintain a coherent identity, which most of them very much want to do. (Lots of implications of this.)
- Worship and sacrifice directly impact the world in some way that the gods like. Maybe the god who is constantly demanding goat sacrifices really, really hates goats. The sacrifice is something that is /done for the gods/ in the hopes that they will repay you.
- Worship and sacrifice are good for the worshipers, which is why the gods require or ask for it. Most of the religious strictures are actually food safety guidelines in disguise. Maybe prayer is structured as a method of making people think through their problems, or empathize with others, or some other quick hack to reduce conflict or find better solutions. Gods don't listen to every prayer, and can't answer all the ones they do listen to, but if you pray right, you'll be better off than if you never prayed at all, which is what the gods want (and of course, different gods have different methods of prayer). (Wait, shit, you already said this one.)
