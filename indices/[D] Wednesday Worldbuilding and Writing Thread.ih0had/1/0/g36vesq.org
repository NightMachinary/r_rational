I think this depends highly on the history of the world. Assuming supes were at some point mostly public, but very rare, and now are both hidden and rare, I would think small isolated communities would form for both the species that can safely interact with humans and those that can't, and these pockets would have frequent enough interaction to be able to mostly understand their neighbor pockets but not necessarily all of them and not necessarily a distant pocket. Human interacting supes would likely be largely integrated, or maybe have an Amish style “go see the outside world and then come back” tradition, and therefore speak the local human languages natively.

If populations are low enough that communities aren't really possible, then I'd expect the life expectancies to be really extreme, and for most supes to be able to keep up with the language, even if they occasionally have to spend 10 years catching up.
