A little late to the party, but two (plus one) ideas I thought worth mentioning:

1) I think that the native language of a supes species in power has the best chance of becoming the supernatural langua franca. Maybe one species of some means became alarmed by the growing population of humanity and began exerting influence on other supes to form an inter-species organization, in order to preempt the possibility of being divided and conquered by humanity's sheer numbers. And because they were the first and or most-influential mover, their language ended up on top. This has a (vaguely?) historical parallel to how English became so widespread thanks to the British Empire and post-WWII America.

2) As for what the native language of each supes species would be, I think that might depend on how each species originated. For example, in a straight adaptation from OG Greek mythology, it would make sense for the centaurs to have originally spoke ancient (or Mycenaean?) Greek, as the first of them were the offspring Ixion (ancient Greek bad guy) and Nephele (a woman Zeus made from scratch out of a cloud). Then, over time, as centaurs do their own thing, maybe they become isolated enough from other ancient (or Mycenaean?) Greek speakers that they develop their own dialect and or language. Or if instead the centaurs are created from scratch by some bored deity, then their original native language would come from whoever first teaches them to speak. And if no one bothers to teach them... then I guess they gradually develop their own, the same way early hominids to humans must have?

3) The siren idea sounds totes legit!

No idea if any of the above if actually helpful. I just wanted to contribute something two weeks ago, and then distractions happened until now.
