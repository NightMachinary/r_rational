Okay! New information (to me); I'm totally down for some Duat / Otherworld / Norse cosmology / Nevernever geography. I think that the prevalence of “Undertongue” on Earth (and vice-versa, possibly) will mostly be a function of the relationship between Earth and the Underworld: if there is need to use the language it will be naturally maintained, and if not, it would likely atrophy, either falling into disuse in favour of other languages or gradually evolving into a new form. The obvious exceptions to all of the above are individuals (philologists?) who intend to preserve the Undertongue in its original form.

Slightly digression: Mycenaean Greek is a Bronze Age culture and language which declined during the Bronze Age Collapse, and is effectively the cultural-equivalent of “ancient Greece” to what we today call Ancient Greece (the Iron Age culture). It is, best as I can determine, the closest thing to a historical setting that can be applied to the “Heroic Age” of Greek mythology, and thus is the language that would have been spoken by Theseus, Heracles, and all the centaurs they fought and chilled with (...had they been real).

So, depending on the Siren's family history, if their lineage reaches all the way back to the Sirens that bothered the Argonauts and Odysseus, then it's plausible for Mycenaean Greek to be passed down within the family. But with Mycenaean having declined post-1150 BCE, more recent dialects may be more reasonable (see 2, below).

1) Now that I grasp the existence of the Underworld and Undertongue, I agree entirely! Also, Kraken (giant octopi???) imperialism sounds like... ultimate horror.

2) Agreed, if Undertongue is the original mother language of supes, then it's entirely a question of if or how much the various small out-groups accumulate other languages. As for the specific example of the Siren... well, in OG Greek myth, the lethal temptation of the Siren Song wasn't just its sheer musical beauty, but also its lyrical content (e.g., when they sang to Odysseus, they tempted him with the knowledge of “all things that come to pass on the fruitful earth”). So, if singing in a language understood by the audience increases the efficacy of Siren Song, then there is impetus for them to be current and multilingual.

Glad I could be helpful, and not just trying too hard to be cool-smart! XD

P.S.: Sorry for taking even longer to respond. I failed several spot checks of the upper-right corner of Reddit.
