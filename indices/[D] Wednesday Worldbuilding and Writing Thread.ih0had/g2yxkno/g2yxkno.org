Urban fantasy and language, let's go!

Real pulp urban fantasy (True Blood, Buffy, World of Darkness) has a few features: long-lived creatures of various human or superhuman level intelligence species (that are often at various stages of peace/war/conflict with one another) spread throughout the world. I'm calling them "supes" for short.

How would they communicate? You imagine a vampire that needs to move in human circles keeping up to date with the local human language, but what would a Sphynx do? Being clearly non-human, she's not going to have much interest in learning human languages except insomuch as she needs to communicate with other supes who know them. She'd probably speak her one native language (what would it be? /would/ she speak Ancient Egyptian, or would she speak Sphynx?) and whatever other languages she picked up.

Yes, supes have the time to learn many languages, and many would devote some portion of their time to it: but humans have the time to learn many languages, and very few anglophones speak more than one. It seems that language learning is done either from passion (so you'd have lots of supes who speak hundreds of languages they accumulated over the years with increasing velocity) or from necessity (so you'd have lots of supes who pick up and then drop languages as they gain/lose need).

So, with that background musing out the way, here's the questions I'm interested in discussing this week:

- Would supes have a lingua franca? What would it be? A constructed language? An ancient language that everyone teaches their children for the purposes of a lingua franca (kind of like Latin in the middle ages)? The native language of a species that is in power?

- What would the native language of these species /be/? I see no reason for them to speak human languages "natively", as they presumably don't have human parents (except vampires, werewolves). Why would a centaur, a siren, a sphynx, or a griffin learn to speak middle English just because they were born in the time and place of Shakespeare? But then, would these four different species have their own individual language (languageS, surely, because humans aren't monoliths who share one language)? Presumably the vocal cords of a griffin wouldn't be amenable to the same phonemes as a centaur.

- Imagine say, a centaur and a vampire meet. The vampire no doubt speaks their original human language. What does the centaur speak? How do they communicate? This is the thrust of my post, I guess: what's their lingua franca. Was the vampire expected to learn a supe language to fit in? Was the supe expected to learn a few human languages in case they need to speak to vampires? What if supes are very high status and vampires are very low status? Probably the vampire would be expected to learn the supe's language, right?

- How long do languages remain mutually intelligible? Shakespeare is barely intelligible to me (you need the usage notes), and you miss a lot of the nuance (e.g. the double meaning of "nothing", the pun with "country"). So probably 250-300 years is about right? How easily could a long-lived creature "keep up with the language"? Adults today don't understand modern slang, so I'd imagine it would be a lot of effort (i.e. it would impinge on "language learning time" for both the passionate and the non-passionate).

- I had the concept of a 400 year old siren based in Greece, who spoke Greek, but in an unholy mix of the past 400 years of vocabulary that was a bit hard to understand because, being a siren, he'd never really had need to maintain "easy communication" with the local humans - a weird, jilted, jarring style was perfectly servable when he needed to interact with local humans, and the local supes had picked up Greek for much the same reason and tended to have a similar command of 400+ years of Greek vocab and made similar mistakes. IDK why I am mentioning this, I just thought it was something that would obviously happen with supes as described above and I wanted opinions.
