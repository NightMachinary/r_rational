I currently can't think of a single novel, even trash ones, that failed in plausibly explaining why the undiscovered combo was undiscovered. Most of the probability failures were in other aspects of the worldbuilding, like economics/politics/real-world assassins going after the MC (?????)/ nonsensical game balance/inconsistent explanations.

LitRPG and VRMMORPG type stories have a relatively high probability buy-in and many of your provided circumstances are basically freebies in worldbuilding. Undiscovered combo kind of falls under the buy-in,and it's basically free as well.

The things you need to consider are the secondary effects of the discovery and basically explaining or showing the meta. Some bad novels don't properly explain why no one else copies the MC. Or if other people do copy, don't think about the secondary effects properly. Sometimes, the meta doesn't shift and the MC remains the dominating outlier, which doesn't make sense either.
