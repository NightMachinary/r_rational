Interesting. I do plan to have a number of cycles of new content in the game's past, and the story starts just as new content is released as well.

  In general, I think readers will accept at least one lucky break as part of the premise if it happens *at the beginning of the story.*

Hm. I need the combo to be a solution to a major problem rather than a starting point. The main character struggles with this problem and figures out a solution quite a bit into the story (it is crafting related rather than fighting if that matters).

I really don't want readers to feel that the combo should already have been found.
