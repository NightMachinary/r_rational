In competitive settings, the meta could have settled into a stable configuration with several dominate strategies/builds/approaches. An newcomer might try something entirely different which people believe won't work at the highest level of play, but the newcomer manages to progressively improve on it and tweak their new thing to counter the meta. When the newcomer reaches the highest level, their off-meta strategy has the additional merit of being totally unexpected

For a real world example... not a MMORPG example, but rather a virtual CCG example... in Shadowverse, the meta changes every 3 months as new cards are released. I can think of several times were the meta seemed thoroughly explored by the 2nd month and then an off-meta deck suddenly rises to prominence in the last month. Hypothetically if a less experienced or more stubborn player started with the basis for that off meta-deck in the first few weeks and stuck with it, tweaking it to counter the meta that emerged, they could have around an entire month or so in which their off-meta deck not only beats the meta decks by directly countering them but also because the players using the meta decks don't know the right counterplays to the off-meta deck.

In an MMO setting, the new player might simply be lucky and/or stubborn and stick with something that seems unoptimal for far too long and gradually find a way of tweaking it to counter something meta.

In general, I think readers will accept at least one lucky break as part of the premise if it happens at the beginning of the story.
