Ideas for avoiding the [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodsNeedPrayerBadly][Gods Need Prayer Badly]] trope while still explaining why sacrifices are made to the God(s) and/or the God(s) are worshipped?

A few ideas I've already thought about. Feel free to expand upon them.

- The god(s) are simply egotistical.
- The worship/sacrifice have community building functions. For instance, animal sacrifices might serve as food for the priests. Large ceremonies might have a nationalistic role. (this is part of the real world reason). This does kind of beg the question as to the point of the gods then.
- The god(s) don't need worship/sacrifices, but people think they do and the gods don't care enough to correct them.
- The gods don't directly need worship/sacrifices, they are eternal/immortal, but the sacrifices allow them more influence on the world
- The gods are keeping score between themselves and worship/sacrifices are worth points. Or are a way of gaming the scoring method.
- The gods think worship is good for their followers psychologically (I think this is given as a reason by some Christian theologians)

Other ideas?
