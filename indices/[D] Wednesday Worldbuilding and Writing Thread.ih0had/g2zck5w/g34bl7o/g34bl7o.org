This website talks about gods in the ancient world though with a Greek and Roman bent. But here are some bullet points I half remember.

• Gods are in charge of certain things, you want to stay on the good side of as many as possible but mostly of the strongest ones

EX

War god, food god, weather god, god of childbirth

• But small gods will typical be sated with less and be easier to catch the attention of than the big ones

• Sacrifices to the gods is bartering for them to help you out

EX

Prayer: I give you chicken, you give me rain? God: Y?/N?

• Certain sacrifices happen because there's a reliable outcome from said sacrifices

EX

Priest: The earth god usually responds if we pour wine on the ground, dance for 5 minutes and fast for 3 days.

Earth god: You did it right so sure, soil is now fertile
