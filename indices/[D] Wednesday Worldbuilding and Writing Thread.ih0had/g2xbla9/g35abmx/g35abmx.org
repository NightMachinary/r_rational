I need to see some math and/or estimates here. I'm having a hard time buying that this would actually work financially. In particular, under taxes, although you talk about generally low taxes, you also talk about a potentially hefty wealth tax and an inheritance tax. I'm expecting you get little to no revenue from those taxes as the wealthy elite end up emigrating to other countries while denouncing you as a tyrant who tries to "rob the people with absurdly high taxes".

Then there's:

  Plus the government would pay for the insurance of those who couldn't afford it

  A variety of free nutritious, but bland food like Soylent is provided by the government for free to anyone for personal consumption. Additionally the government subsidizes almost all rent for the poor, to ensure all housing can be high quality.

  The country buys modern military hardware from other NATO members, but only enough to be militarily superior to its much poorer neighbors.

  Primarily the function of the military is a public health and jobs training program.... serving good food, having nice amenities...

  Infrastructure is one of the largest government expenditures, because while toll roads are common outside cities, other infrastructure must be publicly funded.

  The government maintains large stockpiles of many essential goods able to last for years in the event of a crisis.

  The government is focusing large efforts on space infrastructure which once complete will be vastly cheaper than all other methods of getting into space.

  The government has put a great deal of money into shaping the coast: Builds many large artificial reefs partly to attract tourists. Has created many artificial islands adjacent to urban centers to create more valuable seaside land, generate tourism, and as breakwaters. Seawalls have been preemptively built anywhere they are expected to be needed in the next few decades.

Post-scarcity economies are pretty cool, but can this fantasy Venezuela actually afford to do that?
