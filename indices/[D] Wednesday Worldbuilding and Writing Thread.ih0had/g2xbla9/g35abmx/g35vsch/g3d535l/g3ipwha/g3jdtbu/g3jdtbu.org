I guess it depends how you go about it. if your taxes prevent random Joes from leaving then it's a problem. If your taxes prevent destabilization of your economy via mass expatriation of the 1%ers and 15%ers, that's just banking security. Mind you the %ers can leave, they just can't take so much of their money with them to wreck your nation.
