Thanks for the feedback, this is exactly the sort of thing I'm looking for to help refine my ideas.\\
I've tried to make some changes and additions to make it more clear how quickly this Venezuela is supposed to diverge from the Venezuela of our timeline.

#+begin_quote
  I need to see some math and/or estimates here.
#+end_quote

Yeah there are certain areas where I left things deliberately vague or I just link to other sources, for instance the specifics of the futarchy system would default to "whatever Robin Hanson endorses", because fleshing out /every single detail/ would require I be an economist myself. Generally when I make a comparative claim like a tax being "high" I mean on the high end of the distribution of wealthy nations. Since I where I haven't fleshed something out I default to assuming this Venezuela is similar to other wealthy nations, so as to error on the side of caution.

  In particular, under taxes, although you talk about generally low taxes, you also talk about a potentially hefty wealth tax and an inheritance tax. I'm expecting you get little to no revenue from those taxes as the wealthy elite end up emigrating to other countries while denouncing you as a tyrant who tries to "rob the people with absurdly high taxes".
#+end_quote

The inheritance taxes are decently high, but only as high as South Korea (and slightly more than France) and those countries seem to be doing fine (though the structure of the estate tax was designed to avoid the major issues with South Korea's estate tax). The nice thing about having the social security system double as a large part of the estate tax is that it can't be dodged, because people never have access to their principle so they can't exactly leave the country and take the money with them (even if they could access the /dividends/ from abroad).

  Post-scarcity economies are pretty cool, but can this fantasy Venezuela actually afford to do that?
#+end_quote

Venezuela in this timeline has a lot of advantages because almost all profits from oil (with Venezuela having the worlds biggest reserve) and other natural resources goes into the states sovereign wealth fund. Hell even in our timeline where most of that resource wealth was embezzled/wasted, Venezuela was /still/ able to support staggering government expenses up until oil prices crashed (just look at the figures for what an absurd portion of the populace were government employees). The country has also made sure to consistently run a surplus so that it has been able to benefit from the compound growth of its SWF. The very high immigration would also mean this Venezuela much, /much/ more populous than it is in our timeline, definitely exceeding Brazil.\\
The country is hardly a post-scarcity economy since none of the welfare the government provides is /unique/, and is generally provided in a much more cost effective way than what is the norm.

Below I make some comments on areas where I suspect the expenses you brought up are less significant than you think:

#+begin_quote
  Plus the government would pay for the insurance of those who couldn't afford it
#+end_quote

This should be much less costly than the single payer healthcare systems most wealthy nations have. Since the healthcare system was structure with incentives aligned so that it should be able to match the costs in many developing nations (by virtue of not experiencing the explosion in costs experienced by wealthy nations).

#+begin_quote
  A variety of free nutritious, but bland food like Soylent is provided by the government for free to anyone for personal consumption. Additionally the government subsidizes almost all rent for the poor, to ensure all housing can be high quality.
#+end_quote

Lots of nations have something like a food stamp system and this should be much cheaper because people usually will prefer normal food to something like soylent, and it's much cheaper to produce than normal food. The rent subsidizes however are absolutely a one of the governments largest expenses, making up most government welfare (though again other nations do similar things in ways which should usually be less cost effective).

#+begin_quote
  Infrastructure is one of the largest government expenditures, because while toll roads are common outside cities, other infrastructure must be publicly funded.
#+end_quote

This is also absolutely a major expense, but other less wealthy (per capita) nations like China have done this, and by structuring things like Hong Kong's MTR Venezuela should waste a lot less money.

#+begin_quote
  The country buys modern military hardware from other NATO members, but only enough to be militarily superior to its much poorer neighbors.
#+end_quote

I don't know why you would think was a major expense given their spending only what they have to. After all this is like the US spending only as much on military hardware as necessary to be militarily superior to Mexico and Canada. So the expenses here should be relatively trivial compared to the costs of the rest of the military.

#+begin_quote
  Primarily the function of the military is a public health and jobs training program.... serving good food, having nice amenities...
#+end_quote

The military is certainly a major part of the government's expenses, since it's focused on job training though some of this cost should be offset by the economic benefits it provides. The military also serve multiple functions which saves money, since its members provide the labor for many government projects (at no /additional/ ongoing cost), disaster relief, etc.

#+begin_quote
  The government has put a great deal of money into shaping the coast: Builds many large artificial reefs partly to attract tourists. Has created many artificial islands adjacent to urban centers to create more valuable seaside land, generate tourism, and as breakwaters. Seawalls have been preemptively built anywhere they are expected to be needed in the next few decades.
#+end_quote

There's a reason so many highly urbanized asian countries already do this quite a lot, since creating new land near urban centers can be very profitable. So the main limit on land reclamation might actually be environmental concerns more so than cost.
