[[https://docs.google.com/document/d/17XdKfhcpd9xnfjPEwRIEQZXmxF42gW2ImOcqBrsyBp0/edit?usp=sharing][I've developed a fictional country that utilizes many of the obscure political policies and governance structures that are talked about in the rational community.]]

Would like for people to point out any glaring issues, especially if it's because of specific expertise.
