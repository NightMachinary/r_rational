I could imagine that across species, supes having established customs and rituals and maybe a few phrases without having a full language. After all, if different species rarely meet each other, they probably wouldn't be able to properly practice and maintain a specialized language but certain customs, like offering bread and salt to indicate hospitality, and certain commonly used phrases might be used enough to be remembered.

This could lead to some interesting scenarios. The ancient spells spoken by cultists to communicate to their sleeping god are actually just garbled commonly used phrases that were most frequently used to talk to the God back when it was awake and bothered to learn a bit of the local human language. Or the siren scenario you described, where the garbled tongue of a particularly influential and established supe become the language of a local supe community.

I would bet either the most used local human language or the most widespread would be the most common lingua franca. Maybe Latin, since it was spoken across Europe by the educated? In the modern era, in Europe and America, I could see it being split between Latin and English, as post World War II English became common enough to finally be worth learning/relearning by the supes. To go to your vampire meets centaur scenario, it depends on who is educated and how recently. The centaur might be irritated that the younger vampire hasn't learned latin, the common tongue of Europe for hundreds of years and thus the centaur muddles through with English, which it hasn't quite gotten around to mastering yet, which the French vampire went to the trouble of learning since it is so commonly used in the modern human World.
