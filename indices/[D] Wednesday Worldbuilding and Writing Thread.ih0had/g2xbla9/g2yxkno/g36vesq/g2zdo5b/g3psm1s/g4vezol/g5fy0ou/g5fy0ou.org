Thanks so much for your comment! I apologise for taking so long to respond to it but I really wanted to take the time.

A lot of this is complicated by my setting not putting Our World on a pedestal: most supes live in "the underworld", essentially a second Earth / alternate dimension / plane of existence, and only a few bother to make a life on Earth. That said, many do live their whole lives there (my Greek siren for example), and others just happen to like it (maybe they're not popular with other supes, or just like isolation, or like free range human meat?). But it /does/ mean that the Underworld would have its own languages similar to Earth having its own languages, and maybe the Underworld lingua franca is what has caught on on Earth. But would they teach Undertongue to, say, vampires? I suppose it would only take one vampire to spread it, and Modern Vampires barter a lot in teaching skills, and being able to communicate with supes fairly reliable would be a pretty neat skill... hmmm.

I'm wondering if it's more legitimate that the Siren would have learned "Ancient Greek"(Mycenaean? idk, I'd research the right name) from Mommy Siren, or Vampire would have learned Undertongue from another vampire in a "trade" that would help with situations like this. The latter adds more depth to the story, but also might be a bit of an annoying aside to make when the alternative seems equally sensible.

1) Could definitely still work, more or less as written, with the proviso that the Supe that brings this along chooses Undertongue as it's the ~English(or Latin, French, Chinese depending on your era) equiv in the Underworld, and it's adopted after a bit of angry posturing between a few who think that Undertongue represents Kraken imperialism or whatever.

2) I like this as concept, but if we assume that supes originate in the Underworld waaaay back, and the populations that interacted with people in Greece/etc are small groups of weirdos who decided to live elsewhere, those people wouldn't be speaking Greek originally but whatever their "native" language was. But I suppose if they lived in Greece for a few generations they'd speak it too becuase why not. It just feels /weird/ having Sirens, which are clearly not human, speaking Greek, but... if they have brains and mouths they can /learn/, damnit.

Thanks, I appreciate you taking the time to give me some thoughts to riff off of!
