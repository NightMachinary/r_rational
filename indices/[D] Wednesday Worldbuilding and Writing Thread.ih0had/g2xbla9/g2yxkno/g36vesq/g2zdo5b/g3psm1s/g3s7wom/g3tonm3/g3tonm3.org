about Latin:

Latin is a very old language, compared to English, that has fell out of use and codified. There are several chronological types of Latin, but Classical Latin is probably THE language that legal, medical, and scientific jargon is based on, precisely because it is a word-rich language with very well tested grammar rules.

English does not compare to that. English has messy grammar, and its a live language that keeps pirating words from other languages all the time, most notably from French, Spanish and German.

If you want a language for Magic, you need something that no longer changes, and is already as versatile as possibly needed. There is no concept that could not be worded using Latin, AFAIK.

Generation Latin 3.0 would be great, except the chaos that would happen DURING the development. If Latin was the language of magic, then messing up the declension in a sentence might not just mean failing an exam, or making a faux pas, but actually blowing yourself up. It would be like going from Imperial to Metric System, except if saying "10 inches!" or "20 centimeters!" could set your arm on fire.
