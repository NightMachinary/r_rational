Thanks so much, I really appreciate all the careful thought you put into your response! I especially appreciate you pointing out the obvious-in-retrospect fact that if supes are disperse, they are going to come into contact with humans from necessity (even if they don't have servants, they are probably going to want to buy, like, wood, occaisionally).

  Because Classical Latin is a VERY precise and meticulously developed language that has grammar and words for every possible idea

Is this true, or is this [[/r/badlinguistics]] ? Like, English and Indonesian could probably fit this bill, because languages are "turing complete" (I know that's not a real concept for natural language, but you can explain things: those lists of untranslatable vocabulary that proceed to /translate all the words/ are proof enough). If Classical Latin is special in some way, and that specialness is so important that supes would learn the language for spell casting/etc, then it would stand to reason that they might want to expand and improve on it and generate Latin 3.0?
