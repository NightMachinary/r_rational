Surely, if latin became used as a lingua franca, it would start to change? I could definitely see it (or even PIE) being used as a language for spell-casting (would explain why "nonsense" words, eg abracadabra, have a meaning - perhaps abracadabra meant "kill this thing in a flash of green light" in PIE), but when people communicate, it's going to start getting polluted.

But that's a problem whatever the lingua franca, I suppose. Hm.
