Ok, several points:

- In any sensible story, that at least aims at realism (True Blood and WoD come to mind) supes are rare, far fewer than humans, and mostly hide from humans trying to blend in, or keep to remote wilderness. What that means, is that effectively supes would adopt local human languages first, out of sheer necessity, because baring some very inhuman supes, most of them would be interacting with humans.

- because of the above, I believe there would be several types of "lingua franca", most notably Latin, English and Chinese, plus possibly Spanish and Russian.

- if there are any "native supe languages" those would very likely be used only between supes of the same type, as some kind of Sacred Tongue, used for formal occasions.

- long lived, humanoid supes would very likely influence human language a far bit over the centuries, just by using it. It would be likely that modern common English is the way it is partly because there are hundreds of vampires who refuse to let go of old grammar and words and keep feeding it back into common use.

- for many supes, especially Europe based, Classical Latin is likely the language of Magic, contracts, and politics. Why? Because Classical Latin is a VERY precise and meticulously developed language that has grammar and words for every possible idea, and thus allows for a very precise speech or writing. If you are a 1000 year old vampire writing a Hunting Grounds contract, or a Demon buying a soul, or a Witch casting a complex ritual spell, you want to be as precise and non ambiguous as possible.

- a lot of immortal/long lived supes woudl likely speak in two "modes": standard modern language for everyday dealings with normals, and speaking with their original accent or original language when wanting to show their age (and thus, power). So say, a 2000 year old vampire might speak with a mild Boston accent on a normal night, but make him mad enough and he would rant with a throaty Ancient Germanic accent of his warlord days.

- the more "natural" the supernatural creature is, the less likely it is to remember old languages. Biological creatures change over time, and overwrite their old knowledge. A 600 year old centaur likely does not remember the language he spoke as a young colt, but a 600 year old vampire would, since being frozen in time is the whole point of their curse. Biologicals forget and move on, but the undead do not, and it applies to languages as well.

- and finally: if there is Magic in the setting, it very likely influences language as well. As a rule of the thumb, you do not want to cast spells using your regular language, or you run a risk on accidentally throwing a spell during normal conversation. This would encourage magical supes to forcibly try to make good quality languages obscure, but not forgotten. This way, these precise languages (like Latin) stay alive and learnable, but unlikely to spread to the general population and cause a leak of magical spells.
