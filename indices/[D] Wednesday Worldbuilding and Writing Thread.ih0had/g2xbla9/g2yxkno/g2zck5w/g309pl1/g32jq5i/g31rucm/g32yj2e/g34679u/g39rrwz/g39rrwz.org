If there original luck was picking or having the opportunity to get the right item/class/skill/ability (in spite of the meta or theorycrafters or recommended builds) and their subsequent finding of a key combo builds off that initial premise, then it should be acceptable to the reader, especially if it is foreshadowed.

So for instance, if the main character picks a crafting class against the recommended starting classes and happens to make it initially work, and most of the meta focused players don't bother with focusing on crafting (perhaps crafted items are viewed as inferior to rare dropped items at the highest level of play, and items purchased from NPCs are an acceptable stopgap), then the main character finding new combos within the crafting class should be acceptable for the reader.
