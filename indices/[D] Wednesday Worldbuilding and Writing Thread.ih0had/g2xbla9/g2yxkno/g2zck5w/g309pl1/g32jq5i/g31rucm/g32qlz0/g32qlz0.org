Perhaps I am overly concerned with plausibility. I just don't want the things the main character figures out feel like they should have been discovered long ago by the tens or even hundreds of thousands (or /millions/) of players that have played the game for years.

And on the other hand I want it plausible that the main character /figures it out/ - not handed it on a silver platter just to satisfy the plot.
