Unfortunately, the main character picks an established combination of class and skills for a different purpose at the beginning.

Later, the main character solves an important problem by finding a new synergy that at its core is a few skills (generally considered useless) and an item (also generally considered useless). The skills and item have been known for some time, but the combination is unknown.

That is why I want it to be plausibly obscure.
