That's a good list. To add to it:

- Theorycrafters might be mistaken about how a mechanic actually works, due to either a misreading of the rules, rules which have a different implementation from what the UI shows, or something else.
- The combo might be powerful only in a team/group/guild setting, which is harder to theorycraft for due to combinatoric explosion and the general difficulties of attempting to theorycraft how two or more builds might work together.
- There are unknown bugs or anomalies within the skills that were never discovered because testing (both by the devs and by the theorycrafters) was focused on other areas.

Generally speaking, I think most people will give you a bit of a pass if it's the conceit of the work, so you don't need to put in that much effort to figuring it out. It would be better to, IMO, but not /necessary/.
