How to make it plausible that a new player of a game is the first that finds a combination of skills and/or items that is quite powerful or profitable?

In games today players theorycraft and test just about everything very quickly, so finding an unknown combo needs some mitigating circumstances to be plausible.

Some things I have been thinking about are (in no particular order):

- Large number of clesses, skills and items makes theorycrafting take more effort and time. This is not in itself a barrier, but helps amplify below points.
- The game has been live a long time, and things that has been theorycrafted and "proven" to be useless might interact with things released years later. Theorycrafters may be working with outdated assumptions.
- If people are able to earn real world money by playing the game, the sharing of information might be less free than it is in games today. Fewer theorycrafters have a complete picture. On the other hand, successful guilds may hire entire teams of theorycrafters.
- Categories of classes, skills or items may have a "bad reputation" as being useless; for example in a VRMMO some professions or skills might be primarily for the enjoyment of the players rather than effectiveness in dungeons. They may be passed over when theorycrafting.
- Some effects may only be discoverable if you have knowledge in the area the effect is intended for and an (more or less) related area where it has an interesting side effect. Or perhaps only if you /perform tests/ using skills and/or items from those two areas. If one area has "bad reputation", there may be few theorycrafting players who can perform those tests due to their class and skill choices.
- The combo is powerful only in a narrow scope that is not common, either because it has "bad reputation" or because there is little attractive content of that scope. That scope can, with the combo, somehow be leveraged to greater potential.
- There are combos that are easier to discover that are equally or more powerful but has some cost or limitation that can be avoided using the new combo.
- Rarity of items that are key to the combo may also limit who can perform tests. Too rare, or especially /previously unknown/, items will potentially make the reader feel like the combo is handed to the character.\\
- Being a single character game would limit players to testing (but not theorycrafting) things using the class, skills and items they have access to.\\

Any other ideas? How much is needed, in your opinion, to make it plausible that a new player finds an undiscovered combo?
