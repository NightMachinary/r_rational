I have a new(?) head cannon concerning worm.\\
The reason why Entities are close to mindless is because of their anti-malware procedure. You see, among anti-cancer laser and reprogramable flesh white cell, they have the total perspective canon (a concept taken from hitchhiker guide to the galaxy ) as part of their routine checkup.

So, if a shard gain the abilty to understand what is their context and understand their place in it (a requierement to apply tool correctly) then they also become succeptible to the total perspective canon effect.
