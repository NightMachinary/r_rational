In classical myth, the usual explanation was that the gods didn't /need/ sacrifice (they existed and were powerful before they made humans, after all), but they did /enjoy/ the sensation of being sacrificed to immensely. The smell of burnt offerings being pleasurable to them is often mentioned.

Of course, there were differing schools of thought on this historically! But this was a common theory, anyway. (And that's without getting into different religions, e.g. the Aztec gods did literally depend on sacrifice for power IIRC.)
