- The gods don't want to be bothered by endless frivolous requests for their intervention. To keep things manageable, they instructed their priests that they would require sacrifices to provide their aid, with bigger sacrifices for bigger requests, and a threat of punishment for anyone who fails to appease them. In practice, these punishments are only used on people who are endlessly spamming them.

- The sacrifices can somehow be arranged to allow a prayer to get through a spam filter. The gods can basically ignore their millions of followers, and only receive messages when large and very specific sacrifices are made, like a barrel of absinthe and a basket of incense burned at sunset at a shrine to the god in question using a bonfire made with goat tallow and charcoal derived from willow saplings.
