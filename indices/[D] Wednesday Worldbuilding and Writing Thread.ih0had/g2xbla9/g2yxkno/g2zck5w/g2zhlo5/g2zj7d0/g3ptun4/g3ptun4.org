  A god doesn't get weaker with fewer worshipers, they get less coherent, more subject to individuals. Structured worship and structured religion is a way for the gods to maintain a coherent identity, which most of them very much want to do.

would that also not work in the opposite way?

I mean, If Im a Horned Toad, the God of the Southern Swamps, this identity and my "story" woudl stay pretty coherent if I have 100 worshippers and they all know the Gospel of the Horned Toad by memory.

But If I have 1000 0000 worshippers, and they split into factions, reformants, counter-reformants, etc, then I would be averaged out into just Toadlike God of Vague Wilderness
