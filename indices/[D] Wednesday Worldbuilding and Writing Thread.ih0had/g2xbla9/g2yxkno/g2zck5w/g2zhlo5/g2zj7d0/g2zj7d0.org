I really like the first one. Depending on the exact mechanic, the god might even prefer a smaller population of worshippers if it lets them get more committed or more homogenous worshippers that can be impressed with an exact perception of the god's identity. Or they could use a mystery religion setup to protect and cultivate their identity. Backstory for an urban fantasy take on YHWH: they accidentally erase their own identity and motivation in the process of trying to make themselves omniscient/omnipresent.

I thought of the basic idea of the last one, but you fleshed it out a lot better. Thinking about the real world, you can kind of see the different theologies at work in the different denominations of Christianity: the greedy requests of prosperity gospel, the more moderate requests of denominations with a less literal belief in the power of prayer, the formulaic prayers of Catholicism, the passive aggressive prayers and indirect gossip in Southern Baptists, etc. In a fantasy setting you could have a lot more specially designed prayers depending on the God's expertise and goals: complex patterns of therapeutic meditation, spells intermixed into the prayer, a communal way of addressing taboo topics... this seems like a really rich vein of ideas to explore.

Also, no pressure, but I am really psyched up for the Worth the Candle take on the gods.
