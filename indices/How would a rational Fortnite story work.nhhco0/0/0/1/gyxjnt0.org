Make it a /Dungeon Crawler Carl/ sort of setup where you're rewarded for being entertaining.

Or, alternatively, start the story centuries into the setup, with most of the cast literally driven insane by that point. Though that would probably result in a somewhat different flavour of silliness. (Or maybe not, I don't know anything about /Fortnite/. Is there a character whose comedic gimmick is being an insensate vegetable? What about an ultra-violent cannibal rapist? This might still work if you go the pitch-black humour route, with trigger warnings: yes.)
