You could write something like [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/1vwndq/sisyphus_harry_potter/][sisyphus]], maybe, a psychological horror look into what it would be like being trapped in a samsara of endless war.

The problem is that it would be very difficult to reconcile that kind of story with all the shitpost/irreverence otherwise present in Fortnite's material -- travis scott concerts, the dances, all the nonsense.

It's probably possible to write something poignant, but the world isn't a natural choice for that kind of story and I'd be surprised if anyone was interested in giving it a real shot.
