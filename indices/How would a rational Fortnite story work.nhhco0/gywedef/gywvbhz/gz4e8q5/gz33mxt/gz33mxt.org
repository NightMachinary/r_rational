Dunno, never played it. Not sure if it has a fleshed out backstory to work with.But it's not a VR game. And that makes it either a story about gamers having to play Fortnite over and over on their PC or phone (which... could be a story about addiction and/or elementary school, I guess). But if you want people actually be trapped in a world, do a "Population One"-story instead?\\
Or at least play any Battle Royale title in VR yourself.Caprica season 1 has a "trapped in a virtual world"-story arc.And obviously the Hunger Games or the original Battle Royale have other aspects.

EDIT:\\
I lied. I rember that I did play it once to try it. Had unplayably bad performance on my gaming laptop and I decided that I had no time for that. Bit of a letdown.
