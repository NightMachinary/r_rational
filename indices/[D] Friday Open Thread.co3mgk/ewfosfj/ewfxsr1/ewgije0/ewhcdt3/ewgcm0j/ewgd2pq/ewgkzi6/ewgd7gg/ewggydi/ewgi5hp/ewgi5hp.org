Ah apologies, that's due to a lack of added details. I fully meant precommitment.

The stakes would be my lifestyle. Selfish yeah, but it'd work on me.

I'd donate all of my money to the foundation that is funding the research, and get my own paychecks from there. Additionally, I'd limit my own access to the oracle such that I can only use it if the foundation is operational.

Even if I did get access to it, you can only win the lottery/day trade perfectly/etc so many times before someone takes offence.
