  Well, yes, but taking the best example of randomness we have available to us: quantum decay, you'd need some awful strong evidence to suggest that the process isn't truly random. And whilst it's true that you'd need strong evidence to show the existence of time travel, I still think the time travel hypothesis wins out

If it were truly random, it'd be different in different timelines.

  I was also assuming that you had access to the transmitter. I guess that isn't explicitly said in the prompt, but the future you that is transmitting the messages at some point will become a present you, and it was from this present that I was thinking.

That's a whole other question.
