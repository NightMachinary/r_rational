First, I'd use it to amass funds. There are countless ways to do this, enough that I could say it's a given that I have arbitrarily large amounts of money. While living my now comfortable life, I abuse the power of precommitment to solve problems facing humanity. I'd commit to hiring and suporting huge teams of mathematicians to solve various pure maths and comp sci proofs, sending the answers to myself back in time.

I'd accomplish this by fully committing to whatever problem the team is currently working on until future me spits out the answer. I then have the team verify it, and set them on the next one. They'd either hate me for somehow intuiting what all their hard work is leading towards, or revere me as some sort of super genius.
