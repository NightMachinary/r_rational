Power zero is disaster aversion. You can't do anything else if you're dead. Power one is duplication: How do you expand the capabilities? Have more than one? Etc.

A device like this does not let me have more time, or have more resources (directly), it just lets me use what I have to best effect.

Power two is probably money, aka, "general resources". Ideally something that garners some fame along with it, so that now you have the two easy "resources" that let you get more of them, although it's easier to turn money into anything else than anything else into money.

Now you have a real choice. Try to build the machine into yourself, like an additional sense? Try to turn it into something that produces Coherent Extrapolated Volition, and just follow it forever? Go after worldly missions - nuclear de-escalation, global disaster aversion, Golden Path...?

Depends a lot on the temporal model behind it.
