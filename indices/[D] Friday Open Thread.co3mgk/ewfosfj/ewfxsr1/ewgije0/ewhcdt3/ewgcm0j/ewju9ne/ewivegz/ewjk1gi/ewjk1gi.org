  Has anyone managed to turn Twitter into a generally positive experience?
#+end_quote

Yes. Aside from specific people, my general advice would be /Art/ (also memes).

I might have just gotten lucky - I don't have a twitter account, I occasionally browse when other thing link there, so maybe I avoid seeing negativity because I don't see everything a person has posted, only a snapshot of most of what they post. I have a similar experience around youtube - I listen to music, and everyone commenting (when I look at the comments) seems positive, like "This is my favorite song" etc. (Unless youtube leaned harder on censoring criticism, and everyone's comments about it being bad are from before that, I don't know what the issue is.)

  Like, idunno, it would be nice if people split their twitter accounts between a normal account and an optional â€˜$name is angry about the world' account that I could just choose not to touch.

I'd love this, though once in a blue moon I come across examples of people mentioning stuff on their account that is that type of thing, but is good to know.
