I figure people here might be interested - there will be a fairly large community meetup by [[https://www.lesswrong.com/events/8fzBPHx8aQjrBNRqg/european-community-weekend-2019][Lesswrong]] over in Berlin, Germany from 30th of August to 2nd of September. I believe they still have free spots, so if anyone is in Europe and wants to go there, look at the link to register.
