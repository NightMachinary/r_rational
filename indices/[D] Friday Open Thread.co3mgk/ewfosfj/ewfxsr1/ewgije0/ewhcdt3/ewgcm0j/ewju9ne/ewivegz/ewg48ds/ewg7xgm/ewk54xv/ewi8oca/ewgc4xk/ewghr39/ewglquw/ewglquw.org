Yes, that's definitely the issue in this case.

But! --and I haven't thought about it too much so I could be wrong -- I think the case could be made that good world building happens cumulatively and organically. For the case of your isekai or litrpg protagonist, I want to see them act realistically when finding themselves, abruptly, in a new world. Have them explore and more gradually come to the understanding that this is, in fact a totally new world as they discover magic exists and people mofumofu things like it's totally normal behavior.

I much more appreciate the stories that have characters who question and explore things. Who actually act... rationally. Things I see that at least somewhat work: "Is this a prank? Real funny guys," "am I dreaming/in a coma?", "am I in a game or actually transported to a new universe that is exactly like the game?", "Ooh, can I do still do X here?", "Does this mean gods actually exist?"

(Of course, few works take a serious look at the mechanics or ramifications behind such a transition, to my dismay. I'd love to see reincarnation or the like munchkin'd!)

Here, the scene that set me off on this rant:

#+begin_quote
  First of all, although he had no idea how the interface had transmigrated together with him, he had to treat this world as his new reality, meaning that if he died, he could not bank on being able to respawn like in a game.
#+end_quote

I hate how the fact that he can't treat it like a game is shoehorned in here. The possibility that he could die and be OK is never brought up again. To me, this the author being lazy and wanting this situation to be the case, without having to go through the effort of showing us why it should actually be that way. Having access to the interface should make the character think the opposite, for heaven's sake!
