Broadly speaking:

- Any action that costs little to try is now trivial (e.g. computer security is non-existent because hacking is "an action" in most RPGs).

- Any action where failure is expensive is now a nightmare (e.g. all cars are made illegal to drive above 10 km/h - and are still covered in bumps and scratches).

It feels like constructive activities more frequently fall into the second category than destructive ones (because they usually consume time and raw materials). So I don't think it would be a great world to live in on net, even if it'd have its high points.
