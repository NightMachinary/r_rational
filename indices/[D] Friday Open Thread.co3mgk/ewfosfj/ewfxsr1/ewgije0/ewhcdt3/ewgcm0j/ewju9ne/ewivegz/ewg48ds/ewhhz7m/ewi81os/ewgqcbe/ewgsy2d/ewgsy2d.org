It's pretty bad honestly. I'm not a fan of Shield Hero by any measure, but I can at least acknowledge that some of the earlier parts of the story can be emotionally and narratively compelling to some people.

Arifureta has none of that. I've only read the web novel version, but it's really just a wish fulfillment fantasy through and through, from the characters to the plot events. The inciting incident is uninspired and the main character is a huge edgelord. He has a romantic relationship with a single partner, but as you might expect, the story inevitably devolves into a harem anyway.

There's also pretty much zero rational elements in the story. From what I remember, I got the impression that every aspect of the protagonist came from a teenage fantasy of what a gunslinging, revenge-seeking badass would look like, and the author wrote it as such.

Even if you're a sucker for that sort of wish fulfillment story, Arifureta will probably still be a let down considering it's terrible pacing and crappy characterization of its already shallow characters. It suffers from a problem that all harem light novels suffer from, that female characters are just trophies to collect and become cardboard cutouts of character tropes once they join the protagonist in his meandering quest.
