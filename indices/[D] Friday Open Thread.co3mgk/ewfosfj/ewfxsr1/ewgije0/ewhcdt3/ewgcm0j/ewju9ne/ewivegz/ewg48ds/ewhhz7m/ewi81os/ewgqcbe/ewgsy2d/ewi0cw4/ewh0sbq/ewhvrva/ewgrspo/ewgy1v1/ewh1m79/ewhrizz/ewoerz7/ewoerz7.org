i read the LN but then it got really boring. i was drew in by the grimdark premise. abandoned, betrayed, a weakling forced eat monster meat that would kill if not for the magical mcguffin. after he escaped the labyrinth and went in the roadtrip with the loli vampire and bunny girl it just devolved into a standard isekai.

shield hero is far better since he never really falls (literally and metaphorically) as the mc in arifureta.
