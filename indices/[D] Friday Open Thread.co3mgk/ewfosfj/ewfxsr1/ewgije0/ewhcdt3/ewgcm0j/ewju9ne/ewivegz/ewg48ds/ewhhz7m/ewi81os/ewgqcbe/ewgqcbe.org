Has anyone read the light novel series /Arifureta/, and is it any good? I've heard it recommended as â€˜better Shield Hero', but am doubtful to that proposition. Also, from what I read the main character preempts a harem somewhat by early commiting to a romantic partner (though /of course/ a harem forms of girls who aren't easily dissuaded by such inconvenience).
