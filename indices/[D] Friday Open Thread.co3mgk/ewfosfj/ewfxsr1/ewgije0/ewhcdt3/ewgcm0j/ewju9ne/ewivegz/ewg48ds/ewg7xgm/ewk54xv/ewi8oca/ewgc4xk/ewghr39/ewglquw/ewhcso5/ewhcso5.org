  Having access to the interface should make the character think the opposite, for heaven's sake!

Hmm, where's the save button? Is this a checkpoint game?

I do think a scene where someone asks "should I throw aside my fear of death because I'm in a video game" would be amazing. I wish you luck as an author, and look forward to works which don't have that flaw.

  If the only thing actually presented as changed is the setting, I'm assuming the humans have the same information & abilities I do.

I found that advice in a book review for a book where the moon gets blown up - into a few different (large) pieces, which will eventually collide, and break into smaller pieces, and the really small debris from those collisions will fall to earth, leading to an escalating series of meteor showers that will destroy civilization. The author of the review appreciated they did that up front, because their knowledge of physics said that was wrong, but that's the premise. They enjoyed the rest. (Since the Earth won't be habitable, a moon base is constructed.)
