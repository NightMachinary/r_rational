  There's a bit of writing advice that says - get the big, unbelievable thing out of the way at the beginning of the book, when you're setting the rules, so it's not a deus ex machina/diabolus.

I think I've heard that statement before but if you're writing for me (and probably others on this sub) I think that would be terrible advice. It's at the beginning of a story that I have the least information about the characters and settings so it's the hardest time for me to fanwank/headcannon explanations. Not to mention at the beginning of the story, I'm the least invested (sunk-cost still affects me) and it's where I'm examing everything as closely as I'll ever be to try and glean what I can about this new world I've been thrown into.

It's all about consistency in what requires a suspension of disbelief, I guess. If the only thing actually presented as changed is the setting, I'm assuming the humans have the same information & abilities I do. In my example, to determine how many lives they would have. Or take police dramas on TV -- I can suspend my disbelief about a given case's unusualness but if you're still working inside the framework of the American legal system it's going to throw me out of it when the police search a house without a warrant or the lawyer starts spewing career-ending, disbarment-worthy lies left and right.
