Has anyone managed to turn Twitter into a generally positive experience? I'm finding it hard to disentangle wanting to hear interesting things from interesting people with not wanting to hear endless streams of criticism of other-party people from same-party people. Like, idunno, it would be nice if people split their twitter accounts between a normal account and an optional â€˜$name is angry about the world' account that I could just choose not to touch.
