Went on a binge read and finished Worm this week, and started on Ward. Worm is good and surprisingly consistent. Even the bad chapters are pretty decent. It's got a lot of fat to cut, but I liked it. The author does a great job of creating a realistic setting where humanity really does seem under siege. I do feel like the best ending for Worm is the final pre-Ward chapter.

Ward is not nearly as good. I like the main character a bit better, but it moves really, really slowly. It also has a hard time explaining why so many people are hanging around the city when there's essentially free land if you go west. The heroes kind of feel like bullies in the first arcs anyways; harassing petty criminals just to harass them. Now if they were trying to stop protection money rackets, that's one thing, but really they show up, pick fights and leave.
