I'm thinking it was vote fuzzing. Because now the post is at 100% upvotes, which shouldn't be possible if some had previously downvoted. Or, I suppose people could have changed their votes.

My comment being downvoted... I'm assuming people are just trying to be funny. Like, seriously, guys, why is this comment deserving of two golds?
