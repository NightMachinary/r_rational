I really hate it when authors take the easy way out when setting up a story in giving characters insights or knowledge they shouldn't reasonably have. No, a character that suddenly finds themselves in a video game 'for real' should not just be able to know that they only get one life! If you want the character to act like they only get one shot, fine, but at least couch it as a supposition and not a certainty!

On the other hand, I have to appreciate it when authors do this, so at least I know right away I'm not going to be reading anything approaching rational.
