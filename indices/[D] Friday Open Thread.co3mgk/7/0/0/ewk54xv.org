  There's a bit of writing advice that says - get the big, unbelievable thing out of the way at the beginning of the book, when you're setting the rules, so it's not a deus ex machina/diabolus.

I would phrase that really differently.

  Every reason why your protagonist is the person who will triumph over the antagonist (i.e. why they have the motivation and the means to do so) should be all of one piece, and it should be made known to the audience early.

For instance, in canon Harry Potter, Harry is the chosen one because Voldemort attacked him as an infant and killed his parents, and Harry's a good (if angry) kid. As the discussion with Dumbledore illuminated, there's no way that Harry is /not/ going to try to stop Voldemort, prophecy or no prophecy. And most of the story flows from there.

On the other hand, the events of /Prisoner of Azkaban/ have practically nothing to do with that. The reason why Harry is the protagonist of that book is that Peter Pettigrew decided to go into hiding with the family of the kid destined to be Harry's best mate, and the rat showed up in a picture of Harry's friend in the newspaper. That's an /extraordinarily unlikely/ coincidence (especially when paired with the fact that another Marauder happens to be in the school that year, /and/ this is the year that Hermione gets a cat that can recognize that Scabbers isn't actually a rat), and it detracts from the story.

An example of a story which does this badly is /Iron Man 3/.

The reason why Tony gets involved in the whole Mandarin affair is because: * he shunned a guy at a party in Bern, Switzerland * he solved a biology problem for a girl at that same party * those two met up and decided to try to get Tony help them solve that same problem again for them, and * Tony's chief of security decides to follow the shunned-guy's henchman as he goes to give a potentially-explosive drug to a guy who, it turns out, can't handle that drug without exploding.

Already, we're stretching the boundaries of belief (why did /that/ guy have to be the one to explode, when its a random occurrence?), but, sure.

Now, if this is the introduction to the character, and he uses that as motivation to become a superhero and take the shunned-guy down, that'd be one thing. But: * Your protagonist is also /already/ Tony Stark, a.k.a. Iron Man. * And Tony has been building an excessive number of Iron Man suits, for a completely unrelated reason, which he's going to need later to win. * /And/ shunned-guy just so happens to own the company which did the software upgrade to one of the suits Tony built: a suit which is an essential piece of shunned-guy's plan. * And, for sheer Easter-egg convenience, the party in Switzerland is also the same place where Tony first met the guy who helped and inspired him to become Iron Man in the first movie.

There's no reason why /all/ of the above should be true, when Tony wouldn't even be involved in the main plot of the movie if Happy hadn't been caught in an explosion which the Mandarin had claimed credit for.

Bringing this back to "giving characters insights or knowledge they shouldn't reasonably have"...

If there's no reason why the character should know that they only have one life, but they just "know it," and that intuitive knowledge ends up being why they are able to prevail, where the others all die off because they treat this as a game... I'm cool with that. The reason this guy is the main character, is because the guy who wasn't 100% convinced that he was playing in hardcore mode didn't quite try hard enough to get out of the way of a gun, and died, and who wants to read a story about /that/ guy?

However, if there's something /else/ special about the protagonist, which has nothing to do with the intuitive hardcore-mode knowledge, and is necessary to defeat the antagonist... Yeah, I might have a problem with that.
