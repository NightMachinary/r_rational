There's a bit of writing advice that says - get the big, unbelievable thing out of the way at the beginning of the book, when you're setting the rules, so it's not a deus ex machina/diabolus. This sometimes allows for a fantastical premise, with otherwise reasonable exploration of the implications afterwards.

  No, a character that suddenly finds themselves in a video game 'for real' should not just be able to know that they only get one life!

Yeah, the author should kill people off in order to facilitate this. (I'm not always a fan of that trope, but if it serves an important narrative purpose...)

The inverse would also be interesting - multiple/infinite lives, but people are still instinctively afraid to die, even when there's no consequences.
