I think there's a lot of examples on here that would imply otherwise, in terms of frontloading the most important information about what makes their world different being an effective storytelling technique. Just as an example, WtC smacks you with its isekai and litRPG premise within its first few pages. Is the issue more that the changed rules are presented through assumptions of the character that are then taken for granted as true?
