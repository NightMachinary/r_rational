  No, a character that suddenly finds themselves in a video game 'for real' should not just be able to know that they only get one life!

That's a... really specific thing to be pissed about?

In a similar vein, one movie was bad with this was Edge of Tomorrow, where they set off this big obvious Chekov's gun of "if you get a blood transfusion, you lose the groundhog day magic". Later, the protagonist inevitably gets a blood transfusion and says something in the vein of "I can feel it. My power's gone."

And I'm like... wow, it sure is convenient that whatever magic is at play is giving you a very specific synesthesia that you can immediately identify as "not having the power anymore", and it's really convenient that both you and your predecessor figured it out /before/ shooting yourselves in the head to try and restart your day.
