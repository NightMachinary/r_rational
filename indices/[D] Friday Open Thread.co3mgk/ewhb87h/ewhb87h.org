Someone posted [[https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/37810/is-it-possible-to-get-a-spacecraft-into-earth-orbit-using-linear-eddy-current-br][this]] with respect to an idea I had a while back, and it attracted some good discussion. [[https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Hypervelocity_Landing_Track][Here]] is my older write-up. Unsurprisingly, similar ideas have been had in the past, but it's not well known in any case. Feel free to use in e.g. HSF set 20 minutes in the future if you like the idea. I see it as a good precursor to an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_ring][orbital ring]], as it appears to work with smaller scales while still being bootstrappable.
