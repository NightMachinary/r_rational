I've read some of the first book and as everyone has been saying, it's trash. There is another web serial that takes the initial hook of mediocre magic guy getting trapped in a dungeon and gaining power by eating monsters with a lot more emphasis on the danger and isolation. Unfortunately I lost the link, but it was called something like Taint: black blood chronicles.
