Honestly its one of the very few series that seriously pissed me off.

The central premise that you get in the first volume is simple: 1) The main character is going to be a dark edgy type that is entirely committed to getting revenge against those who wronged him, and 2) No harem.

After volume 1 these are both thrown entirely out the window. He just decides not to get revenge for no reason (like seriously, at the point where he can get revenge trivially he just goes "ehh, no point getting revenge lol"), and then gets a bigass harem.

I don't have a problem with either wishy washy harem main characters or people that don't care about getting revenge, but the way they butchered what little character he had to enable them kind of felt like a betrayal.

Oh, and the series is pretty terrible wish fulfillment stuff with a main character with OP abilities that don't even make sense along with a boatload of other problems, but that's just par for the course and something to be expected.
