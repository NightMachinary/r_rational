I suppose this is the best place to bring this to the mods' attention:

There are a couple of problems with the "Flair and spoilers" box on the right side of New Reddit.

First, it should probably be called "Tags and spoilers," as it doesn't actually mention flairs at all.

Second, "Spoiler tags like this one are written like this." doesn't do a very good job of telling people how to actually insert a spoiler tag within their comments (as opposed to "Spoiler tags like this one are written >!like this.!<").
