Isn't the future me who has the transmitter the only one who can "use" the device?

From my point of view in the present, the messages aren't from the future. It's some kind of prank or psychological experiment. It might be difficult to convincingly fake "messages from the future", but it's a lot more probable than there actually being a way to send them.
