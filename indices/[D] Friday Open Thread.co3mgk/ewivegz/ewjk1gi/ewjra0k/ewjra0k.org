I can imagine the artsy side of twitter being pretty healthy, if only it were for me.

I share your experience of YouTube comments being surprisingly positive. They make for terrible conversation, but by and large over a fairly wide breadth of videos it seems to mostly be made of people saying nice things. I just checked some I'd watched and even the comments of the democratic debates seem to be civil. It's weird.
