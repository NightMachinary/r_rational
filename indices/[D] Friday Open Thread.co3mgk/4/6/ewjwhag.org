My answer would depend on whether I could prove the loop was self-consistent.

If it's self-consistent, what I would do would depend on whether the future was a crapsack one, or an awesome one. If the former, I'd start squirreling aside resources to rebuild from crapsack Earth, since I can't avert crapsack in the first place. If it's an awesome one, I'd try to bring about the awesome future myself.

On the other hand, if it's not self-consistent (e.g. the movie /Frequency/), then I have a difficult choice to make. Is the possibility of making things worse worth the possibility of making things better? Any choice I make could kill my future self, leaving me unable to fix any problems I introduce into the time stream.

In that case, I'd probably strive to avert anything apocalyptic, but, if the world already seems to be on a good path, I'd probably do exactly what future me says I did the last time. No sense in me taking any risks of screwing up the future.
