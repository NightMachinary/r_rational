FYI, what you're describing is just regular commitment, not precommitment. It's something that stands out to me ever since someone pointed out that I was using the word wrong in the same way.

Precommitment is not only committing to an action, but then removing your ability to choose a different action. Fully automated nuclear MAD is precommitment. Locking the steering wheel in a game of chicken is precommitment. Since you haven't actually forced yourself to hire teams of mathematicians, that is not precommitment. In fact, it would be counterproductive to precommit to that since the whole point is that you want to /cancel/ that commitment once the future you pays its dividends back.
