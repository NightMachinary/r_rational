I'm curious to see what people here would use a time travel device for.

Let's say that you have somehow received a device that reads out short messages from the future. So you can't travel through time, just get information from the future sent by a future you.

Obviously people here would start out with the testing and experimentation to see what you can do or throw it away in fear of a "DO NOT MESS WITH TIME."

But you're past all of that initial testing and investigation, and know some of the rules for how it works and that it's safe to use (or at least it /seems/ safe so far).

What would you /use/ it for? Money, women/men, fame, exploration, knowledge, or something else? What would be your long-term goals if you have an actual time travel device?
