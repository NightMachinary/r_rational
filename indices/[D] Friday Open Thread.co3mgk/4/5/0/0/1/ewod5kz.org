Humans not being able to pre-commit, which I agree with, leads to some pretty amusing scenarios.

You're REALLY sure you have a time machine, but because you've never received anything from the future, you can't send anything back. You keep pre-commiting really hard, but it never works.

You turn the machine on, and receive a random ctrtVLaRn of letters. You spend the rest of your life sending nonsense messages into the past, in order to avoid blowing up time.
