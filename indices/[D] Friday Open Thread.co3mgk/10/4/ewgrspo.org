No, it's kind of a generic isekai in my opinion. Shield Hero is also not to my tastes though. Both revolve around the MC being wronged by someone he trusted resulting in indignation.

Personally, I prefer isekai-type stories to revolve around a sense of wonder and exploration of the new fantasy world, and its differences to the "real" world the MC came from. Otherwise, just make a regular fantasy novel.
