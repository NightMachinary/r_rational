This week I recommend [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4597194/][The Genius]], which is a Korean reality TV show, where contestants compete in various games for a cash prize. It's like survivor with far more complicated games and without the sweat. Or like the manga [[https://myanimelist.net/manga/1649/Liar_Game][Liar Game]] in real life. There is always a sure way to win, lots of twists, betrayals and fun. It's also masterfully edited with a familiar soundtrack and a wonderful cast.

This review makes the show more justice than my description: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lng4dn1uAc][The Incredible Storytelling Of South Korean Reality TV]].

You can watch the [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKKdWt1N95s9lCdIWIwECvLzYzc_urIq5][first season on youtube]] with amazing subtitles.
