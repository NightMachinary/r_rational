Here's another thing to make it worse:

Human empires routinely extirpated history. The Qin Dynasty "burned the books and buried the scholars". The Spanish Catholic colonists burned whatever Mayan codices they could get their hands on. The Nazis and the Communists burned books, killed scholars, and published falsified histories. The classical world had the sentence of oblivion, in which those in power could order a person wiped from history and ban all mention of their name.

The further back into history we look, the more likely it is that some king or bishop or commissar has interfered --- /for the exact purpose of preventing us from learning something./
