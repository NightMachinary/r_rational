A bit off topic because it doesn't change your point at all, but could you point me towards a discussion of the ancient flood/younger dryas relationship? It sounds really cool to me, so I did a quick google of the subject. It looks like the most likely source of the flooding that kicked off the cold period is a North American ice sheet, and the likely drainage route doesn't square with how widespread the ancient flood myth is, just to my current understanding. Would love to know more!
