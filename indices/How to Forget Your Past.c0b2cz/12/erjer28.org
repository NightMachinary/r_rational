Once I read that it takes 7 years for a society to forget major events despite records of any kind. The mob rules and the mob doesn't care for what the few remembers.

If something big enough happens, we will be forgotten in less than 10 years. How many people do you know that know how to play music? How many people do know how to read music? How many people do know how to build a musical instrument? How many people do know how to procure and work the materials for said musical instrument? Now let's translate it to every field of knowledge.

Minerals might prevail, rocks, crystal, etc but as soon as power goes off, fire, moisture, acidity will destroy papers. Our beloved clouds, hard drives, flash drives, sd cards will be some alien collection of plastic and metal.

It's easier to find people who is capable of identifying famous people or brands or cars than finding people who is capable to heal people using plants.

We made our bet and will lose at some point. The peppers, the outdoors people, the survivalist will be the grand fathers of the next cavemen. I wonder how many times we've done this.

The Popol Vuh is an ancient text that talks about the stone men, wood men, mud men, corn men... Maybe they were here before us using similar devices and technology completely different from what we know asking the same questions. I believe that the puppeteers reset all as soon as we become a true menace or as soon as enough people becomes aware.
