I keep circling back to record-keeping, and one thing that occurs to me is that updated and reprinted records would do a damn fine job of avoiding a situation where historical records become unbelievable.

Imagine some future society got their hands on an informational pamphlet describing the Atlanta airport. It'd read "Two hundred airplanes flew through the sky and landed at this airport every day." The future humans might view such a pamphlet the same way we read "Osiris flew through the stars for a thousand years and finally came to rest in Giza." It's the standard ancient aliens Stargate plot. The record is being quite literal, but the cynical modern reader sees it all as a metaphor for something else because they know for a FACT that antigravity wasn't developed until the year 2342. The pamphlet leaves out critical details that the intended audience could be expected to already know.

But if the records were being consistently updated and reprinted, then the editors of each successive edition would get a chance to add in the necessary contextual information as it falls out of public consciousness. A history professor would add a footnote to the reprinted Atlanta pamphlet describing what the hell an airplane is and how it worked for an audience that might not have them around anymore.

Obviously, this assumes a future society that moved on to bigger and better things instead of being reset. I'm not sure how any of this applies to the rest of the discussion. Just more rambling.
