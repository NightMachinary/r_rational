You would probably have to drop to pre-printing technology levels to actually forget where you came from. After that all you need is a harsh enough environment that owning books becomes a rarity and a few burned libraries later things have become lost enough for new authors to get away with embellishing or making up the missing details. Then science disproves the made up elements and the whole history becomes discredited myth, easily out-competed by religions with higher meme spread rate.

But for the printing press to become a lost technology you would probably need a societal collapse so devastating that worldwide for at least 4 generations people can only survive in the form of nomadic tribes.

If there's anything like a village with stone houses and a consistent population of >100 I would expect at least someone to start printing stuff.
