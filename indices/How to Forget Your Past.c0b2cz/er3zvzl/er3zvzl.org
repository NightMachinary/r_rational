Collapse of an advanced information system probably does a pretty good job of it. After books and similar physical records are phased out in favour of purely electronic information systems, practical knowledge of printing techniques will mostly disappear in a generation, depriving society of a valuable tool for maintaining its knowledge after a serious setback.

This might happen immediately and deliberately in the course of planning an interstellar colony expedition; mass is valuable aboard a starship, so why bring physical books when you can bring that knowledge in electronic form? Then the starship lands at its destination and promptly breaks down, and the knowledge base of the children of spacefarers is reset to oral tradition overnight, demonstrating why physical backups to those records would've been handy. Oops.

Some knowledge could still be preserved through oral tradition and hastily-improvised physical records, but with the sudden loss of their advanced technology, the survivors will have more serious problems to worry about than trying to record whatever details they can remember of the many, many things they can no longer do. In time, this fragmented information decays further, and passes into myth and legend, and is eventually considered no more reliable than any just-so story invented by the local wise men.

Additionally, if the planet they're stranded on turns out to be missing key resources in the path to industrialization and space travel, they might be stuck at a low tech level for good... or at least until another space traveller stumbles upon the lost human colony.
