  if you transplanted some random sample of today's first world population into an untamed wilderness, they probably wouldn't be able to maintain much of today's tech level.

That's almost euphemistic. If you did that, you'd get something in between a tribe of stone age hunter-gatherers and a bunch of dead people. We're all dramatically specialised. You'd need an incredible stroke of luck to get the right mix of competences (masons, carpenters, smelters, smiths) to even reach a bronze or iron age tech level.
