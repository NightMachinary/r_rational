I'm not entirely sure, but I'd contend that it would only require that the saved technical knowledge (blueprints, textbooks, wikipedia, etc) to become either inaccessible (EMP wiping out electronic records, which, in an advanced society, may be all the records), or useless (quantum physics isn't very helpful if you're trying to build a working stone-age society). After that, it'd only take time.

At first everyone would obviously know where they came from, but as the generations go by, that knowledge becomes more and more redundant if it has no direct effect on quality of life (if you're not using space-age tech, the fact that you were once a space-faring society starts to seem more like pointless history). In fact, I imagine that this historical fact would seem more outlandish and less trustworthy the more generations have passed, if you don't have tangible proof of your previous tech level.

Eventually, everyone would be so disconnected from this historical fact that it would have the weight of any other myth, and could be superceded by any other myth or religion that has more sway with the people.

Additionally, I feel like the chances of losing all applicable knowledge increase as a society gets more advanced. An advanced society would rely heavily on technology, and most people wouldn't personally know how to build up the infrastructure necessary for that tech level. That's already happening today to a small extent, as if you transplanted some random sample of today's first world population into an untamed wilderness, they probably wouldn't be able to maintain much of today's tech level.

Actually, another important point would have to be population size and diversity of occupation. If you have enough people, it would be easy for a society to dedicate at least one person to finding and recording scientific and technological information from the relevant experts. Each person may only have part of the information in any particular field, but if you can spare anyone from whatever labor is needed to survive, and you have access to enough people that may be experts in something, chances are you can piece back together enough technological knowledge to be useful. If the technology can remain useful, it would be very hard for a society to forget how it got that technology.

I apologize for this ramble, it probably doesn't answer your original question, but your post got me thinking and I felt like throwing this out here.
