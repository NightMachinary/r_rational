I think it's three main phases, assuming a catastrophe or quick decline before a short rise.

1. It becomes religion. These stories our grandparents tell of an age we have forgotten, we trust that it is so, but have you ever really seen a rotary phone, or a document describing one? Even the most ardent believers take it on faith rather than evidence.
2. Religion is phased out. As society modernizes again we leave behind silly beliefs, for what we can base in evidence. Are those historical documents or religious texts? What does it matter what a priest of the religion clarified in a foot note.
3. For true forgetting, the specific religion has to die out too. No more believers, no more churches, just some religious scholars who do their best to work backwards from 700 year old religious texts (see: Norse Mythology).

I think in the history of the world we can look to see how the ancient religions are no longer practiced. Is it really so far fetched to think 2000 years later a person might look at someone claiming that hieroglyphs were a manual for ancient spacecraft as insane?

I think the Foundation series also discusses this. How even a slow collapse of a centralized and specialized system can leave behind problems. If no physicists nor nuclear engineers lived on your planet nor university could you figure out how to fix a nuclear reactor (even assuming Wikipedia: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CANDU_reactor][Here figure this out]]) in time to prevent the collapse of the power grid and the information it gives you?
