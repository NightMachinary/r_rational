An EMP or anything like that would completely blast away a lot of information. Lack of time, manpower, and resources might hamper written records. And written records can also be destroyed by harsh enough conditions. There's a lot of practical know-how that is going to simply disappear if enough people die before they get a chance to teach their skills to others.

That said, I think /completely forgetting/ something like that might be really hard. But forgetting all the useful bits? Much more feasible. You'd probably just get with leftover myths and wildly misrepresented stories. In fact, let's consider this from another point of view - is there something we've forgotten in our past? Not advanced technologies, but specific events. We have lots of myths about a flood, for example, in many cultures. Of course a world-spanning flood is nonsense, but could it be the leftover of some far reaching memory of, say, a major tsunami caused by an impact, or a time of rise in sea levels at the end of an ice age? I think the possibility is there, but the tale is now mangled beyond recognition, and we can't just tell fact from fiction any more.
