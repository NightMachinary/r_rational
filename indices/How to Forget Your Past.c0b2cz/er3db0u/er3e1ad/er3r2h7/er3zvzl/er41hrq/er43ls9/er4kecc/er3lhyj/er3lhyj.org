If a civilization has no way of recording their past it may be all too easy to become skeptical of it. Even writing isn't necessarily going to sway everyone. Just think about how many old creation stories we have nowadays. I don't think it would be that unlikely for a civilization to end up viewing their past in much the same way, or the truth gets muddled with lies as everyone tells a different version from generation to generation
