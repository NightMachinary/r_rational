The model of the brain as hardware that runs on culture - software - can help us understand how we forget. If we can't upkeep the culture (not just social behaviour and norms, but also art, rituals, technology etc.) the next generation has a downgraded "operational system". It's a slippery slope.

If the means of preserving knowledge are fragile and centralized, they have a smaller chance of survival. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero_of_Alexandria][Heron]] invented a steam engine almost two millennia before the Industrial Revolution! But the burning of the Library of Alexandria contributed to the technology being forgotten. We could have steam-powered chariots instead we got all this papyrus that burns.

As if exposing books to fire was not enough, knowledge has to survive the burning of scholars (shout out to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burning_of_books_and_burying_of_scholars][emperor Qin Shi Huang]]). And so we enter the area of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_memory][politics of memory]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_laws][memory laws]]. State approved narratives survive while the truth suffers. Excluding people from official accounts is an old practice ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damnatio_memoriae][damnatio memoriae]]).

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_amnesia][Collective forgetting]] is also a possibility:

#+begin_quote
  *Social amnesia* can be a result of "forcible repression" of memories, ignorance, changing circumstances, or the forgetting that comes from changing interests. Protest, folklore, "local memory", and collective nostalgia are counter forces that combat social amnesia.

We have to bear in mind that "[[https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9280.2009.02343.x][*conversations can alter memories* of speakers and listeners in similar ways, even when the *memories differ*]]". Just "[[https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.01967.x][*listening* to a speaker remember selectively *can induce forgetting* of related information in the listener]]".

Moreover, belonging to the same social group favours similar patterns of selective forgetting, so that "[[https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fxge0000077][basic mnemonic mechanisms seem to be adapted to promote the emergence of shared mnemonic representations that *preserve group membership and group identity*]]".
