There is a third method, which requires as follows (I initially came up with this to justify Medieval Stasis in fantasy worlds):

The tech/magic has these properties

- Use requires very little or no infrastructure (a single being or a very small group can maintain everything on their own, new materials are either not required, or are so few they can be easily gathered and stored by a single person).
- Use requires a significant investment of time to learn, or use requires large time investment.
- R&D is impossible, thought to be impossible, or is [almost] entirely theory-based.

​

This leads to the following effects

- There is little to no gain from disseminating knowledge or ability to use the tech (one does not need an army of educated people to maintain one's high standard of living).

  - Thus, spreading said knowledge and ability only creates potential threats

- Thus, the only ones that one has an incentive to teach are those one really cares about - one's family and friends (freely chosen apprentices fall into the latter category).
- Thus, if single practitioner dies before passing on everything they know, that knowledge is lost. If their library is damaged or destroyed, that knowledge is lost.

​

This could happen with sufficiently advanced technology - for example when the only people who really understand it are the ones who are just really interested in it.
