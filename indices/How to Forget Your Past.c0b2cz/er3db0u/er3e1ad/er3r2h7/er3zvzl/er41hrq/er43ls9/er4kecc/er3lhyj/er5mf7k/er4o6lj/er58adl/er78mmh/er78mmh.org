types of data storage.

oral history is the oldest and most basic. its what was before, and we really have lost a lot of the skills for this in modern times.

written history is a bit better, but languages change over time. look at older english writing, even shakespeare. lots of confusing language there, but the modern translations are horribly bad.

then we get digital media. you need both power and a working device to view it, and EMP will destroy it. but its very dense, and you can store so much more information in a smaller space, share it easily, and copy it as much as you want.

if your space-faring civilization just lost all of its digital storage, and a large percentage of the population just died in the following riots and famine... then the survivors are the ones who knew how to get food, and fight to survive. how much do those people remember of your civilization, and how much do they want to forget?

sure, a trove of hardcopy books is priceless... but if its a cold enough winter, not freezing to death is more important. and paper will eventually rot away, if not cared for properly.

and i would add in one more factor, politics. if you want to be a dictator and control a population, then you dont want them to have easy access to information about other forms of government. why, they minght question your divine right to rule and rebell! so a group (maybe a church) acts to destroy any records that contradict their power and authority.

without a cataclysm, it could just be a regime change. or a new religion. a people who reject the old ways completely, and let it all be forgotten. even if its double-plus un-good.
