Many civilizations and cultures used to have an extensive oral tradition of transmitting their own foundational myths and history. Some argue the Ancient Flood myth present in every culture of the world in some form is related to the Younger Dryas extinction event, so it would have been transmitted without any tangible record over millenias, without fail.

Unless you mean to have people move to an entirely new location (off Earth) and then been explicitly told lies, I don't see any such "forgetting" happening realistically. There's a funny (and IMO realistic) version of this in Jack Vance's book "the blue world", where the people of the liquid world are all descendants of convicts from a crashed prison spaceship.

Now, if you mean losing some technology, well we only recently figured out how the Ancient Romans used to make nigh-eternal concrete. We're not quite sure of how the Mongolian raiders used to craft their composite bows. And we're still left with guesses as to how exactly the Ancient Egyptians were lifting all those blocks making up the great pyramids (I like [[http://emhotep.net/from-quarry-to-capstone-transporting-the-blocks-and-megaliths-of-the-great-pyramid-3/][this theory]] best), and figuring out their hieroglyphs was a stroke of luck mostly.

It only takes a few years of bad crop failures toppling an Empire or an invasion to replace the language or crafting culture (like with the Roman amphors replacing Celtic barrels).
