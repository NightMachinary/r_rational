Just recently reread The Mote in God's Eye (also Niven I think). That has a very interesting dichotomy; the spacefaring humans in story had the CoDominium (implied to be the USSR and USA), which had a vague but horrible civil war, essentially destroying Earth's habitable surface, and was replaced by the First Empire, which collapsed for vague reasons and was replaced by the Second Empire. Then there are aliens called Moties, which are unable to travel interstellar distances because of a quirk of their star system and undergo regular and total societal collapse. HOWEVER, they build museums that contain all sorts of old science, to help rebuild after another total collapse. It's basically assumed in-story that any sufficiently old civilization will collapse or expand, rather than assuming that any given culture will win out and preserve the history a la Byzantium after Rome.

I feel that the population argument isn't really tenable; you'd expect AT LEAST one sufficiently sophisticated group to survive and then dominate the survivors if there was really so much lost that the rest of the society is essentially gone.

I'm more inclined to believe that any community with inadequate long-term storage, like a jungle world (so any long-term paper storage isn't feasible). Spoken word isn't really sufficient for transmitting any modern tech, so I think any time a culture is incapable (or unwilling) to make written records, the tech will probably die out within a generation or two. Once the tech is gone, it'll only take a few generations before it's legend - just think of how many modern people find it hard to believe what medical science was like just a hundred years ago! Eventually people will doubt that they 'really' came from space, since there's no evidence. Where are the ships? Why can't we fly now?
