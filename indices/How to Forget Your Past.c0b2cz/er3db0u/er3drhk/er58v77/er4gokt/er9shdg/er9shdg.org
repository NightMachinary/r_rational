I think it wouldn't take so long to find a way to collect and form metal that it would prevent rudimentary generators. At that point we can generate heat (and light, depending on the metal) which would be useful for cooking. Similarly easy is storing that power. Citrus juice or salty ocean spray and ore will do the job. Not necessarily as well as lead and a stronger acid, and probably involves a lot of waste, but it'll do the job long enough to find a better technology.

Every field has similarly low effort ways to get the job done, so getting back to a level where you can have the luxury of r&d shouldn't be a problem with a few nerds around.

Maybe the technology will take different forms and directions as a different set of synergies are found and built but just memories of what is possible or plausible are going to be enough to keep humanity out of the stone age 2.0.

Similarly someone who has a small amount of grounding in history and anthropology or in library science can ensure the most important knowledge doesn't get lost, or gets rediscovered, whatever they decide that is.
