I like that list, but I think it can be generalized a bit more. I would rephrase it in terms of:

1. Direct evidence exists. At this point, it takes activate information suppression by an organized force to keep knowledge from spreading, and will likely be imperfect even in ideal conditions. (Ex: North Koreans' idea of what other countries are like")

2. Primary sources exist. The immediate event is over, but evidence of existence continues in the form of testimonials, accounts, pictures and video, etc. At this point, depending on extensiveness of documentation, misinformation can easily begin. Outright denial is possible, but unlikely without extensive measures by a central force. (Ex: China's position on the Tiananmen Square protests)

3. Secondary sources exist. At this point, no living persons directly involved with the event are around. Records only exist through data, more easily manipulated or deleted. It becomes necessary to collate different sources to obtain a comprehensive picture of the event, and distortions of the truth more regularly occur. (Ex: Debates over the 19th century genocide in Australia)

And from then on, corruption and loss of secondary sources causes history to slowly turn to legend, and legend to religion, at which point your phases come into play.
