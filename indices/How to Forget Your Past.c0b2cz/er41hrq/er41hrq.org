Something to keep in mind is how long physical remnants of human activities stick around, whether it needs to be dug up or not. (It's easy for a US person to think of history as something that needs to be dug up, but in most (or close to it) places on Earth people live within a short trip of structures many hundreds or a thousand years old.

Many materials certainly can't survive such a time intact, unless cared for incredibly well, and maybe that's even more the case on whatever planet these humans are trapped on, but at least on Earth things that don't oxidize will keep a super long time (glass and ceramics in particular).

The Uplift universe from David Brin is the sort of culture that could get around this though. Galactic society is in general very conservationist, much of the rules of the different alien races are based around making sure nothing messes with the ability for new Uplift-worthy candidates to develop. One of the rules is that (aside from a species home planet) worlds are typically "leased" not owned. Even if that lease period is in the hundreds of thousands of years.

What this means is that permanent structures are usually built along subduction zones so that after the time expires and the species moves on, all traces will be gone within a couple million years. Practices like that would help give a reason for the fictional universes archaelogists to be so much more inept than real ones.
