I'd argue this is the current and natural state of things. There was a brief window of time where a polymath could reasonably have some knowledge of that era's technology (ie "A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court").

Now we interact with nanoscale engineering and global networks on a daily basis but only know how to power cycle a router, and society still functions.

I'm a computer engineer and have the knowledge and experience necessary to assemble a computer and OS from passives and semiconductors, given a working supply chain for those components, but I feel pretty pessimistic about my ability to uplift a society if transported to the dark ages.
