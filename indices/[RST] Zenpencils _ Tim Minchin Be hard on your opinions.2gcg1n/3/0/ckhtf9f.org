Zenpencils irritates me. It is the same sort of pseudo-zen dogma that has been around since the 1970s, just dressed up as "rationality" instead of "spiritualism". It has almost nothing in common with rationality.

The comic posted boils down to "Change your beliefs, and give to the poor." It doesn't make a case as to "why" we should change our beliefs, just that we should do so.

Similarly, the comic about "we're lucky to be dying" is also entirely lacking of a rational argument. Why should we be happy that we have the ability to die? Why does the fact that others have never had a chance to live make it more exceptional that we did? And further, why should we not seek immortality?

This is a quote made by Dawkins in 1999, when human immortality was a pipe dream. Not in 2014, when there are treatments in testing today that extend human telomeres, and current methods that allow for direct human-computer brain interfaces.
