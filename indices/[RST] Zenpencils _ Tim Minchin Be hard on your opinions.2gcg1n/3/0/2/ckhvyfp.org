  Similarly, the comic about "we're lucky to be dying" is also entirely lacking of a rational argument.

It /doesn't/ say that we are lucky to be dying. There clearly is an argument: It's good to be alive; most potential humans will not have lived, ever; therefore, we are lucky. Anyway, the point is not to convince you of some position, it's simply to make you feel grateful, which is good for mental wellbeing, as opposed to be despairing about the prospect of death (which, even if not inevitable, as you say, is still quite likely).

Though I, too, have a distaste for Zenpencils. Maybe it reminds me too much of Chick tracs? Maybe I dislike it for the same reason that I often dislike [[http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Absurdity_heuristic][ridicule]]. Being able to formulate something so that it sounds ridicules doesn't track truth very well and neither does being able to formulate something in an "inspiring" way. And the comics, more than the saying that go with them, are a form of [[http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Generalization_from_fictional_evidence][fictional evidence]].

Though I do not advocate that we all should sound like the most boring kind of philosopher, either.
