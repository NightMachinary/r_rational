To the first point, I disagree. That famous quotations drawn from all over are not explicitly rational doesn't make it anti-rationalist.

The comic text is two sentences long! Of course it doesn't make an argument, that's barely enough space for an assertion! The interaction of the quote with the comic is always complicated, but it's usually telling a related story - I actually agree that this part of it is too unsubtle to be a good choice, but the opinion-surgery made me smile.

"lucky to be dying" is obviously ridiculous - but the /point/ is that that is still an enormous privilege within the mind-boggling large space of all possible people, most of whom never live at all. Living is good. More is better. /We are in the immeasurably tiny fraction of people who ever live at all/.

And immortality (or 'indefinite optional life extension')? What better way to spend a life than living well, and increasing our and everyone's capacity to live well?

^{I think we mostly agree on the substantive stuff, but differ in taste and approach to this kind of thing}
