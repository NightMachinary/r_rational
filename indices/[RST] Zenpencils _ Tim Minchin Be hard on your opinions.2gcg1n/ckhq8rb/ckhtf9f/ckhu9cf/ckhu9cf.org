Hey now, it never said we shouldn't aspire for transhumanism. In the essence of it, all it did was celebrate how incredible it is that right now we are here, by mere chance. The sheer odds of the perfect conditions needed for life developing in the universe. Like Carl Sagan had said there's an unbroken thread that stretches from those first cells to us.

Zenpencils illustrates a wide variety of inspirational sayings from notable people -- some from reader requests I think. Some might not, but there are a lot them that I think would appeal to folks in this sub. It definitely belongs here.

*Edit:* I just opened the first comic. Yeah, zenpencils maybe could have used a better way to illustrate this. The quote though is more of a reminder that we should be faithless to our beliefs, constantly adapting with evidence. And it talked in passing saying because our biases can cloud our judgment. I'd have liked it to expand more on it though. But then, it's just a quote. Reminded me of [[http://yudkowsky.net/rational/virtues/][Yudkowsky's thoughts on rationality]], the third para.
