  This is a quote made by Dawkins in 1999, when human immortality was a pipe dream.

That was literally only 15 years ago. Anything that was a "pipe dream" then still is today, and anything we note today is not a pipe dream /was not a pipe dream then/, we were just ignorant of how to accomplish it.

When are people going to learn that we kick logic out and go beyond the impossible?
