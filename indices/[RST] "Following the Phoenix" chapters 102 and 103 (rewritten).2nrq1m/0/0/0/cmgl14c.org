Dementors/Patronus, though the instant communication is useful, it's actually objectively worse then muggle communication because of the limits on transmitters. Partial transfiguration is at best a 'personal scale' power, without any current uses on the larger scales. None of his other tricks would work on competent mages (which seems to be, at the least, what he has to compete with now for effectiveness).

I think the main problem is that the conflict levelled up, but Harry hasn't (yet) - his powers are still 'strong' in the context of schoolyard fights, not world wars.
