Which ones are you thinking of? Partial transfiguration is still useful. Destroying / controlling dementors is becoming less useful by the moment. His various tech tricks (batteries for breaking shield walls, armor for blocking stunners, skateboards, etc) are still useful although less so against adult wizards with real power and Apparate ability.

(Not being snarky here; honest question.)
