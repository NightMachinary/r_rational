It would be too much to paste everything here, but over [[https://specevo.jcink.net/index.php?showtopic=1552&st=0&#entry19159][here]] I'm working on the worldbuilding for the sequel for [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41427865-junction][Junction]], a science fiction book published last year about a planet whose surface is linked to hundreds of thousands of other habitable planets by means of a grid of "wormholes," including Earth. The sequel will hopefully iron out some of the problems in this scheme...

So if you have questions or suggestions for me, I'd love to hear them. Those wormholes are hard to think about.
