I like it. I'm imagining something like:

"They call us engineers. Not demolitions engineers, electrical engineers, mechanical engineers or any sort of specific title. No, according to the brass in Spectre, we are simply 'engineers'. Of what? It doesn't matter. The important part for them is that we're all people capable of passing through engineering school, which means we all excel at analytical reasoning and creative problem solving, at least compared to your typical Systems Alliance marine. And that's why they order 'engineers' into combat."
