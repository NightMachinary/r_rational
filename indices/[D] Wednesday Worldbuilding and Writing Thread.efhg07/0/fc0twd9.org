I am going to take an opportunity to talk about a story I have planned.

It's a Mass Effect fanfic that might end up being a full-fledged rational fic. The basic idea is to make fun of how the game allows you to pick "Engineer" as your class, but then has you solve all your problems by shooting things anyway. I intend to make the main character into an actual engineer, who is expected to fight all kinds of alien monstrocities even though that's not at all what he is trained to do. The effect is a smartass, resourceful, kind of cowardly doctor of engineering trying to talk and puzzle his way out of the situations he is thrown into. As the story goes on, the characters are revealed to differ from their canon counterparts as well and the plot starts to be less like a heroic space opera and more like a... "HPMOR on drugs" seems like a good term if I get my way. I have only half a chapter written and only a few things planned, so I'm not sure if it ends up going anyway.
