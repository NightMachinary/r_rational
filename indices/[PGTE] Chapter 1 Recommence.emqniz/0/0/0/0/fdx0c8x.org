Eh. Never retreating isn't really a point in the undead's favor.

During early WWII, the Soviets biggest disadvantage was Stalin's insistence that troops defend their positions to the last man. It means any defeat automatically turned into a massacre, even when the Soviets could have fallen back to stronger positions.

See also this fight, where the Binds sent their small army straight into a meat-grinder, even though they could have gone further with guerilla tactics and forcing the Army of Callow to pursue them.
