The army of the dead is a pretty difficult tactical problem to solve.

Line warfare against people is usually about logistics and morale, as I understand it. So, like, making it hard for your enemy to feed their soldiers, tiring out their soldiers via marching. & fortifications, and then convincing the soldiers to break formation and run away.

None of that applies to the dead. The dead have greater endurance AND numerical superiority. Barring narrative mojo, every zombie eventually has to be stabbed by a living soldier.

The fact that the dead have parity or superiority in artillery, air support, and special forces makes this a real uphill battle for the living.
