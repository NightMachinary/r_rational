The front page of this subreddit has posts from 11 days ago. That's significantly more than a week for a single page. In Reddit terms, that's practically dead.

If anything, this subreddit is /desperately short of content/. It baffles me that anyone would discourage someone from posting anything even remotely relevant.

If we ever get to the stage that good content is getting pushed off the front page before people get a chance to see it, you might have a point. But that's ludicrously far from where we are.
