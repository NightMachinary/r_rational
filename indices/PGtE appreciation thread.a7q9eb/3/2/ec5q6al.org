I like it for the worldbuilding, mostly. Also, the protagonist going from fuck-up to fuck-up yet getting the better deal at the end is like watching a 30 car pileup with miraculously no injuries. The banter is also pretty funny sometimes, reminds me of Hollywood action flicks.

The epigraphs are hit or miss, but there's some gems in there.
