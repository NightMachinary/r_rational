I started twice, and stopped, and the third time was the charm for me. Early on, it seemed too, I dunno...generic. It took a bit to grow an attachment to the characters involved, and for it to feel archetypal, rather than generic. Once I got past that, I was hooked.

I think it's common for authors to improve as they continue writing, so you end up with a fair number that have a rough patch at the start. The quotes don't stop, mind you, so if they're a real mood killer for you, that might not help...but over time, the story does become more fulfilling.
