I thought 2 was really good, definitely better than 1. 1 seemed like it ticked a bunch of YA boxes just to tick them. On the other hand I also burned out about halfway through 3 and lost all motivation; I thought there was a pretty clear decline in EE's writing when they were forced to move to triweekly updates. I caught myself skimming through chapters paragraphs at a time enough that I just asked myself, "why am I reading this at all?"

If you are slogging through book 1 I'd say try to give it a finish. It ends on a high note as far as I can remember. However, if you don't even like the funny little epigraphs then it probably just isn't for you. They're the essence of the story in a microcosm.
