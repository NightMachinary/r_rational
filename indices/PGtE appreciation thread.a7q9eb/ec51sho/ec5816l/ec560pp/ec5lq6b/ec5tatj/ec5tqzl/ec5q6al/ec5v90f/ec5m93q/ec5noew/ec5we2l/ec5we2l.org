Didn't hate the wargame, but didn't love her reaction when she experiences some of the fallout of her (quite cold) decision to let the lone swordsman go. It's a bit raw at that point, but in retrospect, reading more, she's a bit more tolerable after she settles into her pattern of making dubious compromises for the greater good. She is, after all, a villain...she just needs a little more time to ungrow.

In short, I dropped the fic around where you're reading, but apparently for other reasons, but now find it quite palatable, especially as the story expands, the stable of (unstable) characters develops, and Foundling settles into her persona a little more. If, after great characters like Apprentice and Archer are introduced, you still find it's not for you, then so be it.
