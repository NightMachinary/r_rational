I think other have provided good answers, but as for a motivational kick, the best characters in the story arrive in Book 2. We start character arcs of many side characters in Book 2. And the top notch banter gets better in each book. Book one is setup for characters and plot, and only really pays off in (short term) plot.

If you liked the scene where Cat meets Heiress, there are lots more political intrigue scenes to enjoy. If you liked the scene where Robber names things, there's LOTS more of that to enjoy.

If you think you can learn to love the practical pettiness that is Cat, you can learn to love the story.
