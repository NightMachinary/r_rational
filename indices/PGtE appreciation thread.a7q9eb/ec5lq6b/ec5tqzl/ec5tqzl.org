Copying from another comment:

Book 1 is definitely the weakest entry in my opinion. The stakes basically go down after the Summerholm thing transitions to the war college. Book 2 is significantly better, [totally free of wargames for example] so I'd recommend at least that much, although if you don't like it either that's probably a good time to quit, since 3 and what we have of 4 are comparable to that.

Basically the end of Book 1 is probably the weakest stretch of the whole thing, so if you liked the beginning I do think you'll enjoy where it starts to pick up, in Book 2.
