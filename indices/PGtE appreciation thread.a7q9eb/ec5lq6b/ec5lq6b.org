Could anyone give me a motivational kick to finish Book 1?

I liked the start and Catherine's introduction (can-do orphans who find their own agency in the world is a recipe for success), but the petty Squire spats and tacky Dread sovereign quotes starting every chapter really grinded my interest down before the nail in the coffin, Catherine's stilted entry into her company and war game. Bookmarked ever since and collecting dust, but PGTE is pretty popular here so maybe someone can extol its forthcoming virtues if I just soldier on?
