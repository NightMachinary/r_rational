It's brutal, man! Yet so far, this has been the absolute largest success of any of my serials and virtually no single reader has done anything but treat the schedule with glee and praise. While I completely agree that going slower would improve quality and there have been a few times that it killed me to go on when I really wanted to do a big edit (like split a chapter in two) I got over it. The crowd has spoken, and the crowd says quantity > quality.

That said, I like to think I'm a pretty decent and entertaining/meaningful writer, even at these speeds, so I would encourage you to give it a chance. I might add that if you're looking more for proper literary art than entertainment (I try my best... but /honestly/) you should probably not be reading web serials. Funny enough, I don't! :P

Thanks for your response. Good to know some people exist who value a more deliberate pace. As it stands, I'm just trying out a different tactic to writing. I've done weekly updates and I've done biweekly. Been at this a long time. See my RRL profile for more fiction!

Thanks!
