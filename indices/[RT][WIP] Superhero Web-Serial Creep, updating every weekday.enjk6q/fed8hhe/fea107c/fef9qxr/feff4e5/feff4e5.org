That must be wildbow's handle on here. I have to say, it's hard for me to judge. I think Twig probably did it more, also had a lot more time to do it. Was it /worse?/ Probably. For me personally, the body-horror has not felt as scary /as I would like to end up being/ if that makes sense. And that is about as bad as Twig's, with the occasional 'ew I hate parasites/that mental image' moment.
