I think the big advantage of a harsh schedule like that is that it pushes writers to just write and publish without looking back, and the biggest way to improve is to actually write a lot. Of course if the outline of the plot and basics of the world aren't planned it will end up being kinda incoherent in the large scale, but often times the specific scenes, plot points and even characters tend to change as you write anyway.
