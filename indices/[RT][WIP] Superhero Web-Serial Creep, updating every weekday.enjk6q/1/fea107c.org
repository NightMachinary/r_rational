Nice. Keep going. I read the first couple then skipped to the most recent (the level of grim isn't for me at this time) but I like the world-building in that latest chapter, and the something-to-look-forward-to. I'd like to see perspective chapters from people with wildly different characters and mindsets than Walter.
