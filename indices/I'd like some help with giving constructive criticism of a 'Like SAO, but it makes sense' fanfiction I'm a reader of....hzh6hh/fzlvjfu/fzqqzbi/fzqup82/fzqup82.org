Hmm yeah.... a microwave, I suppose. But it has to be a battery-run, microwave which is not trivial, I think. Also it has to be a Faraday cage good enough to withstand whatever EMP-device you could use against it and still have enough charge to microwave the hostage's brain. Also while the outer layer of the headset is sprayed with liquid helium. [and whatever other attack one could run, I haven't thought of] I don't think that this is plausible, but then I'm not really an electrical engineer.
