Not really biased by that I think. I was just wondering what an electronic trap helmet could do and what to do about it.\\
Japan already has a massive logistical problem, namely keeping those 6k vegetables fed, washed and their muscles from wasting away.\\
This is a large scale terrorist attack on the level of (and in the worst case far exceeding) 9/11, the national and international response would be extreme.\\
There's no rock Kayaba could realistically hide under, or a country that would allow him to defect. [noone likes to be bombed and China or Russia still have reputation to loose]\\
Everyone would fly in/volunteer personell and specialists from all over the world for that, to keep those people alive for as long as possible. Mostly those are young people so they'll last a while, but in the end, there's going to be attrition of people slowly dying, anyway. [or a MRSA outbreak just killing everybody, if they're sloppy/unlucky]\\
But once someone dies ingame, they die in real life, so you can harvest dozens off the Nerve Gear helmets without any additional risk.\\
You can even rebuild them, disassemble them, test all kinds of attack vectors in a large Faraday cage on the corpses for safety and speed.

I just can't imagine that future tech created by a lone mad genius could resist all the future tech funded with hundreds of billions of dollars, the power of nation states and every technically minded person on Earth having thought about it for a couple of minutes at least once.
