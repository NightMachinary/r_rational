Basically, it's a sort of collaborative writing thing based partially off of tabletop role-playing games, and partially off of old text-based adventure games.

The QM (quest master) makes a post on a forum or whatever, detailing a scenario. For example:

#+begin_quote
  You awaken in a jail cell. You are on a bed. You don't know why you are here. What do you do?
#+end_quote

The players then respond with commands, like:

#+begin_quote
  Try to break through the wall!

  Do we have a cellmate? Try and talk to them, if so.

  Examine the cell, looking for anything we can use.
#+end_quote

The QM then picks whatever was most voted for/whatever they like the most/whatever meets their criteria, and then writes the next post using it/them.

#+begin_quote
  You try and strike up a conversation with your cellmate. He says to leave him alone. However, after you spend the next few minutes checking every nook and cranny of the cell for useful items, he seems to be curious enough to talk to you. "What are you doing?" he asks. How do you respond?
#+end_quote

And then this goes back and forth over and over until the quest ends, be it because the players won, lost, or the QM got bored.

A few I would recommend if you want to try reading one:

And many, many more. But these are probably some of the best/most popular.
