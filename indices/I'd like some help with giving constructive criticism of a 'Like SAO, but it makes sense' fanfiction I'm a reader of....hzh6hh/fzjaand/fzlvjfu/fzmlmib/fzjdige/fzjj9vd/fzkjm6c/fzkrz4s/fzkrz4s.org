Well, it's a story-game-quest thing that has participants... So there's that.

Also, like I said before, I'm looking for help getting across my opinions/arguments that players murdering other players and forgetting there is an outside world and becoming despairing layabouts and similar things is an unrealistic theme, not how humans react to stressful external threats to life and limb, and not a good way to ramp up tension, and wouldn't be fun to read about. Can I have help with that?
