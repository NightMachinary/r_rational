Just a direct benefit would people who see your criticism and then change because of that, author or not, will then produce more content you want. That's the intended benefit

I think more people criticise for the emotional catharsis

Then for some authors any communication is good communication

Also surely such logic applies to your comment too and mine and all of us here
