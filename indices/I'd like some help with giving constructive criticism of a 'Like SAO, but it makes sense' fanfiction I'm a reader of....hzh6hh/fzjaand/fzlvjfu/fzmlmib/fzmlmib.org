I've read a lot of stuff on SV, including the quest you're talking about. I assume that you, like me, have the same username here and there.

I haven't read all the discussion pages referenced, but I did skim a few. I think I got the gist of it though.

Essentially, you see the opportunity to make an early intervention and set up a long term plan which will further the goals of the MC and make the quest more enjoyable for you personally.

You are right that you are having trouble communicating. But it seems like part of that at least is not really understanding or at least not addressing the fairly diverse objections you are getting. They include things like:

-There are low hanging fruit that we should get now -All easy options for influencing psychology have already been taken -General distaste because people keep using the word cult -Belief that the guild is a better option than starting something new. -Belief that the existing psychological services are better than starting something new.

Your best bet is to come up with specific actions and rituals that the guild can do on its own to reaffirm it's belief in and desire for the outside world. And abandon any hope of getting the rest of the quest interested in turning the game into a paradise post escape. SV doesn't do that sort of long term goal making, they fight enemies, grab shinies, and Make Hard Decisions.

The AI rights situation will start getting actions once the QM writes a scene with a sufficiently sympathetic and in depth NPC. And not before.
