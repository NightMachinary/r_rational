Never made sense to me that the VR gear could kill you, if you tried to remove it.

Like..... short of a small explosive, I wouldn't see how that would work.

And it was disappointing that we never saw people just disconnect/shatter when someone from the outside world called that bluff. Abridged addressed some of that, with the girl having a bad internet connection living in permanent fear of a disconnect.In Abridged this was due "to an unforeseen bug", though. But you can't just cause a mortal fit of epilepsy in just anyone with perfect reliability. (at least, so far noone has managed that, afaik)And since it wasn't intentional, it seems that frying the circuitry with an EMP should do the trick at least in the Abridged-universe.

In SOA they show the next generation being much less bulky. So the whole helmet form factor was apparently just there to trap you?

I just don't see how anyone would fall for that. There must be some of the headsets that were bought, but the buyer didn't have time for the launch date.\\
And for any electronics device you can find a teardown video that would have revealed the explosives.
