  Never made sense to me that the VR gear could kill you, if you tried to remove it.

  Like..... short of a small explosive, I wouldn't see how that would work.

Microwave ovens work by vibrating water molecules to heat things. It seems obvious to me that applying the same principle to water molecules in the brain at a certain intensity would result in catastrophic damage. No explosives needed.

  And it was disappointing that we never saw people just disconnect/shatter when someone from the outside world called that bluff.

That would have only happened in the first few hours before Kayaba's "tutorial" when the knowledge of its lethality wasn't widespread yet. And if anything like that was shown on-screen before the "tutorial", the narrative couldn't have pulled off the twist so nicely.

  In SOA they show the next generation being much less bulky. So the whole helmet form factor was apparently just there to trap you?

  I just don't see how anyone would fall for that.

Since the SAO world version of VR is wireless interception and interface of nerve signals sent from the brain, it wouldn't be out of the question for the helmet form to be thought as a way to secure the interface from being misaligned and/or intercepted. Whether it's true or not, it was pretty new technology, so probably very few people knew for sure. (They do mention in the novels that the NerveGear's successors tend to be less satisfying to the senses, though that might be more due to the signal being weakened for (perception of) safety rather than because of loss of the full-head coverage.)
