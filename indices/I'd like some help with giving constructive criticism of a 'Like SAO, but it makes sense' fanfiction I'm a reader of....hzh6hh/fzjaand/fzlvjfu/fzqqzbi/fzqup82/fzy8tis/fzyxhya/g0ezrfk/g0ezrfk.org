  Japan already has a massive logistical problem, namely keeping those 6k vegetables fed, washed and their muscles from wasting away.

Hospitals are built to take patients, and there were some allowances in the death game (described at least in the novel if not the anime, I'm sure) that made it easier for responders to move patients to hospitals without too much risk of accidental death. I think it's another thing entirely to allocate resources and infrastructure out of thin air for a solution to a one-time problem, and all the more so if they want to avoid getting Kayaba's notice in the process, since it's doubtful he'd look kindly on attempts to subvert his death game.

  There's no rock Kayaba could realistically hide under, or a country that would allow him to defect.

I'm not sure I agree with the first part - though Japan is tiny in land size compared to the US, I'm pretty sure there's still plenty of rural/undeveloped areas that would be hard for the entire police force of Japan to search exhaustively (if they were depending solely on witness sightings and physical searches, at least).

As for the latter part, I disagree with the sentiment by the reasoning that sometimes countries and leadership can be really stupid, or at least, they either don't see or don't care about reputation in quite the same way as other countries or other countries' people do.

I agree with the idea in general, actually. There probably is one or more ways to be found or developed that can defeat the NerveGear's anti-tampering features. Though again, logistics - it would take time to deploy /en masse/, it'd have to be evaluated to see what are the chances of accidental or unforeseen failure, and how that stacks up against the risk to players of simply letting the game be, and it'd have to avoid possibly making Kayaba shift to more active methods of defending his system, which probably means its highest chance of success is if it's applied to every player at once, somehow. The question to ask isn't whether it's possible or not, because it's most likely possible, the problem is whether it's practical or not - specifically, whether the solution can do the job well enough that implementing it is likely to save more lives than allowing the status quo to continue.

(Though, no offense, the suggestions you were giving before definitely seemed like the kind of suggestions you toss out after less than a minute of thought, with disproportionate focus on the failure modes of the NerveGear problem in comparison to the failure modes of the proposed solutions. I thought those suggestions in particular weren't sophisticated enough to be close to a possible solution, which is why I jumped in with my objections.)
