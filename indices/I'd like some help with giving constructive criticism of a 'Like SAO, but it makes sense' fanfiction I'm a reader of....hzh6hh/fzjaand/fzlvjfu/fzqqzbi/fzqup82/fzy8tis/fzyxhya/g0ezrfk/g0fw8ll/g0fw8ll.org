Yeah, that's fair. As a person, I do lack sophisication in those EE areas. Even if I wasn't though, there's little point in being sophisticated about what's basically a black box full of cutting edge future mystery tech. Though I wouldn't believe this to be possible, it's not a bad plot device for the kind of setting the anime wants to establish.

Death Note doesn't suffer from the fact, that no outside power even threatened to nuke or invade the Kanto region or at least cut them off from the internet. I know, I know, more unsophisticated one-minute ideas :) Not everything has to be a global simulation for it to be good. It's okay to just roll with a premise and focus on some implications, ignoring others. I did enjoy SAO (and especially the Abridged, which is head canon).
