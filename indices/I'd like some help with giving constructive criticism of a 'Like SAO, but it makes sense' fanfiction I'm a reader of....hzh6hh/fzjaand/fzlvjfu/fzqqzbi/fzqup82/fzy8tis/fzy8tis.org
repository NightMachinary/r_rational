  But it has to be a battery-run, microwave which is not trivial, I think.

That actually reminds me, I think the novels mentioned that most of the bulk and weight of the NerveGear was from that battery. Though I don't remember exactly where it said that...

I think it's already possible to build a battery-powered microwave oven in this day and age, though (but it's probably still impractical). I think such batteries would be comparable to the batteries used to power an e-bike's motors, which works well enough.

So I took the time to look up what exactly an EMP would do to electric devices on Wikipedia. While the answer doesn't seem clear-cut anywhere, I think the basic gist of it is that an EMP just /damages/ circuitry, not reliably de-powers it. In those incidents I hear of solar-flare-originating EMPs blacking out entire neighbourhoods, I think what actually happens is that the EMP damages circuitry on multiple locations on the grid and the safeties on the grid trip to prevent anything that's wall-outlet powered from being damaged themselves. Assuming that's true, it's actually the safeties that shut down electronics, not the EMP itself. So an EMP that's powerful enough to break through the standard shielding an electric device has for "natural" EMPs like solar flares is just going to end up damaging the device somehow, and then it's probably fifty-fifty on it just shutting it down or making a fire start somewhere in the device (or outright exploding the batteries)...

And even if an EMP reliably shuts down instead of damages a device, there's probably a logistics problem in managing to do so on all 6000+ players at the same time (otherwise the game's creator might start executing players to get the jailbreak attempts to stop), and in moving all the players somewhere where the EMP attack can take place (since using EMPs on the hospitals they're placed in is probably a bad idea...)

Not entirely sure, but I'm assuming this to mean an attempt to freeze the machine and its circuitry? Leaving aside whether you'd really want to use something so damaging and seemingly hard to precisely control nearby a victim's relatively unprotected head, would this really work on the NerveGear quickly enough that it doesn't realize it's being tampered with and flips the kill switch before it loses power?

And, again, logistics.

All this said though, the VR experience in SAO was a speculative science originally written in 2001 (and originally meant to be set in 2012 rather than 2022). Your initial impression on a VR gear's ability to kill someone might've been biased by your prior impressions from the VR gear actually developed in recent years, if I may be so bold to assume.

Also, Catsy's SAO one-shot [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9303028/1/Man-in-the-Middle][Man in the Middle]] precisely about trying to break into SAO for a rescue attempt comes very highly recommended. (And I'm fairly sure Catsy was the first one to point out the logistics problem, if not in some forum tangential to SAO then at least in this fic.)
