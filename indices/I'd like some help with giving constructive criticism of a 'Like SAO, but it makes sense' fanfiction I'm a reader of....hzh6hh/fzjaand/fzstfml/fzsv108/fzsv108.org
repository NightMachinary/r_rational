Source!Kirito never seemed to me to make much sense - he is constantly surprised and unaware of his harem (as is required by the author to prevent any romance from getting anywhere) while still being extremely competent socially, gaining multiple close friends. He's not a misanthrope like 8man from Oregairu, so why would he not notice the multiple women crushing on him? SAOAbridged at least puts that misanthropy in the context of Sachi, which Source!Kirito seems to forget 5 minutes down the line.
