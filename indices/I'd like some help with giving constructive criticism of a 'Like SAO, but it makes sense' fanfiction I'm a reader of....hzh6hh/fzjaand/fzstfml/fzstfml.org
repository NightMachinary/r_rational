It's funny; SAO Abridged made it way harder for me to enjoy SAO fanfic. I keep finding myself expecting Kirito to act like abridged Kirito, and even though I know academically that abridged Kirito wasn't the original version, it still feels off to me. The same goes for the other characters, to a lesser extent.
