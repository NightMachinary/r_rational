Thanks for your help, what do you think of some of the more recent replies by the QM? I am kind of sort of getting the QM to consider 'rational, smart people acting rationally, but that vehemently disagree with one another in how to run things' is more the way to go, but I'm not 100% sure the point is fully there yet.
