Not that I'm in any way trying to speak for [[/u/Detsuahxe][u/Detsuahxe]], but generally author's that post their work online, especially authors of serial fiction who post their work piece by piece, value their readers' criticism to improve their writing. Sometimes readers will find mistakes that they could not.

However, the way you phrase your question (i.e. "Do they gain anything from hearing your unsolicited, probably bad ideas?") makes me think you're referring to a specific form of criticism which while, granted, is often unhelpful, is not the form most criticism takes.

Criticism is about the critic sharing their opinions about the piece, not their ideas. Someone suggesting alternative forms the story could/should have taken is generally bad criticism. It looks past what the work is and only focuses on what it could/should be.

Maybe that's not what you meant, and if so, my apologies. But, if that is the kind of criticism you were referring to, hopefully I could clear up any confusion or frustration about this.
