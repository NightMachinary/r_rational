You notice nothing, because no, I didn't. What do I gain from engaging with a work, thinking about it critically, and discussing those criticisms with others? I dunno, pleasure? Engagement? Social interaction with my peers? A possible future world where the work is improved as a result of critical discussion about it?

Hell, let me turn this one around on you. What do people who want to actually engage with work and discuss it critically gain from you saying "no, criticism is bad. Your ideas are bad. Don't think about or discuss a work. Just consume in silence."? Where do you get off shutting down conversations you don't like? Do you think authors will repay your hard work defending their fragile egos on the internet?

They will not.
