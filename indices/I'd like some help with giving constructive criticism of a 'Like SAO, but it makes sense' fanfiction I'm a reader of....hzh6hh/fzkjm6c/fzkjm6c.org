*Disclaimer:* I almost never give feedback on stories I'm reading, and when I do it's mostly things like "This is a good story" or "I really like this story". But it doesn't seem like it'd be too different than something like figuring out what you like/dislike, and why you like/dislike it, then explaining the results of your introspection. I journal, so do this sort of thing but with my life every day, and I think strategies I use can be applied in this case also. So here's my techniques for doing that, adapted to the context of providing story feedback:

--------------

You could try making a list, or just writing down what you like, and don't like about the story. To do this, you may want to reread it, and take notes on parts that you thought were clever or you just thought were cool or especially emotionally appealing. If this seems like too much work, you could try summarizing the story, spending extra time on things you like, and noting things you didn't like, along with a reason why you didn't like that and/or a recommendation for an improvement. During this phase, you are just trying to figure out what you like, and while it's better if all your thoughts are fully fleshed out (for instance: you may not be able to come up with an alternative to a part of the story you didn't like), the main goal is to figure out what you like.

Often, I get caught up in thinking something along the lines of "what if my thoughts are super dumb, and this plot point that I didn't like was completely necessary for this other thing I loved!" or "maybe I'm being too critical with the author here. I have no idea what I would do different, so it's possible this is the best it could've been." (that is, if I'm trying to write a review that goes beyond "This is a really good story"). If you begin to feel similarly and it holds you back from writing a good review, I think the best thing to do is ignore the thoughts entirely. It would be nice if you made all your opinions 100% consistent on your first pass-through, but really your job here is to decide what you like or don't like about the story. Maybe take note of the notes of discord, but otherwise just push through and try to get a good representation for your preferences.

From here you have two choices: a) just post your raw thoughts, or b) edit your thoughts so they actually make sense. If you're anything like me, b is the way to go (or you could sneak-edit your post later on and hope no one notices). But here is where things will be different for most people. It's even different for myself at different times of the day. How do you turn stream-of-consciousness writing into something that makes sense? My main strategy is to completely rewrite/summarize my stream-of-consciousness multiple times, but do whatever feels right to you.

If I understand your previous comments correctly, then your goal in giving feedback here is to argue in favour of a particular path the Quest story will take. Here, I'd recommend doing something similar to what was described previously. That is, write down what you do and don't like (or maybe just what you don't like) about the path the story's taking presently, and where you think it's going. Engage with arguments against your position. Explain why you think they're wrong about psychology stuff or why you think what they're proposing wouldn't make a good story or whatever. Point to specific points they're making that you disagree with, and try to [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/FhH8m5n8qGSSHsAgG/better-disagreement][steel-man]] their argument into something they would agree with & think is better than their own argument, then refute that argument.

Also, understand that you could be wrong about your preferences. The author(s?) and community have done a good job of predicting them in the past (or else you wouldn't still be reading). Your goal should be to try to /improve/ the story. You learn your preferences so that the story can be made better, you communicate those preferences so the author(s?) know how to make the story as good as possible for you, and you argue with others about various proposals so that members of the community can make an informed decision.
