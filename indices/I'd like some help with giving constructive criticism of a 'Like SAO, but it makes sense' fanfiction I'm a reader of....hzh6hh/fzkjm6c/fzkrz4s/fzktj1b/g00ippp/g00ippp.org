Here are some responses from the GM regarding themes and such in the story:

"A part of human nature is that humans take on the qualities of their environment - if you live in an unstable, chaotic space, you're going to be prone to chaotic, unstable responses. Likewise, someone living around compassionate and caring people is far more likely to be compassionate and caring.

.....

I expect if the game lasts for longer than four or five years, players might start questioning if there was ever a game to begin with. Was there really an Earth, somewhere? A place with no magic, and no system that runs things? Perhaps Earth was an ephemeral dream, and everyone in reality truly is a higher-dimensional being, merely afflicted with memory loss and higher spiritual order paralysis? This would be especially true for kids who were around ten years old when the game began, or people who are already either unstable or seek escapism from their old life.

It may also develop into a form of deadly sloth, where people refuse to challenge Adversaries and Lord Radius to escape the game, since... well, there's no game to escape. What's the point of trying? Let's just live."

(On the suggestion to start a cult to fix things) "It's never too late to become a crusader, laddie! In all seriousness, if you decide to seriously pursue a religious cult, I will not stop you - keep in mind at this point it would mostly be a memetic idea and pursuit, and religious fervor, if any, would only come into play later on, as people begin to lose their marbles.

It's also, quite obviously, a trade-off. If people fervently believe in the idea of the outside world and reaching it, they'll work towards that. This means anyone who disagrees is a heretic: adherents will find it easy to justify, say, the murder of such heretics and forceful seizure of their property. If they weren't prepared to help achieve the Goal, they weren't worthy of life to begin with. You can make tenets about not killing people all you like, but Christianity also has its rules, and Christians are still going to violate them - often in the pursuit of faith, as the aforementioned crusades have shown. There is no perfect religious person, because no person can be perfect."

"Otherwise, I've planned a theme of insane detachment from reality that develops over time, as well as escapism to the point of borderline sloth. You're working on a clock, quite literally, because eventually people just won't care enough to even attempt escape. Why bother with boring, conventional reality, when you can be a demigod in a land of eternal legend? Another theme is going to be searching for the anchors that keep people attached to their past."

(On plans to derail the sloth and lack of cooperation theme with education and propaganda) "Derail it? Probably not, unless you act on it further. Impact it? Yes.

Setting up NATO isn't enough to stop war, conflict, and terrorism; it only acts as a deterrent. At best, those activities change their scope from military to political, which can still cause problems. You're fighting the symptoms with mild effectiveness, and the source of the disease with minor effectiveness. It's just not enough."

(On how people wouldn't descend to PK/murder relativley early on, just because some asshole put a bomb to their head) "You have a very optimistic view of mankind.

Some people are going to be thankful to Kayaba, and outright support him, while fighting any attempts of ending the death game scenario. As I said, escapism is a bitch: SAO is a world whose realism nearly matches that of the real world, but it offers incredible, superhuman power to its prisoners.

Unlike in the real world, the disenfranchised can easily become leaders, masters, and powers to be reckoned with inside of the game - the only cost is for them to ceaselessly grind or murder other players if they're truly desperate. There will be no one to unplug them, and the ability to interact with other, real people, who are weaker than them adds a degree of sweetness. For those who desire total supremacy, you have the NPCs, who are totally inferior to players in most aspects on average.

I'm using a lot of these to justify Laughing Coffin later on. We're going to tone down the "psychotic serial killers because killing is fun and I'm crazy," aspect and instead favor the theme of, "being in this game lets me be powerful, and having power over other people feels fucking good."

And as the person above said, this isn't America after Pearl Harbor. There is no national identity, propaganda, or history to pull people together. Being a gamer doesn't constitute the kind of togetherness a country has, especially in the case of gamers who all come from divergent cultures and places, and each have their own spin-off beliefs on top of that.

This isn't Pearl Harbor; this is a bus crashing into a building. Some people are going to rush inside to rescue survivors, a couple will call an ambulance, but most are going to stand by and watch it happen while scratching their balls in a collective action paralysis; and there's bound to be at least one psychopath - probably more - who's going to gleefully raise his phone to record it, and then post it on social media for the reactions and retweets."

"If [philosophical themes rather than humans being terrible] is how you want it to go, sure. But I'm not seeing many paths for this other than turning this quest into Detroit: Become Human, where lots of people act like dicks to NPCs for no reason other than being dicks, to the point of enslaving them in droves, while other people fight that. I'd normally use this on a lesser scale and shift attention to it only as a side-plot. Transhumanity was already going to be a heavy concept, and related to the entire thing where people start wanting to stay in the game because it seems better than reality. The next update will have a vote that asks players where they want the story to go."
