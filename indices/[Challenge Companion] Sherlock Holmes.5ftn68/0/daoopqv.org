Maybe off-topic, maybe not, as it concerns the genre Sherlock Holmes kicked off rather than Holmes himself...

I've had a pet idea for ages for a procedural murder-mystery show that spends the first season building up the title character's detective prowess. Then, in the first season's finale, it reveals to the audience (but not to any of the other characters) that he's actually a brilliant but evil serial killer who gets his kicks framing others for his murders to bolster his reputation as a crime-solving hero. In retrospect, this makes sense of some of the inconsistencies that come with the genre - mostly questionable lines of evidence that always turn out to be right. The truth is that they /never/ turn out to be right; he just successfully tricked everyone else including most of the audience into thinking they were. His thought processes were optimizing for persuading third parties all along, not for deducing facts. And really, what would you /expect/ of one guy who keeps "stumbling on" supposedly unrelated murders? Something pretty fishy, right? In future seasons, the show is a dark drama; his serial-killing-and-framing operation continues; sometimes the side characters will start to have suspicions and get killed if they fail to hide them, until finally he makes some error and gets found out and taken down.
