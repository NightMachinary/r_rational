A fun fact about Sherlock Holmes is that he is in the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes#Copyright_issues][Public Domain]]. This means that any derivative work or fanfiction is perfectly legal and can be sold for commercial purposes without any explicit permission from any copyright holder. Dinosaur Comics mentions this a [[http://qwantz.com/index.php?comic=2126][couple]] of [[http://qwantz.com/index.php?comic=2590][times]]. Rejoice!

One of my favorite Sherlock Holmes derivative works is A Study in Emerald by Neil Gaiman [[http://www.neilgaiman.com/mediafiles/exclusive/shortstories/emerald.pdf][(link)]].
