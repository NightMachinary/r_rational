I haven't found any actual Final Fantasy rational fiction, but you may be interested in my own *Arcane Ascension* or *Weapons and Wielders* books. Both series are expressly inspired by JRPGs, including *Final Fantasy*, *Ys*, *Bravely Default*, etc.

*Arcane Ascension* is a mix between a dungeon crawling book and a magical academy. There's a lot of emphasis on learning how magic works in an academy setting.

*Weapons & Wielders* is a spin-off from both my *Arcane Ascension* series and my older *War of Broken Mirrors*. It's much more adventure focused; you can think of it as being more like *Zelda* or *Ys*, but there's still some *Final Fantasy* influence in there, and one of the protagonists is very directly FF4 inspired.

They're rational in terms of characters using a lot of lateral thinking to solve problems, as well as a strong emphasis on hard magic and internal consistency. You should be aware that I don't write characters with the intention of them being just "intelligent" - I tend to write different characters having different /types/ of intelligence and weaknesses in other forms of intelligence.

For example, Corin tends to think about how he can exploit specific resources in the long-term, Sera is much better at social intelligence, and Keras is great at finding ways to just ignore the obvious answer to something and punch through it.

This can be frustrating for some readers - there's a subset of the rational community (and fantasy fans in general) that prefers for characters that are basically a power fantasy of perfect intellect, and you should be aware I don't write anything like that.
