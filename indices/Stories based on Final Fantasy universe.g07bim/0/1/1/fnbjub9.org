  Different types of intelligence? Respect and appreciation for the fact that there are many kinds of skills far beyond and outside of pure truth seeking/analysis/explicit epistemic updating, which are all just as useful and valuable? In a rational fic? That's not something I get to see very often.

It's a difficult balance, since I know that a lot of rational fiction readers find it off-putting when a character makes sub-optimal choices. I've tried to address this by making sure that these specialists each have areas to shine, but it's still not perfect for every reader.

  I'm intrigued, what's it about?

*Arcane Ascension* is about Corin Cadence, a teenager who attempts to learn magic and climb a gigantic ever-changing tower to search for his brother, Tristan, who disappeared into the tower five years earlier. The story moves back and forth between magical academy segments and dungeon crawls in the tower (and other locations).

It's also very party based after the intro. Each member of the protagonist's group has a different attunement - the primary sources of magic power on this continent. Attunements confer powers analogous to character classes; they're things like "Guardian", which has physical combat powers, or "Elementalist", which has blasty magic, etc. Every character spends time training and improving their abilities.

In terms of rational themes, it gets into things like magical influences on society, the ethics of specific types of magic (especially monster binding and summoning), different categories of sentience, some transhumanism themes, etc.

*Weapons & Wielders* is a prequel/side story following Keras Selyrian - a crossover character from my *War of Broken Mirrors* series - when he first shows up on the continent where *Arcane Ascension* takes place. The frame story for this takes place after *Arcane Ascension* book 2, but the main narrative is years earlier, so you can read them in any order (although I generally recommend you read *Arcane Ascension* first unless you dislike magical academies). It's largely focused on a quest to obtain the Six Sacred Swords, legendary magical artifacts tied to defeating the God Beasts, unbelievably powerful monsters.

Keras is already something of a powerhouse when this starts (it's after the third *War of Broken Mirrors* book, and he was pretty strong even at the start of the first one), but he still spends a lot of time looking for ways to improve his skill and learn new ones, especially in the second book and forward.

This is a good series if you're looking for someone with more of a JRPG hero mentality - Keras is pretty close to the standard yuusha archetype that people like Link and Adol Christin belong to, but a lot chattier.

It hits a lot of the same types of themes as *Arcane Ascension*, but with a particular emphasis on interacting with non-human characters.
