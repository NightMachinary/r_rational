Early/pre industrial setting, there's 5 dungeon towers throughout the continent created said to be created by a god, completing a challenge in the tower gives you a mark that gives you the ability to interact with mana in a specific way, such as shaping it into weapons, making contracts with monsters to summon them, or enchanting items. Corin goes to a school for people with these marks and is trying to learn about how to use his mark and how to improve, and wants to find his missing brother.
