My main subs are [[/r/climberscourt][r/climberscourt]] (for my own books) and [[/r/progressionfantasy][r/progressionfantasy]] (for books with a similar focus on character progression), but I drop by here from time to time and read some of the works here. =) Mother of Learning was a huge influence on Arcane Ascension, for example, and I'm enjoying Legacy of the Goddess and Delve right now.

I'm glad you're enjoying Arcane Ascension! Thank you very much for reading the books. =D
