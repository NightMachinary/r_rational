I wish there was a rational rewrite of FF7. I don't expect anything rational to come out of Nomura's mind.

I've been looking for a rational rewrite of FF7. Considering FF7 has been out for a couple of decades I would think there would have been something, but nope.

The plot had so much potential but retcons, bad devices, stupid motivations from both protagonists and antagonists, and glaring plotholes just kind of ruin it for me. I still love the world and idea but I can't view the story the same way again.
