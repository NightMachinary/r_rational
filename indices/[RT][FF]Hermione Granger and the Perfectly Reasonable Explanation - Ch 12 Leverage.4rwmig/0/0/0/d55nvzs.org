When I realized Snape had a good chance of stumbing onto the Time plot, I couldn't resist.

But even knowing the Prophecy and having additional reason to be on guard after the murder, a decade of peace is a far cry from active double-agent duty. Given how /completely unexpected/ what he encountered would have been, I decided that he was /just/ rusty enough that he'd be rattled enough to show /any/ reaction at all. :)

You're right about it not being necessary from a reader standpoint, given the coda - that was purely an impulse to establish dramatic tension, and I didn't reconsider the earlier decision in light of it. Though it does at least still have the benefit of providing /Hermione/ with a small clue for later use.
