Snape knows that YH is confident that Voldemort will return, and that she's actively thinking about a whole bunch of things she shouldn't have a clue about. He also either felt OH, or bounced off her occlumency shields, or she hid her presence somehow. It would be interesting if he read her mind as well. It'll be interesting to see what he does with that. Dumbledore or Malfoy or keep it to himself, if he moves against Nott (slytherins have potions the next day)
