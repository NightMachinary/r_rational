If you're Nott, how do you safeguard yourself from losing the contents of the incriminating letter to a memory charm without revealing it to anyone else? Some sort of mechanism that reveals it to someone if he doesn't tell it not to every 24 hours maybe - nothing he'd be able to craft himself at 11, but he's from a Slytherin family, and an artifact with that ability would be good for Slytherin plotting, so maybe he has one.
