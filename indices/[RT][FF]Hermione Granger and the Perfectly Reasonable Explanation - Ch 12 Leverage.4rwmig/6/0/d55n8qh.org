It could be, I've read maybe half of the Lovecraft stuff. I want to say I've heard the exact phrase used somewhere, though Google didn't help. But as I wanted something with a little more bite than the original "dunderheads" - but not /quite/ so far as "waste of skin" - it seemed to fit. Salt can have a lot of functions in Potion-making, but also rituals, and is thus far more useful to Snape than the average first-year. :)

And thank you! I've tried to avoid direct quotes from the canon book, which is easier as the story progresses and events diverge anyway. Using Madam Pomfrey's death to highlight safety seemed very Snapeish, and yeah, the original seemed a little too poetic for Snape to have been entirely off-the-cuff.
