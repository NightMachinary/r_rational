Yep. I remember my reaction to /Ender's Game/ (age c. 11ish) as disappointment that the kids weren't clearly out-thinking the adults.

I mean, in this scenario we're talking about the ~500 smartest children of a population of ~10^{10,} putting them in the top one-hundred-millionth or so. Add military training ("all warfare is based on deception"), and a social environment which challenges their skills, and what hope do relatively normal adults have?
