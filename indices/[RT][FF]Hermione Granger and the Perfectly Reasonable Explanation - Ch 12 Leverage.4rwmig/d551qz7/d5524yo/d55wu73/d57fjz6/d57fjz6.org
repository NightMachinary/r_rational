I don't think they necessarily got the most normal adults to teach them either. Sure the teachers probably weren't all geniuses, but you can bet they were all top experts in their individual fields of expertise.

And they seemed to mostly be taking a very hands-off approach to mentoring the students so there really wasn't much chance for the kids to "get one over" on the adults.

Though I may be making a mistake by assuming that most of the students were treated similarly to the way they treated Ender.
