Maybe I'm wrong, but I'm still not convinced that there /is/ an older Hermione time-travelling inside her younger counterpart's head. Why? The title. /The Perfectly Reasonable Explanation/. It won't be justified unless and until a very reasonable explanation that's very much unlike the weird stuff we are initially led to think appears. Therefore, my current theory is that there is a Perfectly Reasonable Explanation to the note and the glimpses that Hermione hasn't discovered yet.
