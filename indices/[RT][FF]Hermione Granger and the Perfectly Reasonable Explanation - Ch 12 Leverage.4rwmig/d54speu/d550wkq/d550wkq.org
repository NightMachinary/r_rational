This is definitely a really cool development, and one that I didn't expect at all for all that it emerges totally naturally from what we know about the world.

That said, I'm slightly of two minds about the execution.

#+begin_quote
  Snape abruptly backed a single step away from her, his expression not changing in the slightest.
#+end_quote

I thought this line was almost a really great, subtle indication that Snape read her mind, relying on reader knowledge, and that it did a nice job of demonstrating that we are dealing with an intelligent Snape (or at least one with some self-control). Even then though I wished his reaction had been something a bit less dramatic than even merely taking an abrupt step backwards.

I thought so even more after seeing the chapter end with the explicit revelation of what happened. Given that we are about to find out for sure, I think Snape's reaction should be more subtle. This makes him even more impressive (and doesn't detract from impact of reading his POV -- though I can see why [[/u/RobinDrew]] might not want to make Snape too perfect) and allows readers to feel clever when they figure out what happened before having it spelled out directly.

If the text is going to explicitly say what happened, there's no need to find a happy medium between being clear enough that everyone gets it and subtle enough to reward readers who are paying attention.

This is a very minor complaint though :).
