I am amazed by how well you portrayed Theodore Nott here. The entire time he spoke I had this awful squirmy feeling in my gut and I felt the same desire to do nasty (for non-weird values of "nasty") things to him that Hermione did. I imagine most people here will feel the same way, which is a testament to how well you've portrayed Hermione, since Theodore's behavior here is something we've been known to cheer for. I am hoping Hermione will toughen up a bit, but it her reaction here was actually wonderful.

Also, to reiterate something I've said before, I'm really looking forward to the rest of this story. You've set it up to be so much more than just another "Actual Smart Hermione" fic, and it has the makings of something quite original. Add that to your great writing and the result is a really memorable story.

I'm glad to see you were able to keep the story going after the incident in the library. Something like that could easily have derailed the story (in a bad way), but it looks like you have found a way to keep it moving forward in a way that

1) keeps Hermione in a position of agency

2) continues to deliver on the things that readers have enjoyed up to this point

3) shows Hermione dealing with the new information in a proactive way, and

4) continues piling on new complications.

Really impressive stuff, and I think the result will be wonderful if you continue to be successful on all of those points.
