Dear lord. Thanks, this one is horrible!

Analyzing it, I have found that when I'm typing very fast as I compose, homophone errors are more frequent than any other type, as if my hands are just taking dictation from my thoughts (though I usually notice errors when they come out).

Ordinarily that wouldn't make a lot of sense for this example, unless you're /thinking in a British accent/, in which case "sort of" actually does sound close to "sort have" (at least, for the Hermione accent that lives in my head).

In any case, I changed it to "vaguely", which probably suits her better in precision-of-thought terms anyway. :)
