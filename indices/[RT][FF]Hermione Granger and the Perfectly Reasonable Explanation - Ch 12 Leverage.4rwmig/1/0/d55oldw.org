Thank you!

What went up is definitely better than my first draft, where Theodore was /too/ thorough in analyzing the situation, to the point where he'd discarded all his sensible theories as to what was going on, and was starting to question some of the evidence.

I thought about it, and realized that it does make sense for high-status pure-bloods to receive "factional" tutoring before Hogwarts (a-la Draco in HPMOR), but it's not likely to be in /critical thinking/ (as that would not be a survival trait, given the faction's difficulties with objective reality), rather in fast, reliable heuristics for identifying /opportunity/ and acting on it.

That shortcut most of the analysis, recognizing that, regardless of Hermione's motives for "making it up", she'd made herself vulnerable. And because /he/ doesn't believe a word of it, he's content to make personal use of the situation, rather than immediately owling his father, which could've had /much/ more serious and immediate consequences.
