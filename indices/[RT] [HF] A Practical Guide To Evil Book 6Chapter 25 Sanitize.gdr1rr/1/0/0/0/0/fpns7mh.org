I've actually read almost all of those. I gave up on the wandering inn at some point because I realized that it was never going to end and I didn't particularly care about the current arc (something about a crazy clown?).

Everybody loves large chests had too much of a sexual nature for my tastes, I don't want to read about the female demon disgorging a cock from somewhere and aggressively fucking the other female demon.

Homicidal aliens was good when I last read it but there wasn't much of it and super minion is great.

I've never heard of vacant throne and I've heard some good things about the daily grind. Thanks!
