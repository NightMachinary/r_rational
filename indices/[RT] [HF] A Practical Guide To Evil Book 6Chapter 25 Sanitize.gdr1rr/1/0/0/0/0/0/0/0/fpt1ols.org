It might just be a mark of the author's improving skill, but more and more frequently plotlines are coming together, foreshadowing is playing off, and things are culminating in ways that you'd never see coming but which make complete sense in retrospect. It's definitely a noticeable change from the first few books. So yeah if you're really looking for something to read at any point give it a shot. The clown and Rhir heroes plot hasn't come back up in quite a while, so for the time being you can skip those and continue on with the main story.
