hey, I just started your story (currently starting book 2) ans I have to say, I'm loving it so far. Very good world, interesting characters (especially Catherine), and interesting good/evil rules with characters being more greys.

I'm genuinely scared for the secondary characters during the big fights, hope the pixie won't eat the dust
