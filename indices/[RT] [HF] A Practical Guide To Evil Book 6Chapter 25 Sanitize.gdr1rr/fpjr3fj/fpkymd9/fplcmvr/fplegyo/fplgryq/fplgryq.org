If you go back to recent stuff, Worm is the gold standard for many and recently finished its sequel Ward. Mother of Learning also recently came to a fantastic conclusion.

For ongoing works, I'm a /huge/ fan of The Wandering Inn, but it definitely has no ending in sight. It does have pretty clear arcs though I feel.

Vacant Throne is a lesser known one, I think, and definitely feels like it's wrapping towards a conclusion. Excellent piece, I really like the author's other works too.

I recently read Homicidal Aliens are Invading and All I Got is This Stat Menu, which I thought was fairly well written and has just one book fully written; the author dropped it shortly into book 2, so you can stop at the epilogue for a satisfying conclusion.

Metaworld Chronicles is a long one with fairly decent narrative separation. I had a lot of problems in the beginning with it feeling like pure male fantasy, but the editing has helped that a lot and the worldbuilding is quite excellent. Still has a bit of a Mary Sue feel.

Super Minion hasn't gotten far enough that it feels it's dragging and the author's stated he has a clear ending planned. I adore this story.

Worth the Candle is acclaimed and has a lot of work and attention to detail in it. I took a break when I caught up to it at chapter 100 and haven't started back up (it's at 200-something now). The depth of mechanics involved gets hard to keep up with at times, imo.

Everybody Loves Large Chests is a bit of a guilty pleasure of mine as it's unashamed in its power fantasy and sexual content but very neat in terms of worldbuilding. And recently finished, come to think of it.

The Daily Grind is also quite a decent story if you like a more modern aesthetic as a change from all the typical fantasy pieces.

And that's all I've got off the top of my head and my royalroad follow list. Hopefully some good stuff in there.
