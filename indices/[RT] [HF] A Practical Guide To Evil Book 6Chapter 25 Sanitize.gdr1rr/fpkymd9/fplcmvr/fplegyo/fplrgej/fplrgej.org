/Animorphs The Reckoning/ is fifty-fifty on planning (like, it clearly has a planned ending, but it takes some /wild/ tangents to get there), but it's pretty great in terms of "things really happening"; the status quo changes /fast/, and it always feels like the protagonists are working towards a new pressing goal.
