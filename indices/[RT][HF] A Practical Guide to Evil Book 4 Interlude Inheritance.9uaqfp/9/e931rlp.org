Just got around to finishing up Book 3 last week, can anyone tell me (in a non-spoilery way) if it seems like Book 4 is approaching the end? I'm not a huge fan of reading new chapters as they come out, so I prefer to wait until each book (or clearly delineated arc like wildbow does) is complete then bundle them together.
