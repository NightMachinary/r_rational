I'm pretty sure that Reflect was all Wekesa. The Gods Below gave him a second wind, which he spent tearing up Tikoloshe's contract so 'Loshe could run away. Of course, /love doesn't walk away/. Wekesa noted that Below wouldn't give him another boost.

His own third aspect, though... Wekesa just pulled a Summon Bigger Fish. A God struck at him and failed to make it stick. His Reflect aspect let him respond in kind for one eternal, glorious moment.

And, as others have noted, Masego the Heirophant got to Witness /all of it/.
