He might need aid from Below if he had just seen the face of a God, crushing his bones and eyes and ears and leaving him bleeding from every hole in his body. My reading of it was that he was already broken and well on his way to death.

Plus, his crafting of Tikoloshe's contract was described as meticulous and cautious beyond what most diabolists demand. I imagine that, when summoning a creature specifically designed for mind-reading and manipulation, Wekesa made sure the contract /couldn't/ be dismissed merely by a stray thought.

Him spending his second wind on that rather than Masego is potentially a fair point, but I have imagined having to choose between my daughter and my wife. The ethical calculus there is /not/ as simple as you might think. I, at least, won't second-guess his priorities. Plus, he may have already decided on his course of action with Reflect, and knew he was about to save Masego. 'Loshe was the one who needed to get clear of the blast radius.

Amusingly enough, had Wekesa left the contract in place, he could have forced Tikoloshe to run. Probably. But who knows what happens when the mortal half of a summoning contract dies? It's probable that there was a contingency that forcibly dispersed Tikoloshe in the event of Wekesa's death.
