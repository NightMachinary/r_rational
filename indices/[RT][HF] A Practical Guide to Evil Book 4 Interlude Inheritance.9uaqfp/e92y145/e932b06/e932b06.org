You mean like, say, opening the possibility for a villain known for bringing hells to Creation temporarily getting the powers of a god? For some reason I doubt that Above is going to risk that happening again for quite some time.

Also, remember that this is the *tenth* crusade. If there was ever a time for unprecedented meddling, this is it.
