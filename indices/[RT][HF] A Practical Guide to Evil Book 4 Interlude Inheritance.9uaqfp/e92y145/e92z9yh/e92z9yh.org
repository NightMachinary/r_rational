And now Malicia is in trouble. She's down two of the Calamities, Masego is free to return to Catherine and Scribe is going to go berserk looking for Black.

Assassin's still the wildcard. I don't imagine he'll be sent after the Woe or the Procerans. Maybe just pointed at the Dead King? Clean up the leftovers by using them. She wins either way. And Ranger has probably stuck her head out of her burrow.
