Huh, I was figuring either Wekesa or Tikoloshe would die in this fight, but not both. Man that's gotta be rough for Masego. Also, I wonder how the Ashurans / Procerans got a God Above to directly intervene. I don't think we've ever heard of that happening before. Hopefully their was quite a cost to be paid, because if they can do that for free... And lastly I guess does Wekesa get a death curse, or did his reflect trick count as that?
