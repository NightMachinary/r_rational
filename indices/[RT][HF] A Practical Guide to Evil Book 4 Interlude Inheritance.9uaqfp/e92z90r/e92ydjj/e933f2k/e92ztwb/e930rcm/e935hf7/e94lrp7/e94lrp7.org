Will did not use all of his aspects against Cat. He /tried/ to use Triumph, but was interrupted by an exploding zombie horse and didn't do get a chance to do anything other than be grievously injured (which he then shrugged off with his second aspect Rise). If he used it, or if it had an effect, it was one that went entirely unnoticed and unremarked upon which would be weird after so much build up towards it.
