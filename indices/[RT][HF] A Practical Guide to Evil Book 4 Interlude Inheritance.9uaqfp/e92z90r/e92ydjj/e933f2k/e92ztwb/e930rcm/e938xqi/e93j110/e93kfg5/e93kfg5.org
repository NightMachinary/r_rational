My point is that even explicitly passive Aspects ([[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2017/04/26/heroic-interlude-appellant/][Obey]], [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2018/01/31/hierarchy/][Receive]], [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2018/06/04/kaleidoscope-vi/][Dawn]]) are bolded when mentioned in the naration or by their wielders. Hell, she may be using side effects, like Tyrant of Helike can read minds without spending a Wish - [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2017/09/25/villainous-interlude-thunder/][but even in that case it's bolded]]! I'm not saying those can't be hers, just that she's unlikely to have actually no active component to them. That's for someone like Hierarch, who's pretty much an opposite of hers in the sense that he refuses to act, no matter what he wants.
