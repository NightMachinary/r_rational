The Woe has been turning heroic for quite some time now. Ever since Cat died and was reborn, I'd say. The rescue of Black ? It reeks of heroic rescue and was foreshadowed by the flavour text on [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2018/08/29/chapter-49-wrangle/][chapter 49]].

That's my theory and I'll be running with it.
