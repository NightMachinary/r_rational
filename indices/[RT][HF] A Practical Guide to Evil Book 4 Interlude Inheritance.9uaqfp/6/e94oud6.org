So that was a very, very full chapter. So much happened so quickly that there's an awful lot to go through. It's going to need a couple of rereads just to unpack it, I think.

There wasn't a huge amount of incomprehensible magical jargon, which I'm happy about, and instead we got a really interesting look into Warlock's life (and by extension the lives of the Calamities) and it just really humanised all of them.

Then there was an enormous battle - which i think was actually the largest fight we've had in the series, despite it's brevity, with direct interventions from the Gods Above and Below - and holy crap the Crusade actually did something! After the Battle of the Camps or the Vales it's good to see Good being a threat.

And so now Warlock is gone, which happened right after we were given a lot of reasons to care about him, his husband, and their relationship, so it was actually quite upsetting. But this is going to have huge repercussions going forward.

Malicia is a bit screwed. She just lost one of her biggest assets, which doesn't put her in a great spot if things come down to a straight fight for her (which it might - I can't recall offhand whether Ashur have more ships/men -EDIT: they do but a limited amount-, and there's always the looming Callow situation). Plus, Masego just lost his biggest incentive to pull punches against Praes himself, or to argue against fighting Praes, which are both fairly big deals.

Also, Masego just lost his fathers. Poor guy. That resolves both the issues of him being pulled between his old family and his new, and thankfully sidesteps the whole personal-drama-because-people-can't-communicate thing he had going on with his parents. Thank God. Although now he's got no warning on the dangers surrounding the Dead King's knowledge.

Then there's further strain being put on the resources of the Grand Alliance, and right before the Dead King steps out. There's reveals about how and when the Gods step out to play and what that looks like. And a bunch of other important details.
