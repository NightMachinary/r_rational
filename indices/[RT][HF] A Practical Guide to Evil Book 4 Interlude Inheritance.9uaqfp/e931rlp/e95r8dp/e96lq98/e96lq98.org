I'd say that a lot of the fae arc was slow, but not boring. I thought it was intentional though, because fae are eternal creatures who don't operate the same as humans, and it would make thematic sense in PGtE that this quality would bleed into the story structure itself.

And I appreciate the offer, but I'll probably just wait for a while. The author writes are a breakneck pace, so it probably won't be that long, compared to how long we have to wait for the next installment of normal novels.
