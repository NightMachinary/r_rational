As others said, we don't know, it will either go for a long time or end with a big cliffhanger soon. But there are some good arc like delimitations to it. So you can probably just read by arc. Won't spoil you here but if you want i can give you where the first arc "ends". that way you can probably read some of book 4 without having to read week by week.

Also a question to you. since you already read book 3 recently. I read book 3 as new chapters came out. And a lot of the fae arc seemed to me incredibly slow and boring. I think some of it might have been because i read every episode as it came out. Did you feel the same in this arc?
