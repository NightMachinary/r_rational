It's... not really clear. A lot of shit has happened already in Book 4, but the plot looks like it might checking items off a list, and we know that list isn't exhausted yet.

Unless the unchecked items on the list are to become major plot elements of the next book, in which case we could be coming up on a "Then everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked" style of cliffhanger.
