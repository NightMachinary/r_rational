Destroy too was used after the battle, /still/ nearly killed him, and we don't know how does Conquer manifest: we know that [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2017/10/02/villainous-interlude-calamity-ii/][it is better fit for war than skirmishes between Named]], and the strenghtening of the legionaries at second Liesse seems to mostly fall under Lead. We only have Akua's word on the dubious notion of Black Knight opening the fight with /two/ Aspects.
