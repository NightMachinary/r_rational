Warlock didn't use Link against the Witch of the Woods. Black Knight's Lead definitely isn't passive (Akua was able to detect [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2018/01/17/villainous-interlude-crescendo/][the moment he used it at Liesse]], and he [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2018/09/28/interlude-queens-gambit-offered/][mentioned consciously having to spread it between sixteen thousand legionaries]]), and we don't know what his version of Conquer actually /does/. William is the case that led me to the whole "death by overcommitting" line of thought.

Seriously, guys. I can't be the only person who counts bullets here.
