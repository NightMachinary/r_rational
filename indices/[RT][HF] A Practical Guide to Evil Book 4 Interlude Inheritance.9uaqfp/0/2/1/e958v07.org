Well if you lived in a world where narrative affects reality it would be really important to know what are the most likely death flags /in/ narrative.

Like for example you would never under any circumstances say to your beloved "We will get married when I return from this battle. This, the last battle before I retire from soldiering". You might as well put a gun in your mouth!
