Agreed. I'll be the first to admit that I'm not the biggest fan of the story itself, but the delay is a period of less than a day, with a notification clearly displayed in the same place a new chapter would have been, at the same time that a chapter should have been posted, such that anyone who cared enough about reading the update asap would have immediately seen it anyway. Making a thread about the delay under such circumstances to me feels like unnecessary clutter.
