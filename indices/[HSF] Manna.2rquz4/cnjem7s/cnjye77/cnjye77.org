You should check out "Freehold" by Michael Z Williamson for an exploration of exactly that "hoarding welfare families" idea. It's packed full of libertarian propaganda, but it's a rocking good war story with some excellent character development. The sequels are also lots of fun and at least occasionally start it brush up against the bad sides of libertarian society.
