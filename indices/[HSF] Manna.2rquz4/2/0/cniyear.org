You went right to it, when i was reading the quoted bit i was thinking "Cordyceps", then you mentioned it :)

So, video. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuKjBIBBAL8][Here's cordyceps]], narrated by Sir David Attenborough which is always a plus, and [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go_LIz7kTok][here's something else that affects snails]].

It's not that it can't happen, it's just that it hasn't happened yet. And doing this is almost begging for it.
