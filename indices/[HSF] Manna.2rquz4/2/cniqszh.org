This part bothered me:

  "What's to stop someone from taking over the system and turning us into an army of zombies?" I asked.

  "I'm no engineer," Linda said, "But here's the best explanation I've heard. Why can't someone take over your brain?"

  "What do you mean?"

  "Why has no one ever been able to take over billions of human brains and create an army of zombies that way?"

  "Well, it's inside of me. How would they take it over?" I replied.

  "Why can't they just upload a program into your brain, and that program takes over your brain and turns you into a zombie a minute later? Why does that never happen?" She asked.

  "Because there is no way to 'upload' a program into my brain. And my brain does not execute programs anyway. It is not a computer." I replied.

  "Yes." She said.

/My/ answer to the question "Why hasn't anyone taken over our brains?" is not "because the brain is special", its "because no one has figured out how to do it yet." I would be incredibly wary about a computer being connected to my brain; especially after experiencing Manna. I would certainly ask about security risks before I attached a computer directly to my brain.

As a computer science student I know that any computer system can be hacked, given enough time and incentive. And from the wonderful world of [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophiocordyceps_unilateralis][parasites]], I know that you don't even need a computer to control brains.

Edit: grammar
