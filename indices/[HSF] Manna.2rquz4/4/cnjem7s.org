I like this, but it reads as a long thought experiment, instead of an actual story. Yes, it would be terrifying if capitalism was brought to an extreme. Yes, just like now, the poor would want to change the system while the rich would want it to stay the same. And yeah, the Australian model would be pretty ideal and would prevent a lot of the problems.

It reminds a bit of the plot of Atlas shrugged, where the world is going to hell and a small community has found a way to live that's much much better (which they will soon spread to the world in order to save them).

It fails though to go into detail. What happens to an economic system when almost all of the recipients are without jobs? What happens to the owner of fast food joints, when those who frequent fast food joints are suddenly unable to pay for that kind of food. How does a hospital make money, if none of its patients can pay for the care? How long can rich people stay rich, if their markets shrink every day? If capitalism doesn't collapse, then how does it stay afloat?

In Australia, there are serious downsides to the system that ought to be examined. The possibility of a virus is handwaved away, but what about a malfunction that won't let you control your body anymore? What about the sexual deviants who want to keep some of their kinks private? What about the people who live in VS who want to take on different shapes? Letting everyone do their own thing is awesome, but it also creates very different fractions. Within years, Australia might be splintered into parties or countries that want mutually exclusive things. Religious extremists probably won't be allowed to bully others into doing something they don't want because of the rules, but manipulation and emotional abuse can still exist and be very damaging. Whenever you make rules, there are people who can find the loopholes.

And as some other people mentioned, how do you deal with other countries taking offence to your way of doing things? Even if Australia doesn't run out of room and wants to start expanding, other countries might demand some answers as to where their 400,000 inhabitants a day are going. I really wouldn't put it past rich guys with big egos to wanna selfishly hoard their wellfare families and launch a 'humanitarian rescue' for those 'unfortunate souls, probably used for slave labour'.

So yeah, fun concept, but feels incomplete.
