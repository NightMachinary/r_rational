I also found it odd that there was practically a whole chapter devoted to how the "haves" don't do anything for the "have-nots" and how we should redesign society, but as soon as the main character gets his chance he completely forgets about the poor sods back in America. (And the whole "no one did anything for those in third world countries " is patently false.)

Wide-eyed idealism indeed.
