Digital was good and bad. It was about your conversations on old BBS's on an amiga. Turns out you were talking to an AI the whole time.

It can be difficult to figure out what you need to do to trigger the next part of the story sometimes. Analogue probably spoiled some things.

I played it years ago and honestly can't remember much about the plot beyond that.
