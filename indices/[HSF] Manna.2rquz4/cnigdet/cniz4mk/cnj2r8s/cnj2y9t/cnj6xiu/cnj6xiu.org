I liked Digital. It did depend on commands quite a bit, and there were some times when I wasn't sure how to progress, but usually it didn't take long to figure it out and I never needed to consult a guide. The plot was pretty decent, though much thinner than Analogue or its sequel Hate Plus, and the romance was underdeveloped. Still, it was good for a short, free game. If you haven't played it yet, Hate Plus might be more to your liking, and it's on sale on Steam right now. I liked Mute's route especially. Analogue was Hyun-ae's story, and Hate Plus is Mute's.

I agree about don't take it personally, babe. It had some elements that I liked, but it was made in a month for some challenge and it shows.
