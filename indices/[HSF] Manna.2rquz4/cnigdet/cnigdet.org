  [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious][Anvilicious]]

  A portmanteau of anvil and delicious (or possibly vicious), anvilicious describes a writer's and/or director's use of an artistic element, be it line of dialogue, visual motif, or plot point, to so obviously or unsubtly convey a particular message that they may as well etch it onto an anvil and drop it on your head. Frequently, the element becomes anvilicious through unnecessary repetition, but true masters can achieve anviliciousness with a single stroke.

Not that I disagree with their point, just the implementation is a little bit bad. Still, it seems popular.
