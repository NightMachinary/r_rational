Read it, but sincerely to me it sounds like a great first-third of the book. Missing are the parts where Vertebrane decides who needs "reeducation" by criteria much different than initially intended and where America decides that they want some of those toys, and they're just going to take them, thank you very much. Too much wide-eyed idealism, which i sure as hell wish was possible, but don't for one second consider likely. Human nature doesn't change much.
