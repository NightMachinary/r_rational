Just read the few chapter that are up. This is surprisingly good. I am always leary of self insert fics because they have a very high tendency to be op wish fulfillment crappie. This story does not do that are works hard to avoid that by not using the pov of the si. Additionally the characters are well fleshed out and mostly true to cannon from what I can recall. They act rationally and I think this is perfect for this sub.
