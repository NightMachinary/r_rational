SI fits organically within the story as if the character actually belonged there, unlike almost all SI.

That's because it's never told from the SI point of view. We, the readers can pick up hints of the SI's origin, even as the characters in the story didn't suspect a thing.

Obviously, this will change as the SI ages and she is able to comprehend her memories and situation. But we'll witness all of this externally, without access to her POV.

That's the premises.

Other than that, it divulge into the origin and politics that lead to the third ninja world war even as butterflies derail canon.
