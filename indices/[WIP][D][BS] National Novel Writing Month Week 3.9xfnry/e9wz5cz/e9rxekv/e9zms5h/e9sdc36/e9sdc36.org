This has been a very hectic month for me, school-wise, as the majority of my projects and exams are happening right now. There's been a few times where I've had to prioritize school over writing (which I don't regret), and it completely kills my momentum. I'm probably going to take an extra week to finish at my current pace, not the worst though.
