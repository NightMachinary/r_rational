I committed the cardinal sin of NaNo: I refactored. My friends, my siblings-in-quill, forgive me, but know that though I have erred in my path I still somehow managed to keep hitting my self-imposed ~2k word quota, so I guess that's OK.

The reason why is simple: the narrator has not yet earned (narratively, not in-setting) what he received, and so I had to dial it down. This also gives a slower burn to finding out the deep dark secrets of the other people involved, which I think is good.
