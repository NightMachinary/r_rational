I've often felt that November is one of the worst months that National Novel Writing Month could have chosen, because it's prime school time, and in America, it's got Thanksgiving, which has historically been a productivity killer for me. Prioritizing school over writing is entirely sensible, especially if you're going to time-shift the writing to a better time for you.
