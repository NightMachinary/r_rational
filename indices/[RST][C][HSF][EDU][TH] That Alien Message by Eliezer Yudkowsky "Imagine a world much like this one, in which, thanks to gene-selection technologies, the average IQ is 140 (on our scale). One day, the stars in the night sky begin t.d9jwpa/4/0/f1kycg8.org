Yeah it reminded me of that story too.

There's a fair few sci-fi stories on that premise. /Spin/ tries it with humans, /Permutation City/ goes off the rails because of it, pretty sure one of the petty robot tyrants of Stanis≈Çaw Lem's /Cyberiad/ orders one...

(The point Eliezer is making with it is original though, AFAIK.)
