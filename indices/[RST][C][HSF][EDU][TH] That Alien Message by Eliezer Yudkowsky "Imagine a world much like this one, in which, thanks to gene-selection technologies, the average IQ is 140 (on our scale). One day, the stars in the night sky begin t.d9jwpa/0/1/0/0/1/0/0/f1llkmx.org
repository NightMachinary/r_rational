Nanotech is just robotics on a smaller scale, and there's no particular reason you WOULDN'T want to be able to manipulate things on a very small level, given that a properly coordinated nanotech swarm is also a great way to manufacture your macrorobotics as well. You COULD start with macrorobotics first, I suppose, but if you're technologically advanced enough to do so, why not skip the extra step and push the "I win" button right away?

Unless by "robotics" you mean AI research? In that case, you have more of a point, but waiting a bit to try that is perhaps understandable given that THEY were (in a sense) rogue AIs themselves.
