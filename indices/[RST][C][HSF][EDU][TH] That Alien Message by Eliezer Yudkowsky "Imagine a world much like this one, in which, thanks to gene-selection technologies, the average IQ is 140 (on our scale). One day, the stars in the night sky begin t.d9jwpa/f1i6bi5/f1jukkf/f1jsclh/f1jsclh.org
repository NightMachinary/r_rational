Agreed that it's more entertaining and engaging, but there's a few things (e.g. what is being created in the bathtub) that only make sense if you've read the original.

"That Alien Message" stands alone better than "Starwink" does, but, assuming you've read both, "Starwink" is certainly the superior telling of the story. Which is not surprising, as the latter is told as a narrative and the former as a thought experiment.
