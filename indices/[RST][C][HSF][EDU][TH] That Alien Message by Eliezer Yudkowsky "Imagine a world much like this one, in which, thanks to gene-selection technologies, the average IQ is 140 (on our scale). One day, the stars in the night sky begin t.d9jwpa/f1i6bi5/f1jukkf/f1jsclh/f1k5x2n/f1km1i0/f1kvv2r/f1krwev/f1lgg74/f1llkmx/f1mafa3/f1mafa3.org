There's the sticking point.

I don't doubt that after all those years, humanity is that advanced. However:

- It doesn't look like the AI creators are that advanced
- The laws of physics outside of the simulation are different than those inside (e.g. five dimensions instead of four),
- You can perhaps infer some of those laws from the creators' knowledge beyond the ones they know themselves, but not /all/ of them, and
- Any experiments humanity does to either confirm or deny those laws of physics have to be done in creator-time, rather than simulation-time.

It's not my contention that it's a bad ending: just one that should have been explained better, as it wasn't as obvious what was going on as the author intended.
