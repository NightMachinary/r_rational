I realize that this is a thought experiment or whatever, but it is a remarkably unrealistic view of humanity. We all agree to surrender our freedom and go into cryo? We don't try to find bugs in the universe? We plan and execute a secret attack without trying to communicate? I don't see us ever having the unity this story displays, especially since it's not like smart people are more prone to unity.
