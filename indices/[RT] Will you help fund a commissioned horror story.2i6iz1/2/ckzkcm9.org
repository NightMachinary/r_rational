As I told you before, Kickstarter or indiegogo are great for funding single specific short-to-medium term projects, and such an idea is perfect. You've got a nice portfolio to use for consumer evaluation too.

If I were your editor, I'd with get at least a premise written up to sell the idea, and try for an indiegogo campaign.

If that failed, or even if it succeeded, a patreon subscription would likely help you more in the long-term. If you have a lot of ideas, you could have subscribers make non-binding suggesting votes to give you a basic idea of how appealing each story idea is to the audience, and help you pick which to focus on next.
