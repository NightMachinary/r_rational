I'd put in $5 but prefer a more automated way to pay; from this I think it might be possible that you're shooting yourself in the foot by asking for a personal commitment. (Coming up against social anxieties, people feeling singled out/put on the spot, plus having to pay later is /more/ of a commitment, not less. It's not like anybody here distrusts your ability to deliver. [I presume.])

I wonder if there's a site where you can run micro-kickstarters. Maybe something like a bounties site? I think Patreon is trying to go that way, but it's not really best for one-offs.

[edit] I don't think Kickstarter has a minimum, and there seem to be a bunch of $100-$1000 projects. Not sure if that would be too much effort for you/for the occasion? I don't think every Kickstarter needs to be a professionally-designed /campaign/.

[edit] Maybe wait and see if people agree with this comment or not. (People: if you agree, or disagree, please comment! Your voice matters!)
