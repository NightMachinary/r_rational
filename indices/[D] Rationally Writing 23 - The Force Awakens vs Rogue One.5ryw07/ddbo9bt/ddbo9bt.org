To add to some of your remarks about the quintuple geocide in The Force Awakens (and the Stalin quote):

Fiction is an illusion that we willingly participate in.

If I open up the newspaper, and read, "Bob Smith died in a car crash," that's an objective fact. If I open up a novel, and read on page 1, "Bob Smith died in a car crash," that's objectively non-factual. It is a fiction. And because it's a fiction, I can't say that it's objectively a good or bad thing. What matters in a novel isn't the objective facts (because there are none; this is fiction); what matters here is my subjective experience. "My subjective experience is the most important thing" is something that isn't true of reality, but it is arguably true of fiction.

If Bob Smith is a real person, then his death is objectively a bad thing whether I knew him or not. The universe doesn't need me to "believe" that Bob Smith died for that to be true. However, if Bob Smith is a character in a fictional story, my belief is a reader is arguably the only thing that matters.

If Bob Smith dies on page 150 of a novel, and pages 1 through 149 are spent portraying Bob Smith as a person whose behavior is consistent with what I've identified as human behavior, then when I read, "Bob Smith died in a car crash," that's an objectively non-factual, but I have an experience that is subjective. I know that Bob Smith didn't /really/ die, because he never actually existed. However, I've bought into the the idea that Bob Smith is a person, and as such, I can subjectively experience Bob's death as though he were a real person, or at least an approximation of one. If he dies on page 150, that effect is probably much stronger than if he died on page 1. And if he dies in book 5 of a long-running series where I've spent a lot of time getting to know about Bob's various personality quirks and who he is as a character, the impact is probably going to be greater, because the more I read about Bob, the more I allow myself to be "convinced" of the fiction that "Bob Smith is a person."

The deaths of real people don't have to be "justified" in this way, because I already know that they're real. I can objectively say that a hundred Chinese people dying in an industrial accident is worse than my neighbor dying, and nobody has to take the time to convince me that "hey, those people who died in China are real people, just like your neighbor," because I already know/believe that. But for me to "believe" the fictional death of people on a movie screen, that requires a bit of self-deception. I'm going to willingly suspend my disbelief to a certain extent, but the filmmaker has to meet me halfway. If you say, "Bam, five planets were just destroyed, and that's terrible," in my view, you haven't done a proper job of meeting me halfway; that's putting the burden entirely on my suspension of disbelief, and I can only offer so much of that, especially as we get closer to the end of the meaning. (You don't have to "earn" a beginning, but you do have to earn a climax.) I didn't even know that these planets /existed/, so how could they possibly feel real? In Star Wars (A New Hope), I don't really know much about Alderaan, but the first half of the movie has done a good job of convincing me that Princess Leia is a person, and so when I see her sadness, that makes the destruction of Alderan feel "real" in a way that the 5-planet destruction in The Force Awakens didn't.

To get more at the Stalin quote, "A single death is a tragedy; a million deaths is a statistic:"

One way to interpret this is literally: increasing the scope of the destruction causes us to feel less bad about it. By this logic, if TFA's "tragedy" had involved the destruction of only 3 planets instead of 5, it would have been "more tragic." But I don't think that the integer really has anything to do with it. I think that the Stalin quote is actually something that you can derive from the idea that "specificity is truth."

If you tell me, on page 1, "Timmy died," that's going to make me less sad than if you told me, "Timmy, who loved reading fantasy novels and was about to start the sixth grade, died one afternoon when a congenital respiratory condition caused his lungs to collapes inside of his chest." The second one is "sadder" because it is more specific. The quintuple geocide in TFA feeling less impactful than the death of a specific character. However, I'd argue that this has to do more with specificity than actual quantity.

Consider the two following statements:

#+begin_quote
  Bob Smith died last Tuesday.
#+end_quote

or

#+begin_quote
  Twelve million people died on Alderanian. Children, their parents, and those without families. Alderaan was home to many: some loyal to the Empire, some sympathetic to the rebels, and many indifferent to the political situation, instead focused more on the difficulties of their own lives. An entire planet full of people, each with their own personal ambitions, half of them sleeping and hidden from the light of their sun, the other half scurrying about, trying to fulfill their own personal ambitions the moment that the planetary death ray hit. All of those people, each ready to forge another day of pleasures or regrets, they were all silenced in a single instant.
#+end_quote

If you'll forgive the second of these for being a bit overwrought, which would you say is more "sad?" I'd go with the latter, which would contradict the idea that "one death is sadder than a million."

Now, obviously, the larger the scope, the harder it is to make it specific. And if we're given zero contextual details, it's easier for us to picture the death of one person than it is to picture the death of a million people, hence one feeling more "real" (or "specific") than the other. And even when we do provide details, it's easier for us to make the death of one person feel more personal and intimate and specific than the death of millions. However, it's not as simple as, "Larger number of people died, therefore it's less sad." If the movie had spent more time explaining the stakes to me, or even given me any time to comprehend the fact that "Hey, these are five planets, all teeming with life and people who have lives," the quintuple geocide would have had more impact.

I also feel obliged to mention that there is nothing inherently tragic about planetary destruction. I mean, many planets are destroyed all of the time in our own galaxy whenever a star goes supernova (or any other number of celestial phenomena occur), and we don't get particularly torn up about that. The destruction of a planet is only sad to the extent that we care about what (or who) is on that planet. Once we comprehend that the planet is home to a population of people (lives that we regard as having value), then it becomes a tragedy, but until we really comprehend that fact, the destruction of the planet itself doesn't have any real impact.
