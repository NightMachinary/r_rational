Good points. I also often find the space battles frustrating when considering the axis they take place on: you always see these ships lined up in a visually pleasing way, with the star destroyers all facing the same direction or at least in the same rotation, while the Rebel force ships do the same thing on the opposite side... like they're tanks that are all on the ground and have to cover the distance between them head-on, rather than, I don't know, attacking them from above? Or below? Or behind?

Granted this is probably a bit of awareness that growing up on books like Ender's Game and playing /X-Wing vs TIE Fighter/ helps in, but it's hard to unsee just how unimaginative the writers/directors are for space battles.
