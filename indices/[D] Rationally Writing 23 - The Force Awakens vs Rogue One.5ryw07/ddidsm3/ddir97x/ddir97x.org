  I was expecting this to have a little less Star Wars fan perspective and a little more writer and rationalist perspective... Or that Rogue One's first few acts are troubled: I came into the episode agreeing, but came out without understanding it any differently.
#+end_quote

Very fair criticism, we'll definitely try to keep to more of a rationalist analysis in future reviews :) Since the editing was kept to a minimal and no one seems to mind that, maybe we can let the episodes go even longer and allow us more time to get into more of those deeper discussions.

  Since you asked for leads: both the Alien and the Matrix franchises could be fertile ground

Great ideas! There's definitely a lot to unpack in the Matrix series, both for what it did so well and what went terribly, terribly wrong.

  Also, I have to say I disagree with you on the use of Vader. I rather disliked his appearance at the end. He was there to contain the plans and there's a guy holding out a disk in the room with him, and he simply doesn't notice. He Force-pulls half a dozen guns at once but fails to pull on the disk when he's reaching the end of the room and it's in plain sight. It doesn't sit right with me.

Oh that definitely bothered me too, but I kind of assumed that it was out of his range. It's never made quite clear how far people can reach with force pulling. Does it have to be line of sight? Is it harder to "grasp" it if it's moving? I often wondered in Empire Strikes Back why Vader didn't just grab Luke when he lets himself plummet in Cloud City.

The novel of Rogue One at least shows that he tried:

  The security door opened a mere crack and rebel hands shoved the tape through. Vader reached through life and matter and air and by will alone he /pulled/. He fueled his will with rage and fear and need. It was enough to tear the rebel from the door and drop him at Vader's feet.

  But it was not enough to claim the tape.
#+end_quote

But I agree that while watching it it seemed strange that he wouldn't do so. Either way, emotionally I think the scene worked very well to portray Vader as an implacable force. If they just made the soldier with the plans farther along the corridor, out of sight, that probably would have helped.

  On another level, A New Hope opens with stormtroopers breaching the ship and taking losses as they exchange blasterfire, but now we know that just minutes before Vader was an overwhelming force all on his own, so why didn't he take point on the boarding action?
#+end_quote

Maybe he was recharging his force batteries. Or his literal batteries, come to think of it :P
