I was expecting this to have a little less Star Wars fan perspective and a little more writer and rationalist perspective. For example, at one point Alexander mentioned that the scene on Han's freighter with the monsters and smugglers was weak but didn't elaborate, where to me that's an opportunity to consider things like why that scene exists or became a weak one, and what alternatives could have made it stronger or no longer necessary for the story. Or that Rogue One's first few acts are troubled: I came into the episode agreeing, but came out without understanding it any differently.

I guess I think of your show as being about exploration of and advice for storytelling from the rational perspective, and felt this conversation walked away from that ground a bit. Not to say it was absent, of course, between The Force and Idiot Balls and more. Overall I really enjoyed the episode and would definitely like to hear others like it. Since you asked for leads: both the Alien and the Matrix franchises could be fertile ground, Paprika and Inception invite comparison, and I wonder about comparing/contrasting authors with suitably adjacent work but have no examples in mind.

Also, I have to say I disagree with you on the use of Vader. I rather disliked his appearance at the end. He was there to contain the plans and there's a guy holding out a disk in the room with him, and he simply doesn't notice. He Force-pulls half a dozen guns at once but fails to pull on the disk when he's reaching the end of the room and it's in plain sight. It doesn't sit right with me. On another level, A New Hope opens with stormtroopers breaching the ship and taking losses as they exchange blasterfire, but now we know that just minutes before Vader was an overwhelming force all on his own, so why didn't he take point on the boarding action?
