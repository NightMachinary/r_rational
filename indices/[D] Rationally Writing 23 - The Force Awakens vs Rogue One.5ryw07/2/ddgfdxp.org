One thing that you both didn't bring up, but that reliably annoys me, are the battle tactics employed by the good and bad guys both.

They always tend to be astonishingly bad in any science fiction movies or TV shows.

If something takes place in our current time, the directors/producers generally get professional advice from actual military or SWAT personnel. Sometimes the background SWAT teams are even played by actual real-life SWAT teams. That gives it a plausibility that is missing in Sci-Fi.

If the characters use lasers, all of that apparently doesn't matter anymore. It's not impossible to think about for a few minutes "How would people fight against opponents with these futuristic weapons?"

Everyone else in the theater is enjoying themselves because of the lasers and explosions and I'm just screaming in my head for characters to get in cover or try to outflank the enemy.

Same thing applies to space battles. Just emulate actual WW1/2 sea or air battles if you want something more visually appealing than what realistic space battles would be, that's fine. But they're not even doing that. They're fighting space battles like 5-year-olds play-act them.
