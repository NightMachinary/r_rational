  I'm hoping there's going to be a scene in Episode 8 where Kylo Ren starts to go into one of his violent tantrums (as seen in Episode 7), but then masters himself and crosses into cold, calculating rage. Basically, make the Dark Side Limit Break sociopathy (just as the Light Side Limit Break is equanimity).

That would be pretty awesome, yeah. Kind of like the Avada Kedavra 2.0.
