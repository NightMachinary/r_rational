Well said. This particularly is something that could have used more explanation:

  If you'll forgive the second of these for being a bit overwrought, which would you say is more "sad?" I'd go with the latter, which would contradict the idea that "one death is sadder than a million."

Usually what it boils down to is just how much detail and time did we spend with them. It's easier to make a single character feel more real, but it's absolutely possible to make the loss of a whole planet feel more impactful, but it requires getting to know the "civilization" or "race" through constant contact and caring for individuals in it, even if none of the individuals are known as much as an individual character might be. All the smaller interactions add up to a wider feeling of empathy.
