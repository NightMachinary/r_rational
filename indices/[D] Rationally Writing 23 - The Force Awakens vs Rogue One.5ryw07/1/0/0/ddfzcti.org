My take on Kylo Ren is that he's basically the doubting evil character. Since the Force is nebulous faith-based space magic, the fact that he is in conflicted greatly lessens his power.

I'm hoping there's going to be a scene in Episode 8 where Kylo Ren starts to go into one of his violent tantrums (as seen in Episode 7), but then masters himself and crosses into cold, calculating rage. Basically, make the Dark Side Limit Break sociopathy (just as the Light Side Limit Break is equanimity).

It'd make a nice parallel to Rey's training under Luke, and would provide character development which is otherwise going to be hard to come by ("We sent him away to be trained in evil, and he came back slightly more angry than he left!").

I just really hope they don't end the series with Kylo Ren being redeemed. I suppose that good has to triumph in the end, but let him fight to the death for his beliefs rather than be persuaded. Because honestly, if he gets persuaded by Finn or Rey after rejecting and killing his own damn father and then going to Evil-Space-Wizard Camp, they've completely undercut the character they set up in the first movie.
