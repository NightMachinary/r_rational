Some interesting ideas. I disagree that viewers/readers are constantly predicting the future and updating their predictions, that this is a part of the story telling experience. If anything, the current trend of fast paced, dialogue-light blockbusters that can be consumed agnostically by anyone in the world is proof against it. They are pure Id/system 1 experience, no thinking or forethought required.

But I do like world building for its own sake, i.e. not just in service to a narrative, so I'll check out your podcast.
