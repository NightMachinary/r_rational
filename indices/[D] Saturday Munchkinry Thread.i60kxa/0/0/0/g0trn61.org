If it weren't for the distracting OCD aspect of it, it would be superhuman. With the distracting OCD, it comes out to peak savant human. So to use the word scramble example, you could solve it nearly instantly, except you would be distracted by the imperfection of the wood pulp that makes up the newspaper it is printed on and by the improper arrangement of the crossword puzzle hints and so you would only end up being able to solve it with savant speed and not obviously supernatural speed.

The time can be as short as a 30 second elevator pitch (for someone in an already vulnerable state of mind or life circumstances) to as long as 15-30 minutes (for a healthy, happy person actively resisting but still choosing to listen to you). As long as they aren't talking loud enough to block out what you are saying to them it should work. Over the phone works as long as you have a vague idea of who you are talking to. Voice modulator works but is slightly slower/less effective. Prerecording is unreliable, proportionate to how far in advance it is prerecorded and if you have a vague idea of the target (5 minutes in advance works almost as normal, several hours in advance is unreliable). Choosing the right time to stop talking is tricky, often you may think you stopped early enough only for the person to commit suicide anyway. But if you do manage to get the sweet spot of enough to affect your target but not enough that they kill themselves, they will be in a vulnerable and depressed state of mind for a few days.

You automatically and unconsciously adjust your suicide talk to whoever is listening. This is why it doesn't work on more than 3 people, too many people at once and nothing about it resonates with any single one of them enough.
