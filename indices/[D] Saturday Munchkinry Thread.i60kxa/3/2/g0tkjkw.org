This is oddly specific and I didn't watch friends very much to have a good gauge of their characters. It's still an interesting question for all sorts of stories though (including Mother of Learning, funnily enough. What would Zorian do if he started back at the first loop he remembers and Red Cloak/nobody else remembers what he's done?).
