Northern Caves Munchkinry. The Northern Caves is a several thousand page “bargain-bin Finnegans Wake” consisting of a mix of gibberish, odd puns,surreal short stories full of grammatical errors, fragments of stories, and possibly a few encoded cyphers. By reading from it out loud, continuously, until an altered state of conscious is reached, you can gain several temporary abilities along with several side-effects.

Practice and the right drugs can possibly speed up entry to the altered state. In the first instance you know of it took around a day or two of reading with sleep deprivation, hunger, caffeine, and ADHD medication to enter the state.

The primary power, which has the shortest duration is to convince people to commit suicide. When you target someone with this ability, your words are strangely resonant with your target, seemingly random guesses on your part seem like deep insight to your target, and your target will feel a mix of overwhelming depression, disassociation. and intrusive thoughts. This power wears off after 1-3 usages, a few hours, or when you fall asleep, whatever comes first. It doesn't work on groups only up to around 3 people. It isn't absolutely guaranteed to work, for instance person who is already heavily depressed might be less susceptible. A target that refuses to listen to you at all, for instance covering their ears and making noise is entirely safe, although once they start listening to you it is very hard to stop.

The secondary power/side effect is an intense awareness of and aesthetic sense for spatial positioning and arrangement. The feeling is like an uncontrollable OCD and lasts until you get sleep.

As a tertiary effect, you experience strong synchronicity although the actual objective measurable effect is hard to disentangle from the subjective experience of the altered state of consciousness.

So ways to exploit these powers?
