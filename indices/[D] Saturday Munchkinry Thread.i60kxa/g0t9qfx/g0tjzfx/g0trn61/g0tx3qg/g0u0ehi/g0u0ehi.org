I thought of a few more uses... based on your questions.

If you had minions capable of physically stopping someone from committing suicide, you could use induce the urge to commit suicide in your target, then physically restrain them and wait for the suicidal urges to wear off, taking advantage of their vulnerability in the meantime to indoctrinate them into a cult. If anyone tries to leave your cult, let them, then call them up a few days/weeks later and use your power. When they commit suicide, use that to intimidate your cult into obedience.

For the code example or mathematics in general you would need a spatial/physical/tactile representation of the problem. You then keep a specialized room prepared which has already been optimized to reduce the downsides of your OCD. Setup your problem, go into your altered state, then rapidly solve the problem in the physical setup, sleep it off, then reverse engineer the physical solution back to math notation.
