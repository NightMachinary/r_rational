Is the spatial sense superhuman, or do I just get Fung Shui OCD until I sleep? Like could I solve word scrambles incredibly fast? How long does it take to suicide someone? Do I just say "Die" with the right inflection that it makes them want to, or does it take like half an hour or more to convince them? Do they do any talking while I convince them? Can I convince them over the phone? What if I'm using a voice modulator? If it's a one-way conversation, can I choose a target and prerecord it? If so does it have any effect at all on anyone else? If it's not just saying "die" to someone, what happens if I only go most of the way, but then stop talking instead of following through?
