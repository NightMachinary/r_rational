Thank you this is very useful. The thing is, when you give it tools their abilities break. If for instance I give it a 350N and apply it to a 3g lead bullets, I get a high powered rifle.

So I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong, I'm using a basic force equation. F=m*a, compared the values I got from rifles and the rifles seem to generate less force than thrower does with his arms.

I'm probably using the wrong formula, converting something incorrectly or messing up some unit. Because otherwise my numbers make little sense.
