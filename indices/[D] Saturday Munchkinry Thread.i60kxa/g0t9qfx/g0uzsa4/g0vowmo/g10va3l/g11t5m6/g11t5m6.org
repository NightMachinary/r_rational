It's learning that's the problem.\\
Consciousness is part of a vast sub-realm web related to magic, learning things about the world and how it works integrates a person further into the web. Normally this isn't that noticeable as people are learning small things. But someone in our characters position who is learning fundamental truths that govern the entire nature of the world... that lights up like a beacon to someone who is looking specifically for "brighter than usual" occurrences as its a thing well known to happen to new arrivals.\\
For example, when they learned magic was actually real is this place, that was like a flare gun in the middle of the night.
