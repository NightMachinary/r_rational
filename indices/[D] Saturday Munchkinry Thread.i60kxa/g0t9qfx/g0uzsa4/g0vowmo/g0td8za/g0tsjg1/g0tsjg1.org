I see things going their way, until reality ensues.

Ross and Rachel are dating from the very beginning of the show. Chandler quits his job as he knows he hates it. Monica and Chandler start dating. Monica quits her job as a waitress, confident that her chef skills will land her a job. Phoebe tries to find Mike, her younger brother, and her mother. Joey is happy.

Ross, unlike the others, keeps his current job going because he loves doing it, not because it's leading to something better. Of course, this means he leaves for the trip to China at the end of season 1, where he meets Julie again, and realizes why he fell in love with her to begin with. This time though, he already knows Rachel's the one he loves, and decides to cut off all contact with her, lightly changing the course of his career, a pattern which occurs time and time again (as with Charlie), leading him to new roadblocks in academia, and coupled with the abject redundancy of his current field, decides to use his future knowledge to excavate sites of future archaeological interest, effectively taking him away from Rachel and the rest of the group for extended periods of time.

Rachel slowly falls out of love with Ross, as she finds flames of the past that she's now emotionally mature enough to handle, and coupled with the fact that Emma's effectively dead, the two go on another "break", prompting Ross to dive into his work, isolating him from the group. Rachel applies to work at Ralph Lauren, and gets in. She uses her future knowledge to advance up the corporate ladder rapidly, forcing on her much higher expectations than she's used to, as a young "prodigy". She becomes disillusioned with fashion design and burns out, using the money she'd saved to live alone in the apartment she and Ross had rented.

Monica finds good work as a chef, and her relationship with Chandler remains solid for the next 10 years. However, they're still unable to conceive a child, and can't find an adoption agency that doesn't find them too young and inexperienced. Their lives are comfortable, yet missing an element they both desperately want. Chandler falls into a mild depression as he finds himself unable to give his wife a happy life. They finally adopt in 2002.

Joey lands Dr. Drake Remoray again, and this time is more level-headed in dealing with people. He gets better and better jobs, and eventually moves into a classier section of the city, and slowly loses touch with the others, only meeting now for holidays, which are incredibly joyous occasions.

Phoebe finds her family, but spooks Mike away. Miserable, she finds David, who she then forms a relationship with. They get married in 1998, and spend the next few years together, until the date of her actual wedding in the original timeline, when she feels so guilty about giving up on Mike that she leaves David, and eventually adjusts to a new modicum of happiness with her brother, mother, and three cats (her brother's).

Ross eventually comes back from exploration permanently in 2003, as he can no longer rely on his future knowledge to keep him going. His relationship with Rachel is heavily strained, and he's been away so long that he no longer really recognizes the people the others have become, and moves in with Joey (both of them are very rich now, but they want the company).

On the night of May 6, 2004, the last day they lived in the original timeline, they get together again, all six of them properly, for the first time in years.

And Ross, being the largest friend, eats the other five, fulfilling that ancient prophecy.
