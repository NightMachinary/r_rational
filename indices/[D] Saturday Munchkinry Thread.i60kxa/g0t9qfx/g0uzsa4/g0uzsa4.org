Any tips on how to limit the force a clay golem can generate per second total to move and do useful things without giving it the ability to focus all the force on a small area to create a fake firearm.

​

And how would you describe that limitation on a medieval setting. e.g as much power as a horse?

​

Or as I suspect limiting it this way will be too difficult to explain, how else would you limit a golem's strength on a hard magic setting ?

​

Assuming the ability to create golems is an inherent ability of a mage and not a constructed object that can be powered externally, how would you limit it's usage while still having it be useful? I was thinking maximum force per second output and a maximum daily force output that amounts to 30min of maximum force per second. But it's kind of difficult to explain in a medieval setting. Any ideas for this ?
