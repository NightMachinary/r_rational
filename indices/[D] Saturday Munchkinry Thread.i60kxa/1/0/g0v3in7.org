Limit the force by volume of clay and have the force evenly distributed throughout the volume of clay. The force can only act on the clay itself. This will prevent exploits like the firearm. To prevent shape-shifting exploits the force pee unit volume of clay gets a multiplier/bonus when the clay is in an overall humanoid shape and when it exerts force consistent with a humanoid's means of exerting force.

To explain in medieval speak... an educated medieval person will have a concept of weight and density (although not necessarily of mass as separate from weight) and force is basically just weight. They should also have a basic idea of proportion and ratios even if they lack education on the full algebraic notation. So “Unformed, clay of the golem exerts strength just sufficient to match its own weight, move slowly, and maintain its shape. Furthermore, when given or allowed to assume the shape of man, the clay gains the addition of strength in imitation of man. The clay can exert its full strength for around half an hour, and then must rest for a day to recover its full strength. This time it can exert its strength is proportional to that strength exerted, if allowed to operate at half strength it can operate for a full hour, one quarter strength two hours, and so forth. A wise golem mage will carefully gauge the task so as to ensure sufficient time is allowed for the strength required before setting the golem to it.”
