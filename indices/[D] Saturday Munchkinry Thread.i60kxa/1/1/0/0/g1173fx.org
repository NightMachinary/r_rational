You're also assuming he can project himself at his maximum psi without stopping. That's the same thing as assuming the only thing limiting how hard our muscles can contract is their breaking point.

Just set a hard limit on the acceleration of the clay, say maybe 25 m/s^{2.} Google says a fast boxer can punch around 9m/s, so use that as a gage for how fast you want your golem to be able to punch in a humanoid form (assuming that's the max speed and you want a punch to be about as fast as a human punch which takes ~.25s, your avg punch acceleration is about 40 m/s^{2,} but golems are slow and heavy and lumbering so I would turn it down) could get around that by forming its arm into a sling, but hey--that is going to put a lot of pressure on the throwing arm. Better stay under that 3N/mm^{2} limit or else it'll fail.

So now you have a pressure limit to keep the golem from just hyucking boulders (where speed doesn't really matter) and an acceleration limit to prevent it from being a gun.

I'd also cap it's max velocity well below a full second of acceleration, personally, because 40 m/s is hella fast (getting into fastball speeds). So maybe 25-40 m/s^{2} acceleration that can only be maintained for 0.25s before topping out.

As far as legs this would make the golem about half as good at jumping as a human (google says we near 20 m/s^{2} during the fastest acceleration of a standing jump, although it's obviously not constant through the jump). That's fine for me since the golem can accelerate for far longer than a human; it can just keep extending its legs at its max acceleration until the cross section becomes too narrow to support pushing its mass at that acceleration.

Overall at these numbers a golem would totally physically overmatch a normal peak human, but most of that would come from its presumably large mass and ability to form clubs and attack from weird angles at speed.

It would be able to throw rocks really well, good enough to use as projectile weapons, but not as fast as an arrow or sling.

One issue I haven't solved is that it can still throw often, like a pitching machine. You could also limit that on a cognitive basis -- calculating trajectory and moving projectiles through the body and aiming all at once takes a lot of processing power, and the construct may only be able to do one throw every few seconds. Lord knows my 18mo son takes like 6 seconds to throw a ball and it goes straight up or backwards like 30% of the time.

Edit to add: you aren't doing anything wrong with the force equation. Bullets are fired with a relatively tiny amount of force, much less than a punch. If they fired with the force of a punch, the shooter would be taking all of thar force in his shoulder with every shot.

The magic of firearms comes from the ability to nearly instantly generate a huge amount of pressure (upwards of 60000 psi for a .308 round) behind a small, dense projectile. Because the equation for kinetic energy is KE=mv^{2} you are going to have a very energetic projectile, even though the force is low.
