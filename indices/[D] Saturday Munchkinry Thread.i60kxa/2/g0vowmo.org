Help me out here people (if you want too) :)

Here is the restrictions a character is under early in a story I've been drafting for almost 2 years.\\
* They know almost nothing about the world they have found themselves in other than of the 4 people they met out in the wilds, 3 tried to kill them, the fourth being the helpful one that told them the following things.\\
* There will be many people looking for an Arrival like our character. Dangerous People. Scrying magic is extremely potent in this world, so much so that every piece of information our character learns is a 'connection event' that a Scry could increase its location resolution on.\\
* They don't know the language/s or writing of this world, they are only able to communicate due to a Direct Meaning spell their helpful friend is currently maintaining, which they will not be able to keep up all the time, as again, that is a specific thing that others could Scry for.

- Knowing these limits, and that your helpful friend was reluctant to tell you even this much because of the danger. What questions would you absolutely need to ask anyway?\\
  I want to check the characters decisions are reasonable given these outlandish and highly restrictive limits.
