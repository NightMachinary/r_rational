With robotics and enough time, you could rig anything in your wizard castle to move and act on your voice, gesture, position - or on the input of hidden sensors tracking people and objects in and around the area. Make doors and window shutters open and close (and lock/unlock). Make parts of the floor, walls, and ceiling move. Have objects float through the air (autonomous robocopters with fake shells). Have your drawbridge raised and lowered by "invisible servants".

Make water of any temperature flow from a dozen different places. Using delivery drones, concealed chutes, and [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWsMdN7HMuA][retrofitted bases]] of things, have chests and barrels and assorted medium to large items move about the castle floors, appear in and disappear from unwatched rooms (even on different floors!), and so on. (More invisible servants!)

Retrofit a Big Dog with ceramic plating and you have a golem horse. Have remotely-controllable self-loading arbalests mounted on the battlements with wind and temperature sensors all over the outside of the castle and amongst the surrounding trees: they should be capable of puncturing a target twenty times a second at a range of a few hundred feet. Additionally, equip them with mirrors capable of focusing sunlight. And infrared targeting lasers. Capable of all being pointed at the same location.

Drone cargo blimp with transparent canopy and winched cargo pod. Not the fastest thing, but capable of transporting heavy loads (including yourself) to and from the castle under the cover of night. Bonus as it would not be hindered by harsh terrain or serpentine travel paths. Maybe even put some white aerogel in an irregular cloud shape inside it and around the pod, so in a pinch you could appear to 'summon a cloud', walk inside it, and have the 'cloud' carry you away on wizard business.
