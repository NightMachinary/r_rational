Information technology is roughly equivalent to an oracle/augury. A modern smartphone is on-par with a crystal ball in many ways, differing only in form factor. Especially so with speech recognition. You can ask what the weather will be like next week, you can make a medical diagnosis, etc. That's all with consumer-grade stuff. If you want to add in the sort of information that a spy satellite can give, we've got it better than almost any fictional crystal ball can do. We've also got distant messaging, whether that's with a smartphone, a walkie-talkie, or a CB radio.

Most of magic seems to be dressing it up, if what you want is to impress the locals.
