Rapid replication of written material, including binding into books. You could spit out the replicated contents of a king's, guild's, or monastery's entire library in hours, and the only difference would be the lack of gold leaf and the better-quality ink and paper. Not to mention that with a concealed pinhole video camera and/or high-resolution still image camera activated by tapping a Bluetooth finger ring (or concealed in a wizardly monocle or hat and able to pick up eye twitches), you could record any 'secret' or 'does not leave this room' lore, take high-rez photos of anywhere you walked, and with an autonomous drone, map entire towns/cities and the surrounding countryside to incredible precision.

You could be the only source of everyone else's proprietary information, plus the only source of accurate maps, plus be able to bring any city or town library up to standards that no-one had been able to match to that point.

Wear wizard-spectacles with a built-in HUD feeding from concealed drones in the area, and you can see everyone's roofs, track people moving around the entire town no matter where they (or you) are, and so on. Scatter disguised solar-powered microcameras around towns and you'd be able to review the comings and goings of everything going back months or years. Heck, with a lack of glass in most windows, you could fly a microdrone into any empty room and plant AV bugs under the furniture or on the ceiling - instant access to records of most 'secret' conversations amongst the wealthy and powerful.

Automatic textile manufacturing would make you the sole source of high-quality, relatively cheap cloth in large amounts. You would also be the sole source of artificial fabrics.

You would be more likely than the locals to be able to spot untapped sources of minerals, buy the land (or acquire mining rights), mine using automated mining machinery, and process the ore into refined materials and chemicals of unsurpassed quality. Even if you didn't want to upgrade the locals' weapons, you could supply chemical fertilizer, chemical cleaners, advanced (manual) farming equipment made from high-quality metals, and tools of all kinds for all industries and the average homestead.

The quality of goods in your area should take a sharp upswing, even those you are not personally producing, as you provide the capability to work faster and in higher precision with a range of materials, and information about improved methods and processes so that a craftsperson with "wizard tools" can also crank out masterwork toolsets which are an order or two of magnitude better quality than what they were using before.
