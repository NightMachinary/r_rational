You're not alone. I also feel this way. Even when I was a teenager, I was listening to a friend give his nihilism rant, and my end thought was "I agree with everything he says, but I don't know why this is supposed to depress me."

I'm afraid of death, that's for sure, but the lack of a grand cosmic meaning to life doesn't bother me at all.

I don't really have anything to add, just wanted to say you're not the only one who thinks this.
