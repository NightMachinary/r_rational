... I think you have a really skewed perception of religion? I mean, I don't remember exactly what I did in catechism, but it was mostly boring philosophy stuff, talking about that one time that one saint did something really great etc. I mean, it was probably completely opposed to the philosophy I have now, but so is every other institution, that's not enough for me to call it indoctrination. Nobody came to me and said "You will go to hell if you become a consequentialist!!!"

Also I remember that one time where we had to imagine which 3 items we would to take with us if we ended up on a deserted planet. I think we were supposed to say "the bible", but then I mentioned taking a computer with me and it derailed from there. ("Well *I'LL* take a magical mansion with *two* infinities of food and video games and all my friends!")
