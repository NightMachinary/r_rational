  Specifically, I feel that it is very hard to maintain a sense of optimism in a world void of meaning.

I'm starting to wonder if I'm a some sort of philosophy mutant because I see people making points like that and never understanding it.

EDIT: Okay, since I've had like ten millions "me too"s in the last 3 days, I'm going to guess this is just an uncommon position and not a weird brain mutation.

The basic idea of nihilism is "There's no deeper / higher meaning to be found". Every time I see someone mentioning nihilism (as in "this guy is a nihilist" or "I'm nihilist"), it's mentioned as a sad thing; like the idea that there's no higher order is an inherently bad thing.

And I almost never see someone just... be okay with it? I mean, personally speaking, I'm a bit unhappy with the whole "death" thing, but as far as philosophical / existential meaning go... I don't see any, and I don't feel the need to see any? I dunno. This whole subject weirds me out a bit.

  I also think that some religious practices, like meditation (and maybe prayer?) are legitimately helping people live a happier life, and generally feel better about themselves.

I'd be happy to change my mind, but so far I've seen no evidence that meditation is more than self-reporting errors plus regression towards the mean.
