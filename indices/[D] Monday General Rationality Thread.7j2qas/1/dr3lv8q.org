In the last Monthly recommendation thread, there was a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7hq84n/d_monthly_recommendation_thread/dqti48i/][recommendation]] for a podcast named "Harry Potter and the Sacred Text". The theme of the podcast is a little weird. It is a re-reading of Harry Potter, but they read it as if it were a sacred text (like the bible), and find deeper meaning in it.

The [[https://www.harrypottersacredtext.com/][podcast]] is actually very well done (it is very good technically, and there is a great chemistry between the hosts).

I'm usually quite cynical when it comes to spirituality. Obviously, J.K Rolling didn't intend all these layers of meaning when writing Harry Potter. However, listening to people discuss several spiritual themes (like Curiosity, Fear and Commitment) through the lens of this famous story is somehow very interesting for me, even a bit moving.

This leads me to a greater question: Is there such a thing as rational spirituality?

I sometimes feel like the secular life are missing some very important parts of human experience. Specifically, I feel that it is very hard to maintain a sense of optimism in a world void of meaning. (I remember reading somewhere that religious people are less likely to develop depression, and are generally more contend in their lives. Could anyone find a source on that?).

In addition, I think that the communities and family structures in the western secular culture are crumbling. These social structures seem important for our happiness, and it doesn't seem that we have built anything to replace them.

I also think that some religious practices, like meditation (and maybe prayer?) are legitimately helping people live a happier life, and generally feel better about themselves.

On the other hand - I find it very hard to identify with traditional religions. I feel like they force people to suppress their common sense, and ignore inconsistencies and falsehoods.

Is it possible to find meaning in a meaningless world, while still maintaining our rational thought processes?
