I enjoyed the University of Michigan's free [[https://www.coursera.org/learn/model-thinking][Model Thinking]] course so much. The idea of modelling things is so important that I wish everyone could be exposed to it.

I guess I'm also pretty stoked because it made a lot of things that I taught myself finally click, and I ended the course feeling like I gained a minor superpower when it comes to problem solving.
