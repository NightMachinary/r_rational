My first thought reading the summary:

#+begin_quote
  Models. Evidence shows that people who think with models consistently outperform those who don't. And, moreover people who think with lots of models outperform people who use only one.
#+end_quote

OKAY BUT IS THAT CORRELATION OR CAUSATION?

It does seem nice though. Do you know if it's available online?
