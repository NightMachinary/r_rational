I really, really like that article and the model it develops, but I think it's too simplistic to give accurate predictions of reality (the most visible argument is that it treats the different stages as strongly correlated, which doesn't have to be the case). I'll probably revisit it when I have time to do serious philosophy; I'll hit you up then.

There's definitely a "n-1 => n => n+1" pattern of

- "All is X"

- "There doesn't have to be X"

- "There is /some/ X"

to be found in a lot of philosophy.

(that's actually a really neat way to put it, now that I think about it)
