As already written I don't think the pendulum metaphor is perfect. But it does abstract better over your second point. That n can confuse n-1 with n+1. Because in a pendulum both n-1 and n+1 would be on the same side. That (independent from the pendulum metaphor) could explain why most people think of rationalists as "cold" or "selfish" (asuming most rationalists are on 4 and most other people are on 3).

Your blurry image metaphor is also interesting. It better abstracts over the stages getting more complex. But it is linear.

I don't know a better metaphor which abstracts over all these points unfortunately.

But Kegan himself thinks his theory has some flaws:

The book "Psychotherapy as a Developmental Process" which Kegan calls: "the closest thing we have to a 'unified field theory' for psychotherapy" sounds interesting. I probably should give it higher priority on my reading list.
