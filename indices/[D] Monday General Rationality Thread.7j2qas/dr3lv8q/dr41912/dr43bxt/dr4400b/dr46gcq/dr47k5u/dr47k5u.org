Ugh, I'm having French class flashbacks. That's not a pleasant thing.

Seriously though, I can't quite say "Yes, I was describing this" or "No I wasn't", because I get the feeling two people reading this wikipedia article could get wildly different understandings of what thesis-antithesis-synthesis is.

What the vividness.live article you linked says, which blew my mind the first time I read it, is that for a lot of philosophical concepts, people go through the following stages:

- Not knowing about / believing in the concept

- Thinking the concept is everywhere

- "Transcending" the concept, seeing where it is and where it isn't.

Ex: Morality is absolute -> There's no reason believe in a higher morality, every position could be valid -> Okay, morality isn't absolute; but in most situations it may as well be; however, thinking of it as relative can be more productive in other situations.

The interesting points here are:

- Each stage is utterly incompatible with the previous stages. You can't be both a moral absolutist and a moral existentialist.

- If your "current stage" is n, you can easily confuse n-1 and n+1.

- Each stage is more complex than the previous one; in fact, each stage "contains" the previous one; a n can understand a n-1, but a n-1 can't understand a n.

This is the most important part. In that framework, your beliefs aren't a pendulum that swings on a linear axis towards an ideal value (so the only possible directions are "more X" or "less X"); they're more like a blurry image that gets a better resolution over time. Stage n-1 is "everything is white", stage n is "there's some black!", stage n+1 is "it's mostly white".

The article then naturally tries to apply this pattern everywhere, which is where it starts to lose me.
