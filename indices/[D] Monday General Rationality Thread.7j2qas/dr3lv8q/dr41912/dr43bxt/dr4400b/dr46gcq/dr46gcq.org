You seem to describe Hegels thesis - antithesis - synthesis. Interesting theory to describe things after the fact, but can be misleading when trying to predict things. I am not the biggest fan of Hegel.

But now that I think about it I often have imagined the stages as some sort of pendulum swinging back and forth with decreasing distance. Maybe I should rethink that.

Oh and Kegan is a developmental psychologist not a philosopher but I don't really know very well how psychology research works. Maybe the difference is not that big.
