I mean given religions do have pretty good success in permanently imbuing most of their members with a litany of specific supernatural beliefs in lieu of any evidence it's hard not to call that indoctrination.

  Nobody came to me and said "You will go to hell if you become a consequentialist!!!"

Sure nobody may have said that directly, but I'm pretty sure that would still implicitly be true given the church canon, since it would qualify as heresy. I mean they don't don't have to be too explicit with fear-mongering about hell in order for that fear to be there implicitly given the implications of the teachings.

The point though was that religion imbuing ideas of god granting life meaning (and thus meaning being a very significant thing) seem like they would almost certainly be part of standard religious indoctrination. After all I do hear an awful lot of ex-christians talking about that, and bringing up having to grapple with a lack of meaning after deconversion.
