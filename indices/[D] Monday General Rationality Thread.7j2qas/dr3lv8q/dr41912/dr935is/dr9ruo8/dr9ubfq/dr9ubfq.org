Then it seems sort of unusual that you can't imagine the existence of "meaning" being something of particular importance. Like it really seems like something religion would indoctrinate into you if at all possible, thus lending some credence to the idea that you're a mutant.

Though given I think the weird idea of meaning is something humans are predisposed to, but don't get unless they're indoctrinated. It could be that your particular religious upbringing wasn't very thorough in following standard indoctrination procedure or something like that.
