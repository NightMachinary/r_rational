I'm a mutant in that same way, out of curiousity were you ever religious? Because I suspect not being bothered by nihilism is sort of the default if you don't grow up with religion serving as a crutch.

I also find the whole idea of meaning weird because it's not even clear how life having "meaning" would even work. Like even were there a god I don't think that would actually solve anything. In that respect I think meaning is like objective morality, there's no possible world in which it would be a sensible concept and people seem to miss that the actual details of your world such as whether a god exist, are actually irrelevant here.
