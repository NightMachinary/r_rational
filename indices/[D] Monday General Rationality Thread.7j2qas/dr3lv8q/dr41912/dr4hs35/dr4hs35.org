  I'd be happy to change my mind, but so far I've seen no evidence that meditation is more than self-reporting errors plus regression towards the mean.

I don't know about religious style meditation, but there is a specific kind of meditation that has been studied and shown to produce very positive results in practitioners. It's simple:

1. Sit comfortably, with your eyes either closed or mostly closed (whichever you prefer)\\
2. Focus your attention on your breath\\
3. When you catch your mind wandering, gently bring your attention back to your breath\\

This does two things: trains your ability to focus, and trains your ability to observe your own thoughts without getting reeled in by them.

For example, if you think about dinner it might automatically set off a huge chain of thoughts related to what you're going to make, what ingredients you'll buy, what you're going to eat tomorrow, and whether or not you should start meal prepping because you heard it saves money, etc. Once you've had enough practice via meditation, it's like you have the ability to choose whether or not you engage with that line of thought. It's like a gives you a small buffer against random thoughts, and also random emotions. You can simply observe that you're angry, hungry, in pain, etc and the sting is lessened somewhat. This is especially good if you're depressed or anxious, because it can stop you from ruminating endlessly about painful subjects.
