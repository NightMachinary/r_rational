If you are already better at the skills that meditation teaches than the average person, then the heights reached by the average student will not impress you, since they are your baseline state. That's OK, since they are not the skills that you would say you gained, if you practiced. (Though you'll likely find that those things you can already do become less effortful.)

I'm pretty sure I fall into the "naturally good at meditation" camp myself, and can report that there is interesting and useful stuff beyond the "can notice that they're thinking" stage. (Useful: when I'm in practice, I'm better at paying attention to really small aspects of my experience - for the lulz, for design, or for changing how I feel about them.)
