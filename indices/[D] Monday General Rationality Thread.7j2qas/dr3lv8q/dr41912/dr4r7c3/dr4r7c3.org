It's not unique to you. I am such a mutant as well.

I never really saw the point of looking for a point to my existence. I just enjoy that I exist in the first place. The one thing that I never really understood from other people is that they think the idea that our complex lives emerge from very simple interactions at a much lower level somehow takes away meaning and beauty while I find order emerging like that to be a very beautiful thing.
