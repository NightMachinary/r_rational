This is a common theme I've heard from the authors in this community. The audience will sometimes fail to spot what they consider obvious hints (because the author has access to privileged information), but more importantly will also find 1,000 completely off-base links to justify any conceivable interpretation.

The correct answer will often rise to the top (e.g. because it fits more evidence, resonates thematically, or provokes retcons when the author sees what people are confused about), but until that selection process is finished you're looking at a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Library_of_Babel][Library of Babel]] situation.

In the case of a holy text, this selection process never finishes. The people interpreting it, and the world they live in, are too diverse and dynamic to ever settle on a single, majority answer. And it's looking unlikely that we'll get authorial clarification at this point, since their human authors are generally dead and their spiritual authors are some combination of non-interventionist and non-existent.

It sounds like this podcast is a good study in the ways that people ascribe meaning to random patterns. I'll have to give it a listen sometime.
