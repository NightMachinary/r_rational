I think I get what you're trying to say, but you're just misusing words.

"Racism" is usually agreed to mean "race-based discrimination that goes beyond 'this person of group X is statistically more likely to Y' types of assumptions and negatively affects people of group X beyond what they individually deserve".

When you say "good racism", what you communicate is "people of group X inherently deserve these negative effects"; whatever you're trying to say, find better words to say them.
