You will never convince me that any human being has any less value than others because of how they were born. Human suffering is something I will never tolerate or accept, particularly if it's at the hands of other humans.

I don't care what you believe, I care about what you do because of your beliefs. As far as I'm concerned, you are an enabler of evil and the fact that you draw the line somewhere does not make the other evils you tolerate any less harmful.
