  my morality dictates that racism is evil

Try thinking about the opposite side. Is it possible for an otherwise reasonable and good person to view racism as not evil?

The libertarian in me is okay with racism. That is to say I think people have every right to be racist. It can even be useful to an extent, inasmuch as "racism" is a heuristic shortcut for thinking about groups of people; it's lazy thought, and it has many pitfalls, but not intrinsically evil.

Maybe I should say it this way: racism is unacceptable, but not intolerable. From a pragmatic point of view, in order to achieve long-term goals, it's necessary to tolerate many things that are otherwise unacceptable. A quick and easy example: As a conservative, I find it unacceptable for Alabama to send a Democrat to the senate, but it is intolerable for them to send Roy Moore. Ideological purity be damned, I will not be associated with a child molester.
