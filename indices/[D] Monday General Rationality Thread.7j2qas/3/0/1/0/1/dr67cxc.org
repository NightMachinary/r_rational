  But once you given them a common enemy, one who tells them that white people are evil and must be exterminated, they group together and lash out

That's not true. If a group wants to find a common enemy, they'll find one, no matter what the "enemy" thinks. Saying "antifa led to the rise of white nationalism" is like saying "the jews led to the rise of national-socialism". That's empirically true, but it's a really, really skewed way to describe things.

  We have never lived in a society where racism was completely extinct, but we sure were a lot closer in the 90s where people tended to just ignored it and treated each other equally than we are today when we have to be all worried about whether people of this "other" group will get offended if we say certain words and aren't respectful enough of their "culture" that we aren't allowed to "appropriate." That just breeds resentment and alienation.

No. Just because you didn't see discrimination doesn't mean it wasn't there. The point of many identity politics movement is to say "You don't get to pretend our suffering doesn't exist". By your metrics, things were better in the 90s when we didn't have so many controversies about gay marriage.
