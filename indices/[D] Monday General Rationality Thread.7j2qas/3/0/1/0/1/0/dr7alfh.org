No, the point of most identity politics movements is to promote their own identity politics movement as a memetic institution. Every problem that is classified as a race problem gives their movement more power and influence over how much control they have in society, and so they are heavily incentivized to classify every problem as a race problem even when it's not, or has a small racial component but a much larger class or social component. In a world where these movements suceeded and racism went completely extinct, every black studies major would suddenly be unemployed, every political analyst who specializes in race would lose their career. That is, if it went extinct AND everyone knew that it had. This would give them a huge incentive to convince people that it wasn't extinct, that everything was still racist, and they would still be fighting for more power and special privileges.

If you did live in this world, would you notice? How do you know you aren't in it now? I don't think we are, but there's a continuum, and I think we're a lot closer than you think. The existence of these groups provides pretty much no evidence in either direction because it would exist in both worlds, and the majority of the issues faced by minorities are not caused by racism, and will not be solved by racial policies.
