So its imposible to persuade you that anybody that is a trump supporter is posible to persuade?(and you only know that he frequents that subreddit so you don't really know if he is a trump supporter). It's fine if you use being a trump supporter as some evidence of being someone you can't persuade, and take that as your prior ,but you seem to have an insanely high probability assigned to P(unreasonable|Trump supporter) that can't correspond to reality or be healthy to have. Your mental model of why other people support things things seems crazy(like all the people in the opposition where evil), and I don't think it reflects reality. His comments seem evidence that he's thinking carefully about things and and honest about his opinions, and he doesn't seem to be unreasonable. Right now by the information I'm getting from his and your comments on this thread I would assign higher probability of him being able to be convinced that he's wrong about anything politics related than you, especially if he was the one trying to convince you.
