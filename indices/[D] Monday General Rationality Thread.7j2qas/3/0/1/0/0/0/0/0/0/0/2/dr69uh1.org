Yudkowsky once wrote about what it would take for him to come to believe 2+2=3. He said that his confidence in the fact that 2+2=4 stemmed from the fact that every observation on the matter he's ever made has had that result, and if he woke up one day in bizarro-land where 2+2=3 he would begin to accumulate evidence against even such an 'inviolate' belief until he had no choice but to concede and change his mind.

What I'm saying is, to make sure your confidence here is not on the tier of dogma, could you describe for me what it would take to convince you otherwise? My fear here is that by becoming convinced that it is impossible to persuade a Trump supporter you have become yourself unpersuadable on the specific topic of Trump. Regardless of how right you are, being unpersuadable on any topic is in and of itself dangerous to rationality because, as you are no doubt well aware from your debates, a person can become unpersuadable regardless of whether they're right or wrong.
