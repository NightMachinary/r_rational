Okay, but hidden racism is, in pretty much all forms, massively less dangerous than overt racism, because it has to restrict itself in order to remain hidden. I don't think you can describe a group as oppressed if the people who dislike them have to hide that dislike for fear of being ostracized. So when I see two groups, one which contains a subset who hold hidden racist thoughts but can't express them or act on them publicly, and the other which is actively rioting, censoring speech, and controlling the media and academic instutitions to further and further extremes of political correctness, I'm going to focus my criticism on the second group, even if I dislike the first.
