I doubt hh26 is trying to "promote fascism" he just believes racism ins't a important problem. You are being really uncharitable whith him and I doubt you will convince people like him racism is a big problem that way. And it feels like you just saw that he disagrees whith you in something , and searched his comment history to see if he was a trump supporter to dismiss his ideas(you didn't necessarily do this , but saying it like that doent make you seem the rational person in the conversation) .

You don't seem to be in the best frame of mind today to discuss about this topic whith people that disagree whith you so I think you should calm down a bit.
