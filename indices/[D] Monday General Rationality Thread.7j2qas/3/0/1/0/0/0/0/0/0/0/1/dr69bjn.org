You know who else can't be persuaded to change their mind? People who are right.

I mean, you're not really arguing with evidence here. hh26 says he doesn't see evidence of there being massive amounts of racism around him; you're answering "Okay, guess it's impossible to convince him then; I'm not going to bother".

You said that you've given up on trying to convince or empathize with red tribers, but I have the feeling you never really tried that hard? As far as I can remember, as far as I've been able to see, your standards have always been "I keep telling them they're wrong and they keep thinking they're right. I'm done trying to dialogue."

  Do you have a way for me to feel better about how many more upvotes he got than me when I believe he is one of the enablers of evil I mentioned?

*STOP THINKING ABOUT POLITICS ALREADY.* Move on to thinking about video games, or your studies/job, or a hobby, or anything else. You're making yourself sick, and you clearly don't have the mindset and the mental baggage to approach these subjects productively, and you know it.

The world isn't going to end in the next five years. The USA aren't going to descend into civil war. I know that you have a very strong sense of the world being about to end and the USA being about to descend into civil war / some sort of slavery empire, but that's just not going to happen. You'll never be able to think about this clearly if you keep killing yourself worrying.
