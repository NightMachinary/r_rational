I agree to an extent: my experience is that convincing a Trump supporter they're wrong is about as likely as convincing a YEC that they are. It's not actually impossible, but the work you have to do in epistemic upgrading is so massive that it's usually not worth the effort.

That said, I don't think [[/u/hh26]] is justifying or supporting fascism in his comment. He may actually support fascist beliefs, I have no idea, but this specific comment doesn't support it: it's just standard apologetics for racism as "rare" that almost everyone on the right engages in. He probably actually really believes that "overt racism = illegal" is the same thing as "racism = not a problem," because by setting legal boundaries it's easy to just lump everyone who sticks a "No Blacks" sign on their shop door as the racists while everyone else gets a free pass.

But jumping from that standard Goodhartian fallacy to accusations of fascism is a bit too far.
