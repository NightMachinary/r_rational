I advice putting up some kind of notification about the rules change, either as a sticky thread (leave it for a week?), or at least as a post in the off-topic thread. Perhaps alter text of the next Monday thread and the current Friday thread to include this information.

  Would anyone be terribly upset if I just ruled that US politics is off-topic for [[/r/rational]] and often unpleasant in these weekly threads?

It's somewhat dubious to ask this regarding a subreddit-level rules change, in a tenth-level post from a two-days-old thread, in a comment chain discussing spiders. The number of people who read it is probably in single digits.

Not that I exactly disagree, and [[/r/rational][r/rational]] doesn't have to be a democracy, just thought I should note that.

*Edit:* On second thoughts, I'm not quite happy about the rule, aesthetically. It's rather arbitrary, to a silly degree: "we're a subreddit for talking about rational fiction, our only rules are, be pleasant, be on-topic, */and don't discuss USA politics/*". One of these things is clearly not like the others.

Also, what if I wrote a brilliant rationalist story involving USA politics? Is it forbidden to discuss it here, should I post it to [[/r/slatestarcodex][r/slatestarcodex]]? What if it's not modern USA politics? I think I recall some story here already touching on the topic; should it be taken down?

Perhaps do put it up for discussion? [[/r/rational][r/rational]] as a collective may come up with a better way of implementing this rule.

*Edit 2:* Oh, wait, [[/u/CouteauBlue][u/CouteauBlue]] just linked to the parent-comment in the off-topic thread. I suppose the number of readers isn't in single-digits anymore.
