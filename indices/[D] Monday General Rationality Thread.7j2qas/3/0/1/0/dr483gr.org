I don't know that the two groups have exactly the same level of danger, but they're on the same order of magnitude. Both groups have an identified villain who they blame for all of societies problems, they hold radical beliefs and believe that it is acceptable to silence any opposition to those beliefs, by violence if necessary. And they actually commit violence against their opponents and random people who have wrong opinions.

I don't believe for a second that many members of antifa, especially ones high in the totem pole, would refrain from gassing republicans, or rich white people, [[https://fellowshipofminds.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/antifa-hate1.jpg][or cops]] if given the opportunity. The only reason they haven't yet is because they're not in power.

Bullshit. Antifa's existance has done far more to radicalize the right than anything the moderates have done. There have always been a minority of isolated racists throughout society, who are for the most part ostracized and discouraged by moderates without the need for idealogical purity tests. But once you given them a common enemy, one who tells them that white people are evil and must be exterminated, they group together and lash out. The left likes to blame Trump for the rise of white nationalism, but if you pay attention to the timelines you'll find that antifa arose first, and then the right rose in response to them, which is why the first several violent protests had antifa protestors alone committing violence, and then later ones had both sides fighting against each other.

We live in a society where the vast majority of people believe that everyone should be treated the same regardless of race, and a minority of people is screaming that race does matter and race A is better than race B or is responsible for race C, as if people are somehow responsible for the actions of other people who have the same skin color and aren't individuals.

I firmly believe that the best solution is for everyone to stop grouping people by race. Treat people as individuals, based on the content of their character, not the color of their skin. Because when you start telling people that their race did this, or did that, that they need to act differently or be treated differently because of their race, that the deeds of ancient people of the same race as them are now their deeds, the worst thing that can happen is they'll believe you. We have never lived in a society where racism was completely extinct, but we sure were a lot closer in the 90s where people tended to just ignored it and treated each other equally than we are today when we have to be all worried about whether people of this "other" group will get offended if we say certain words and aren't respectful enough of their "culture" that we aren't allowed to "appropriate." That just breeds resentment and alienation.
