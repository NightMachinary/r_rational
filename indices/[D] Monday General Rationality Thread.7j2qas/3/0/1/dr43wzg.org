How can I distinguish between people who believe racism is acceptable or that racism isn't a problem when my morality dictates that racism is evil and I know that it is constantly causing harm to so many people? I can persuade neither group to change their mind and they both work together to the effect of tolerating evil.

I believe radicalism caused an unacceptable about of harm no matter the ideology, but less harm is caused by people who choose to do something about racism than people who choose not to. I don't like antifa and I posted here because I'm afraid becoming more like them is dangerous, but they cannot be equated to neo-Nazis.
