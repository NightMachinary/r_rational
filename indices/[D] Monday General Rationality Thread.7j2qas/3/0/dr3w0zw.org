  because that ideology is about empathizing with and helping victims of abuse and discrimination, whereas the opposition are tribalists who want to allow oppression to continue.

This strikes me as wayyyyyy oversimplified and naive. The vast majority of people on both sides are ordinary people trying to do the right thing, but disagree on either the best methods of solving certain issues, or on how reality is. Let me put forth the following groups of people and their beliefs that I believe portray certain types of people:

Type A) Radical leftist:

A1) White people enslaved black people in the past, and that was bad.

A2) White people are currently oppressing black people and causing them to remain poor

A3) White people are inherently evil as a result of their race

A4) White people should give money to black people, or should be segregated in society and given lesser rights to atone for their sin of being born white

Type B) Semi-radical leftist

B1) White people enslaved black people in the past, and that was bad.

B2) Some racist white people are discriminating against black people, combined with past injustices which is causing black people to remain poor

B3) White people are responsible for their actions that have caused black people to be poor, and should make up for it by checking their privilege in debates, never ever do anything culturally insensitive like making racist jokes or saying the N word, and should give precedence to black people via welfare and affirmative action

Type C) Moderate Leftist:

C1) White people enslaved black people in the past, and that was bad.

C2) The cycle of poverty has caused this to continue until the present time, where black people remain poor

C3) Everyone should be treated the same regardless of their race

C3) However, policies should target black people with welfare and affirmative action because this will help them break out of the poverty cycle

Type D) Moderate Rightist

D1) White people enslaved black people in the past, and that was bad.

D2) The cycle of poverty, combined with gang culture and the destruction of the black family unit, has caused black people remain poor.

D3) Everyone should be treated the same, regardless of their race

D4) Therefore, people bear no guilt or association with the actions of other people, living or dead, who share nothing in common other than race.

D5) Therefore, we should not give extra welfare or affirmative action to black people, but instead should make policies that target poor people regardless of race, as this will accomplish the same good in a more fair and equal manner.

Type E) Semi-radical rightist

E1) White people enslaved black people in the past, and that was bad.

E2) This, combined with geneticly smaller intelligence and looser morals, has caused black people to be poor.

E3) Everyone is responsible for their own choices, and the consequences of those choices. Therefore black people should be left to their own devices and if they want to not be poor they can simply work harder to fix it

Type F) Radical rightist:

F1) White people enslaved black people in the past, and that was good.

F2) Black people are inherently inferior to white people

F3) Black people are poor as a result of their own inferiority

F4) Black people should be sent back to Africa, or re-enslaved, or exterminated, so that they stop ruining our society.

Obviously the above are somewhat oversimplified, many people will have more nuanced versions of these beliefs, or have some but not others from various different tiers. But my first main point is that the distribution of people believing these in real life seems to be close to a bell curve. Most people are close to the middle, and a huge part of the issue is that people on one side tend to view things in terms of "right of me" and "left of me". People on the right have difficulty distinguishing between A/B/C, while people on the left have difficulty distinguishing between D/E/F. However by looking at these it is obvious that we have a sort of horseshoe theory happening, where A and F are obvious and dangerous racists, B and E are moderately racist or misguided but have some hope, while C and D both believe in equality but differ slightly in what that means for policy.

The second main point is that many of the beliefs are possible to hold without being a terrible person. We have "moral" beliefs, about whether or not certain things are good or bad, and "territory" beliefs, which describe how someone thinks reality is. Someone who believes "black people are genetically less intelligent than white people" has a territory belief. There is a hypothetical world in which this is a true statement (which might be our own, I don't know enough about genetic influences on intelligence to know either way). This does not necessarily imply that this person thinks they should be treated differently (a moral belief). So even if you do think this belief is incorrect and makes them a racist, they're on an entirely different level than someone who hates black people, and you shouldn't group them together.

I find it incredibly naive to call one group "tribalists" and "radical" but not the other which is performing idealogical purity tests that is scaring away its own members.

Hopefully, at the very least, you can see the concern for radicalization of the left, as well as for the right. Both are dangerous. Even if the two sides are not perfectly symmetric, they're awfully close. All labelling everyone D and right as "nazis" does is dillute the word and makes it harder to recognize the real nazis.
