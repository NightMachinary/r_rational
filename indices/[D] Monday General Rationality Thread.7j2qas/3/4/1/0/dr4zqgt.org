Twenty years ago, there were liberal feminists arguing that it was fine to overlook sexual assault, even rape accusations, for the sake of protecting liberal political interests. The real test of those principles, in this modern panic, will be when a Democratic senator is accused in a state with a Republican governor. Do you really believe that there wouldn't be plenty of Democrats arguing that The Big Picture necessitates overlooking some small, personal evil? Do you really believe that, of the people who gave us "No bad tactics, only bad targets?" There have been a number of instances of social justice progressives rallying to the defense of proven pedophiles (and not 14 year olds, but prepubescent) in the last few years, including a magazine (iirc, Slate) scrubbing their archives of anti-pedo articles and publishing a sympathetic look at the phenomenon.

Betting against "Politics is the mind-killer" is virtually always a losing proposition.
