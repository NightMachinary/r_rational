Free speech laws are about protecting speech that is controversial, offensive or abhorrent. There is no law needed to protect speech that everyone is OK with.

If the law is allowed to silence "irrational hate" speech, the definition of "irrational hate" can later be altered or expanded. Imagine what someone like Trump could do (criticizing the president is now unlawful hate speech).
