I feel like you're missing [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/02/23/in-favor-of-niceness-community-and-civilization/][the point]] of free speech laws.

The gist is: wouldn't someone with different opinions than you apply the exact same arguments you use to, say, silence everyone who advocates atheism in a muslim country, or draw caricatures of religious figures?

"I am not against foreigners or believers of other religions, but I've have zero need to pretend heathens are my equals. Free speech is just fine for people who have something worthwhile or harmless to say. All these people do is turn other people away from God. Why should they be allowed to do that?"

In other words:

  No! I am Exception Nazi! NO EXCEPTION FOR YOU! Civilization didn't conquer the world by forbidding you to murder your enemies unless they are actually unrighteous in which case go ahead and kill them all. Liberals didn't give their lives in the battle against tyranny to end discrimination against all religions except Jansenism because seriously fuck Jansenists. Here we have built our Schelling fence and here we are defending it to the bitter end.
