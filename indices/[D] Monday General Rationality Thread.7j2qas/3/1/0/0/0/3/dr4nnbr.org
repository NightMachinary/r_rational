I will never understand why people worry so much about the free speech "rights" of people who explicitly want to deny that and other rights to groups that are already underprivileged out of nothing but irrational hatred. By the time fascism is defeated, they'll be lucky if public incitement to hatred and violence is the only "right" they're denied.
