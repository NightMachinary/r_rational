Look, I don't have a full answer for you; in part because politic in general is complicated; in part because American politics look absolutely insane from where I'm standing and I've haven't kept up with them nearly enough to make informed judgments.

That said, I think you shouldn't pursue political radicalization, because it's always counter-productive in a non-broken system. The idea is, every time you do X, people will expect you to do X again, which shifts their incentive and behavior. If the agents of "Good" lie, then "Good" may come out of the lie, but it's offset by the fact that people trust them less. If Good [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/05/12/weak-men-are-superweapons/][builds a superweapon]], everyone will tear it down lest it be used against them.

And I'm using "Good", but it's a cheat. In real life, nobody really knows who "Good" is. They just have people they agree with and people they disagree with; no-one likes to see someone they disagree with build a superweapon.

I wish I could add specific examples and political anecdotes to the general principles I'm describing.
