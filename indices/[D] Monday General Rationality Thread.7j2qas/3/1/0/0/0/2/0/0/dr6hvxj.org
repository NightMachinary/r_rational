Impressive. You entirely managed to miss the point, and get defensive. So you /are/ a willfully uninformed voter.

I said it was a litmus test. The point is to apply it to yourself so that you can know for yourself who you are. Can you imagine someone on the internet replying to say that they are, in fact, an uninformed voter who goes along with the party line? I can't either. And any other reply? Like what you just did? It says everything.
