That's almost the definition of a leftist (who is trying to convince himself he's a moderate). Nothing has changed; you've just come out of the closet, so to speak.

Here's a litmus test for you: did you ever find out more about a politician's character before voting for them? Did you ever study local issues before voting at a local level? Or did you occasionally vote for scandal-ridden people because you were too lazy to look beyond the party labels? (And don't bother answering: I won't believe you anyways.)
