It's okay, you made a reasonable assumption of what was an acceptable joke based on the data you had seen. I didn't post about politics here until this year, before which I was a hardcore centrist who voted left but believed radicalism was a problem on both sides and divisiveness was the biggest problem.

Now after spending a full year attempting to make sense of the ideology of my allies and opposition while receiving new information about people's suffering that I had the luxury of not knowing, I can only conclude that evil exists today in far greater amounts and far more sinister forms than I ever thought possible.

I'm terrified that becoming more extreme in my opposition towards the people who cause and enable abuse will result in me enabling abuse of others, so I want my new paradigm to be criticized. I don't yet think free speech rights should be denied to fascists, but every day I see the fascist agenda continue to be promoted I get closer to that path and I'm afraid where it might lead.
