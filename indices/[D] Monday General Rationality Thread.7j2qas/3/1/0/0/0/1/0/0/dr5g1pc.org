Just a few questions .

What is your plan now?

How it helps solve those problems?

Why do you think worth it to risk becoming too radical as you said you feared before?.

Remember that if doing something wont help you should try to do anything else or doing nothing . Actually helping people is more important than how you feel about it, don't do things only because you don't want to feel like you are ignoring the problem.
