I would say that no government whether left or right can be trusted with the ability to censor their opponents without eventually turning to tyranny. I would be right but incitement to hatred laws are surprisingly bipartisan and haven't lead too far down the slippery slope as far as I can tell though they are inching towards further censorship.
