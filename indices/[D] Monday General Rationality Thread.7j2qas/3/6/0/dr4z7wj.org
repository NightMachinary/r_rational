  I underwent the same transformation earlier this year. I no longer think fascists deserve free speech and vastly prefer the way Germany handles them to the way we do in the US. The risks of allowing that ideology even an inch of breathing room are simply too great.

This is functionally an admission that their arguments are stronger than yours. But more pertinently, repression of Nazi speech, alongside street violence against them, was actually an integral part of their rise to power. It gave them an oppressed/victim narrative that grew the movement considerably. As was mentioned elsewhere in this thread, this sort of thing is just going to push them further; it's the exact same logic progressives tout regarding the radicalization of Islam. You're even doing the exact same thing progressives used to decry when Republicans would condemn all Islam. If you're declaring that /all/ Republicans are evil, then you're functionally normalizing their actual extremist element.
