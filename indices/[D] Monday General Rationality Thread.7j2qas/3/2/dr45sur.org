The way Kazerad [[http://kazerad.tumblr.com/post/71725286960/im-trying-to-get-back-into-the-habit-of-actually][put it]]:

#+begin_quote
  I've said things to this effect to people before and gotten replies like “you can't solve problems by being nice”. I should clarify that I'm not advocating the idea that people should be nice and passive and eventually problems will go away. I am advocating the idea of being a manipulative bastard. I am advocating luring people into a sense of security wherein they openly put their most vulnerable thoughts and feelings forward for your perusal and modification. This is traditionally called “being nice and understanding”, and it's how you control people. Or help them, if you're into that sort of thing.

And while Kazerad is being pretty romantic about the whole idea, there's a lot of merit to it. At least anecdotally, I've noticed that I was more convincing to people whose views I strongly disagreed with if I approached them from a position of respect and understanding.

From a consequentialist point of view, it doesn't matter for Jason Pargin's point whether your opposition is "tribalists". If ideological purity leads to more people going to the opposition, then it doesn't matter who the opposition is, it's in your interests to be more open.
