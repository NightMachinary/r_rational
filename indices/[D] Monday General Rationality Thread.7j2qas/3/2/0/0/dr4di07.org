I guess it really depends on who you've been talking to.

You've talked about that before, and the answer has usually been between "Maybe the guys you were talking to were unusually bad jerks" and "Maybe you're not as open-minded and good at showing empathy as you think you are".

I know it hasn't been my experience.
