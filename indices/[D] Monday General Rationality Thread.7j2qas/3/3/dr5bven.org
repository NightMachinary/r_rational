There are a lot of different evils in the world , more than anybody can understand or care about at the same time.People don't automatically agree that something is a problem especially if people in the outgroup are the ones talking about it all the time(or even if someone talks a lot about it), so you can't expect people in other group to be concerned about all the things your group is concerned, you can try to care.

Of course I kind of understand why you would feel angry and start considering more extreme ideas , but in that case the kind of solutions your brain will suggest more easily are the kind of solutions that would work in the ancestral environment , but not now.Most people in the opposition aren't neo-nazis , in fact , a really low amount of people are neo nazis .You cant get the opposition to agree whith you by force , or by being angry at them , again that is the kind of thing that could work in the ancestral environment(by convincing who can be convinced and getting everyone else out of the tribe) , but in big countries it just leads to people being increasingly more divided , radical and eventually violent.

Are you sure that being more radical and equating everyone in the other side of the political spectrum whith the neo-nazis will lead to less racism? .Or are you actually thinking that because you are angry whith them so you want to punish them and then rationalize reasons why doing it is going to help ? .Because I don't see how that will help convince the other side , in fact I see a lot of ways it can lead to things getting worse . You cant subjugate half a country , you can subjugate the evil people whith the help of everyone else , but if you start saying that everyone on the other side is evil , you aren't going to get their help, and they will believe you less when you tell that racism is important ,or that someone is racist or a nazi because they will be angry whith you ,,witch will make you angrier because you think in doing so they are tolerating evil , which will make them more angry , creating a feedback loop of people getting angry at other people and dismissing the other side's opinions. It's really unlikely that in the big mostly arbitrary conglomerations of ideas that is the political spectrum happen to perfectly divide good and bad ideas, or true and false beliefs (which doesn't necessarily mean that both happen to be equally right or wrong but its bad anyway, and everyone things their group is the best ) .

Its not a question of which side is righter , its just that being polite and trying to convince people ,even being manipulative about it is the only option, not only moraly , but practically , if its isn't working for you can only try harder or in a different way . And if you think it's naive to believe that the situation can can be solved that way , then at least things wont go worse by respecting the rights of people ,and you can get more info about their actual views to figure out other ways of solving the issue. Really consider if whatever other idea you have was actually generated by your problem solving ability trying to find how to get people to be less racist or something else.

I say all this because I'm getting the impression that the main change between you a month ago , and you right now , is that you fell more strongly about the issue ,and you tried talking to some people on the other side , but it didn't work and those are reasons for why you are angrier now and therefore more inclined towards being more radical , not reasons why now you are better at deciding which plans will lead to less racism .

And remember , there are a lot of other people suffering in the world for thousands of reasons, and right now you aren't deciding everyone else is evil for not trying to help.
