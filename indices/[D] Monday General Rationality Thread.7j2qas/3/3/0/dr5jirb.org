This is my favorite response. What I've learned from this discussion is that my self righteousness is tied into my self loathing since it is my realizations about how I had enabled evil just by thinking in ways I considered normal that led to me taking a more hardline stance.

That is unlikely to change, I still believe that I am intrinsically privileged in ways I am incapable of understanding due to being a white middle class male and implicit bias is something I must be ever vigilant against, but you managed to remind me that I can't allow that to consume me.

Upon realizing I had impulsively placed less value on people who happened to be outside my social group and not taken notice of their suffering, which vastly exceeded my social group, I committed myself to feeling as much empathy as possible for people I never did. Now I find myself in constant anguish now that I can't ignore their suffering anymore.

I want to prevent as much suffering as I can among people who are powerless to protect themselves, but I don't have the ability to do anything that I wasn't already so I just try and correct people when I think they're thinking in ways that I was before. Since communication is difficult, especially for me, this hasn't gone well.

Having been through many depressive episodes over the past few years, I now believe that the anxiety, self hatred, and mind consuming nihilism I felt then is what people who aren't privileged feel /all the time/ due to the behavior of the privileged. That is something I cannot tolerate and don't know how to deal with the fact that so few other privileged people believe the same.

I'm not going through a depressive episode right now, I've been doing very well over the last year, I just have no idea how to confront suffering that I now see everywhere. I feel the crushing pain of despair eating at me every day and I can't stand seeing other people suffer even that much, but I know they suffer far more due through no fault of their own.
