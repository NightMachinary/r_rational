I just listened to [[https://overcast.fm/+BHdl_96bg][the latest episode of the Cracked podcast]] where Jason “David Wong” Pargin, a former conservative turned ardent leftist and writer who was hugely influential on my development, gave a sound logical explanation of how liberals enforcing ideological purity is pushing people into right-wing circles that become ever more radical.

If I had heard that a month ago I would've thought he'd hit the nail on the head yet again, but now I believe that is naive. I think ideological purity is incredibly important because that ideology is about empathizing with and helping victims of abuse and discrimination, whereas the opposition are tribalists who want to allow oppression to continue.

I feel so strongly about this that I'm worried I've become too radical and will end up worsening the divide in my society, but I can't imagine a way to repair that divide without persuading or subjugating people who enable oppression. I now think that treating people as equals when they think I don't deserve equal rights will just make me another enabler.
