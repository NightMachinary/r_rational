Recent revelations about the prevalence of: sexual abuse and harassment, police brutality against minorities, the belief that it is acceptable to discriminate against Muslims and LGBT people, and the self-sustaining disempowerment of people with low economic status.

I knew these things existed beforehand, but as a cisgender white male I never really understood them and the effect they have on people. Now that I've seen how common they really are and been educated as to how severe an injustice each event is, I refuse to ignore or tolerate them.
