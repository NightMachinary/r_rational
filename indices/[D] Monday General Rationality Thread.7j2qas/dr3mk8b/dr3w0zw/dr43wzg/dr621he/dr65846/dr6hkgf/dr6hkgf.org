  You will never convince me that any human being has any less value than others because of how they were born.
#+end_quote

Nor would I want to. But if you want to believe that anyways, I support your right to do so.

#+begin_quote
  Human suffering is something I will never tolerate or accept
#+end_quote

You don't have to accept it, but you'd better learn to tolerate it, because it is a fact of life. Possibly an intrinsic fact.

#+begin_quote
  I don't care what you believe
#+end_quote

You sure seem to care a lot about what people believe. Wasn't that the whole point of the "ideological conformity" bit? I don't much want thought police of your sort around. Your views don't help society at all. /And/ I think you're a terrible person.
