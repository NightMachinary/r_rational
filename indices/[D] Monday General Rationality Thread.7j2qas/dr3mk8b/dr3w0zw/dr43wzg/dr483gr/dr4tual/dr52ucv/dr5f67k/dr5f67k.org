My first reaction reading this was , thinking of course your observations are a extremely biased sample and you cant use them to measure how munch racism there is.But i guess ,it is evidence against a world where 50% of people are racist . I don't thing is actually a noticeable amount of evidence of rarity, even in a world where a lot of black people experience racism expect to find a lot of people that haven't ever seen it , like there are a lot of problems that i haven ever seen (or at least noticed) on my life but that I have reliable statistics on(and is not like all problems are equally polarized in all countries so you can get data on those , and statistics are are manipulable, but not so manipulable you can get 0 information from them) .[[http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/10/02/different-worlds/]] anecdotal data on why anecdotal data is not a lot of evidence.

I'm not saying that I know how munch racism there is , but I wouldn't bet on it either way based only on anecdotical data.
