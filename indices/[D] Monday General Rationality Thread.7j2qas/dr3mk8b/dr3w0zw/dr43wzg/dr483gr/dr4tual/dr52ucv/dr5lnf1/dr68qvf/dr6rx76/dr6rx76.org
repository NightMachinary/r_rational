  If you think public approval of Fox News and Breitbart constitute hate speech and shouldn't be allowed on [[/r/rational][r/rational]], that's fine.

I don't, actually.

  But if it isn't at least a semi-official rule, then you have no ground to stand on. The general, implied rules are "be kind, don't be insulting, don't be disruptive", and by those rules [[/u/hh26][u/hh26]] [-2] has done nothing wrong.

Quite true. However, I've had a lot of experience needing to mod around thinly-veneered political shitposting before, and I wanted to make sure things were clear this time.

  I'm not fine with this; using your moderator color and saying "I'm going to look through your previous posts" is a very clear threat. You're implicitly using your moderator powers to say "Things that go too hard against my political views aren't welcome in this community", and I as far as I'm concerned as a member, this is not okay at all.

No, I'm saying that /raiding this subreddit/ is not ok. So far, he's not a raider, so he doesn't get a warning, let alone a penalty. He's done nothing wrong. But since he's an active participant in a shitposting sub that regularly raids other subs, yes, I want to keep an eye for raiding with shitposts.

As [[/u/PeridexisErrant]] proposed, a blanket ban on partisan politics sounds like a good way, in my eyes, to handle the problem of partisan shitposting. I'd like an exception carved out for personal experiences, such as for instance, "Well, they're instituting rent control/raising my taxes/whatever", but other than that, the easiest way to prevent raiding is to blanket-ban things that look like raiding. That's also very, very broad, and arguably clamps down on people's ability to talk about what they like, but oh fucking well, Reddit's structure makes it too easy to flood any sub you please with low-quality content.
