I've said this before, I am really, really not okay with you putting on your mod hat in these situations.

If you think public approval of Fox News and Breitbart constitute hate speech and shouldn't be allowed on [[/r/rational][r/rational]], that's fine. Make it a rule. If you think people with a posting history on [[/r/The_Donald/][r/The_Donald/]] aren't welcome here or should tread carefully, fine, make it a subreddit rule and put it in the sidebar.

But if it isn't at least a semi-official rule, then you have no ground to stand on. The general, implied rules are "be kind, don't be insulting, don't be disruptive", and by those rules [[/u/hh26][u/hh26]] has done nothing wrong. The part you quoted did nothing more than express an opinion (in a subdued and non violence-encourage-y way).

I'm not fine with this; using your moderator color and saying "I'm going to look through your previous posts" is a very clear threat. You're implicitly using your moderator powers to say "Things that go too hard against my political views aren't welcome in this community", and I as far as I'm concerned as a member, /this is not okay at all/.

Paging [[/u/alexanderwales][u/alexanderwales]] and [[/u/PeridexisErrant][u/PeridexisErrant]] for feedback.
