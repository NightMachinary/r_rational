I wouldn't bet on it based on anectodat data alone, but what we have are multiple interpretations of causes given the same statistical date, or multiple statistical studies that don't quite agree on all of the details. So we might hear group 1 is saying "here are statistics that show black people are poorer on average than white people. The obvious interpretation is that this is caused by widespread discrimination" group 2 says "here are statistics that show black people are poorer on average than white people. The obvious interpretation is that this is caused by black people being less intelligent than whites" and group 3 says "here are statistics that show black people are poorer on average than white people. The obvious interpretation is that this is caused by the breakdown of the black family unit and lack of good father figures for youth"

Then I can use my anecdotal experiences as evidence that allows me to weigh how trustworthy these interpretations are of the exact same data. I don't see widespread discrimination, I see social censure of people who act racist openly, I am aware of explicit laws against it in pretty much any institutional form. It's possible for it to exist AND be hidden, but the more ands you have to add to a theory the more conspiracy-like it becomes and the less likely it is to be true. So I find group A to be less credible than I would if I did encounter racism.

The black people I interact with tend to be about the same intelligence as the white people I interact with, although that's much more likely to have sampling biases since most of the individuals I interact with are college students. But nevertheless, I find group B to be less credible than I would if I encountered a noticeable difference between black and white people.

I very rarely encounter people who have grown up without a father figure AND tell me this, so I have pretty much no anecdotal evidence for or against group C. However I have encountered studies in the past that show the influence of good role models and father figures especially for young boys and how it influences crime rate, and nobody seemed to be disputing them at the time when they weren't being used in a political issue, so I find it consistent with previous data and so find group C to be slightly more credible than I would apriori.

I'm not using my experiences to create new theories, I'm using them to guide my common sense in trusting other peoples' theories. They have a lot more data points, but they can't all be true because they're contradicting each other, and they have a lot more hidden motivations which makes the data less trustworthy to me than my own experiences, so each one of my data points is more valuable than several of theirs.
