I looked through this guy's comment history and found out they're a member of [[/r/The_Donald][r/The_Donald]]. This explains to me why they have said things that I believe have no basis in reality and provides further confirmation that rhetoric like this exists to promote fascism.

Do you have a way for me to feel better about how many more upvotes he got than me when I believe he is one of the enablers of evil I mentioned? [[/u/CouteauBleu][u/CouteauBleu]], [[/u/eaturbrainz][u/eaturbrainz]], and [[/u/DayStarEld][u/DayStarEld]] can attest to my experiences with Trump supporters that have led me to view them as an existential threat to rationality.
