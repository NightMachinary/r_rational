A major theory you're not mentioning is "Blacks are poorer than Whites because Whites have a head start and we should correct that".

  I am aware of explicit laws against it in pretty much any institutional form. It's possible for it to exist AND be hidden, but the more ands you have to add to a theory the more conspiracy-like it becomes and the less likely it is to be true. So I find group A to be less credible than I would if I did encounter racism.

"People aren't allowed to do racist things" isn't the same as "People aren't racists" or "People don't do racists things when the law isn't looking".

I mean, overall, I get your point, and I really feel the same on a level; but I think "hiding" racism is way easier than you think (which is why I think censorship is super counter-productive), and there are communities where overt racism is more frequent that you're used to.
