Fox news and Breitbart aren't committing violence, and as far as I can see, are not encouraging segregation, racism, or violence against other races, are not shutting down speeches by sem-radical leftists. I am vastly less concerned about them than a media which is doing these things to the right, gives interviews to and takes antifa seriously, of universities which support things like a "white-free" day, of vast swathes of protestors who shut down semi-radical, nonviolent rightists.

I don't know what reality you live in, where there is so much racism everywhere that a color-blind, individualist approach to life is more damaging than a collectivist, all-controlling idealogy that wants to label everybody according to their skin color. I don't see the people around me oppressing each other by their race. I don't see 50% of the population around me openly admitting that racism is good (and if there were actually that many racists, they would not need to keep it a secret). I don't see 50% of the people around me thinking that Hitler had the right idea. I don't see ANYONE doing these things, so if these things are still a problem at all, which they probably are, they're pretty rare, and occur as individual decisions, not as cultural occurences.

Most issues are not racial issues. Most problems faced by minorities are not racial problems, and are not caused by racism. That's illegal, it's been illegal for decades. It's not that they don't have problems, it's that these are class problems, and the only genuine solution to them must be class-based policies.

I don't know that we can actually come to any agreements if we can't agree on what's real. I definitely think that the problem is that you're not giving enough weight to your own observations because you consider them to be "anecdotes". In theory, statistics would be more reliable, but they're so easy to manipulate that both sides have loads of unreliable statistics that can't be trusted. I'm guessing that the vast majority of your evidence of this rampant racism in society is from the media and internet, not from real life. Go out and look, re-examining your memories and experiences. How many racists have you met or encountered? How many acts of racism, bullying, or discrimination have you encountered, and how many have been against each race (including whites)? Now if you're white, then to some degree it's difficult to distinguish between the theory that "discrimination doesn't occur often" or "discrimination only occurs to minorities when I can't see it", but at the very least the absence of evidence is strong evidence in favor of absence. Or rarity. I'm not claiming that racism doesn't exist, but if it's so rare that I cannot remember witnessing a single instance in my life, then it's either rare period, or they are incredibly good at hiding it from the general public. Treat every source as questionable, look at reality, and then figure out whose theory best fits your observations.
