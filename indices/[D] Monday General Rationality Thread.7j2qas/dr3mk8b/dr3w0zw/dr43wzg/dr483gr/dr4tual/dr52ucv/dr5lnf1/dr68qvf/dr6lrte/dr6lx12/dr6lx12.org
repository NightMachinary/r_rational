Speaking as an Australian, the constant presence of US politics and partisanship on both sides is kinda ridiculous - I can see where all of you are coming from, and at this point it's more about different assumptions about facts than different moral intuitions.

Would anyone be terribly upset if I just ruled that US politics is off-topic for [[/r/rational]] and often unpleasant in these weekly threads? They seem to shed more heat than light, and I'm inclined to keep us focused on less divisive conversation.
