I don't understand your logic. Anecdotes about crazy and stupid liberals have been used as propaganda by the right at least since the Clinton administration. How is antifa to blame for Fox News and Breitbart stories about them when those outlets clearly don't care how much basis their stories have in reality?

You called what I said BS, but I think your description of the history of racism and the solution to it is BS. I used to think the same way as you, but now I believe that was a naive view born of privilege that enabled racism within others and myself. Now what do we do if we can't agree on what's real?
