It doesn't matter what it means to you, because you're not communicating in a vacuum. Unless you're just posting to feel smug, you need to get a point across, and using a label differently than the way most people use it (and on a touchy subject) gets in the way of communicating your point.

If you want to be understood by people, then you need to understand what words and concepts mean to them, not just your own custom version.
