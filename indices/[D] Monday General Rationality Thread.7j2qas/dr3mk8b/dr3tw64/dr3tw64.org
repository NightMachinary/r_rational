I underwent the same transformation earlier this year. I no longer think fascists deserve free speech and vastly prefer the way Germany handles them to the way we do in the US. The risks of allowing that ideology even an inch of breathing room are simply too great. In addition, I've come to the conclusion that the only word which adequately describes the Republican Party as an organization is Evil, and given the magnitude of what they have done to the world at large I'm not sure if even that is enough.

That said, those are just facts about me. The best way forward right now is not righteous face-punching, but bringing enough people on board our causes to step us back from the point where violent revolution will become necessary. Fixing everything at once isn't in the cards, we just need to halt the progression.

Despite the obvious corruption of our government at every level, I do still have some hope on that front. Mueller's investigation is advancing at a frankly shocking pace by comparison to the Watergate investigation, and given the number of people very close to the President he already has in his sights publically, I wouldn't be surprised if he presented damning evidence in time to affect the 2018 elections. That will do nothing to change the minds of the 35% of this country who are unabashedly evil, but it will affect everyone else. Remember, Trump did not get a majority of votes last time, and this time we have the entire country enraged.

Even if you believe the Democratic party is also somewhat corrupt, they have every political reason to impeach the President if they manage to retake Congress. Even if they don't, making him a lame duck will stem the bleeding, and two more years of random flailing will do nothing to help the Republicans' chances.

These monsters were elected in large part because they made promises they could not keep to the people of the American Midwest, and that is something they cannot cover with propaganda. Jobs simply are not returning to the coal towns which voted them in, they have utterly failed to do anything with healthcare, and their tax bill is easy to campaign against with the line "Your tax break ends in ten years. His doesn't." Hell, their laughable attempts at a "Muslim Ban" have even shown they can't get appeasing the KKK right. These are people we can get into the fold with the right kind of populism.

We can still fix this.
