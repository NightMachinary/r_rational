I don't think it's an admission their arguments are strong at all. Their arguments are 100% based on lies! However, the ideas of fascists have proven to be pernicious and self-sustaining, and given the damage they do to society just by existing that is not acceptable. Censoring them just enough that their choices are go to prison or look utterly ridiculous (as has been done in Germany, where they are forced to wave Confederate flags because all of their other possible symbols are banned), limits the amount of damage they can do by making them look far less appealing to the kinds of people it is easiest for them to recruit.
