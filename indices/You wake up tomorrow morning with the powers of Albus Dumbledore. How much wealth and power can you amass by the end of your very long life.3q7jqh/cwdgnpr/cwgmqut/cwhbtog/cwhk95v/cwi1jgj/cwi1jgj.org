I agree with you its possible HP canon is a world where actually thermodynamics is followed. It's just so much more parsimonious to assume that what we see in canon is actually what's happening.

I can't prove HP magic overcomes entropy-- I can say pretty categorically that the magic in Harry Potter gives every appearance of disregarding physics as we know it entirely.

Why should we posit complicated hypotheses to explain the apparent violation of thermodynamics in canon as really just an elaborate technology when we can go with the perfectly reasonable explanation of "Physics as we know it in our universe is subordinate to magic in HP's universe. "

Well HPMOR suffers from the flaw that it makes Harry the only real scientist in Harry Potter world, which doesn't gel with canon. In-canon, there is an active academic community making advances in magic-- there's at least one magical scholarly journal we know of, "Transfiguration Today", that presumably is constantly advancing the field.

So I'm not sure why you're bringing it up as if it proves anything. In canon, Harry isn't interested in the academic side of magic-- so we don't see it. We do see obvious hints of a world where magic is constantly being advanced, hinting at some sort of scientific community.
