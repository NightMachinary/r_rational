  there's no evidence for that in canon, its never mentioned.

That doesn't mean that the energy comes from nowhere. To say you've "solved" heat death, you would have to /prove that in-universe./ It doesn't even matter what canon says, because you don't know that J.K. Rowling's stories are the consistent canon that perfectly describes this hypothetical world. J.K. Rowling's stories are neither obviously consistent nor perfectly precise as descriptions of a world. The point of HPMOR is that you have to do science to magic because /what is real is not always apparent./

Relying on appearance and intuition to say things like "objects move on their own," "the only cost of magic is concentration," "Reparo reverses object-local time," "this fire burns forever, even though we have not tested that assertion and /can't/," "mass-energy is not universally conserved when transfiguring, conjuring, vanishing, replicating, shrinking, growing, etc.": /all/ of these hypotheses are entirely reliant on that which is /apparent/ being the /only/ fact of the matter.

The observations you're claiming as evidence are still consistent with a world where conservation of mass-energy and the second law of thermodynamics hold true, and there's no evidence for those principles being /violated/ in canon. You /cannot say/ that magic simply "fixes entropy" in the space of canon-consistent worlds. You can already disregard entropy as a problem without resorting to rejecting it without justification.
