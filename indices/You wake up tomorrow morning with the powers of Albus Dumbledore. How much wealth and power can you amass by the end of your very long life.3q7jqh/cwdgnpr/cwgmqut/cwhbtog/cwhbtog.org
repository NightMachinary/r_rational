Given the hilarious abilities of HP magic, even just as used in canon, as well as JK. Rowling's statements on the nature of magic (she said it is superior over mundane nature), I'm pretty confident that with HP magic and Albus's abilities, entropy and heat death will be a thing of the past.

Quick summary of everything in canon that shits all over thermodynamics:

1. The fact that magic is effortless and doesn't drain the caster in any way means that ignoring the mental fatigue that comes with concentration, magic is unlimited in how often it can be cast. Basically you don't 'run out of magic' in canon.

2. Every instance of transfiguration or conjuration, though given that conjuration is not permanent, and transfiguration is permanent, the former is more relevant.

3. Every instance of charms that make objects move on their own.

4. Reparo Charm

5. The Geminio charm as used on Hufflepuff's Cup in Bellatrix's vault makes copies of objects, though they may dissapear in some way eventually.

6. The fact that magic allows easy shrinking and enlarging of objects (AKA destorying and creating mass)

7. The many possible sources of limitless free energy in canon-- Gubraithian flames, Levitation charms, conjuring gasoline for engines, Incendio to create fire, charms to make objects move on their own, charms to create light for plants to grow from and then be burned for fuel, etc.

8. Unbreakable Charm, which can increase the strength of materials to an unknown degree-- presumably to 'unbreakable by mundane methods' levels, but we don't see these much in canon, so we don't really know.

If your argument is that the energy for magic may be coming from somewhere else-- there's no evidence for that in canon, its never mentioned.
