Unless it's basically like making a wish (supply a more or less well-formed thought, no effort to cast, no effort to maintain, no time limit), such AoE spells still sound like a way too much work to develop, set up, cast and maintain. Not to mention that you'll condemn yourself to a lifetime of fighting against humanity's inherent stupidity, and let's be honest here, if you're doing it you've already lost.

I guess you /could/ cheat and continually tweak the global population's minds, with whatever self-sustaining method you can think of, but frankly I'd like to think that even with near-omnipotence I'd still retain some measure of moral integrity. As my current position is that my self is defined by my thinking patterns fed by my memories, the very concept of manipulating people's minds in the shadows is abhorrent.

So to summarize, I'd be too lazy to set up such a worldwide affront to my sensibilities.

(Sometimes I wonder what I would do in a supervillain's shoes, and then I realize that I'd probably stay at home with a good book, and the story would be over in two pages)
