Force cooperation in a game-theoric sense on the world scale. Eliminate sectarian conflict, invest in infrastructure, food production and distribution, basic standard of living for all humans. Eliminate major negative influences such as organized crime, terror groups, or drug cartels, eliminate partisan political whining.

Find some way to increase intelligence. If Wit-Sharpening Potion or Felix Felicis actually works, make a ton of it, distribute to researchers. Force lawmakers to indicate monthly under Veritaserum that they are operating without improper external influence, bribes, or under duress. Failure to do so will result in temporary and then permanent removal of office.

Randomly check those who pass with Legilimency, just in case.

Design new spells: fixed Tranfiguration for example to permanently and safely transform cotton into carbon nanotubes, like the spells to turn glass into steel.

Design a magical item which uses Aguamenti as a combination infinite clean water source/perpetual motion machine by running conjured water over a hydroelectric generator.

Then play it by ear. Hell, if I have Dumbledore's powers, I have Fawkes too. Cure as many incurable patients as possible, triageing for those with useful skills or potential who would otherwise be lost.
