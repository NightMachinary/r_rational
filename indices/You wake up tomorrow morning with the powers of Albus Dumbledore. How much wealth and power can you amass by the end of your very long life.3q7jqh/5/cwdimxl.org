Assuming this is canon Dumbledore.

Step 1. Amass a moderately large amount of wealth via conventional means (transfigure or Geminio rare materials, use Reparo to mend expensive machines, use the luck potion for anything money related, generate energy in any of a bajillion ways, such as through the use of reducio and engorgio, heal otherwise incurable injuries or diseases, scry for lost treasure or mineral deposits or whatever, become a celebrity).

Step 2. Bribe Rowling to change canon to include an "infinite wealth" spell.
