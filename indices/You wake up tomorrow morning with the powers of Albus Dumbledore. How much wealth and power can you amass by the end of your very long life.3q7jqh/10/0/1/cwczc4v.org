Well, for the first one, a Portkey.

Stopping climate change is, again, dependent upon finding the right spell, but I imagine that there are other spells out there which are "magic amplification" spells, or at least something which would allow me to industrialize a process to stop climate change. After that, it's just the act of applying it safely.

As for magical computing, I'm the only one with magic /in the entire world./ I don't know how it works; nobody does. I imagine I would have to make a base magical language, then a debugger/compiler, then a "Hello World" just to be sure, /then/ we would all have to take several months with the best of the world's AI programmers to create a functional FAI, and at this point I would basically be treated as a magical version of VS or Eclipse, since I'm the only way to communicate with (and program in) the language (By the way, this is assuming there's no /Creatus FriendlyAIus/ spell which lets you modify it). As for mind uploading, it's more or less the same issues.
