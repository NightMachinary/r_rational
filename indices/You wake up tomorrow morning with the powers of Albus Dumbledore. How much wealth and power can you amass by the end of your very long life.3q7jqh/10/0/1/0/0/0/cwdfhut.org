Mine is several decades. You're overestimating magic- in potency, flexibility or simplicity, i'm not sure which. As you only have one person who can perform the experiments, or use it, and no one has accidentaly built a growing inteligence in canon or hpmor, it's not easy. I mean, I'd think a dark wizard wouldn't hesitate to use inteligence boosting spells, or duplicate themselves into a portrait or something similar. despite the number of mind-uploads (pictures are sentient in canon, if incapable of proper memory.), there are no above-human AI in canon. It might work anyways, but i think it'd be at least measured in units of years not months.
