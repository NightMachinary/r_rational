1. Make a wand with some old tree's wood and the only magical material I have access to-- my own blood, hair, etc.

It probably won't work too well, but I'm Dumbledore, so it should be more than enough for my goals.

1. Make a Horcrux (only one, so I don't get too ugly) with the death of a vile criminal. My life is vastly more important than some evil criminal's since I can fix the world's problems. Protect the Horcrux with every protection I can give it, and hide it somewhere safe.

2. Reveal myself publicly and show my abilities.

3. Use Gubraithian fire (canon charm that makes fire brun eternally, mentioned in Order of the Phoenix) to make power plants that run forever with no inputs of energy. I have now beaten entropy and heat death.

4. Funnel proceeds of the clean energy plants to foundations designed to solve the world's most pressing problems.

5. Control, through the Imperius Curse, every halfway unstable country in the world. Gradually dismantle North Korea, Iran, radical Islamist terror factions, etc.

With unlimited clean energy I'm basically as wealthy as I want to be, even without any transfiguration to make any expensive material (except Gold or food) I want, charms to increase the amount of something that I have, and charms to make materials very strong (the Unbreakable Charm has unknown limitations but presumably could make stuff like the space elevator possible without exotic materials). Those are just cherries on the top.

Basically leverage my massive economic and political power to make the world a better place.
