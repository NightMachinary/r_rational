  Why should we posit complicated hypotheses to explain the apparent violation of thermodynamics in canon as really just an elaborate technology when we can go with the perfectly reasonable explanation of "Physics as we know it in our universe is subordinate to magic in HP's universe. "

By what metric are you comparing them? I guarantee you it isn't math. Saying that physics is subordinate is faux simplicity; you're using associative intuition to hide the actual complexity of the hypothesis. We have two very elegant descriptions of reality in comparison, and many hypotheses that are well-supported even outside those theories, like the second law of thermodynamics and conservation of mass-energy. A world of magic does not "supersede" some "natural order," because a world of magic has magic written /into its physics./ Magic is /natural./ The unifying theory has to account for magic, and it has to account for the petabytes of physical data we've gathered.

/Apparent/ deviations from things like the second law of thermodynamics have to be explained, because without magic (and there's no way to know if the observations were actually performed /without/ magic without /developing a theory of magic!/), we have observed massive amounts of evidence for a specific set of world-states, and somehow no data for this massive expansion of configuration space, and it is very important that we /ascertain/ that magic "reverses entropy," or whatever crap you're assuming in your OP. You cannot simply say that magic disregards all of that data; you have to /verify it./ Even if you as a worldbuilder wave your wand of Authorial Fiat over the setting, you as a /character/ do not know it to be a fact, even if you assume it in the unjustified way you're claiming is justified.

  What we see in canon is actually what's happening.

Tautologically. That doesn't mean that all that is happening is seen.

And if you're bringing up academia in Harry Potter, might I point out that you can't actually conjure permanent objects or transfigure food? There is evidence in canon for magic's non-world-breaking properties!
